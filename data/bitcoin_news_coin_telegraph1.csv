0,"It’s all about the economy, cryptocurrencies, art and future projections. To talk about all this, Cointelegraph en Español reached out to artist Alberto Echegaray, the director of Trustlink and former representative of Argentina in the Financial Action Task Force.Cointelegraph: Let’s start off by talking about your artwork, the Moneyball.Alberto Echegaray: Moneyball began developing in 2012. It is a piece that touches on something that is taboo in art: money. And it is still taboo, although it is something that is changing now with NFTs.What Moneyball wants to show is how most, or basically all, fiat currencies have no backing in the world right now. And how many governments take advantage of issuing these currencies to generate inflation, which is basically a tax — a phantom that takes away people's purchasing power.With this concept, I started to work on Moneyball with dollars. I lived in Washington, DC for about 12 years — I did some consulting for the Fed. That's how I came to the Fed, I was invited to tour the facilities of a division where they print dollars.At that time, they were replacing old dollars with the new dollars that are in circulation now. In one part, I found a huge warehouse with billions of dollars destroyed. That's when I thought, This is incredible. You couldn't take pictures — there were a lot of security measures. I asked for the destroyed money, but I was told that the money is state property, it's not our property. And even if it's destroyed, it's still federal property.I had to write a series of letters, and after several months, they gave me two million dollars in 100-dollar bills, destroyed. And so I began to create the artwork.CT: And how did you come up with the idea of adding Bitcoin to your work?AE: At the end of 2013, a Venezuelan in San Francisco told me about BTC and gave me some, which I still have. I didn't pay much attention to it until 2015 or 2016.I talked to several people in Silicon Valley, and they were telling me that it was going to be part of the future, especially blockchain. I started buying Bitcoin and really getting into it. Then I opened a fund and became a crypto missionary.But in 2016, I was contacted by a person who became part of the Argentine government and needed some help with technology to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. It was Mariano Federici, head of the Financial Investigations Unit. The FIU had practically nothing to fight against money laundering with Bitcoin and crypto. It was a mess. I was asked to help, and it was an interesting challenge. More advanced systems of analysis, data and information were installed.But I was not interested in the prosecution part of the crime; I was much more interested in the technical and crypto part. At that time, Europol held a meeting where security specialists met on the subject of crypto and cybercrime. I was new, but I was invited by the Argentine government. Then, I was invited again to the FATF, and there I met some people — specifically from the U.S., China, Russia, South Africa and Australia — who knew something about crypto. They were a very strong team. And I started to see how regulations were going to developCT: Did you want to do more and see the other side behind the curtain?AE: That was in 2016/2017. But before I joined FATF in the Argentina chair, I had four years of experience working in Paris on regulatory issues. I had started to develop, in parallel, a private note off-market, and it was the first synthetic with the underlying asset being Bitcoin.And there, I was able to structure a financial product that you could invest from a bank account. It was super successful, until the banks told me that they could not accept money because it involved BTC.I started thinking about Cryptoball. If I had gone through fiat money, showing it to be worthless, I said I'm going to try it with crypto. I started developing the Cryptoball, but in 2017/2018, it was hard to get curved displays that would show the price of BTC. I had to contact a person in China who gave me access to flexible screens.Cryptoball is a sphere with two flexible screens connected to software in a processor. The processor shows the real-time value of BTC that is held in a hardware wallet within the piece. It shows the price in yen, euros and dollars. By that time, I got 250 BTC, and I placed them in the Ledger wallet.That's when a European collector who I didn't know approached me. He offered to meet me at a restaurant the next day. It was very interesting because then they contacted me on his behalf and talked about “His Royal Highness.”He turned out to be a prince who is very supportive of the culture. We sat down and talked about the artwork. I couldn't believe it because the Venice Biennale is not a place where you sell.The Biennale ended, and I took the artwork to his house, a place in Switzerland. It's a very interesting story.CT: The art and crypto worlds are getting along very well. What do you think about NFTs? Do you have plans to work with this technology?AE: I am starting the process of tokenizing some works. I'm thinking about tokenizing the sphere, but I want it to be something interesting. Not just a 3D design of artwork or a sculpture but, for example, a kind of live ticker that shows the price. Something that exists in real life, that exists in parallel in different dimensions.I'm also working on 3D mapping and augmenting reality with a group of people. I was also invited to be an adviser on an NFT platform that has established artists.I think we are at the beginning of tokenization and a lot of interesting things that can spread the art. By this, I mean that before, it was very difficult for artists who graduated from art schools to access galleries. This is changing dramatically. Now, art school graduates who have chosen to dedicate themselves to digital or virtual art are getting job offers, as is happening in the gaming sector, for example.This is added to all the mass consumer brands that are getting into the virtual world. It's amazing what's coming.CT: Regarding the future of private banking, do you think that banks are going to work with crypto or against crypto?AE: All the big banks already have large crypto research divisions. They know that this is a new system within the financial system. It's like when we talk about landline phones and cell phones — they are going to end up cannibalizing everything.But they are still clinging to their transfer systems and their ways of charging commissions and making money, and they haven't realized that this has changed dramatically.The same goes for regulators. There are not enough human resources to ask who understands both worlds. And there is no capacity, brainpower and determination. They think it is still a long way away.CT: What do you think the state of the global monetary system will be like in 2030?AE: I think there will be huge opportunities for the new generations. It's a parallel system of governments, which is based on the speed of technology. I think in 2030, there will be a society that is more integrated on the one hand, but more discriminatory on the other. They are going to be very powerful groups.What we are seeing with crypto is basically a revolution of assets or private currencies like we have never seen before. In the case of crypto, I clearly see private systems, linked to private space systems, which may or may not be open source. I see banks in this space, much more evolved digital assets, and the tokenization of commodities happening in the future.Traders do not want to lose control of all this. That's kind of the projection I see. I think there will be a new system that is neither capitalist nor socialist."
1,"This year marks the 30th anniversary of the first web page on the World Wide Web, which means a person has to be nearly half a century old to clearly remember the patchwork progress, the false starts and stops, and the trial and error that eventually gave us what is now the defining foundation of 21st-century life. We take the internet for granted in 2021, but it took us decades to get to this point. Throughout the years, the barriers toward adoption tumbled away, and there were clear signs that this new technology would fundamentally change the way the world lives and works.Now, soaring Bitcoin (BTC), the blockbuster initial public offering of Coinbase and the appointment of MIT blockchain professor Gary Gensler to lead the United States Securities and Exchange Commission are offering clear signs that another technology will be transformational on a similar scale: cryptocurrency.Do these recent developments mean crypto is approaching its “Netscape moment?”In the early ‘90s, the internet was about connecting through a phone modem to three major services — AOL, CompuServe and Prodigy — all of which made up what we called the “World Wide Wait,” which illustrates the headache that was caused by loading those rudimentary pages. For those of us old enough to participate in these earliest days of the transition, all the way to a consumer internet, we remember well that moment when everything changed.It was August 1995, when Netscape went public with its main product Navigator, the first browser that allowed anyone to surf the net without having to pay for “World Wide Wait’s” services. This was the moment internet adoption went mainstream, and it created a frenzy that lasted until the dot-com burst in April 2000, establishing the investor and consumer template for thinking about the internet and the World Wide Web.Related: Blockchain Is Evolving Like the Internet: Who Will Be the Crypto Hotmail?It is difficult to see tomorrow’s certainty, or at least the narrative of tomorrow that is described by today, when you are preoccupied with the uncertainty of the present. Perhaps there is no endgame in technology as a whole, making it as mysterious and tantalizing as the world of crypto.However, it is hard not to see the parallels between the current state of crypto adoption and the internet as it existed in 1995. Despite the many news cycles obsessed with booms and busts in pricing, in terms of true financial and technological use, crypto still remains the playground of early adopters and geeks. Many institutions and professional investors are interested in playing around with it, but the vast majority of major institutional finance has yet to engage with it in any serious way.Related: Institutional investors won’t take Bitcoin mainstream — You willI believe 2021 will be the year when all of this changes. The global COVID-19 pandemic has led to massive fiat money-printing everywhere in the world. The cryptocurrency market stands at around a $2 trillion market capitalization, and Bitcoin is in the news daily, arguably with more regularity and over a longer period of time than it enjoyed during the boom of 2017–2018.This new hype cycle comes with the gradual increase of general crypto awareness that has been on the rise since 2017–2018, and professional investors and institutions are even more keen to dip their toes into the water of crypto, even if that only means developing a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.Crypto seems like it should be inevitable — id est, vires in numeris. The mathematical school of Thales and Satoshi Nakamoto should also keep that old phrase from the empiricist Immanuel Kant in mind: “Out of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made.” We cannot overlay the timeline of the internet onto crypto and say, “Aha! This is when it will happen.” Some timescales of adoption and development may continue to accelerate, while others stall behind.External events may also intervene, such as a pandemic. Initially thought to be an event that may halt crypto markets and innovation, due to the initial financial panic and need to liquidate, the price of the flagship Bitcoin has increased tenfold in the first year of the pandemic. Governments put themselves at monetary hazard with debt spending, and people dug deeper into the online world than they did before, adhering to the cryptocurrencies that define so much online life and discussion.Related: How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the crypto space? Experts answerOne thing that is certain is that for crypto to enjoy that “Netscape moment,” especially in the Western world, it will need advocacy and cooperation from the U.S. government. The Netscape moment will happen when the U.S. government, particularly the SEC, comes out with clear regulations about fundraising, custodianship, “Know Your Customer” guidelines, taxes, investment and transfer rules. Even better would be the SEC declaring that crypto is not a security but a whole new asset class with its own set of rules.Related: The US has already lost the 2020 crypto regulation race to EuropeGensler, recently appointed to lead the SEC, has made it clear that he sees the potential and the value in new digital currencies. Recently, he announced that there will be negotiations of some unambiguous regulation for the space that could open the floodgates to billions of dollars in institutional capital. This would be a tremendous development that could stabilize initial public offerings’ day-one pops and swinging Bitcoin prices.Related: Crypto-friendly faces poised for positions in Biden administrationThe U.S. became the leader in the internet movement because, in our wisdom, we allowed e-commerce companies to grow without the burden of sales taxes in state and municipal jurisdictions. This allowed the growth of the industry to the behemoth it is today. Though Al Gore might forever rue the day he ever claimed credit for the U.S. government’s efforts to facilitate national networks and technologies through the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991, the fact is that the U.S. government’s pro-internet policies did help the internet grow as quickly as it did. Marc Andreesen, who created that “Netscape moment” and can claim at least a partial share in helping invent the internet as we know it, has said as much.Today, the U.S. government finds itself at a similar crossroads. Countries including Switzerland, Singapore, Malta, Panama and other free market-oriented economies have already seen the light, and it’s our collective hope that the powers are willing to see the wisdom in allowing the cryptocurrency industry to thrive. Investor-friendly rules in the U.S. will allow the U.S. to keep its leadership in innovation and technology (please take note, Gensler).If the U.S. wants to repeat the history of the last 25 years, a history that has seen America reign supreme as the global leader of technology innovation, then it must repeat the ways of its early pro-internet policies, paving the way for the new crypto technology that will break through in the same way as Netscape.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2,"Bitcoin (BTC) price continues to limp lower as traders in the U.S. hit the BBQ to enjoy the upcoming Memorial Day holiday on May 31 and regulated futures and options markets like the CME are closed through the weekend.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that after a brief attempt by Bitcoin (BTC) bulls to rally above $37,000 in the early morning hours on May 29, the price has tumbled below $34,000 as the support needed for a move higher failed to manifest. Price action for Ether (ETH) was nearly identical to that of BTC, with an attempt to break above $2,500 met with stiff resistance that pushed the altcoin's price down to $2,300.According to analysis from filbfilb, co-founder of Decentrader, Bitcoin's price action is a major source of  the market's confusion as it remains a ways away from the 20 Week Moving Average (WMA) “which is typically the line between Bitcoin being either in a bull or bear market and as such remains a bearish scenario for Bitcoin.”The analyst went on to further state that if Bitcoin is able to find solid support in the low $30,000s, the 20 WMA could turn into a major resistance zone in any attempt to move higher.Filbfilb said:At this point, according to filbfilb, it is crucial for BTC to reclaim $37,500 “to avoid a retest of weekly support.”Should Bitcoin manage to stage a rally and break above $40,000, filbfilb identified the previous support/resistance zone at $45,500 to $46,500 as the next area of resistance that will need to be overcome.Ether performed slightly better than BTC after it sold off back to the 61.8% retracement as the price was able to bounce back above the 20 WMA, but was ultimately rejected at the “critical pivot price” of $3,000 as the recovery momentum faded.Filbfilb identified $2,300 as an important area of support for Ether that would need to be held if bulls wanted to gather momentum for an attempt to break above the $3,000 level and retest $3,300, with this scenario be highly “dependent upon the strength of Bitcoin.”Overall, the analyst expects that Ether will outperform BTC in any upside move and “at least match any bearish movement.”He said,The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

3,"Crypto traders are drawn to the market by its bombastic growth and lucrative opportunities to make a profit. However, not every investor is seeking volatility or using degenerate leverage levels to gamble at derivatives exchanges. In fact, stablecoins usually comprise half of the total value locked (TVL) on most decentralized finance (DeFi) applications that focus on yields.There's a reason why DeFi boomed despite Ethereum network median fees surpassing $10 in May. Institutional investors are desperately seeking fixed income returns as traditional finance seldomly offers yields above 5%. However, it is possible to earn up to 4% per month using Bitcoin (BTC) derivatives on low-risk trades.Notice how even non-investment grade bonds, far riskier than Treasury Bills, yield below 5%. Meanwhile, the official inflation rate in the United States for the past 12 months has stood at 4.2%.Paul Cappelli, a portfolio manager at Galaxy Fund Management, recently told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin's ""inelastic supply curve and deflationary issuance schedule"" make it a ""compelling hedge against inflation and poor monetary policies that could lead to cash positions becoming devalued over time.""Centralized services such as Crypto.com, BlockFi, and Nexo will typically yield 5% to 10% per year for stablecoin deposits. To increase the payout, one needs to seek higher risks, which does not necessarily mean a less known exchange or intermediary.However, one can achieve a 2% weekly yield using Bitcoin derivatives. For those instruments, liquidity currently sits at centralized exchanges. Therefore the trader needs to factor in counterparty risk when analyzing such trades.The buyer of a call option can acquire Bitcoin for a fixed price on a set future date. For this privilege, one pays upfront for the call option seller. While the buyer typically uses this instrument as insurance, sellers are usually aiming for semi-fixed income trades.Each contract has a set expiry date and strike price, so potential gains and losses can be calculated beforehand. This covered call strategy consists of holding Bitcoin and selling call options, preferably 15% to 20% above the current market price.It would be unfair to call it a fixed income trade as this strategy aims to increase the trader's Bitcoin balance, but it doesn't protect from negative price swings for those measuring returns in USD terms.For a holder, this strategy does not add risk as the Bitcoin position will remain unchanged even if the price drops.Considering that Bitcoin was trading $37,000 when the above data was gathered, a trader could sell the $44,000 call option for June 4, maturing in six days. Depositing a 0.10 BTC margin should be enough to sell 0.30 BTC call option contracts, thereby receiving 0.00243 BTC in advance.There are essentially two outcomes, depending on whether Bitcoin trades above or below $44,000 at 8:00 am UTC on June 4. The $44,000 call option will become worthless for any level below this figure, so the option seller keeps the 0.00243 BTC advance payment in addition to the 0.10 BTC margin deposit.However, if the expiry price is higher than $44,000, then the trader's margin will be used to cover the price difference. At $46,000, the net loss is 0.011 Bitcoin, therefore reducing the margin to 0.089 ($4.094). Meanwhile, at the time of the deposit, the 0.10 Bitcoin margin was worth $3,700.Indeed the covered call option seller would have made more money by holding the 0.10 Bitcoin from the beginning, as the price increased from $37,000 to $46,000. Nevertheless, by receiving the 0.00243 BTC advanced payment, one will increase the Bitcoin holdings even if the price moves below $37,000.That 2.4% profit in Bitcoin terms will happen for any expiry below $44,000, which is 18.9% higher than the $37,000 when Deribit option prices were analyzed.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

4,"Bitcoin (BTC) has crashed by around 44% from its all-time high of $64,899, signaling an end to its second-largest bull run that started in March 2020. Many analysts, including those from BiotechValley Insights, see ""terrible technicals"" in the Bitcoin market, noting that the flagship cryptocurrency could extend its ongoing decline until $20,000.Nevertheless, Glassnode Insights, a weekly newsletter issued by on-chain data analytics service Glassnode, anticipates a Bitcoin price recovery in the sessions ahead, based on an on-chain indicator that serves as a metric to gauge institutional interest in the cryptocurrency.Dubbed as Grayscale Premium, the metric tracks the capital flows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) — the largest investment vehicle for institutional investors looking to gain exposure in the Bitcoin market.A rising Grayscale Premium shows a higher bitcoin inflow into Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. That prompts GBTC to trade at a premium with respect to the BTC spot price. Conversely, a lowering Grayscale Premium conveys a declining BTC inflow, prompting GBTC to trade at a discount to Bitcoin spot pricing.The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust attracted more than 50,000 BTC to its reserves throughout January 2021 and the first half of February 2021. GBTC traded at a 10-20% premium in the said period, showing a rising institutional interest.Nevertheless, the premium fell below 10% in the first half of February. GBTC started trading at discounts to spot pricing. The same period saw the BTC/USD spot rate climbing from lower $30,000s to almost $65,000 in April. By then, GBTC premium had flipped below zero.On May 13, just ahead of the Elon Musk-led Bitcoin market crash on May 19, the GBTC premium reached a peak low of 21.23%. It showed that institutional demand for bitcoin investment products had softened since late February.But the May 19 price crash improved the Grayscale Premium, noted Glassnode Insights. The metric recovered to -3.8%, suggesting that institutional interest, ""or at the very arbitrage trader conviction,"" rose in tandem with declining Bitcoin spot prices. The Canadian Purpose Bitcoin ETF underwent a similar discounting trajectory, witnessing consistent capital inflows through late April and early May and outflows later in a sign of weakening institutional demand. Glassnode noted:The contrast between lower Bitcoin spot rates and recovering GBTC prices conveyed that institutions have not outright abandoned the crypto market. Instead, it shows that the sell-off has motivated investors to gain exposure in both Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and Canadian Purpose Bitcoin ETF. Glassnode wrote:The analytics portal also referred to metrics that showed that the majority of sellers in the latest BTC price run-down appeared to be short-term holders. Meanwhile, long-term holders bought the price dip ""with conviction."""
5,"This is Part Two of a multipart series that aims to answer the following question: What is the “fundamental value” of Bitcoin? Part One is about the value of scarcity, Part Two — the market moves in bubbles, Part Three — the rate of adoption, and Part Four — the hash rate and the estimated price of Bitcoin.In recent months or even years, there’s been a lot of talk about the bubbles developing in the bond markets. Newspapers — both financial and non-financial — talked about it, with specialized television stations and prestigious “macroeconomists” from all over the world discussing how today’s world debt has negative interest rates.It is financially counterintuitive to have to pay or lend money to someone, even if that person is a state. We are experiencing an absurd situation that has never happened before in the financial market landscape. The main cause is linked to the enormous liquidity injected into the markets by central banks, which they use as funding to avoid their own bankruptcy, only to then, prudently, reverse it back onto the states (they themselves in difficulty).After all, John Maynard Keynes’s famous phrase reads:In actuality, this absurdity has made it possible to avoid the bankruptcy of the financial system, so it is welcome, even though it feeds irrational phenomena, such as bond markets with negative yields (and therefore senseless bond prices) and stock markets touching (not all, but most) new highs day after day.One phenomenon that isn’t actually fueled by central bank money, that everyone labeled a meaningless mega bubble in 2017, is Bitcoin (BTC). The price of Bitcoin rose to a high of $20,000 in December 2017, coinciding with the launch of Bitcoin futures by the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the CME Group, the two largest commodities exchanges in the world, and then hit a minimum of around $3,100 in 2018, effectively losing over 80% of its value.Does it represent the bursting of a bubble? Sure. Does it represent the end of Bitcoin? Certainly not. Could there be more Bitcoin bubbles in the future? Of course.As always, we would like to approach the problem as analytically as possible. We reconstructed the table created by the founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, using Excel, to make sure that Bitcoin was deflationary and not inflationary.The U.S. dollar (and all currencies in the world, truthfully, including the euro), due to inflation, is worth less and less over time. We can better understand the phenomenon if we think about the value of assets. Buying a car 40 years ago cost about 13 times less than it does today, so a nice car that cost $10,000 in 1980 would cost $130,000 today.This phenomenon is called inflation, and it is induced by a rule that links the total value of goods in the world to the total currency in circulation. If the number of U.S. dollars in circulation doubles, the same goods will tend to cost twice as much. It “will tend” because currency is not a linear phenomenon, and it may take some time to happen.In the 1970s and early 1980s, inflation in the United States reached rates close to 12% per year, creating many difficulties for those who didn’t have the knowledge and the means to counter it.Bitcoin was created with a deflationary logic, more similar to commodities such as gold and silver. This is why it’s considered by many to be the new digital gold, as it has preservation of value characteristics and not those of impoverishment, like the dollar or the euro.Related: Is Bitcoin a store of value? Experts on BTC as digital goldLet's see how it was possible to create, and what the effects resulting from these choices are.Nakamoto decided that the maximum number of Bitcoin created and available should be 21 million. (The number 21 will occur many times. It is the Greek letter phi, which we will also talk about later). He could have decided to enter a fixed amount of Bitcoin for each block that got mined, but doing so wouldn’t have created the exponential growth effect that characterizes Bitcoin, or at least not as marked as it is today.Consequently, he decided to halve the amount of newly issued Bitcoin every four years, to create a very marked and interesting stock-to-flow effect that would push the price higher and higher.Related: Bitcoin Halving, ExplainedFor the first 210,000 blocks, miners were paid 50 BTC for each block written on the distributed ledger, at a time where the value of Bitcoin fluctuated from a few cents up to a few dollars, so the remuneration was not in the least comparable with that of today — neither was it as difficult to win the challenge. In fact, in the early years, simple computers were enough to do the mining.The first halving took place in 2012 — i.e., from the 210,001st block onward, remuneration was halved to 25 BTC for each writing on the distributed ledger. In 2016, the second halving took place, which brought the remuneration down to 12.5 BTC, and again with the third halving taking place in May 2020, bringing the remuneration for each block to 6.25 Bitcoin, which with a recent price correction of around $40,000 is still around $250,000.Related: 3 good reasons why $30,000 is probably the bottom for BitcoinThe next halving is scheduled for 2024, when remuneration will be further cut by 50%. It is set to continue, probably, until 2140, the year in which the last halving is expected, which will distribute less than 1 Bitcoin in the last year.But how does this halving phenomenon impact the price of Bitcoin? Does the halving of the so-called “flow,” or the flow of new capital into the market, affect the price of Bitcoin itself? As we saw previously in the first part, Bitcoin seems to follow the stock-to-flow model; therefore, a reduction in flow, while maintaining the same stock, should correspond to an increase in price. Now that we’ve had three halvings, shouldn’t there have been as many bubbles?Do you know how many bubbles Bitcoin has had in its short life? Three fatalities. They are represented graphically below.These are the three bubbles Bitcoin has faced so far, and each time the next maximum price became at least 10 times higher. Obviously, it is not a guarantee that it will do so in the future, but there are many factors that lead us to believe that what we experienced in 2017 will not be the last bubble — many more will follow in the future.Can this information be used to determine a correct price for Bitcoin? Or at least, a potentially achievable price according to this model?In fact, we can, if we take a look at this graph where the halvings are highlighted by jumps in the X-axis, in correspondence with the change in status of halving, we can estimate the fair value price — that is, the correct price at which Bitcoin could tend toward.If the price of Bitcoin tends to return around the line described in the figure above, it is clear that we can estimate what the future target price of Bitcoin will be, based on the various halvings that await us.From the graph, it is clear that the target price of Bitcoin is between $90,000 and $100,000. This information is very useful not only because it guarantees that we will arrive at those prices but because we should take into account our investment decisions, as it could actually get there and even exceed those price levels.Obviously, these estimates must be taken as an intellectual attempt to understand the dynamics of Bitcoin and absolutely cannot be considered a suggestion or advice from the author. Understanding how Bitcoin can reach such values is not easy, and anyone approaching this fascinating world for the first time would have a hard time imagining how a seemingly worthless asset could have such a high price, especially if you fall into the trap of thinking of it as a dollar-par currency.To do this, it is important to know its various aspects. One that is certainly fundamental for determining the price of Bitcoin is the adoption rate, which is to be described in the next part.This article was co-authored by Ruggero Bertelli and Daniele Bernardi.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

6,"For the purposes of historical comparison, it’s also worth noting that the pattern of the dominance chart currently looks much like it did during the earlier part of 2017.As the markets have gone into meltdown since May 12, Bitcoin (BTC) dominance has fluctuated dramatically, bucking 2021’s prevailing trend. Before the sell-off started in earnest, BTC dominance had been falling pretty steadily from around 70% in January to a low of under 40% by the time the crash was underway. At that point, BTC dominance was at its lowest since the summer of 2018. It has since recovered to above 43%.If the same pattern is underway this time around, then the market is likely to be at the equivalent of summer 2017 when the alt season was just ramping up, and still some months away from Bitcoin’s price peak of around $20,000 in December 2017.Of course, while the patterns draw some interesting parallels, BTC dominance doesn’t necessarily tell that much about price. But it does offer insights into how the flagship asset is performing in relation to the rest of the markets, underpinning certain trends. So, what are the likely scenarios for BTC dominance, and what would it mean for the markets?The money flow model is one potential predictor of where the markets could go. The model states that money flows from fiat into Bitcoin, and then down from large caps, through mid-caps to small-cap altcoins before redirecting back to BTC and, ultimately, back to fiat.This model is interesting because it pretty much sums up what happened in 2017, except that the cycle played out twice as BTC surged toward the end of the year. So, if the 2017 scenario repeats itself, BTC dominance could continue to rise until the flagship asset sees another price peak, then fall as alt season accelerates once again.Along with the eerie similarities of the dominance charts, the behavior of the alt markets also offers some indication that they could be performing according to historical cycles. In early May, Cointelegraph reported that altcoins had flipped their previous cycle high to support — a move that last happened in 2017.If the cycle repeats, it could still launch the alt markets to stratospheric new heights in 2021. While the performance observed during May may not offer much reassurance in this regard, there’s also nothing yet to indicate that BTC and the broader markets won’t perform according to long-term trends. Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of exchange FTX and Alameda Research, told Cointelegraph:For individual investors looking to follow the money flow, there is one big consideration. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Robert W. Wood, managing partner at Wood LLP, warned: “The elephant in the room for diversification is taxes.” He added: “Up until 2018, many investors could claim that a swap of one crypto for another was nontaxable under section 1031 of the tax code. But the law was changed at the end of 2017.”Indeed, Omri Marian, director of the Graduate Tax Program at University of California, Irvine School of Law, confirmed that crypto-to-crypto transactions are likely to trigger tax obligations, explaining to Cointelegraph:Shane Brunette, CEO of CryptoTaxCalculator, put it into practical terms, telling Cointelegraph: “If an investor switches between BTC and altcoins, the capital gain/loss would be realized in this financial year, regardless of whether or not they’ve ‘cashed out’ to fiat.” Furthermore, he clarified that “The activity would reset the length of time the investor has been holding the asset which would impact the eligibility to claim a long-term capital gains discount.”So, be mindful that following the money flow may come with its own set of costs, and as a result, there are no guarantees that the pattern may repeat, as new variables may have an effect.The most critical difference between 2017 and now is the presence of institutions in the markets. At least, that’s true for Bitcoin and, to some extent, large-cap altcoins such as Ether (ETH). Large swathes of the alt markets, including almost all low-cap coins and memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE), are dominated by retail traders and investors.Examining the dominance charts, BTC seemed to get a boost at the end of 2020 as institutional interest in cryptocurrencies started to pique. Its dominance continued to rise until around January.But there’s some evidence that institutions could be behind the recent boost to BTC dominance. On May 21, it emerged that whales had bought $5.5 billion worth of BTC while prices were below $36,000; two days later, crypto hedge funds MVPQ Capital, ByteTree Asset Management and Three Arrows Capital all confirmed they were dip buyers.So, there’s a chance that Bitcoin’s sudden dominance recovery may not come down to regular market cycles but instead be influenced by institutional whales scooping up discounted BTC.The question is: To what extent will the involvement of institutions make a difference to BTC dominance patterns compared with what was seen in 2017? Perhaps the most critical difference between institutions and retail investors is that institutions are far more likely to follow prevailing market conditions and go risk-off accordingly. Therefore, BTC dominance is rising as investors choose to step away from risk-on alts.Related: For the long haul? When Bitcoin nosedived, institutions held fastHowever, based on the “buying the dip” reports, it seems there’s no reason to assume that investors are going as far as going risk-off from crypto itself — at least for now. Furthermore, bullish sentiments continue to swirl around, undeterred by the market chaos of recent weeks as seen by the reports that interest in BTC appears to still be on the rise.Therefore, there’s still every chance that if interest in BTC continues to hold, and no major bad news comes in to destroy the sentiment around crypto, the money flow model may still play out once again. For now, if history holds firm, some further increases in BTC dominance will take place before investors once again start to expand into large-cap altcoins."
7,"Is it possible to mine Bitcoin (BTC) using only 100% renewable energy sources and deliver the same economic returns as those using carbon-based sources? The answer is yes, according to Square’s recent analysis on the cost of renewables and their impact on Bitcoin mining.Unfortunately for our industry, the number of headlines and headline-making tweets about Bitcoin’s energy use and potential environmental impact has followed its rise in value in recent months. The increased media scrutiny has led to increased calls for regulatory action and even a proposed bill in the New York State Senate that would place a three-year moratorium on non-renewable Bitcoin mining in the state.Related: Green blockchain should work smarter, not harderThis is one debate where both sides have a point. Critics are correct: Bitcoin mining does use a lot of electricity. The Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance estimates that the total electricity used worldwide by Bitcoin miners is an average of 113 terawatt-hours per year. This would place Bitcoin’s energy use somewhere between the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands, two countries with a combined population of approximately 27 million people, which is admittedly a lot. However, the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance’s recent “3rd Global Cryptoasset Benchmarking Study” shows that 76% of miners are using at least some renewable energy in their operations and that 39% of all energy consumption used in proof-of-work mining, such as mining Bitcoin, is from renewable sources.Related: Is Bitcoin a waste of energy? Pros and cons of Bitcoin miningNow that we have discussed Bitcoin mining’s energy consumption and carbon footprint, let’s try to put those figures in context. By looking at three directly relevant comparisons: the United States electricity grid, the traditional finance system and gold mining.Let’s start with comparing Bitcoin mining to the electrical grid as a whole. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that approximately 20% of U.S. electricity generation for 2020 was from renewable sources. This means that with 40% of its energy consumption coming from renewables, Bitcoin mining is twice as green as the national grid as a whole, reflecting the conscious decision-making of the industry to minimize its carbon footprint.Moving on to traditional finance, there are two critical lenses to evaluate the industry through: 1) the financing of fossil fuel projects and 2) the industry’s carbon footprint. The former is a critical piece of the discussion, as shifting deposits away from traditional financial institutions reduces their capacity to fund environmentally destructive activities.According to the Rainforest Action Network’s “Banking on Climate Chaos — Fossil Fuel Finance Report 2021” released in March, the world’s 60 largest commercial and investment banks have provided $3,800,000,000,000 — yes, 3.8 trillion U.S. dollars — worth of financing to fossil fuels since the signing of Paris climate accord in 2015. Think about that for a minute — the Paris Agreement is the world’s definitive step toward combating climate change, and yet, the world’s largest banks have provided financing equivalent to the GDP of Germany, the world’s fourth-largest economy, to fossil fuels since its signing.For all of the outdated, exaggerated criticism of Bitcoin as a means of money laundering, terrorist financing and many others, the traditional finance industry has an incredible amount to answer for as far as its capital being used for destructive activities.Looking at traditional finance’s carbon footprint, Galaxy Digital published in May “On Bitcoin’s Energy Consumption: A Quantitative Approach to a Subjective Question,” which is a breakdown of the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining and the two industries to which Bitcoin is often compared: traditional banking and gold mining. The traditional banking system analysis looks at the energy consumption of the world’s top 100 global banks, breaking down their energy consumption across four primary categories: data centers, branches, ATMs and card network data centers. Using publicly available data from industry leaders, Galaxy estimates the energy consumption to be around 260 TWh per year. This is more than double Bitcoin mining’s energy consumption and notably excludes key pillars of the system, including central banks and clearinghouses, due to lack of reliable data sources, suggesting the multiple may be materially higher.As with its analysis of the traditional banking system, Galaxy’s analysis of gold mining captures what is likely to be only a subset of the industry’s total energy consumption. Using the World Gold Council’s own analysis contained in the 2019 report titled “Gold and Climate Change: Current and Future Impacts,” and limiting the scope of the analysis to direct greenhouse gas emissions, greenhouse gas emissions from electricity purchased by gold miners, and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the refinement and recycling of gold, Galaxy estimates the industry’s electricity consumption associated with greenhouse gases to be 240 TWh per year. At a base level, that means gold consumes around 85% more energy per year than Bitcoin mining. However, given that the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance estimated that approximately 40% of Bitcoin mining’s energy consumption is from renewables, that means gold mining’s consumption of non-renewable energy is 3x that of Bitcoin mining.Being better than your worst comparisons is not enough. For Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining to realize their full potential, we absolutely have to do better as an industry. We believe that the two key levers to do so are thoughtful regulation and industry action, but the inclusion of the former may surprise you. Isn’t Bitcoin supposed to be full of people who reject regulations?The truth is, regulation on its own is neither good nor bad, but depends how it is crafted. Thoughtful, specific regulation can oxygenate an industry by supporting innovation, incentivizing good actors while disincentivizing poor actors and giving the public confidence. Look no further than the state of Wyoming, where legislators have been working with blockchain industry leaders since 2017 to pass 22 laws that provide a clear and encouraging regulatory environment that has since brought tens of billions of dollars of business to the state.At the same time, overly broad, blunt regulation, like the anti-mining law proposed in the New York State Senate, can kill an industry. We look forward to working with regulators to help craft a regulatory regime that oxygenates the industry while addressing the very legitimate public interest concerns at the same time.Related: Blockchain will thrive once innovators and regulators work togetherFinally, we come to the stakeholders who bear the greatest burden but also have the greatest ability to enact change in decarbonizing Bitcoin mining: the industry itself. With an estimated total of 40% of the industry’s energy coming from renewable sources — which is twice the share of the overall electrical grid in the U.S. — we should be proud of the progress we have made.However, we are unequivocal in saying that more has to be done. We believe that the Crypto Climate Accord is a brilliant first step. We encourage all in our industry to not only sign the accord and satisfy its goals of reaching net-zero emissions from electricity consumption by 2030 but to surpass those goals as soon as possible. We believe this will happen, not only because it is the right thing to do but because those in the industry who adopt 100% renewable strategies will be rewarded.Related: Bitcoin mining's future is green, and Russia has the best chanceThe market is the ultimate arbiter of success, and we believe that the era of responsible capitalism is upon us — investors and consumers vote with their wallets, supporting responsible actors while shunning those whose actions drive negative externalities.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

8,"Last month, Bitcoin (BTC) reached above $60,000, highlighting the current frenzy around digital currencies. Following BTC, altcoins also saw substantial increases in value. All of this is music to the ears of long-term and short-term bull investors seeking increased gains, even with the current pullback and support of Bitcoin hovering around $40,000. However, despite all the hype around the current bull run, a lack of digital asset liquidity continues to be a significant challenge for exchanges, traders, token issuers and market makers. The reality of today’s market is that professional crypto traders cannot efficiently access global liquidity or find the best global prices to increase profits.For token issuers, the current climate has forced them to list their coins on numerous exchanges to reach their target client base. It drives up business development costs and forces issuers into niche markets. In order for the digital currency market to continue moving forward, these categories must be understood.One of the main causes of illiquidity is rooted in market fragmentation. The idea behind crypto is much more than a sexy stock investment. Crypto is meant to be an entirely new way of handling money. But with all of the different coins — even the successful ones — and the lack of businesses accepting crypto payment, users aren’t utilizing crypto in the way it was initially intended.Related: Professional traders need a global crypto sea, not hundreds of lakesOf course, this was the inevitable result of the disruption of the fiat world. Fragmentation of this type is the only possible path for consumers to transition into the crypto world. And because exchanges are generally localized, they tend to service only one or a few fiat currencies. Again, consumers are left with a fragmented market and a slow adoption curve.This situation isn’t bad, as users have free choice, but it does have consequences.Two of those consequences are a dearth of liquidity and highly volatile prices. Consider how much the price of Bitcoin has changed over the last two years. It’s been a roller coaster ride, to say the least. That volatility makes it tough for a consumer to go on a $500 shopping spree using a mobile digital wallet at a progressive and technologically adept department store. In short, liquidation and price movements become a problem.What’s more, the fragmentation of the marketplace has left newcomers to the space with a massive learning curve. Understanding the market and determining accurate pricing for various coins requires having many exchange accounts and a deep awareness of the sector. For this reason, many newer digital investors simply buy and hold, anticipating changes in the market but hoping for relatively rapid returns on coins — even those without clear use cases.Related: Forecasting Bitcoin price using quantitative models, Part 1The complexities of the fragmented market have forced several different solutions. Some suggest centralized approaches to liquidity. By centralizing coins and standardizing markets, investors no longer face a fractured and complex maze of coins and prices. Without such negative fragmentation issues at play, investors would be more willing to trade with rapidity rather than holding for wider bid-ask margins.While this seems coherent at first glance, such a solution is untenable. First, centralization goes against the very ethos on which cryptocurrencies were developed. Centralization is not the answer to fixing a market that grew on the back of a conscious rejection of centralized currencies. To do so would alienate much of the market itself.Second, if the market adopts a centralized policy, the same problems that plague banks (slow processing times, lack of transparency and security, high fees) will eventually come to the digital currency market. The progress once hoped for would only be a replication of the current financial system’s failures.Finally, even in an apparently decentralized system where all market liquidity is actually centralized into a few decentralized exchanges, investors would still be limited in how they could participate. With fewer but larger pools of liquidity available, the inevitable result is a return to a fiat-style financial system.Related: Decentralization vs. centralization: Where does the future lie? Experts answerBecause centralized solutions run contrary to the very nature of digital currencies, a more robust decentralized solution is needed to mend the problems caused by market fragmentation. Decentralization, while a longer-term solution to the problem, can provide the market with continued adoption by institutions. This trajectory aligns with the vision of cryptocurrencies while eventually producing stability.However, simple decentralization is not a strong enough answer. For crypto, the key to liquidity is “distributed, yet connected.” This slogan takes the best of both worlds and marries them together. Decentralization — that is, distribution — is what makes crypto so revolutionary. But the 21st century is more globally connected than ever before, a link that will only grow stronger.This growth in connectivity, however, must be maintained through organic methodologies. To seek to force some staunch structure onto the cryptocurrency space is, of course, to centralize it. Therefore, investors and traders must weather the storm of fragmentation to protect what makes cryptocurrency so profoundly disruptive. This pathway offers connectivity, and when connectivity increases, the digital currency market becomes more liquid. Plus, the more distributed the market remains, the more the original purpose of digital currencies remains intact. The market must move in this direction in the next three to five years.As the cryptocurrency market moves that way, activity will only continue to increase, allowing decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions to take over from there. DeFi solutions offer the best of both worlds: a truly distributed connectedness, which will protect the digital currency space and reduce fragmentation of the market.Most cryptocurrency trading companies work the same way as a bank or stock exchange, where buyers and sellers must pay fees for usage. Such a practice can quickly turn into a David and Goliath situation, where traders are taken advantage of by Goliaths with more wealth and higher risk thresholds. However, in a DeFi trading pool, the benefits (and the costs) are spread evenly among all parties. For contributing to the pool, liquidity providers get rewarded with a pool token. Buyers always have a seller, and sellers always have a buyer.Moreover, all the liquidity providers receive a share of the trading fees based upon their stake size. Truly, this is a decentralized system: Not only can someone offer crypto to the DeFi pool, but they can also contribute fiat, providing an avenue for traditional, conservative investors to play a role. If an investment group sees the benefit, count on them being there for the reward.Among the major catalysts that will move the market in this direction, the most prominent are central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). As governments begin issuing CBDCs, they offer a far simpler entry point into DeFi. Investors and consumers alike would already be prepared for digital transactions, and the barrier for transitioning funds from fiat to crypto would be substantially lessened.Additionally, CBDCs would allow for a more significant international movement of funds. Providing a helpful catalyst toward a fully decentralized liquidity pool would make isolated exchanges transacting only in local fiat obsolete. Forces like CBDCs and increased DeFi participation will drive change, and investors will be the better for it.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

9,"The cryptocurrency market faced a new wave of selling pressure on May 28 as Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped to $35,100 and traders seem generally disinterested in buy the dip ahead of the weekend.Despite the downside moves seen across the market over the past couple 2 weeks, institutional investors have for the most part held firm in their resolve to stay committed to cryptocurrencies but the absence of 'we bought the dip' announcements have retail traders wondering if Bitcoin price is in for further downside.While some analysts see the possibility of Bitcoin falling as low as $20,000 as the worst case scenario, the overall price trajectory of BTC remains skewed to the upside with the weekly trend of higher lows still intact.#BTC has already set in a Higher Low on the Weekly

10,"Earlier this week billionaire investor Carl Icahn’s told Bloomberg that he is considering entering crypto in a big way but this hardly made any difference to crypto prices. This is just another hint that the underlying sentiment is bearish and that crypto markets are not reacting positively to favorable news.However, this does not mean that the bulls have stopped buying. While speaking to Cointelegraph, S2F Capital managing partner and chief investment officer Micah Spruill said that on-chain data shows Bitcoin whales, owning between 1,000 and 10,000 (BTC), and retail traders holding between 0.1 and 1 Bitcoin, are accumulating at lower levels.Accumulation by large players near the lows is a positive sign as it indicates they are bullish for the long term.While speaking at Consensus 2021, ARK Investments CEO Cathie Wood said that emerging market central banks may buy Bitcoin to protect their balance sheets “because they know their currencies are going down and that they will be under attack as reserves go down.”Traders should keep a close watch on the fundamentals of Bitcoin and the crypto sector because that will drive long-term price action. In the short term, traders' sentiment plays a major role in deciding the trend.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine whether crypto prices have bottomed out or not.Bitcoin’s pullback could not even reach the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $41,269, which suggests that traders are closing their positions on minor rallies. The downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($42,780) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the negative territory suggest that bears are in control.If the BTC/USDT pair plummets below $34,000, the decline could extend to the critical support at $30,000. The bulls are likely to defend this support aggressively.If the price turns up from the current level, the buyers will again try to push the price above the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. If they succeed, the pair could rally to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $48,231. Such a move will suggest that the pair may have bottomed at $30,000.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $30,000, the selling could intensify as the stops of the dip buyers are likely to get hit. There is a minor support at $28,000 but if that cracks, the next stop could be $20,000.Ether (ETH) broke above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $2,738.74 on May 26 but the bulls could not push the price above the 20-day EMA ($2,888). This suggests traders are selling on rallies to the 20-day EMA.The moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover and the RSI is in the negative territory, suggesting the path of least resistance is to the downside.If bears sink the price below $2,378.54, the ETH/USDT pair could decline to $2,079.94. A break below this support could result in a retest of the May 23 low at $1,728.74.This negative view will invalidate if the price turns up from the current level or the support and breaks above the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest a change in sentiment and the pair could then rally to the 61.8% retracement level at $3,362.72.Binance Coin’s (BNB) relief rally hit a wall at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $395.09. A shallow pullback after a sharp decline suggests the bears are unrelenting and they are shorting even on minor rallies.The bears are currently trying to pull the price below the $306.61 support. If they succeed, the BNB/USDT pair could drop to $257.40 and then to $211.70. A strong bounce off this support may keep the pair range-bound between $211.70 and $395.09 for a few days.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up and breaks above the 20-day EMA ($427), the relief rally could extend to the 50-day SMA ($521). This level may act as a resistance but if the bulls arrest the next decline above $428, it will suggest the downtrend could be over.Cardano (ADA) rose above the 20-day EMA ($1.63) on May 26 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. The price turned down from $1.83 and the bears have pulled the altcoin below the $1.55 support today.If the bears sustain the price below $1.43, the ADA/USDT pair could drop to $1.24 and then to the critical support at $1. If the price rebounds off $1 once again, the pair could remain range-bound for a few days.Alternatively, if the price turns up and rises above $1.58, it will suggest strong buying at lower levels. The bulls will then make one more attempt to push the price above $2. If they manage to do that, the pair could challenge the all-time high at $2.47.The failure of the bulls to build upon the breakout from the downtrend line suggests a lack of demand at higher levels. The bears resumed their selling on May 27 and have pulled Dogecoin (DOGE) below the 50-day SMA ($0.35).If the price breaks below $0.29, the DOT/USDT pair could drop to $0.25 and then to $0.21. This is an important support to watch out for because if it cracks, the selling could intensify and the pair may drop to $0.15 and then $0.10.The moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover, indicating the bears are in control. This negative view will invalidate if the price reverses direction and breaks above the $0.43 to $0.47 overhead resistance.XRP’s relief rally hit a wall at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.05. This suggests the sentiment is negative and traders are in a hurry to close their long positions on a shallow pullback.If the price breaks and sustains below $0.88, the bears will try to pull the price down to $0.65. The downsloping 20-day EMA ($1.14) and the RSI below 40 suggest the path of least resistance is to the downside.A break below $0.65 could open the doors for a further decline to $0.56. On the contrary, if the bulls defend the $0.88 support, the XRP/USDT pair may rise to the 20-day EMA. A breakout of this resistance could result in a rally to the 50-day SMA ($1.34) and the downtrend line.Polkadot (DOT) reached the critical overhead resistance at $26.50 today but the bulls could not drive the price above it. This suggests the bears are defending this level aggressively. If bears pull the price below $19.65, the altcoin could drop to $15.The downsloping moving averages and the RSI below 39 suggest the bears are in command. A break below $15 will suggest the start of a new downtrend. Conversely, if the bulls defend the $15 level, the DOT/USDT pair may consolidate in a range for a few days.This negative view will invalidate if the price turns up from the current level or $15 and breaks above $26.50. Such a move could push the pair to $31.28. A breakout of this resistance will suggest the bulls are back in the game.Internet Computer (ICP) has been trading inside the tight range of $120 and $168 for the past few days. Today, the bears are attempting to sink the price below the support of the range at $120.If they succeed, the ICP/USDT pair could drop to the all-time low at $86.01. If this support also cracks, the pair could decline to the next target objective at $60.On the contrary, if the bulls defend the $120 support, the pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. A breakout and close above $168 will be the first indication that the bulls are back in the game.On a breakout and close above $168, the pair could rally to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $243.08.Uniswap (UNI) reached the 20-day EMA ($29.58) on May 26 but the bulls could not propel the price above it. This shows the sentiment has turned negative and traders are selling on rallies to the 20-day EMA.However, the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests the bulls have not given up yet. They will make one more attempt to thrust the price above the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the UNI/USDT pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($34.27).Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the bears will make one more attempt to pull the price down. If the sellers sink the price below $24.40, the pair could drop to $21.50 and then to $18.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) had been trading above the $685.36 support for the past three days but the bulls could not push the price to the 20-day EMA ($876). This suggests a lack of demand at higher levels.If the price sustains below $685.36, the bears will try to sink the price to the May 23 low at $468.13. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative territory indicate advantage to the bears.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the current level and rises above $802, the bulls will try to propel the price to the 20-day EMA. A breakout and close above the moving averages will suggest the downtrend could be over.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

11,"Bitcoin may not mean an end to traditional currency and banking, according to research director of Coin Center Peter Van Valkenburgh “I think there are folks in the Bitcoin community who probably make too many noises about how Bitcoin is going to dominate all economic systems and nobody will be using dollars anymore, and nobody will be using banks anymore, and I think that’s actually a little foolhardy,” Van Valkenburgh said in a Friday interview with the Washington Journal on C-Span.The way in which Bitcoin is used can depend on users’ geographic location. In some countries, Bitcoin (BTC) is seen as more of a speculative asset, used for trading and investing.In other regions, Bitcoin can serve as a vehicle of greater freedom, providing users more flexibility and faster payments, as well as an avenue out of inflationary troubles when compared to traditional finance and currency.“Generally speaking, here in the U.S., you’ll probably still use credit cards and Venmo and things like that, but maybe you’ll want to buy some Bitcoin because it can be a way to balance your investment portfolio against the threat of inflation,” Van Valkenburgh said, subsequently referring to similarity to gold in terms of limited supply.“So maybe, you know, as part of a balanced portfolio that includes other safer investments, you might have a little bit of Bitcoin to hedge against inflation,” he noted."
12,"Mid-May’s price plunge was one of crypto’s wildest pullbacks in recent years, a tumble that eliminated nearly $1 trillion from crypto’s market value. The industry had soared to new heights a month earlier, with Bitcoin (BTC) reaching almost $64,000, driven in good part by institutional investors. Now that some calm has returned to the market, bears are asking: How did institutions behave during the recent collapse? Did they jump ship or hold firm with their investments? And what impact might the pullback have in future institutional participation in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry?“Institutional investors mostly held firm,” Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya told Cointelegraph, “and after the dust settled, [investors] still seemed confident with their longer-term bets.” Also, Chainalysis chief economist Philip Gradwell wrote in a May 19 market analysis, “It also does not appear that institutions are significant sellers, although they may be more cautious as buyers right now.”On the other hand, analysts from JPMorgan told their clients that institutional investors abandoned Bitcoin for gold during the swoon. And then there was Elon Musk, whose May 12 tweet said that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin in exchange for its automobiles — citing concerns about BTC’s energy consumption — was blamed by many for accelerating Bitcoin’s market descent. It was already declining but fell another 40% after his tweet and has since had trouble recovering to reclaim $40,000.Economist Gradwell sought to put things in some historical context, noting that Bitcoin inflows to exchanges were relatively low compared with past sell-offs. This suggested “that much of the selling is from people with assets already on exchanges, which tend to be retail investors.”Many crypto veterans appeared to agree that the volatility was propelled by retail investors — not institutions. Anyblock Analytics GmbH’s co-founder and chief data officer Freddy Zwanzger told Cointelegraph that “institutions generally have long-term goals, so if anything, they would use recent price swings tactically — and most likely to buy into the market at lower prices.”Social media seemed to reinforce this view. Zwanzger continued, “On Crypto Twitter, I also saw many retail newbies panicking trying to sell, and all OGs commenting on the bargains they’ve got in yet another volatile swing that has happened before and will happen again.” He added:“On-chain data does show that BTC moved from newer wallets to older wallets, which suggests that newcomers capitulated,” Bobby Ong, co-founder and chief operating officer of crypto data platform CoinGecko, told Cointelegraph, adding: “However, it is also important to note that during the dip, BTC on Coinbase was trading at a premium, while huge outflows were also seen coming out. This suggests that certain institutions were buying the dip, but it is likely to include some institutions capitulating.”“On balance, our clients saw it as an opportunity to rebalance and add to positions at lower prices,” Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan told Cointelegraph. Bitwise, which serves primarily financial advisors and other professional investors, had net inflows throughout the pullback.Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of Arca — a digital asset management firm — sought to clarify some of the ambiguity, noting that the term “institutional investors” is often misused, telling Cointelegraph:Musk’s May 12 tweet was blamed by many media accounts for setting off the crypto plunge, but not everyone was ready to incriminate the Tesla CEO, who had written, “We are concerned about the rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.”According to Moya, “this month’s cryptocurrency collapse stemmed from heightened leverage trading across Asia, panic selling from mostly new retail traders and active money managers who just rode momentum.” While Hougan largely agreed that the primary driver of the pullback “was liquidations of overleveraged retail investors,” he also cited rising regulatory risk and “China’s view towards crypto,” which seems to be deteriorating.Regarding Musk specifically, Moya had a somewhat different take. “Initially, I thought this was a terrible flip flop by Musk and ultimately very bad news for Tesla and Bitcoin. After thinking it through, I believe that Musk saw the writing on the wall that the media was getting closer to calling out Bitcoin and its environmental impact.” He further added:Dorman agreed that Musk raised an ecological flag of sorts. “Elon Musk’s erratic tweets have brought ESG to center stage, and this will likely give pause to corporates/institutional capital,” he wrote in a blog post.Will institutional investors, which are more sensitive to ESG issues these days generally, shy away from BTC now for environmental reasons? On May 21, it was reported that Greenpeace would no longer accept Bitcoin donations for environmental reasons, for example.Furthermore, BTC mining does use prodigious amounts of electricity, after all — much more than the whole country of Argentina in a single year, according to a recent Cambridge University study. “The pressure is on for Bitcoin and other cryptos to embrace renewable energy,” continued Moya, adding:What about reports that institutional investors were dumping Bitcoin in favor of gold? Moya agreed that gold has become more attractive and may outperform BTC in the short term: “Bitcoin has dominated Wall Street as the best performing asset over all of 2020 and the first four months of this year. Institutions that were contemplating Bitcoin but failed to pull the trigger are completely riding the rally in gold prices.”It’s important not to let May’s downslide obscure crypto’s overall performance. It has been an extraordinary year, generally speaking. “If we take a look at the bigger picture, Bitcoin has been climbing for the past seven months and was due for a correction,” said Ong.“When you couple that with overleveraged traders, the 50% dip was essential in order to flush out leverage and ensure the bull market’s momentum can continue.” Meanwhile, Hougan noted: “Even after the pullback, Bitcoin is up more than 300% over the past year. The S&P 500 is lucky if it does that in a decade.”What impact, if any, will the “reset” have on institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain adoption moving forward — e.g., in 2021?“Zero,” answered Dorman, adding: “Institutional money doesn’t come faster or slower based on price moves. Those trying to deploy will still deploy, and they are. The recent declines in GBTC and COIN may have been leading indicators that this new money was slowing already, but not because of the recent downward price moves.”Overall, The pullback may have boosted interest in decentralized finance assets, Hougan told Cointelegraph. “This was a severe stress test for DeFi, and the industry passed with flying colors. That should raise confidence in the space.” Dorman agreed that DeFi passed “a major stress test,” writing in his blog that “it worked exactly as designed, handling all-time-high volumes and record liquidations without even a hiccup.”Meanwhile, Gradwell told Cointelegraph: “There is clearly an opportunity for Ethereum to gain ground on Bitcoin if it can deliver on being greener and more useful than Bitcoin — for example, by moving to proof-of-stake and further innovating in DeFi and NFTs [nonfungible tokens].” Moya, for his part, said that “Bitcoin and Ethereum will remain the two favorite holdings for many institutions, though the upside potential appears greater for the latter.”Is a boost for altcoins relative to BTC, then? “It ultimately boils down to different institutional interests,” said Ong. “While BTC continues to develop its narrative as a hedge against inflation and an appreciating store of value, ETH and DeFi, by extension, will attract stock-like investors.”Can one speak of any lessons learned from the recent market shudder?“For investors who have not experienced a crypto bear market in the past, this was a great test,” Hougan said. “If the pullback was too stressful, you have too much of your portfolio invested in crypto. You should downsize your position.”“The latest crypto plunge shows that cryptocurrency volatility can be tolerated by both retail and institutional investors,” added Moya. Traders seemed like they were gung ho to buy more Bitcoin even “if the plunge continued all the way towards the $20,000-to-$25,000 zone.”Related: Inflation winds stiffen as Bitcoin ballast on balance sheets proves its value“People will be more careful, especially those with overleveraged positions,” predicted Ong. “For newcomers, it was an eye-opener as to the extreme level of volatility that you can only find in the crypto markets.”All in all, the recent volatility shouldn’t deter institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. “The institutional investors I speak with are looking at crypto as a 10-year position with significant upside potential,” Hougan told Cointelegraph. “They know it is a volatile asset. They’re making a generational bet and are not deterred by a few weeks of volatility.”"
13,"Unloading Bitcoin (BTC) spot positions when it starts crashing violently upon forming its all-time highs is a bad investment call, at least according to its historical price action.The flagship cryptocurrency's eleven-year lifetime has seen it undergoing many bullish and bearish cycles. The BTC/USD exchange rate typically rises parabolically. It later trims more than half of those gains down as profitable traders sell the top. But, at the same time, traders who buy bitcoin around its local top suffer longer periods of losses.However, the overall historic price trajectory of Bitcoin remains skewed to the upside.The cryptocurrency bottoms out after every bullish-to-bearish cycle and rebounds all over again to seek new all-time highs.Its weekly timeframe chart shows the price forming consecutive higher highs separated by years — $500 in November 2015, $768 in June 2016, $2,998 in June 2017, $19,891 in December 2017, $41,986 in January 2021, and $64,899 in April 2021.PlanB, the brain behind the widely-circulated Stock to Flow model, which predicts the Bitcoin price at $288,000 by 2024, referred to the cryptocurrency's ability to return profits to patient investors in a tweet Friday morning. The pseudonymous analyst noted that not a single investor who held Bitcoin for more than four years ever suffered losses.He cited the 200-weekly moving average curve as an invisible price floor that held the bitcoin market's bullish bias higher during bearish corrections. The BTC/USD exchange rate tested the said support wave on its downside moves, only to rebound later to newer highs.The statement appeared as the Bitcoin price showed signs of waning bullish momentum. The BTC/USD exchange rate topped near $65,000 in mid-April and corrected to as low as $30,000 on Coinbase almost a month later. As of May 28, the pair's bid among traders was near $37,000.Yes, if you buy bitcoin you buy to hold for a long term or forever. That is how the game is played. Now todays sellers are April buyers, that is unusual, that is weak hands.Meanwhile, PlanB's long-term projects make Bitcoin appears like an asset that would keeping siphoning capital out of traditional markets. The analyst wrote earlier that he anticipates people to buy the cryptocurrency for its underlying scarcity — there can be only 21 million BTC in existence.""Silver, gold, countries with [a] negative interest rate (Europe, Japan, US soon), countries with predatory governments (Venezuela, China, Iran, Turkey, etc.), billionaires and millionaires hedging against quantitative easing (QE), and institutional investors discovering the best performing asset of last 10 yrs"" will influence people to seek safety in bitcoin, wrote PlanB in his 2019 paper, ""Modeling Bitcoin Value with Scarcity,"" as he envisioned a trillion-dollar market cap for the cryptocurrency.The model prompts investors who bought Bitcoin at around $65,000 to hold the asset even if it takes more than four years for them to make their investments even. That is applicable only if Bitcoin continues to follow the stock-to-flow price model trajectory.A stock-to-flow model is commonly used to measure commodity scarcity but may also be applied to #Bitcoin to generate actionable insights around $BTC's supply. Learn more here: https://t.co/xZHtx86y0R pic.twitter.com/wF3c1JEB6HA logarithmic curve chart based on the same bullish model anticipates the BTC/USD rates to fall to $20,000 or lower. The downside target appears after sketching a Fibonacci graph between the curve's upper and lower bands. Its uppermost deviation sits near $111,590, while the lowest one is around $17,150.The logarithmic curve's historical significance in predicting price bottoms and tops makes it relevant enough for investors to realize their potential long and short targets.Despite their accuracy, the stock-to-flow model and its derivatives have attracted criticism for its unrealistic bullish portrayals of scarcer assets. Charlie Morris, co-founder, and CIO of crypto data firm ByteTree, told CoinTelegraph in November last year that bitcoin's lower supply against higher demand does not guarantee higher prices.People will still be able to sell bitcoin from existing active supply to meet the market's demand, argued Morris.Nico Cordeiro, the chief investment officer and fund manager at Strix Leviathan, also criticized the core assertion of scarcity-based Bitcoin pricing models, noting that no evidence suggests that supply dictates the U.S. dollar market valuation of monetary goods (gold, silver, or Bitcoin).The past performance is not a guarantee of future results. But with Bitcoin gaining momentum among institutional circles in the wake of lower-yield investment safe-haven alternatives (government bonds, the U.S. dollar, etc.), it looks appealing to many to just “hodl” the token until further notice.

14,"Cryptocurrency businesses in the United Kingdom have been struggling to meet Anti-Money Laundering standards set by the Financial Conduct Authority, according to a senior official.John Glen, a member of U.K. Parliament and the economic secretary to the Treasury, pointed out major difficulties in the process of registering crypto firms under the FCA’s AML regulations in official comments on Friday.According to the official, only five crypto businesses have received registration from the FCA as of May 24 after the authority became the official AML supervisor of the crypto industry in the U.K. in January 2020.“Of the firms assessed to date over 90% have withdrawn their application following FCA intervention. There are 167 crypto asset businesses with outstanding applications,” Glen noted. He added that 77 new crypto firms have applications pending full assessment.The secretary mentioned that the FCA was also not able to process and register all applications by its previous deadline due to a significant number of firms failing to adopt robust AML control frameworks as well as employ proper staff. As such, the FCA established a “Temporary Registration Regime” allowing crypto companies to continue trading until July 9 pending a decision.Glen also stated that Her Majesty’s Treasury has been in regular contact with the FCA as well as industry associations, firms and consumer organizations regarding concerns over the range of financial services related to crypto. He noted that HM Treasury published a consultation on the broader regulatory framework of crypto with a focus on stablecoins in January:The FCA has been expanding its regulatory oversight of the crypto industry this year. In March, the authority announced its plans to require crypto firms to submit yearly financial crimes reports. Previously, the financial watchdog prohibited U.K. firms from offering crypto derivatives products including futures and exchange-traded notes to retail customers."
15,"The Australian Taxation Office has urged citizens to accurately report any profits made in the process of trading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), anticipating tax filings from a pool of 600,000 Aussies who it now believes to be invested in digital assets.The ATO’s assistant commissioner, Tim Loh, told News.com.au that people still make the mistake of treating crypto like a currency as opposed to an asset. The ATO wants to rid citizens of the myth that cryptocurrency profits are tax-free, or that they only need to be declared when cashing back out to fiat money.Loh said the tax office was already aware of who is invested in cryptocurrency thanks to the cooperation it has received from exchanges and banking institutions.“(We) follow the money trail back to the taxpayer and we do that through the ATO which has data matching profiles with cryptocurrency exchanges and they provide that information to us and we use that information to cross match with people’s tax returns,” Loh said.“There isn’t a game of hide and seek. We have got that information and all we are asking people to do is follow the rules. We know most Australians follow the rules,” he added.Loh said he was alarmed by some people’s readiness to ignore tax obligations incurred in the world of cryptocurrency. The ATO will contact 400,000 Australian citizens in 2021 to urge them to review their previously lodged tax returns and to prompt them to report capital gains or losses on crypto trades.As for the process of keeping accurate tax records, Loh said the best practice would be to record every transaction in Australian dollar terms, keeping note of dates, times and wallet addresses.“The best tip to nail your cryptocurrency gains and losses is to keep accurate records including dates of transactions, the value in Australian dollars at the time of the transactions, what the transactions were for, and who the other party was, even if it’s just their wallet address,” said Loh."
16,"Haruhiko Kuroda, governor of the Bank of Japan, has joined the roll call of central bankers taking aim at Bitcoin (BTC) amid the current volatility.According to a report by Bloomberg on Friday, Kuroda argued against the value proposition of the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, stating:The BOJ governor’s criticism comes as Bitcoin experienced an over 50% drawdown from its $64,000 all-time-high price milestone achieved back in mid-April.Indeed, several central bankers have taken Bitcoin’s current price wobble as an occasion to slam BTC and cryptocurrencies in general.Earlier in May, Luis de Guindos, vice president of the European Central Bank, also expressed negative sentiments about Bitcoin. As reported by Cointelegraph at the time, the ECB executive argued that cryptocurrencies had weak fundamentals and did not qualify as a real investment.Recently, Lars Rohde, governor of Denmark’s central bank, dismissed the possibility of cryptocurrencies posing a threat to central bank autonomy. According to Rohde, big tech, not crypto, is the real competitor to gatekeepers of the legacy finance arena.Nobody who bought #bitcoin and Hodled for 4+ years (200 weeks) ever lost money, EVER. https://t.co/oDeJbCC9hW pic.twitter.com/BCK37uTsbFAlso in May, Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, warned that crypto investors were liable to lose all their money. However, as tweeted by PlanB, creator of the Bitcoin stock-to-flow model, long-term BTC “hodling” — owning Bitcoin for at least 200 weeks (four years) — has never resulted in a loss position for owners.In fact, despite Bitcoin’s 50% decline since mid-April, BTC is still up about 22% year-to-date and has returned fourfold gains for holders over the last year. Billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio has even tipped Bitcoin to be a better savings instrument than government bonds.Apart from slamming Bitcoin, Kuroda also echoed the sentiments of other central bankers concerning the potential viability for stablecoins as long as their issuers conform to strict regulatory protocols."
17,"Bitcoin (BTC) led the entire cryptocurrency market through a tumultuous period after the majority of the cryptoverse was painted red on May 19, a day now also referred to as “Black Wednesday.” BTC’s price fell below $40,000 for the first time since it blew past the resistance level on Feb. 9 on the back of the news of Tesla purchasing $1.5 billion worth of BTC while also announcing that it would begin accepting Bitcoin as a payment method.At the time of writing, BTC’s price has slightly rebounded to the $37,000 range, bouncing between the $36,000 and $40,000 marks and failing to break out in either direction.The irony of this crash in the price of the flagship cryptocurrency is that the trigger for the meltdown was Elon Musk opining over concerns of Bitcoin’s energy consumption, and his firm, Tesla, withdrawing its acceptance of Bitcoin as payment. Cointelegraph discussed more on this with the Market Insights team of OKEx, a cryptocurrency exchange. A spokesperson elaborated on these events, saying they were merely triggers to shake an overheated market:Another factor that extended the market crash was China ramping up the ante against Bitcoin mining and trading activities. The news came as part of a general clampdown on illegal activities around securities in a bid to sustain the stability of stocks, bonds and forex markets by the State Council’s Financial Stability and Development Committee.Among many other altcoins impacted, Ether (ETH), the predominant altcoin, took a major hit to its price as well. ETH hit an all-time high of $4,362 on May 12, but following the market-wide bloodbath, the token’s price fell to a 30-day low of $1,922 on May 23, resulting in a 55% price drop. In the rebound that followed, the price grew over 35% to trade in the $2,800 range.Needless to say, both Bitcoin and Ether products dominate the crypto derivatives space due to the sheer prominence of these tokens. While price discovery of an asset is highly dependent on the futures market, unexpected price movements often lead to huge losses for the investors involved.The Bitcoin futures market has seen enormous growth in 2021 along with the increase in the spot price. Open interest in exchange-traded BTC futures hit an all-time high of $27.68 billion on April 13. But amid the market crash, the open interest crashed nearly 58% to reach a 90-day low of $11 billion on May 23.The OKEx Insights team further elaborated, “About $8.61 billion of positions were liquidated across derivatives exchanges on Black Wednesday.” As the result, OI dropped from $2.1 billion to $1.3 billion on OKEx. The spokesperson added, “As of now, no significant rebound in open interest is visible, indicating that the market is lacking confidence.”The open interest in the BTC options market also saw a similar drop on May 23. It reached a 90-day low of $6.66 billion, a 55% drop from its all-time high of $14.77 billion on March 18. Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer of crypto derivatives exchange Deribit, told Cointelegraph:A look at the Deribit Implied Volatility Index (DVOL) provides insight into the forward-looking volatility. It gives the 30-day annualized expectation of volatility. Strijers further elaborated how DVOL could’ve been used as a precursor for the markets. He said, “DVOL would have been a good indication of the turbulence to come. Around midnight on Wednesday preceding the drop, the DVOL started increasing.”The downward trend of BTC’s price can be traced back to May 12, when Bitcoin dove below $50,000. The OKEx Insights spokesperson further commented on this trigger by saying that the tweet by Musk has “struck a lot of fear into the crypto market,” adding, “The premium of quarterly futures declined from 3.5% to less than 1%. This indicated that the futures market was very cautious and did not expect much price appreciation.”On the other hand, OKEx’s long-short ratio, an indicator of retail sentiment for the token, stayed very high leading up to the sell-off triggered on Black Wednesday. This divergence from the usual trend suggests that the price would move in a direction unfavorable to retail investors.Shane Ai, who is responsible for product research and development of crypto derivatives at Bybit — a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange — explained to Cointelegraph:As the cryptoverse sees a much-awaited rebound, Bitcoin and Ether briefly went past the $40,000 and $3,000 mark, respectively, on May 26. Ai further spoke on the factor driving this: “The rebound was catalyzed by enormous spot buying pressure — as seen from Coinbase premiums spiking above 7% as we headed into U.S. trading hours — amidst funding rates sustaining at negative levels over subsequent intervals.”Now another event looms large at the end of May, a major options expiry. A total of 53,400 BTC options expire on Friday, May 28, worth over $2.1 billion, alongside over $880 million worth of ETH contracts. As nearly $3 billion worth of options expire, data suggests that bears dominate this expiry.According to data from CoinOptionsTrack, the max pain price for the BTC options expiry is $50,000. Max pain price is the price where the largest number of options contracts are in loss. The largest open interest comes from put options with a strike price of $50,000 followed by puts with a strike price of $40,000. There could be a slight recovery in prices leading up to the expiry, but the current market sentiment does not back such a move.Strijers further mentioned, “A lot of calls will expire OTM [Out of The Money]; put buyers will see that their hedges or speculative puts have brought the protection they were looking for. An interesting level to monitor could be the 40K level with 2K put open interest.”As the price of Bitcoin currently hovers around the $40,000 range, it will be interesting to watch the aftermath of the expiry and the impact on the price of the asset. As BTC’s volatility hit a 2021 high recently, there is a possibility that further large movements in price can be expected."
18,"While Bitcoin (BTC) increasingly falls under the scrutiny of regulators worldwide, Ark Investment founder and CEO Cathie Wood is confident that regulators will be unable to shut down the world’s largest cryptocurrency.Wood said that Bitcoin is “already on its way and it’ll be impossible to shut it down,” Bloomberg reported on Thursday. Global regulators “will be a little more friendly over time” toward cryptocurrencies due to the fear of missing out on opportunities provided by the industry, she said at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021 conference.The recent regulatory pushback against Bitcoin in Europe, the United States and China contributed to a slump in Bitcoin markets, but the primary trigger for institutions pausing Bitcoin purchases were the mining-related environmental concerns escalated by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, she said.Earlier this month, Musk hinted that he may dump Tesla’s $1.5-billion BTC holdings due to the “rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal.”“Half of the solution is understanding the problem,” Wood said, noting that miners in North America are willing to prioritize renewable sources of energy for Bitcoin mining. This will “bring that topic into stark relief and will encourage an acceleration in the adoption of renewables beyond which otherwise would have taken the place,” she said. Previously, an Ark Investment report stressed that Bitcoin mining can drive investment in solar power and boost renewable energy.Wood’s comments come as Bitcoin failed to hold above $40,000 after rebounding to the price mark on Wednesday. At publishing time, Bitcoin is trading at $36,000, down over 8% on the day."
19,"After a flurry of activity that saw Dogecoin (DOGE) briefly process a higher dollar value of daily transactions than Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) combined, the surge seen on the Dogecoin blockchain appears to be slowing down.Dogecoin’s price increase throughout 2021 has been accompanied by an equally outlandish increase to the value of transactions taking place on its blockchain. The dollar value of DOGE sent from wallet to wallet peaked at $82 billion on May 5, exceeding the $35 billion recorded on Bitcoin and $12 billion on Ethereum.Outdoing the two most well-known blockchains in the world is all the more astonishing, given that Dogecoin handled daily totals as low as $10 million as recently as December 2020. New eyes were brought to Dogecoin in 2021 by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and by the concentrated efforts of social media traders intent on pumping Dogecoin in a manner similar to the shares of gaming retailer GameStop.And while general activity on Dogecoin remains well above December lows, a substantial reversal was witnessed in May, which suggests whales might be tiring of Dogecoin.Dogecoin processed just under $5 billion worth of daily transactions on Wednesday, marking a 93% decrease from the $82-billion all-time high recorded earlier in the month.Meanwhile, DOGE’s average transaction value fell sharply from $1.16 million on Sunday to under $240,000 three days later on Wednesday — a drop of almost 80%. The coin’s oversized average transaction value has persisted for much of the past month despite arriving via a much smaller sample size — a sign that Dogecoin was primarily being used by large account holders.Although the ramping up of activity on the Dogecoin blockchain occurred in spikes scattered throughout the year to date, marked increases to the two metrics mentioned above were witnessed in mid-April as traders began making efforts to artificially pump the value of Dogecoin in the lead up to 4/20 day.The subsequent short-fall in network activity accompanied a 63% drop in the Dogecoin price throughout most of May as it fell from its recent all-time high of $0.73."
20,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) quick run-up above $40,000 during the early New York trading session Thursday lost momentum midway as traders decided to secure short-term profits.The benchmark cryptocurrency shed up to 12.08% after topping out at $40,440 on Coinbase. It reached an intraday low of $36,410 ahead of the London opening bell on Friday, showcasing upside resilience among traders near the $40,000 level.Concerns about stricter crypto market regulations have created headwinds for an otherwise choppy but solid Bitcoin price recovery.In retrospect, the BTC/USD exchange rate had crashed to $30,000 on May 19 after news of China’s ban on crypto transactions hit the wire.In the same week, United States President Joe Biden’s administration targeted regional crypto investors by making it mandatory to report transactions over $10,000 to the Internal Revenue Service, creating more downside pressure on Bitcoin and similar digital assets.So in a time period of 2 weeks @elonmusk @Snowden @china and @POTUS all have a huge influence on #Bitcoin. The environment, security and taxes... Huge drop in value after every message.. Is that a simple coincidence? Or is that a smart plan? Either wat, is opportunity knocking!!Meanwhile, concerns about higher inflation kept Bitcoin from pursuing deeper downside moves. The last big inflation report in the U.S. showed the figures ranging around 4.2%, about 2.2% higher than the Federal Reserve’s expectations.Ideally, that could have prompted the U.S. central bank to taper down its current expansionary policies, but the officials agreed that inflationary spikes were “transitory” in nature.The mixed fundamental signals have pushed Bitcoin’s price into a choppy trading range, with $35,000 acting as interim support and $40,000 serving as interim resistance.Meanwhile, Ark Investment CEO Cathie Wood attempted to calm down fears regarding stricter scrutiny over Bitcoin entities.Speaking at the Consensus 2021 conference earlier this week, the celebrated tech investor said it is impossible to shut down cryptocurrencies, reiterating her views that regulators would eventually need to wrap their minds around blockchain assets.“I think the competitive dynamic in the rest of the world is helping us in the United States. I think it’s been good,” Wood said in an interview last week.On declining institutional investments in the cryptocurrency space, Wood noted that investors had paused their capital flow into Bitcoin and other rival assets over their questionable environmental profile. Elon Musk raised the same issue when his benchmark undertaking Tesla decided to stop taking Bitcoin payments for its electric vehicles.However, the billionaire entrepreneur later backed an alliance of North American crypto miners to track and reduce crypto-related carbon emissions.“Half of the solution is: understanding the problem,” Wood said during her Consensus conference address.She added that institutional buying in the Bitcoin market would resume on the cryptocurrency’s improving green profile.Wood’s Ark increased its Coinbase shares holdings last week, buying another 223,181 units of the stock to push its net exposure to the Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange above $1 billion.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

21,"Retail crypto payment acceptance in the United States continues to grow as Sheetz announces plans to allow the use of digital currencies in its outlets across the country.In a release issued on Thursday, the convenience store chain announced its partnership with digital payments provider Flexa to enable customers to pay for products and services with cryptocurrencies.As part of the announcement, Sheetz revealed that the crypto payment option was for both in-store items and gas pumps at their over 600 outlets across Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and West Virginia.Cryptocurrencies that will be accepted by the convenience store chain include Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE), among others.The company’s crypto payment adoption move is also an extension of its business relationship with point-of-sale payment provider NCR.Apart from enabling Bitcoin and crypto payment, Sheetz also plans to allow customers to link their Flexa-enabled payment apps with the company’s loyalty reward program.Indeed, crypto is seeing significant adoption in the rebates and loyalty rewards arena, with digital currencies being seen as viable for rewarding patrons.The Sheetz announcement now adds convenience stores to the growing list of businesses accepting crypto payments in the United States. Back in March, luxury hotel brand The Kessler Collection debuted crypto and stablecoin payment options for guests.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, a Mastercard survey from earlier in May revealed that up to 40% of respondents across the globe expressed interest to use crypto for payments in 2022.Indeed, retail crypto payment adoption has been on the rise in recent times, with payment giant PayPal entering the fray back in 2020. In March, the company began allowing U.S. customers to pay with Bitcoin for online shopping.By April, PayPal was forecasting its crypto commerce revenue exceeding $200 million in only a few months of deploying cryptocurrency payment solutions."
22,"At a 279th meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee in Abuja, Central Bank of Nigeria Governor Godwin Emefiele expressed confidence that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) will be legal in the country, Business Insider reported on Wednesday.Emefiele did not directly mention a decision to reverse the CBN’s February ban of institutions from buying and selling crypto but noted that the bank has been investigating the industry:Emefiele also said the Nigerian government will do its best to prevent crypto from being used to finance illicit activities. “We found out that a substantial percentage of our people are getting involved in cryptocurrency, which is not the best. Don’t get me wrong, some may be legitimate, but most are illegitimate,” he said.The banker also expressed concerns over the crypto market crash in mid-May, which has been largely attributed to Tesla’s decision to suspend Bitcoin payments for its cars and Elon Musk’s further criticism of BTC:“We saw the market collapse. Initially, when Elon Musk tweeted around the time when we said our banking and payment facilities are no longer available for cryptocurrency transactions, and he tweeted that he will invest $1.5 billion, and the price went up. He now tweeted and raised a few concerns, and the thing plunged.”The CBN did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.As previously reported, Nigeria has emerged as the biggest source of Bitcoin trading volume in Africa as of August 2020, also becoming one of the fastest-growing crypto markets in the world. According to data from Bitcoin P2P marketplace Paxful, Nigeria ranked second only to the United States in trading volume as of December 2020.Amid the growing adoption of Bitcoin, Nigeria’s national currency, the naira, has been falling. “Bitcoin has made our currency almost useless or valueless,” Senator Sani Musa of the Niger East Senatorial District said in February. Following Emefiele’s latest remarks, the naira dropped 1.2% to near a three-and-half year low on the black market on Thursday."
23,"This weekly roundup of news from Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong attempts to curate the industry’s most important news, including influential projects, changes in the regulatory landscape and enterprise blockchain integrations.Normally, this weekly column takes a broad look at all the developments, news and even gossip from within China. This week, most topics took a backseat to the news of another crackdown that had rippled through the industry, threatening to topple markets into a full-blown bear market.It was all fun and games until a ruling came down from the top. Liu He, who is Vice Premier of China and member of the all-powerful eight-person politburo, led a meeting on preventing and controlling financial risks. Among the decisions was a crackdown on Bitcoin mining and trading activities, putting a dagger through the heart of anyone hoping to see a more open regulatory environment. There were immediate signs that the ruling would not be taken lightly, with the province of Inner Mongolia setting up a reporting hotline to rat out people disobeying the order.BTC.TOP, one of the largest mining pools in the world with a reported 2.5% of the global hash rate, immediately complied by announcing it was closing down operations. That didn’t stop BTC.TOP founder Jiang Zhuo from taking to micro-blogging platform Weibo to announce that Bitcoin was a tool China could use to break up the monopoly of the United States dollar in international trade.China’s role in the mining community had been a major source of distrust between East and West, with some Bitcoiners claiming that China’s possible control of the mining community could threaten the ability of the chain to remain fully decentralized. Consequently, some celebrated the news of the ban, thinking that the mining community would become more fragmented. However, just because China is banning operations doesn’t mean that Chinese companies will lose their dominant position in the industry. As Primitive Capital partner Dovey Wan pointed out, many miners are simply packing up and moving out of the country. Registering and basing their operations in regions like the U.S., Kazakhstan or even Africa wouldn’t actually stop the mined Bitcoin (BTC) from belonging to Chinese miners — it would just make the centralization of the network harder to actually track.Exchanges and trading platforms haven’t been greatly affected so far. In 2017, when exchanges were first targeted by regulations, the impact was much higher since many of the leading exchanges were registered in China. Nowadays, platforms are all domiciled in other countries, have offshore servers, and cater to much more diverse user bases. Local authorities will have much less interest in interfering with these operations since the impact on Chinese society is much less obvious. Huobi temporarily suspended futures trading to Chinese users, but it doesn’t look to be a permanent change to how it operates. Futures platform Bybit revealed it will have closed accounts registered with Chinese phone numbers by June 15, but since most of its users are non-Chinese, the negative impact will be much less than the risk it would be taking on by continuing to serve Chinese users.This seems like a winning situation for China, as it can get closer to its carbon-neutral goals by reducing the amount of Bitcoin mines. At the same time, it’s also cementing eCNY as the country’s only digital asset. Finally, profits from mining and exchanges will probably still trickle back to the mainland, as offices of exchanges and mining operations are unlikely to follow the hardware out of the country.Hong Kong is pushing forward with its ban on retail cryptocurrency trading by announcing measures that would place a minimum threshold of around $1 million on investment. Christopher Hui, Hong Kong’s Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, has defended the requirements, stating he believes they protect investors, prohibit market manipulation, and guard against money laundering and terrorist financing. The decision will definitely make cryptocurrency in the special administrative region easier to track and make it harder for citizens in mainland China to circumvent the rules."
24,"Price action for Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider cryptocurrency market was relatively subdued on May 27 as nervous traders remain unsure of what comes next following last week’s market plunge that saw leveraged traders wiped out as BTC dipped as low as $30,000 before its price rebounded. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that while Bitcoin's price has managed to put in higher highs and higher lows over the past week, bulls continue to face stiff resistance at any meaningful attempt to break above $40,000 as bears defend the psychologically important level.For many traders, the recent correction likely triggered PTSD-like flashbacks of the market crash of 2017 and 2018 and the ensuing two-year crypto winter, and this could be a reason why the market seems indecisive at the moment.Given that many traders are unsure of what might come next for Bitcoin's price, it's wise to consider the various bullish and bearish scenarios that could play out and to also take stock of the opinions of analysts in the sector.According to David Lifchitz, managing partner and chief investment officer at ExoAlpha, it's important to look closely at the recent market events and review the catalysts that created the current situation.Lifchitz told Cointelegraph that following an “almost uninterrupted bull run from $10,000 in October 2020 to an all-time high for BTC at $65,000 in mid-April 2021,” the market saw several waves of profit-taking ahead of the “great deleveraging of 2021,” which saw the price of BTC fall by 54% to $30,000, while Ether (ETH) and altcoins were hit even harder.According to Lifchitz, the correction succeeded in ""drastically reducing the amount of leverage that prevailed in the ecosystem,"" which can be seen as a healthy development for the overall market, as it will help ""to build on a more stable base.""Lifchitz cautioned that while data shows that some early dip-buyers managed to pick up tokens near the lows, both volumes and futures open interest have remained weak, “showing no urgency to reload.""The monthly options expiration for Bitcoin and Ether are less than 24 hours away, and Lifchitz believes they are standing in the way of “any meaningful move in the very short term.” He also suggested that it will be “difficult to convince burned investors to get back in the game just now” due to a lack of upside catalyst and the recent reminder that “prices do not always go up.”This has put the market in a “wait-and-see phase,” according to Lifchitz, with both trend followers and contrarian investors needing “to see some motion, either up or down” before they engage in the market.Lifchitz said:While the average crypto trader is currently in a state of stasis and awaiting the next major market move to signal what BTC might do next, on-chain data indicates bullish moves from larger players who took full advantage of the recent dip by buying.According to Micah Spruill, managing partner and chief investment officer at S2F Capital, most of the selling that was seen at the recent lows “has been from newer entrants to the market” who have “been selling at a loss and seem to be exhausted at this point.”In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Spruill pointed to BTC net transfer volume, which shows that following the bearish downturn between May 17 and 20, “Massive amounts of USDC and USDT have been sent to exchanges (to buy BTC, ETH, etc.) and pull them off to long term storage.”Further analysis shows that retail wallets holding between 0.1 and 1 BTC, as well as whale wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC, have been accumulating at these levels in preparation for an overall move higher.Another bullish indicator mentioned by Spruill is entities' net growth, which ""is recovering back to prior levels” and may signal that “the bull market is back in full force” if this trend continues over the next few weeks and the metric resumes its highs.Overall, Spruill sees a positive move for BTC in the future, although the timing is questionable due to a variety of factors.Spruill said:The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and you should conduct your own research when making a decision."
25,"The first step to successful trading is the identification of medium- and short-term trends. Traders who remain on the right side of the trend and use risk management principles usually end up earning profits. An equally important activity in the trading process is calculating the entry.Many times, traders are afraid to pull the trigger in the optimal moment and end up missing a large part of the rally. As they see the markets move higher from the sidelines, the urge to buy keeps increasing, and many times, they end up buying near the top.To avoid such mistakes, it is important to devise an easy system for purchasing. Every trader wants to buy low and sell high, but that is easier said than done. Instead, traders should focus on capturing a major portion of the rally by taking the least possible risk. Let’s learn some easy strategies for doing this.Although the price action in a range-bound market is volatile and random, it can still be traded. If the ranges are too tight, it is better to sit on the sidelines instead of trying to trade choppy price action.On the other hand, if the range is well-defined and large, as in the above example, traders may try to trade it. The easy method is to buy on a rebound off the support and book profits near the resistance of the range. The stops for such trades can be kept just below the support of the range.The larger the number of touches both on the support and resistance of the range, the better it is to trade because the possibility of whipsaws are less. Usually, every range-bound action is followed by a strong bullish or bearish move. Hence, when the trend changes, traders should alter their trading strategy accordingly.After a bull trend starts, the asset continues to make higher highs and higher lows. Traders who keep waiting to buy on a significant correction miss the bus. Therefore, when the trader identifies an upsloping 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) and 50-day simple moving average (SMA), it is time to look for an entry opportunity.Binance Coin (BNB) started its uptrend in February when the moving averages began to slope up and the relative strength index (RSI) sustained in the overbought territory.After the trend is established, traders should wait for a low-risk opportunity to buy. In an uptrend, the 20-day EMA acts as a strong support. Therefore, traders can wait for the price to dip and rebound off the 20-day EMA before buying. This gives a low-risk buying opportunity, as the stop-loss can be placed just below the 20-day EMA or the swing low.In the above chart, ellipses are used to mark the points where traders could have purchased. The price dipped to the 20-day EMA on six occasions, which could have been good entry points. However, on one of the trades, the stops could have hit.On March 25, the price broke below the 20-day EMA and the swing low was made on March 16. This could have hit the stops of short-term traders. However, the bears could not sustain the price below the 20-day EMA because the bulls bought the dips to the 50-day SMA.The price quickly rose above the 20-day EMA on March 27, indicating resumption of the uptrend. In such cases, traders can either buy on a close above the 20-day EMA or the most recent swing high because it signals that bulls are back in command.Let’s investigate a few more examples.Bitcoin’s (BTC) chart above is a good example of how traders who bought the bounce off the 20-day EMA (entries marked using arrows) would have hit their stops just a few days later as the price broke below the 20-day EMA and the swing low where the stops may have been kept.This shows there is no fool-proof entry opportunity, and traders should be willing to buy again at higher prices if the uptrend resumes.In all three cases, the price took support close to the 50-day SMA and bounced back above the 20-day EMA. This was a signal to traders that the trend has resumed. This is generally a good entry point as the stop-loss is well defined and the profit potential is high. On all three occasions, the trade turned out to be profitable.During vertical rallies, the momentum is so strong that the price does not correct to the 20-day EMA. In such cases, if traders keep waiting for the entry near the 20-day EMA, they can miss the entire rally.Therefore, when trading coins that are witnessing a strong vertical rally, traders can reduce the period of the exponential moving average to 10. By doing that, two entry opportunities open up, which offer a good risk-to-reward ratio for traders.After the trend changes direction to a downtrend, the moving averages tend to act as points of resistance.Bitcoin’s 2018 bear market is a good example to understand how moving averages behave in a downtrend. Each of the relief rallies halted near the 20-day EMA, indicating the bears were shorting when the price reached this resistance.After the downtrend was established, there were two occasions when the price rose above the 50-day SMA. Note that before this happened, the RSI dipped close to the oversold territory, which may have attracted counter-trend traders.In Ether’s (ETH) bear market during 2018, see how the price remained below the 50-day SMA from June until the end of the year. The relief rallies reversed direction from either the 20-day EMA or the 50-day SMA.Most times, the best entries also fail and the stop loss orders are hit. After experiencing a string of losses, novice traders often become discouraged and do not buy at higher levels, instead waiting to buy at the same level their stops were hit or lower. Because of this, they miss a large part of the uptrend.In a bull phase, traders should be ready to buy when the trend resumes. Treat each trade as a fresh one, and do not be fixated on the profit or loss realized on the previous ones.Each coin’s behavior is different; therefore, traders should alter the periods of the moving averages to suit the coin and then devise entry points accordingly."
26,"The U.K bank with the worst record for dealing with scam complaints has issued a cryptocurrency scam alert.NatWest, which was rated as the worst U.K bank for accurately discerning legitimate fraud complaints in 2020, sent the warning to users of its mobile banking app after it reportedly received a record number of scam reports between January and March 2021.The warning made particular note of one type of scam which involves hackers installing remote access software on a victim’s computer or hardware. The trick usually sees criminals winning a victim’s trust online, either by posing as an experienced trader, or pretending to be a celebrity, according to reports. The victim is then persuaded to install a cryptocurrency wallet and is urged to invest. After a certain amount of crypto is sent to the wallet, the criminal empties it via the malicious software they installed.Head of fraud prevention at NatWest, Jason Costain, said increased interest in cryptocurrency had created an opportunity for criminals to exploit, and urged customers to be wary of fake websites and celebrity endorsements.“We have prevented millions of pounds from being sent to crypto-criminals who are exploiting the high levels of interest in the currency. However, consumers should always be alert, especially to the use of fake websites and bogus celebrity endorsements,” said Costain.Ironically, data from the U.K’s financial ombudsman for the year ending May 2020 revealed NatWest to be the worst bank for accurately dealing with fraud complaints from its customers.According to the data, almost 70% of NatWest’s adjudications in such instances proved to be wrong between 2019 and 2020, as evidenced by the fact that the national regulator went on to have the decisions overturned. One year earlier, the figure was as high as 87%."
27,"Bitcoin (BTC) may get a boost to finally clear $40,000 at the expense of the U.S. dollar as United States President Joe Biden's new $6 trillion federal spending budget proposal is unveiled.On May 28, the United States president will announce the massive fiscal policy, the largest since the Second World War, to ensure investments in major infrastructure, education and healthcare projects, reported The New York Times on May 27.Biden reportedly wants the federal government to spend $6 trillion in 2022. He also plans to raise the total spending to $8.2 trillion by 2031.Biden had earlier proposed significant tax hikes on America's richest companies and individuals to fund his massive spending program. But it would take the government at least until 2030 to shrink its budget deficits, the Times reported. That means the United States would face a monumental debt burden as it borrows money to finance Biden's record proposal.The scenario, per recent history, serves as an ideal bullish backstop for Bitcoin. The decentralized cryptocurrency rallied 1,582% from its $3,858 low in March 2020 as the U.S. government ramped up spending to unprecedented levels to combat the coronavirus pandemic.On the other hand, the U.S. dollar strength index (DXY), which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of top foreign currencies, crashed by up to 13.38% after topping out in March 2020 amid the global market crash.Meanwhile, Anthony ""Pomp"" Pompliano, a well-renowned Bitcoin lobbyist and founder of Pomp Investments, predicts further declines in dollar bids.""The government is proposing to push our country further into debt while simultaneously destroying the value of our currency,"" Pompliano said. ""Historians will write that the government accelerated the destruction of the world reserve currency as the citizens cheered them on.""Other analysts also jumped in to propose Bitcoin — with its fixed supply — as a remedy against a steepening U.S. debt curve.US President Joe Biden set to announce $6 Trillion budget.

28,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been a hot topic of discussion lately even for those outside the core crypto community, but unfortunately, it’s not for the best of reasons. In particular, the amount of energy required to mine Bitcoin has created concerns for investors who were considering BTC as an option to diversify. According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, Bitcoin currently consumes around 110 terawatt-hours per year. A Harvard Business Review article further noted that this equates to 0.55% of global electricity production, which is roughly equivalent to that of a small county.Although this is the case, it’s important to point out that any industry that adds value to society will likely have an environmental impact. Yet with the rise of global warming and other environmental concerns today, it’s become crucial for the crypto sector to recognize the amount of energy consumption required to mine Bitcoin. As this concern is brought to fruition, individuals within the cryptocurrency community can then come up with solutions to combat this challenge moving forward.Influential executives and crypto investors like Elon Musk and Michael Saylor continue to highlight Bitcoin’s energy consumption challenges on Twitter in order to raise awareness for the future of Bitcoin. Most recently, Musk and Saylor announced the formation of a Bitcoin Mining Council, which consists of several industry leaders who will ultimately enable sustainable Bitcoin mining initiatives.While this is a step in the right direction, it may take years for this Bitcoin Mining Council to make a real impact. Jesse Morris, chief commercial officer of Energy Web — a blockchain protocol designed to facilitate application development for the energy sector — told Cointelegraph that while it’s encouraging that Musk and Saylor are tweeting about a new Bitcoin Mining Council, actions must be taken immediately.Morris explained that Energy Web is currently working directly with a number of Bitcoin miners to build software that leverages blockchain technology to detect in near real-time the carbon footprint of the Bitcoin network. Morris noted:Morris further believes that a near-term solution to begin enabling a greener Bitcoin network could be through the development of carbon-neutral exchange-traded funds.Although carbon-neutral ETFs may sound like a foreign concept, some investment management firms have already taken steps to ensure just this. For example, Toronto-based Ninepoint Partners LP is an independent investment management firm with about $6.5 billion in assets under management. Alex Tapscott, managing director of digital assets at Ninepoint, told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin makes up a good portion of the assets under the firm’s management. “Crypto assets are a fast-growing and important asset class for us,” he noted.Ninepoint created a Bitcoin Trust that went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange in January of this year. The Bitcoin Trust was then converted to an ETF on May 6. Following the news of Ninepoint’s Bitcoin ETF, Tapscott explained that the firm decided to offset 100% of its fund’s carbon footprint to ensure that interested investors receive green exposure to Bitcoin:According to Tapscott, Ninepoint is partnering with a number of initiatives to help ensure the firm’s green Bitcoin ETF. For example, Ninepoint is working with the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute, a research company focused on the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies, along with CarbonX, an environmental software fintech firm.Lena Klaassen, co-founder of the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute, told Cointelegraph that the firm uses its own methodologies and research to compute the best estimate of the real carbon footprint of the Bitcoin network. Together with CarbonX, the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute reports to Ninepoint regarding its ETF’s share of the Bitcoin network. CarbonX then uses its Zerofootprint practice, which supplies the commensurate volumes of CO2e, or carbon dioxide equivalent, to counterbalance the pollution.While Tapscott was unable to disclose specific numbers regarding the fund’s carbon footprint, he explained that this is mainly because the assets under management fluctuate as new investors come in and as the price of Bitcoin changes. “The energy footprint of Bitcoin changes with its hashing rate. This is a moving target that we adjust monthly to reflect these changes,” he remarked.Even with market fluctuations and the cost of offsetting the carbon footprint being funded entirely by Ninepoint, Tapscott noted that the firm views this as the right thing to do, both for the future of the company and for the entire crypto sector at large. Tapscott said:While there are still very few crypto-asset management investment firms that have pledged to go green, efforts of some firms could very well create a powerful movement.Shortly after Ninepoint announced its green Bitcoin ETF, One River Digital Asset Management filed for a carbon-neutral ETF. One River declined to speak with Cointelegraph about the matter, yet Tapscott noted that he hopes Ninepoint’s green initiative serves as a model for the entire industry.Although it’s hard to predict the future of the crypto space, it’s encouraging to see that BitMEX, a crypto derivatives trading platform, also recently announced the decision to go carbon neutral. In addition, Marathon Digital Holdings, a United States-based enterprise Bitcoin mining company, revealed plans to achieve 70% of carbon neutrality. Klaassen added that the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute is now seeing a trend for BTC mining companies — especially ones that are publicly traded — to assess their own Scope 1,2 and 3 emissions in order to address them.Paul Brody, blockchain lead at Ernst & Young, further told Cointelegraph that carbon-neutral mining operations are definitely possible. “If you plan to only hold the Bitcoin you mine in a carbon-neutral operation, you have a green solution,” he said.However, Brody pointed out that if someone were to transact with Bitcoin, one may not be able to know for sure that the transaction will be processed by a carbon-neutral miner. Brody said:While Bitcoin ETFs, investment management firms and mining companies continue to pledge to go carbon neutral, a longer-term solution is still needed in order for a green Bitcoin to become a lasting reality.For the long term, Morris believes that accords that adhere to official standards must be established. In order to ensure this, Energy Web recently launched its Crypto Climate Accord, which Morris noted has 45 supporters consisting of miners, crypto investors, foundations, exchanges and more. The goal of the Accord is to make Bitcoin entirely renewable by focusing on two aspects.Morris mentioned that the Accord aims to raise awareness around “greenwashing.” According to Morris, “clean crypto funds” are cause for skepticism, as blockchain networks that don’t use a traditional proof-of-work consensus do not consume anywhere near the amount of energy as Bitcoin does.As such, Morris believes that the conversation around energy conservation should be focused on Bitcoin specifically. Morris also explained that the Crypto Climate Accord will take steps to help large scale institutional and retail investors make their Bitcoin green by bringing radical transparency to the Bitcoin network.However, a challenge that still needs to be addressed is the development of standards. According to Morris, Energy Web is currently looking into developing a global standard for tracking Bitcoin’s carbon footprint.In addition, the crypto community must also continuously work toward an environmentally friendly solution for Bitcoin. Bill Tapscott, chief operating officer of CarbonX, told Cointelegraph that “although a carbon-neutral path has been set forth, the crypto community itself has to embrace a responsibility to transition to a lower-carbon world.”"
29,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission is looking to cooperate with Congress and other regulators to increase its oversight of cryptocurrency exchanges.Gary Gensler, the newly appointed chairman of the SEC, said that the commission is looking forward to working with fellow regulators and Congress to fill gaps in investor protection in crypto markets. The official announced the plans at a Wednesday hearing before the Financial Services and General Government subcommittee of the House of Representatives.Gensler said that the SEC needs to provide similar protections for crypto exchanges that an investor would get on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq:The new SEC head also outlined some of the challenges to regulating the cryptocurrency industry, stating that the SEC is “under-resourced” in financial terms when compared with some of the big players in the industry. “We only spend about 16% or 17% of our budget, about $325 million a year, on technology, which is less than probably some large firms spend in a month. Some of them even spend that much in two weeks,” he noted.Gensler previously suggested that the SEC should be cooperating with Congress to properly address crypto exchange regulation in a market volatility-related hearing of the House Financial Services Committee in early May.Last week, Michael Hsu, the new head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, announced that the agency has been in talks with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation about setting up an “interagency policy sprint team” focused exclusively on crypto."
30,"Among the many complications associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), a lack of knowledge and understanding of crypto is the biggest obstacle for wider adoption, according to a new survey.The Economist Intelligence Unit, the research and analysis division of the Economist Group, released a new report called “Digimentality 2021.”The study was commissioned by major payment and cryptocurrency platform Crypto.com and contains a consumer survey of 3,053 people conducted from February to March 2021.According to survey results, 51% of respondents said a lack of knowledge is the main barrier to the adoption of open-source cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether (ETH), while 34% of survey participants cited security concerns as the main obstacle, and 29% indicated difficulties in knowing where to buy crypto.In terms of crypto acceptance by institutional investors and corporate treasuries, 47% of respondents said that overall market trust or understanding of digital currencies was the biggest adoption obstacle. Some 32% of survey takers cited cryptocurrency regulations as a primary obstacle to wider institutional acceptance, while 43% and 36% said financial market structures and asset volatility were the foremost obstacle, respectively.The survey also stated that 55% of respondents were aware of cryptocurrencies despite never owning or using them. “As more people adopt and have access to digital wallets, you can just see the number who have access and invest in cryptocurrencies continues to broaden,” Goldman Sachs global head of digital assets Mathew McDermott said in the report.According to a recent survey by Gemini crypto exchange, nearly two-thirds of adults in the United States are interested in learning more about cryptocurrencies or holding them soon."
31,"The amount of Bitcoin (BTC) held by whales increased by around 14% after Tesla announced its foray into the cryptocurrency sector in early February 2021.The latest data from on-chain analytics platform Glassnode shows an inflow of roughly $19.5 billion worth of Bitcoin — according to current exchange rates — into wallets that hold at least 100 BTC and a maximum of 1,000 BTC. The deposits spiked right after Tesla revealed in its January securities filings that it had added $1.5 billion worth of BTC to its balance sheet.The news hit the wire on Feb. 8 when the cost to purchase one Bitcoin was as low as $38,057 on Coinbase. The rates had shot up to $65,000 by mid-April, driven higher by bulls expecting Tesla’s involvement in the cryptocurrency sector to influence more corporates into adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets.Honestly, I’m not surprised that Tesla bought #Bitcoin and I won’t be surprised when Apple and Microsoft do it. Having $BTC is just common sense at this point.The adoption prospects for Bitcoin among corporates and other institutions boomed because of the cryptocurrency’s anti-inflation narrative. Many speculators projected Bitcoin as an insurance against the Federal Reserve’s expansionary monetary policies that sapped investors’ appetite for traditional safe havens like the United States government bonds and the U.S. dollar.Tesla, in its first-quarter filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, also noted that it wanted to buy Bitcoin by utilizing its unused cash reserve worth $1.5 billion, hinting that the electric carmaker was looking to offset potential dollar devaluation risks.The entire Tesla episode served as a bullish cue for investors looking to maximize their returns from the Bitcoin bull run. The Glassnode metric showed that the Bitcoin supply held by 100–1,000 BTC wallets was stable before Tesla’s announcement but spiked dramatically after it.However, another Glassnode metric, which measures the Bitcoin supply held by wallets with a 1,000–10,000 BTC balance, illustrated a steady decline — from around 455,000 BTC (~$17.88 billion) to roughly 410,000 BTC (~$16.11 billion).The outcome revealed that bigger whales sold their Bitcoin holdings following Tesla’s announcement. As a result, they became part of the 100–1,000 BTC supply group.Meanwhile, the sell-off from the 1,000–10,000 BTC supply group did little in offsetting the Bitcoin bull run. The cryptocurrency approached its all-time high of $65,000, indicating smaller whales and retail traders absorbed the selling pressure from bigger investors.Bitcoin is trading around $39,300 at time of writing, down roughly 38% from its record peak in mid-April."
32,"Castle Island Ventures’ Nic Carter doesn’t think Elon Musk is the right person to lead the “clean Bitcoin“ debate, “possibly not as far as the Bitcoin community is concerned.” He told Bloomberg, “Bitcoiners are still intensely skeptical of Musk, and they view him as conflicted, given that his business partially involves the sale of offsets.”However, asking for Bitcoin miners to be more transparent about their energy mix is a good proposal no matter who it’s coming from, Carter stressed, alluding to the recently formed Bitcoin Mining Council. Bitcoin (BTC) is a decentralized synthetic commodity that is very resistant to regulation, he noted. If you ban Bitcoin in one jurisdiction, the hash power will just flow to a new jurisdiction. There will be no shortage of friendlier jurisdictions even if individual countries do ban it.Instead of banning Bitcoin due to its energy consumption, Carter suggests policymakers should create greener grids for Bitcoin mining. North American Bitcoin miners are cleaner than many other industrial consumers of electricity. Carter believes this is why the idea of miners being more transparent about the kind of energy they are using is going to vindicate them.Carter also doesn’t seem to be convinced on the “Bitcoin is used for money laundering” narrative. Any monetary system is always going to be used for crime, he stated, noting that the United States dollar is used for illicit purposes far more often than Bitcoin.Associating Bitcoin with criminal activities is a curious angle, according to Carter, “since we didn’t ban the U.S. dollar because Pablo Escobar had heaps of dollars in his basement.”The Bitcoin Mining Council was established following a meeting between Musk and leading Bitcoin miners in North America brokered by MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor. The council’s primary goal is to promote transparent energy use and accelerate sustainability initiatives worldwide, Saylor tweeted."
33,"On Wednesday, the bullish momentum that had propelled Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins into a relief rally was somewhat subdued, as traders remain unsure of what may happen next. After an early morning attempt by Bitcoin bulls to drive BTC’s price above $40,000 was met with stiff resistance, the digital asset lost momentum and slumped back to the $38,000 support level.Despite the continued struggle, a few positive signs such as a decline in BTC exchange deposits and an uptrend in addresses accumulating Bitcoin suggest that bears have stopped selling and the worst of the downturn may have passed.Earlier in the day, Ether (ETH) also rallied close to the $3,000 level, but the pullback in BTC price saw the top altcoin fall below $2,800.While a majority of the cryptocurrencies are well below recently established highs, Polygon’s (MATIC) price bucked the trend by seeking out a clear V-shaped recovery. The altcoin rallied higher today as the project announced the launch of its SDK stack that will allow developers to easily deploy their own Ethereum-connected blockchains.Since Tuesday, MATIC has rallied 50% from a low of $1.51 to an intraday high at $2.44 on Wednesday.According to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro, market conditions for MATIC have been favorable for some time.The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for MATIC has been in the green zone for most of the past week, and it registered a high of 94 several times on Tuesday, around seven hours before the price increased 50% over the next day.Other notable altcoin performances include an 89% gain for Skale Network (SKL) and a 67% rally from Enjin Coin (ENJ). Origin Protocol also gained 53%.The overall cryptocurrency market capitalization now stands at $1.7 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 42.5%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

34,"A total of 53,400 Bitcoin (BTC) options are set to expiry on Friday. At first sight, bulls appear to lead as the $2.1-billion open interest call (buy) to put (sell) options ratio stands at 1.32, favoring the neutral-to-bullish derivatives.However, after Bitcoin dropped 33% in May, the right to acquire BTC at $46,000 and above is essentially worthless since there is less than 38 hours left before expiry.On May 20, Cointelegraph reported that “May 28 will be no different with $1.95 billion open interest. While it seems premature to call it, bears will likely continue to pressure markets, considering there are almost no call options at $38,000 or lower for next week.”After a brief retrace above $42,000 on May 20, Bitcoin entered another correction after a government statement from China revealed plans to “crackdown on Bitcoin mining and trading behavior and resolutely prevent the transmission of individual risk.”On Sunday, the Huobi exchange reportedly suspended futures trading in mainland China, causing further havoc and pushing Bitcoin below $32,000.As expected, bears continued to have the advantage from the previous week and have still been able to pin Bitcoin’s price below $42,000. For the neutral-to-bullish call options, there is not much gain in rolling over a losing position to the following week, so bulls will face an uphill battle going into Friday’s expiry.The previous week’s expiry gains created room for the bears to further place bets on Bitcoin’s price remaining below $45,000 or $50,000.Take notice of how there are only 2,550 BTC call options at $42,000 or lower, representing a mere 8% of the outstanding. This notional is equivalent to a $100-million open interest. As explained earlier, the call (buy) options at $46,000 and higher are already worthless.Meanwhile, bears hit another home run as most bets were placed at $36,000 and higher. The 17,600 BTC put (sell) options above such a level represent a $685-million open interest, giving the neutral-to-bearish derivatives a $585-million advantage.It is worth noting that BTC’s regular spot exchange volumes have been trading over $10 billion per day. However, the fact that the futures and options expiry happens simultaneously can accentuate volatility.Keep in mind that futures contract buyers and sellers are matched at all times. Thus, trying to predict which side will exert more pressure is a futile effort.Deribit, OKEx and Bit.com expiries take place on Friday at 8:00 am UTC. The CME futures and options happen a little later on the day at 3:00 pm UTC.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

35,"A strong bull market tends to attract speculators and newbie traders who hop on to the rally with an aim to get rich quickly. In their eagerness to earn huge profits, traders throw caution out of the window and take on excessive leverage. While this strategy is fruitful during the asset’s up-move, sharp corrections wipe out most accounts due to the use of massive leverage.Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent market drop below $30,000 caused the Bitcoin futures open interest to plummet from $27 billion to $11 billion. This suggests that several leveraged traders would have taken a huge hit. Although painful, these corrections reduce greed and the asset transfers from weak hands to strong hands who venture out to buy when the sentiment is negative.While many investors are watching the price behavior of Bitcoin to gauge whether the downtrend is over, Ether (ETH) has gradually been covering ground quickly. According to CoinGecko, Ether’s 24-hour trade volume at $60 billion overtook Bitcoin’s at $50 billion.Another positive sign in favor of Ether is that the Grayscale Ethereum Trust’s price is trading at an 11% premium to Ether's spot price, indicating strong demand from institutional investors. In comparison, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust price still trades at a discount to Bitcoin.This suggests that traders should keep an eye on both Bitcoin and Ether to confirm that a bottom is in place. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot any signs of a bottoming formation.Bitcoin broke above the downtrend line on May 24, which suggests strong buying at lower levels. The bears tried to pull the price back below the downtrend line on May 25 but failed.The relief rally rose to $40,841 today but the long wick on the candlestick suggests selling at higher levels. The downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($43,967) and the relative strength index (RSI) below 38 suggest advantage to the bears.If the price turns down from the current level, the bears will try to pull the price down to $34,000. This is an important support to watch because if it cracks, the BTC/USDT pair could retest the critical support at $30,000.On the upside, the bulls will have to push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA to gain the upper hand. If they manage to do that, the pair could rally to $50,000.Ether’s pullback has risen above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $2,738.74 today, indicating aggressive buying at lower levels. However, the bears are trying to stall the relief rally near the moving averages.If the price turns down from the current level, the bears will try to resume the downtrend. The first support on the downside is $2,378.54 and then $2,079.94. If the price rebounds off this support, the pair could remain range-bound for a few days.But if the bears sink and sustain the price below $2,000, the ETH/USDT pair could retest the critical support at $1,728.74.Contrary to this assumption, if buyers push the price above the 20-day EMA ($2,936), the pair could rally to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,362.72. Such a move will indicate the short-term downtrend is over.After hesitating near the $348.70 resistance on May 25, Binance Coin (BNB) cleared the hurdle today. This has opened the gates for a move to $428. However, the bears may not give up easily and they are likely to mount a stiff resistance between $428 and the 20-day EMA ($444).If the price turns down from $428 but does not break the $348.70 support, the BNB/USDT pair could start an up-move that could reach the 50-day simple moving average ($523) and then to $600.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance and slips below $348.70, the pair could correct to $257.40. Such a move will suggest that bears continue to sell at higher levels and that could delay the confirmation of a bottom.Cardano (ADA) formed a Doji candlestick pattern on May 25 as the bears defended the 20-day EMA ($1.64). The uncertainty resolved to the upside today and buyers have pushed the price above the 20-day EMA.The bulls will now try to push the ADA/USDT pair to $2 and then to the all-time high at $2.47. A break above this resistance could signal the start of the next leg of the uptrend. However, the flat 20-day EMA and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a few days of range-bound action.If the price turns down from $2, the pair could drop to $1.55. A strong rebound off this level could keep the pair range-bound between $1.55 and $2 for a few days. A wider range could develop if the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA ($1.47).A tough battle is waging between the bulls and the bears near the downtrend line. Although the bulls had pushed Dogecoin (DOGE) above the downtrend line on May 25, they could not sustain the higher levels.If the bears pull the price back below the downtrend line, it will suggest selling on every minor rally. The bears will then try to sink the price to $0.25 and then retest the panic low formed on May 19 at $0.21.The gradually downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.40) and the RSI below 46 suggest the bears are in control. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the current level and rises above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rally to $0.47.The bulls pushed XRP above the $0.88 resistance on May 24, suggesting the start of the relief rally. The bears tried to sink the price back below $0.88 on May 25 but failed. This indicates the bulls are trying to flip $0.88 to support.The XRP/USDT pair could rally to the 20-day EMA ($1.19), which is likely to act as a stiff resistance. If the price turns down from this resistance, the bears will again try to break the $0.88 support.If they manage to do that, the pair could retest the May 23 low at $0.65. If this support also cracks, the pair could extend the decline to $0.56.Conversely, if the bulls successfully defend the $0.88 support during the next dip, the pair could rise above the moving averages and rally to the downtrend line. A breakout of this resistance could start the next leg of the up-move.The bulls are attempting to push Polkadot (DOT) to the overhead resistance at $26.50. This level may act as a stiff resistance but if the bulls can scale this wall, the altcoin could rally to the 20-day EMA ($30.42).The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative territory suggest bears are in command. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will try to pull the price back below $26.50.If they succeed, the DOT/USDT pair could drop to $20 and then to $15. A bounce off this support could keep the pair range-bound between $15 and $26.50 for a few days.A break below $15 will favor the bears while a break above $31.28 will indicate the downtrend could be over.After the initial slide, Internet Computer (ICP) has been consolidating in a tight range for the past few days. This suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears about the next directional move.If the uncertainty resolves to the downside and the bears sink the price below $103, the ICP/USDT pair could retest the all-time low at $86.01. A break below this level could resume the downtrend with the next target at $60.Conversely, if the bulls propel the price above $168.57, the pair may rally to $186.06 and then to $222.34. A break above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $243.08 could signal that the downtrend could be over.Uniswap (UNI) rebounded sharply on May 24, suggesting strong buying by the bulls at lower levels. The relief rally could now reach the 20-day EMA ($29.59), which is likely to act as a stiff resistance.If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the UNI/USDT pair could drop to $21.50. A strong rebound off this support will suggest the sentiment has turned bullish and traders are buying on dips. That will increase the possibility of a break above the 20-day EMA.If that happens, the pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($34.25). This positive view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below $21.50. The next support on the downside is $16.49 and then $13.04.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) rose above the $685.36 resistance on May 24 and the bulls flipped the level into support on May 25, which is a positive sign. If the bulls push the price above $800, the altcoin could rally to the moving averages.The downsloping 20-day EMA ($908) and the RSI below 43 suggest advantage to the bears. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USDT pair could drop to $685.36.A bounce off this support will suggest the sentiment has turned positive and the traders are buying on dips. That will enhance the prospects of a break above the moving averages.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $685.36, the pair could drop to $538.11 and then retest the May 23 low at $468.13.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

36,"Pintu, an Indonesia-based cryptocurrency exchange focusing on first-time crypto users, has raised $6 million to support its mission to drive industry adoption.The company announced Tuesday that it has completed a Series A funding round led by major global crypto investors including Pantera Capital, Coinbase Ventures, and Intudo Ventures, tech news agency Tech in Asia reports. Other inventors like Alameda Ventures, Blockchain Ventures, and Castle Island Ventures also participated in the round.Founded in 2020 by Jeth Soetoyo, Pintu is a major licensed cryptocurrency company in Indonesia, regulated by the Indonesian Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency, or Bappepti. The exchange is registered under Bappebti and the Ministry of Communication and Informatics as a licensed crypto broker.The company’s new funding will be turned into marketing, hiring and product development to attract more newcomers to the industry. Pintu chief operating officer Andrew Adjiputro reportedly noted that Pintu is a bit different from major Indonesian crypto exchanges like Indodax and Tokocrypto as Pintu is focused on the mass market to reach mainly first-time crypto users.Adjiputro said that many Indonesian retail traders view crypto as an alternative investment asset class, with most of the investors being aged between 20 and 35 years old.“For most Indonesians, the concept of investing and trading is new, because historically penetration in these categories have been so low. So what we’re seeing is also the opportunity to help Indonesians understand the concept of investing/trading and along the way leapfrog investments into other asset classes,” the COO stated.As previously reported, Indonesia has been keeping cryptocurrency trading legal despite putting a blanket ban on crypto payments back in 2017. Yesterday, the country’s central bank reportedly announced state digital currency plans, intending to make a digital rupiah currency a legal payment instrument in Indonesia."
37,"The price of Bitcoin surged higher on May 26, breaching the $40,000 level for the first time in five days as traders brushed aside concerns about China's crypto ban and the United States' crypto tax proposal.The benchmark cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $40,855 before turning lower owing to profit-taking sentiment.In the meantime, analysts such as Cheds and Korous AK expect BTC/USD to hit $42,000 in the short term but advised caution on extended upside positions unless the spot market confirms a clear bullish breakout.Cheds, particularly, showed a bullish conviction if Bitcoin reclaims its 200-day simple moving average (200-day SMA), which is currently around $40,600. The wave has historically served as a strong price floor against long-term bearish trends.Be careful getting too bullish until $BTC #Bitcoin turns both the 42k area and MA 200 back into support on dailyMore support for a bullish Bitcoin outlook came from on-chain data. At least three blockchain-focused metrics showed that the cryptocurrency bottomed out after crashing to $30,000 on May 19.On-chain analytics platform Glassnode revealed earlier on May 26 that the total number of crypto addresses sending Bitcoin to cryptocurrency exchanges declined on a seven-day average timeframe.The metric, dubbed ""Number of Addresses Depositing to Exchanges,"" illustrates the number of unique addresses that appear as a sender in a transaction sending funds to exchanges. Simply put, it shows a decline in the number of new Bitcoin traders who might want to transfer BTC to exchanges to sell it or trade it for other assets.New traders/investors are prone to react more emotionally to wild crypto price swings. But with the Glassnode metric showing a plunge in unique Bitcoin depositors to exchanges, it signals a downtrend in potential selling pressure.Meanwhile, the seven-day average output on Bitcoin's network value-to-transaction (NVT) signal has dropped to a 14-month low, Glassnode data shows.Bitcoin's price reacted bullishly when the NVT signal touched 500 on the hourly chart, as the chart above shows. Based on fractal sentiment alone, the metric now suggests a sharp bullish reversal in the Bitcoin market as it trades 36% above its previous bottom level of $30,000.Another Glassnode metric shows that the latest Bitcoin price dip has done very little in shaking investors' long-term bullish sentiment. The ""Number of Accumulation Addresses"" claimed a record high just as the BTC/USD exchange rate hit $30,000 on May 19, taking the total to above 545,000.#Bitcoin HODL Army is growing through this dip. pic.twitter.com/L8q6vO0rZlGlassnode defines accumulation addresses as those that have at least two incoming Bitcoin transactions and that have never spent funds. The analytics service considers these addresses as long-term holders.A spike in accumulation addresses during the BTC price crash that destroyed billions in leveraged positions shows that bulls with long-term setup absorbed the selling pressure. That marks another sign of bearish exhaustion as Bitcoin attempts to flip $40,000 into a new support level."
38,"China has ramped up efforts to quash cryptocurrency mining in its Inner Mongolia region by introducing new penalties for those caught engaging in the illegal activity.Officials unveiled new draft rules that would see harsher punishments applied to those caught mining Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies, per a report by the South China Morning Post. These would include placing offenders on a social credit blacklist, which would stop them from getting loans or even using the transportation system.The new rules make particular mention of data centers, industrial parks, telecoms companies, internet firms and even cybercafes, noting that any such offenders found operating mining equipment would have their business license revoked, could be removed from the local electricity trading scheme, and could even have their businesses shut down entirely.The draft rules are up for public review until June 1; however, the Inner Mongolia region has already been subject to tough crackdowns on cryptocurrency mining. Eliminating energy-intensive mining is part of China’s stated plans to become carbon neutral by 2060. A telephone hotline is already active in the Inner Mongolia region, where citizens are encouraged to notify authorities of any cryptocurrency mining taking place locally.China’s determination to rid itself of Bitcoin miners has already had a knock-on effect. Three mining companies — BTC.TOP, Huobi and HashCow — announced they were closing down their operations in the Chinese mainland earlier this week.While China chases down crypto miners as part of its stated carbon goals, other countries are engaged in the same activity but for different reasons. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani made a television address on Wednesday, in which he announced an immediate ban on all Bitcoin mining until September. Energy shortages in Iran have reportedly been driven by the over-consumption of power by Bitcoin miners and have already resulted in grid blackouts and the dimming of street lights.Iranian authorities are now offering 200 million rials ($873) as a reward for anyone who comes forward with a successful tip regarding the location of illegal Bitcoin miners — a sum more than four times Iran’s median monthly salary."
39,"A major advertising industry organization in the United Kingdom has ruled on an ad campaign telling people “it’s time to buy” Bitcoin (BTC).The Advertising Standards Authority, a self-regulating ad organization, officially halted an advertising campaign by cryptocurrency exchange Luno for being misleading and irresponsible.“The ads must not appear again in the form complained about,” the ASA said Wednesday, noting that ads like this should mention that Bitcoin investment is highly risky due to its extremely volatile nature.Shown across the London Underground network and on London buses this year, Luno’s ad posters contained an image of Bitcoin saying: “If you’re seeing bitcoin on the Underground, it’s time to buy.”The ASA said that it had received several complaints regarding Luno’s ad, with people stressing that their posters failed to illustrate the risk of Bitcoin investment. “We considered that consumers would interpret the statement ‘it’s time to buy’ as a call to action and that the simplicity of the statement gave the impression that bitcoin investment was straightforward and accessible,” the ASA said.Instead, Bitcoin investment is “complex, volatile, and could expose investors to losses and considered that stood in contrast to the impression given by the ad, that investment was simple and conventional,” the authority wrote.The ASA said that Luno agreed not to post its Bitcoin ads in their current form again and promised to ensure that future ads would carry a proper risk warning.The latest regulatory action comes against the backdrop of extreme volatility on crypto markets, with Bitcoin dropping from its all-time high above $64,000 to around $31,000 in mid-May.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, crypto advocates have been distributing more Bitcoin ads around the world. Last September, the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong launched the “Bitcoin Tram” ad campaign in Hong Kong, with some ads placed right in front of HSBC headquarters and showing the words “be your own bank.”"
40,"The current cryptocurrency market scenario is only for traders who have an extremely high appetite for risks. But for the faint of heart, analysts advise patience and caution ahead.The outlook stands tall for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization that more or less behave as locomotives for the rest of the crypto market. As of Wednesday, the ETH/USD Realized Volatility on a 30-day timeframe has reached near its 2017 peak levels, according to data provided by Skew.Meanwhile, Bybt.com shows Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility at its yearly high, suggesting that the benchmark asset remains at risk of wild price fluctuations in the sessions ahead. Simply put, the top two crypto assets show a likelihood of moving in either direction with a higher degree of volatility. All in all, that could mean both aggressive gains and losses for daytraders.The volatility alarm rings at the time when both Bitcoin and Ether have posted incredible recovery rallies, following their recent price declines. In retrospect, the BTC/USD exchange rate plunged more than 50% after topping near $65,000 in April — a correction partially driven by Elon Musk’s anti-Bitcoin tweets and China’s crypto ban reiteration last week.Ether, whose positive correlation efficiency with Bitcoin currently sits near 0.88, tailed the benchmark digital asset’s bearish correction. The second-largest cryptocurrency experienced a maximum of 60% decline in its market valuation — compared to its record high of $4,380 from mid-April.But bulls saw opportunities in the said price dips, insomuch that they helped Bitcoin and Ether prices recover by up to 36.12% and 68.52% from their local price bottoms, respectively. Some analysts anticipated that the upside retracement would extend further based on supportive macroeconomic catalysts, mainly inflation fears.Tech bull Cathie Wood, who heads Ark Investment Management, reiterated her $500,000 Bitcoin price target after last week’s crash, calling the dip “a really great time to buy.”Ark's Cathie Wood is sticking with her $500,000 target for Bitcoin #TheBusinessweek https://t.co/9eBp5M39Zi pic.twitter.com/VeSRF5fplmNevertheless, many also cautioned traders against buying during a bearish correction phase, especially after a year-long price rally that increases the risks of profit-taking by long-term investors. Analysts at BiotechValley Insights Consulting Group noted that Bitcoin dropped hard even after the United States Consumer Price Index rose to 4.2%, stating that the crypto market is now going through an “anxiety stage.”“I believe Bitcoin has a long way to fall from here,” one of the BiotechValley analysts wrote in a note. “I think it will slowly grind down the slope of hope with a periodic dead cat bounce.”The group called for a $15,000–$16,000 price target for Bitcoin.Koroush AK, an independent market analyst, took a rather middle approach. He advised traders to wait for a clear bounce above short-term resistance levels before determining their market bias, tweeting:The recent rebound has coincided with an increase in the number of outstanding Bitcoin Futures contracts from $11 billion to $11.88 billion, showcasing a steady climb in leveraged positions in the derivatives market. Meanwhile, more than $12 billion worth of long positions has been liquidated since the May 19 price crash."
41,"Canadian securities regulators have initiated a regulatory action against major global cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex.On Tuesday, the Ontario Securities Commission published a statement of allegations against Polo Digital Assets, also known as Poloniex, alleging that the firm has failed to comply with Ontario securities laws.According to the statement, Poloniex has never been registered with the agency, while encouraging Canadians to use its platform and allowing Ontario residents to trade crypto derivatives and securities. “Poloniex has never filed a prospectus with the Commission or obtained an exemption from the prospectus requirement,” the OSC wrote.As Poloniex is incorporated in the Republic of Seychelles, the Seychelles Financial Services Authority has been assisting Canadian regulators in the matter, the OSC noted.The new action comes about two months after the OSC notified Ontario-operating crypto exchanges that they must comply with local securities laws or face potential regulatory action. Crypto firms were asked to contact the OSC before April 19, 2021, in order to discuss how to bring their operations as a dealer or marketplace into compliance.“Despite this warning, Poloniex did not contact the Commission by April 19, 2021 or at any time to start compliance discussions,” the regulator said.As such, the OSC enforcement staff requested that the commission should order Poloniex to cease trading in any securities or derivatives permanently or for a period specified by the regulator. The staff also requested to prohibit Poloniex from acquiring any securities and becoming a registrant as an investment fund manager.Poloniex will have to pay an administrative penalty of up to 1 million Canadian dollars for each failure to comply with Ontario securities law, the statement reads.Poloniex did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.“To date, there is only one crypto asset dealer registered with Canadian securities regulators,” the OSC said. To date, there are more than 70 platforms that have initiated compliance discussions with Canadian securities regulators, the authority noted."
42,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk reminded Twitter followers on Tuesday that despite the recent interest he’s taken in Dogecoin (DOGE), he still has no formal authority over the project.Musk was replying to a comment from a Doge-themed account, which opined that he had taken to operating Dogecoin like one of his own companies and that he’d effectively become the project’s CEO.The comment framed Musk’s influence as something to be celebrated, but the self-proclaimed “Dogefather” issued a reminder that he actually isn’t the boss and that no one really answers to him.Please note Dogecoin has no formal organization & no one reports to me, so my ability to take action is limitedThe results of a recent survey conducted in Australia revealed that more than 50% of respondents believed Musk to be the inventor of Bitcoin (BTC), suggesting that his recent Dogecoin reminder might be well judged.Dogecoin is a meme in the form of a cryptocurrency that was created for purely humorous reasons. After being launched in 2013, the joke eventually faded, and the coin disappeared into relative obscurity until Musk stumbled across it in 2020. Hopping on the bandwagon of a joke the best part of a decade old, Musk’s subsequent tweets were credited with pumping the value of DOGE throughout much of 2021.Others have attributed blame to Musk for what is perceived as an irresponsible swaying of cryptocurrency markets. A petition on Change.org was launched amid the market crash of mid-May demanding that Musk sell off his Bitcoin holdings and divest himself from the cryptocurrency sphere before his tweets cause more unwanted commotion."
43,"Major Wall Street bank executives will appear before the United States Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday to discuss the role of their financial institutions in the recovery of the American economy.Democratic lawmakers plan to grill a number of major bank execs, whose firms saw record profits during the COVID-19 pandemic while average Americans struggled to make ends meet. In prepared testimonies posted on Tuesday, CEOs at the Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo described their respective banks' responses to major challenges such as inequality, diversity, climate change, taxes, as well as how their banks handle cryptocurrencies. This year saw a record bull run in cryptocurrency markets as major financial institutions opened up to digital assets, adding trading desks and custody wings to handle client interests in major cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC).In his testimony, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said that the bank is continuing to evaluate the benefits, risks and client demand for crypto-related products and services. “Currently, we do not lend against cryptocurrencies and do not bank companies whose primary business is cryptocurrency or the facilitation of cryptocurrency trading and investment,” he said.Moynihan said that BofA is also assessing new technologies like distributed ledger technology, which could potentially deliver value to the bank's customers. However, while BofA holds over 60 blockchain patents, the bank still has “not found a use case at scale,” Moynihan said.Similarly, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser also outlined a measured approach to crypto, stating that the bank will need to ensure clear controls and governance before engaging with cryptocurrencies. “Citi is focusing resources and efforts to understand changes in the digital asset space and the use of distributed ledger technology, including demand and interest by our clients, regulatory developments and technology advancements,” Fraser wrote.Wells Fargo CEO and president Charles Scharf said that the company has been closely following developments around cryptocurrencies. Digital assets “have emerged as alternative investment products though their status as a currency and mechanism of payment remains fluid,” Scharf noted. The exec also mentioned that Wells Fargo is preparing to roll out a pilot for a blockchain-based settlement service within the bank’s global branch network.The Senate Banking and House Financial Services committees will also hear from the CEOs of JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley. The latter two introduced limited crypto services earlier this year, while the former is reportedly mulling opening a crypto trading desk."
44,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has surpassed $40,000 on Wednesda, breaking above a key sell area for the first time in five days.Traders expect a broader rally to come and a bullish market structure to form if Bitcoin continues to rise above $42,000 and Ether (ETH) reclaims $3,000. Bitcoin has been recovering over the past week due to three major factors.First, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor have been encouraging Bitcoin miners to use cleaner energy.Musk and Saylor have gone further since, speaking with Bitcoin miners in the United States about reliable energy consumption.Spoke with North American Bitcoin miners. They committed to publish current & planned renewable usage & to ask miners WW to do so. Potentially promising.Second, the Bitcoin futures market has reset to a large extent. According to data from Bybt.com, when BTC crashed to below $30,000, the futures market open interest dropped from $27 billion to $11 billion.This means that the futures market is not overcrowded, which raises the probability of a more sustainable and gradual rally.Third, Ether has been rising rapidly over the past few days, which also benefits Bitcoin and altcoins because ETH saw a deeper correction than BTC.Major cryptocurrencies rebounding as a whole is improving the sentiment around Bitcoin, leading to the gradual recovery of the crypto market.In the near term, traders say that $42,000 is the important short-term resistance area, and after that, $49,000 is the macro sell area.A pseudonymous trader known as Pentoshi wrote:In the foreseeable future, the two key things to observe for Bitcoin traders are exchange outflows and the $42,000 level.Ideally, if the $42,000 level holds and Bitcoin exchange outflows increase in tandem, that would mean that the confidence of investors in BTC and whales at above $42,000 is rising.There are concerns that a “dead cat bounce” might form, which is a short-lasting recovery, but if BTC holds $42,000, the chance of a fakeout rally would substantially decrease."
45,"Ethereum is seeing renewed interest in the aftermath of Bitcoin's travails this week, with Ether’s 24-hour trade volume topping BTC’s by a significant margin.However it's still a long way from doubling Bitcoin's volume as some ETH proponents suggested. On May 25, a screenshot of CoinGecko data circulated across Crypto Twitter showing the daily volume of Ether had surpassed $115 billion while Bitcoin’s sat at nearly $53 billion.Speaking to Cointelegraph, CoinGecko’s co-founder and COO, Bobby Ong, revealed the data depicted in the screenshot was not accurate due to either an API error, or wash-trading, resulting in inflated ETH volumes reported by the EXX exchange.Ong stated that Coingecko has since disabled its data feed from EXX. The platform now shows Ether has driven 20% more volume than BTC over the past 24 hours with roughly $60 billion trade compared to Bitcoin’s $50.2 billion.While CoinGecko's Bitcoin page has seen about 75% more traffic than its Ethereum page over the past seven days, the gap has narrowed significantly in the past 24 hours. Ong noted:The surging trade activity and interest has also coincided with institutional fund manager Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) seeing its premium over spot Ether prices bounce up to 11%. while the firm’s Bitcoin Trust has traded at a discount since March. The data suggests that some institutions have turned their focus to Ethereum rather than Bitcoin.This is what I mean, $ETH both on spot exchanges and institutional (grayscale) is flippening $BTC in volume

macro Market structure on $ETH is more bullish than BTC too

Look at Goldman's comments as well as other institutional investors, you can see where the money is flowing https://t.co/v7vZoWNkSkEthereum’s volume surged to overtake Bitcoin just days after segments of a leaked report from Goldman Sachs revealed the global investment bank believes Ether has a “high chance of overtaking Bitcoin as a dominant store of value.”The report noted the growth of the burgeoning decentralized finance and nonfungible token ecosystems being built on Ethereum, as well as ETH’s dominance over Bitcoin by total transaction volume.“Ether beats bitcoin as a store of value. The Ethereum ecosystem...provides developers a way to create new apps. Most of DeFi apps are being built on Ethereum. The greater number of transactions in ether vs bitcoin reflects this dominance” - Goldman Sachs Global Macro Research pic.twitter.com/vNkQ1HlDYM"
46,"The recent extreme volatility in the cryptocurrency market following Bitcoin’s (BTC) dip to $30,000 and the recovery to $38,000 has traders confused about whether the current price action is a ‘dead cat bounce’ which will see token prices head lower or a solid reversal that will set the floor for the next leg higher for the market. While BTC price still remains more than 40% below its all-time high of $64,863, bulls have managed to weather multiple attempts to significantly break below support at $36,000. A closer analysis of on-chain data and exchange inflows shows that Bitcoin's sell-off led to the market-wide downturn and Delphi Digital analyst Nick Pappageorge highlighted the fact that BTC inflow to exchanges “topped over 20,000 BTC in just one hour on Wednesday,” which was the highest level sesince March 2020.One of the major sources of market turbulence identified by Pappageorge was the seemingly daily FUD headlines, including yet another Chinese government ban of cryptocurrencies and concerns that Tesla would dump its Bitcoin holdings. These back-to-back fear-laced narratives led retail traders to offload their coins on exchanges to escape a further price slide.Pappageorge also pointed to concerns raised by a pair of hacks on the Binance Smart Chain which saw the price of PancakeSwap (CAKE) and Pancake Bunny (BUNNY) plunge, with the latter being drained of $45 million worth of user funds as compounding market fears.The turnaround in sentiment this week has been in part fueled by positive headlines such as the formation of a Bitcoin mining council following a meeting between Elon Musk, Michael Saylor and North American Bitcoin miners, which has helped spark a turnaround in BTC and altcoins. The quick reversal so triggered the debate on whether the current market activity resembles a dead-cat-bounce or a trend reversal. 70% nuke -> 80% bounce -> 10% dip

Dead Cat or Reversal pic.twitter.com/qefB6y4ahQWhile many of the newer entrants to the cryptocurrency market have found the recent volatility nauseating, the more experienced investors jumped at the chance to accumulate BTC at a 50% discount as the number of new accumulation addresses reached new all-time highs amid the shakeout.Well-known Twitter personality and Bitcoin analyst PlanB posted the following chart showing how Bitcoin oscillates around the stock-to-flow (S2F) model, showing the recent downturn is well within the standard range it deviates.PlanB said:As for bullish signs needed to support a quick recovery, the May 24 Delphi Daily report from Ashwath Balakrishnan highlighted the “sharply rising” circulating supply of fiat-backed stablecoins, which has increased from ""15 billion to nearly 21 billion in the last 5 days.”While this could be a sign that dip buyers are “loading up ammo,” Balakrishnan was sure to note that “it could also just be stablecoin arbitrageurs” and stressed the importance of “ensuring that the circulating supply doesn’t drop sharply to confirm these inflows will be deployed.”A record amount of dry powder is now available on exchanges but at the same time, an entirely new cohort of cryptocurrency investors who just experienced their first 50% pullback are now wondering if they should pull out the market or double-down on their investment. The more experienced in the crowd are betting that the market is headed higher but further volatility is all but guaranteed.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

47,"On a day in which Bitcoin crashed briefly to $30,000 in a rampant bear market, the leading cryptocurrency never got anywhere close to that on Korean exchanges. The so-called “kimchi premium” saw to that, keeping the price of Bitcoin as much as $5,000 above its level on leading U.S. exchanges.The major reason for this kimchi premium is that Korea’s exchanges are fairly isolated by a combination of the country’s strict capital control laws preventing funds from leaving the country, and the tax code and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations that make it difficult for foreigners to use Korean exchanges — even giants like Bithumb and Upbit — without local Korean bank accounts.Nor is that premium the only part of South Korea’s crypto industry that sets it apart from the rest of the world. Among other things, the market’s isolation combined with the extraordinary stability of the Korean won has kept stablecoin usage low and the embrace of decentralized finance, or DeFi, well behind that of the rest of the world.Despite this isolation, Korea’s embrace of Bitcoin in particular and cryptocurrency in general is very strong. In April, more than five million unique cryptocurrency users — about 10% of the country’s population — reportedly bought or sold digital assets at least once since the beginning of 2021.On May 19, the day the kimchi premium hit $5,000, just one Korean exchange, Upbit, had a 24-hour transaction volume of more than $31.5 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Add in the rest of the country’s “big four” cryptocurrency exchanges, Bithumb, Korbit and Coinone, and it was $38.1 billion — substantially more than has been traded recently on the leading Korean stock exchange KRX.One interesting aspect of Korea’s cryptocurrency craze is how broadly it is spread across age groups. One February survey showed that almost half of the users of leading Korean exchanges Bithumb and Upbit were in their 40s or 50s — many of them mothers. That said, a broader survey of Korean crypto exchange apps in March showed that young people dominate the ranks of new Korean crypto users, with those in their 20s and 30s accounting for nearly two-thirds of the new monthly app users in the first three months of the year. However, they are investing small amounts, often less than $100.All that’s clearly having an impact. Bithumb Korea recently announced that its Q1 2021 net profit was up 876% compared with the previous year.At the same time, the Korean government and regulators are far from being fans of cryptocurrency. In February, Bank of Korea Governor Lee Joo-yeol told a National Assembly committee hearing that “a crypto asset is an asset that has no intrinsic value.” He added that “it is difficult to understand why the price of Bitcoin is so high.""  Korea’s crypto regulations also make it difficult for foreign competitors. In December 2020, the world’s biggest exchange, Binance, shuttered its Binance Korea operation less than a year after it launched, thanks in large part to a law that banned exchanges operating in the country from sharing order books — meaning Binance Korea could no longer lean on Binance’s liquidity.That law came into effect in March 2021, the same month that another leading cryptocurrency exchange — OKEx — announced it was shuttering its Korean operations due to the new AML regulations. It has also been suggested that these rules will make it difficult for smaller Korean exchanges to compete with the big four.Despite this booming crypto market, Korea is far behind the rest of the world in adoption of stablecoins, in no small part because the Korean won is stable enough that there isn’t as strong a need for stablecoins in the largely walled-off crypto market.Beyond that, the Korean government frowns on stablecoins, according to Oleg Smagin, head of global marketing at Delio, a leading Korean crypto lending and staking firm. That makes exchanges leery of them, he adds.In addition, exchange fees are low — largely in the 0.15% to 0.25% range at the big four. While the fees for withdrawals in won are flat and very low — about $1 — the fee for moving cryptocurrencies directly off can be steep. The big four’s withdrawal fees range from 0.0005 to 0.0015 BTC to withdraw Bitcoins directly — $20 to $60 for one BTC at $40,000.Which could help explain why the Korean won is the fourth-most traded national currency for Bitcoin, behind only the Japan yen, the euro, and the dominant U.S. dollar.One victim of Korea’s closed-off crypto market and unfamiliarity with stablecoins is that the booming DeFi industry hasn’t had a chance to take hold there, Smagin says.“2019 became a tipping point for the wide adoption of DeFi globally, but in Korea it was barely recognized, mostly because most of the local retail investors lacked experience using overseas crypto services and the adoption of stablecoins was low,” he says.Delio’s solution is a hybrid centralized-decentralized finance model that uses CeFi as a way to build the initial crypto lending ecosystem that will become more and more decentralized over time. In the meantime, the firm realized there is an “enormous niche for a CeFi crypto-to-crypto lending service that can serve the needs of the local traders,” Smagin says.The firm currently has four CeFi lending offerings, as well as a new payment service that lets Delio wallet holders pay with Bitcoin at a network of more than 70 retail firms services by payment app Money Tree. In addition, it’s Delio Liquidity arm provides institutional clients with digital asset loans of between $800,000 and $45 million. Delio offers Bitcoin and Ethereum loans of up to 90% of the borrower’s BTC or ETH collateral, and also provides lending services to Bithumb customers, who can use either BTC or ETH, or Korean won, as collateral. Staking and yield farming are also available. Delio recently passed $2 billion in total value utilized.Delio’s DeFi hybrid plans are centered around Ducato, a won-based stablecoin project scheduled to launch in the third quarter of 2021. The KRWD stablecoin — fixed at one won — will be generated by collateralizing cryptocurrency. Ducato is a DeFi protocol with its own token, DUCATO, which is used to pay fees and for governance. But the CeFi Delio platform provides the stablecoin with a user-friendly interface.Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

48,"Technical analysis, the study of chart patterns, is a tool that helps traders increase their edge over others.This is done by keeping the trader on the right side of the trend and providing warnings when the trend is about to reverse. There are many indicators and patterns that can accomplish this task but there is no one particular indicator that fits the bill for all market conditions.Therefore, traders prefer to use a combination of indicators, which come in handy both during trending and range-bound markets. However, this does not mean the trader should clutter every chart with all the available indicators. In some cases, using too many indicators will only hamper the decision-making process and create confusion rather than assist the trader.As traders develop their chart reading skills, they tend to reduce the number of indicators and use the ones that are more suited to their style of trading. Here again, there is no perfect set of indicators that will give better results than others, it is just a matter of preference and practice.In this article, the set of indicators that will be discussed are moving averages and the relative strength index. Without going too deeply into the technicalities of each indicator, the basic ways of using them effectively will be highlighted. The methods discussed here are in no way complete, there are myriad other possibilities and traders can use the ones that work best for them. The explanation can be used as a guide for honing the analyzing skills further.Moving averages are trend-following or also called lagging indicators as they provide delayed feedback after the price movement has already occurred. The most popular time frames that are used for trading and investing are the 20, 50, and 200-period moving averages. Short-term traders also use the 5 and 10-period moving averages but they tend to whipsaw and may not be suitable for everybody.There are four types of moving averages: simple, exponential, smoothed and weighted but the most popular ones in use are the simple and exponential moving averages.For calculation, exponential moving averages give more weightage to recent price data, hence they tend to respond quickly to price changes. On the other hand, a simple moving average gives equal weightage to the price data, hence they tend to be comparatively slow in responding to price changes.Therefore, traders tend to use EMA for the shorter time frame, such as 10 and 20 as they catch the changes quickly and for the longer time frames, the simple moving averages are used because trends usually do not change direction quickly. For the current example, the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA will be used.The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator, which captures changes in price and functions as an oscillator that ranges between values of 0 to 100.As a general practice, readings of below 30 are termed as oversold, and above 70 are presumed to be overbought. While these boundaries work well during a range-bound market, they tend to give false signals during trending phases.The most popular time frame used is a 14-period RSI. However, this is not set in stone because short-term traders may use a 5 or 7 period RSI while long-term investors may opt for 21- or even 30-period RSI.One of the most popular uses for the RSI is spotting a divergence, which warns traders of a possible trend reversal. After the basics, let’s see some methods to use the indicators for analysis.The first thing a trader should learn is to spot a trend. Trading in the direction of the trend is rewarding because an established trend offers several profitable trades. Let’s understand this with some crypto price action.In a range-bound market, the moving averages criss-cross each other and do not slope up or down for an extended period of time. See the area enclosed by the ellipse in the chart above where Bitcoin (BTC) remained range-bound and the moving averages flattened out. Such markets tend to lack direction and are difficult to forecast and trade.As shown in the chart above, Polkadot’s (DOT) price was stuck in a range and the moving averages were flattish without any sense of direction. When the price is largely contained between two boundaries, the market is said to be range-bound.Next, let’s try to spot a trending market because this is where the most lucrative trading opportunities arise.Bitcoin was largely stuck in a range from Aug. 1, 2020, to Oct. 20, 2020. During this period, the moving averages were flat and without any direction.However, on Oct. 21, 2020, the price broke above the range and the RSI also jumped into the overbought territory. During the start of a new trend, the RSI generally remains overbought for the initial period of the trend and the same could be seen here as well.As the price moved up, the 20-day EMA started to turn up first and then the 50-day SMA followed suit. When a trend starts, it generally remains in force for an extended period. Let’s look at another example of a trend.After staying in a range from Sep. 6, 2020, to Dec. 27, 2020, DOT broke out of the range on Dec. 28, 2020. The RSI also rose to overbought levels above 70 and the moving averages started sloping up. Again, notice how the 20-day EMA was quick to move up while the 50-day SMA took time to catch up.In the above case, the RSI did not remain overbought for an extended period but remained above 50, indicating one rule does not fit everywhere.Unlike uptrends, which take time to form and remain in force for an extended period, downtrends are violent and can either stretch for a long time, similar to the 2018 crypto bear market, or could quickly reverse direction after a sharp fall.The above chart has two important things for the trader to note. First, the RSI had been making lower tops since the end of February, even though the price had continued to move up. This is a classic sign of a possible trend reversal. Again, this is not foolproof but if traders combine the signal with the price action, then the possibility of avoiding a catastrophe is high.The negative divergence on the RSI gained importance when the moving averages completed a bearish crossover where the 20-day EMA, which had been staying above the 50-day SMA for the past few months, broke below the 50-day SMA. This was a sign that the short-term price action was weakening and the trend may reverse.After staying in a range for a few days, Bitcoin broke down on May 12 and the moving averages started to turn down. This, along with the RSI in the negative territory was a signal to traders that the trend was reversing. As long as the price remains below the moving averages and both the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA keep sloping down, the trend will remain bearish.In the above chart we can see that after the uptrend, DOT became stuck in a range with the moving averages flattening out and criss-crossing each other. It is difficult to call this a top because the price could have gone either way. However, if the trader also looked at the RSI, it was flashing a negative divergence, warning of a possible reversal.The sharp fall on May 19 confirmed the downtrend as both moving averages started to turn down and the RSI is in the negative zone.For most new traders, the moving averages and the RSI are essentially the starting point for identifying trends.Investors dipping their toes in trading should definitely practice identifying the main trend as this could keep them from going against the market and getting burnt.

49,"Powers On... is a monthly opinion column from Marc Powers, who spent much of his 40-year legal career working with complex securities-related cases in the United States after a stint with the SEC. He is now an adjunct professor at Florida International University College of Law, where he teaches a course on “Blockchain, Crypto and Regulatory Considerations.”These past few weeks have been tumultuous, especially for newbies to the crypto market. First, on May 8, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, was the host of Saturday Night Live where he promoted Dogecoin (DOGE) — a highly speculative, volatile cryptocurrency with present meaningful business model other than being a meme for tipping others. Then, a few days later, Musk dissed Bitcoin (BTC) in a tweet, stating that Tesla would no longer allow purchases of its electric vehicles with BTC because of its purported substantial, environmentally unfriendly energy usage.This is, of course, only a half-truth, as on a relative basis, the current traditional financial industry reportedly uses twice the amount of energy, according to a new study by Galaxy Digital. The crypto industry also comes close to having 40% of Bitcoin mining powered by renewable energy sources, according to the latest study by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. And according to Skybridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, the “future of #bitcoin mining is renewable energy.”Also, leave it to The New York Times to never let the truth, or additional truths, get in the way of pushing its own political agenda, which is decidedly progressive and against most anything that benefits the upper-middle class, involves capitalism and investments that fail to advance its liberal positions, and the wealthy. The New York Times has published no less than four articles on the energy consumption of BTC, including an article in January 2018 by reporter Nathaniel Popper, then another in February 2018 by Binyamin Appelbaum, and then another in March 2021 by Andrew Ross Sorkin. Most recently, The New York Times published a fourth article on April 14 by Hiroko Tabuchi on the purported huge amount of energy consumed and carbon emissions caused by Bitcoin.However, the many supposed “facts” in that most recent piece and a 2018 report upon which that position is in part supported were roundly rebutted by Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures in a Harvard Business Review article published May 5. It is more than a coincidence, I suspect, that two of the NYT articles were published in early 2018 and two in early 2021, both being time periods when the price of BTC had been rising. Is the Gray Lady just reporting the news, or is it pushing an agenda voicing purported environmental concerns relating to the digital asset and opposition to the many crypto millionaires that BTC ownership has created?Then, on May 19, the prices of BTC, Ether (ETH) and most cryptocurrencies swooned by over 25%. Now, for those in the space, like me, who were here pre-2018, they understand that such huge price swings are nothing new to crypto. Indeed, in 2017 alone, BTC dipped several times that year by over 30%. It has fallen over 50% several times in the last 10 years. While nerve-racking, such is the price one must pay for this not-yet-mature blockchain technology. From an investing perspective, Basic Finance 101 dictates that for large rewards, there are large risks.Moreover, it is worth noting that anyone who bought BTC from any time period prior to Thanksgiving 2020 today still has — even with a BTC price of around $40,000 — a return of over 100%. Even if the price is cut roughly in half in the coming days, weeks or months from that level to $20,000, still not one investor who has held the currency from then till today would have lost a penny.Apart from Musk’s tweets about Tesla no longer accepting BTC, another speculated cause of the dive was China’s crackdown on crypto trading in the country. Yet, to those educated and within the space for a while, they know this was not the first crackdown of this kind by that country. More importantly, they know all prior efforts failed.More and more people in China and elsewhere own digital assets, with the number surpassing 105 million worldwide as of February, despite sovereign efforts to curb, regulate or ban them. This is likely because there are many countries — like China, Greece and Venezuela — and continents — like Africa — in the world where citizens do not fully trust their governments or institutions. Either their fiat currencies have been devalued by rampant inflation, their governments are oppressing their people and prohibiting them from transfers of assets outside their borders, or their citizens worry their governments might “nationalize” their bank assets — like was done in Greece in 2014–2016 after the last financial crisis.There are also around 1.7 billion people in the world that do not — for various reasons — have access to bank accounts or financial institutions where they can maintain stable savings or engage in financial and commercial transactions. The peer-to-peer system allowed by the invention of Bitcoin in October 2008 allows that; all you need now is a smartphone.As soon as the large declines began early in the day on May 19, JPMorgan Chase showed its true colors. Remember, it was JPMorgan’s chairman, Jamie Dimon, who famously said a few years ago that BTC was a fraud. Yet, JPMorgan has been developing its own digital coin, JPM Coin. When the prices went down, JPMorgan again blasted the asset class. Also, one could almost sense the schadenfreude by some in the traditional media in reporting on the price declines that day.But I digress... What I really want to focus on is Musk and his tweeting. Because he does it regularly and, in my opinion, with a reckless abandon that has not only hurt the digital asset market but has probably caused a number of his Twitter followers to lose millions of dollars.Many of you may remember, or will be surprised to learn, that Musk was accused of fraud by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in September 2018 for issuing false and misleading tweets. Specifically, the SEC alleged he made “false and misleading” when claiming in tweets that Tesla had secured funding to take the company private at $420 per share. Tesla was also sued for failing to have proper disclosure controls in place to ensure that Musk, then the chairman and CEO of Tesla, did not mislead Tesla shareholders and the investing public.Tesla and Musk in short order settled the charges the following month and agreed to pay penalties of $20 million each and to hire two independent directors and a securities counsel to review in advance all of Musk’s tweets involving Tesla to ensure that any material information, or information that reasonably could be considered material, is preapproved and accurate.Despite this SEC settlement being approved by the court in October 2018, Musk was at it again in 2019, tweeting — according to the SEC — without pre-review and approval by Tesla’s new securities counsel and governance committee. The SEC thus brought a motion to hold him in contempt of court for violating the consent judgment he had signed just six months earlier. Musk claimed that the new tweeted information was not “material” and, in any event, was protected by his First Amendment rights. That case, too, was settled, with an amendment of the judgment to specifically identify nine kinds of Tesla-related information for which Musk must receive prior approval before issuing a tweet.In March — just two months ago — a Delaware derivative lawsuit was unsealed that again accused Musk of violating the SEC settlement and his fiduciary duties by his “erratic tweets.” It has also been over two and a half years since Tesla and Musk paid the collective $40 million penalty. Yet, there is still no specific court-approved SOX Fair Fund plan in the SEC action to distribute the money to shareholders of Tesla who were financially harmed by Musk’s purported tweets about going private. As the adage goes, justice delayed is justice denied — in this case, it is the Tesla shareholders that may have lost out.So, with Musk tweeting regularly about Bitcoin, Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies, one can rightly ask: Are the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (for commodities such as BTC) or the Federal Trade Commission listening? Or more technically correct, are they reading? Are any of his hundreds of tweets on these and other subjects potentially violating the SEC-amended judgment to which he consented? Are there any tweets involving the finances or business of Tesla that are possibly misleading or that have not gone through the agreed-upon preapproval process? Does Musk have some undisclosed personal or business interest in knocking BTC and promoting DOGE? Are his tweets, which contain what some would consider wild speculation on the prices of Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies, mere puffery and permitted First Amendment speech, or are they violations of securities, commodities, consumer or other laws?From the FTC’s perspective, one of its concerns is consumer fraud. It and the SEC have addressed in public announcements the oversized influence of social media influencers and celebrities. In November 2019, the FTC issued guidelines to remind influencers that if they are receiving any form of compensation for their recommendation of a product, it needs to be disclosed. The SEC has sued several celebrity endorsers, including Floyd Mayweather and DJ Khaled, for receiving undisclosed compensation for promoting cryptocurrencies. Is it perhaps time for the government to look into Musk and his tweets again?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

50,"Elon Musk captured the world’s attention when he declared that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin as a payment method, citing the blockchain’s environmental impact.Although this thrust the debate about cryptocurrencies and the climate into the spotlight, this has been an issue that has been rumbling on for many years.Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism is exceedingly energy intensive, and it seems to be a problem that’s only getting worse — with vast data centers established as miners vie to get their hands on a supply of new coins that has dwindled further since the 2020 halving.The latest figures from Digiconomist suggest that Bitcoin’s annual carbon footprint is now comparable to the whole of Portugal. A single BTC transaction uses as much CO2 as completing 1.26 million Visa transactions… or watching 95,000 hours of YouTube. Worse still, this single transaction also uses as much electricity as the typical U.S. household gets through in 40 days. Just a few short weeks ago, this figure stood at about 28 days.It's a problem that’s getting worse, not better. You know that you’ve got a problem on your hands when the environmental group Greenpeace says that it will no longer accept donations that are made using Bitcoin.Worse still, some heavyweights in the crypto industry believe that, unless the issue is resolved as a matter of urgency, it could sink Bitcoin altogether as corporations and governments make concerted pledges to take action and mitigate the effects of climate change. The COP26 climate summit is due to be held in Glasgow later this year, and New York recently unveiled proposals to ban Bitcoin mining in the state for three years — with politicians fearful that the cryptocurrency could cause it to miss environmental targets.Speaking to CNN recently, Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin conceded Bitcoin’s energy consumption is “definitely huge” and a “significant downside” in the quest for mass adoption. He also made this stark warning: “If Bitcoin sticks with its technology exactly as it is today, there's a big risk it will get left behind.”Right now, Ethereum itself is making a big change of its own. The blockchain is currently based on a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, but is now making a concerted shift to proof-of-stake. Some cynics will argue that the main motivation for this ambitious transition lies in the scalability issues that have plagued the network, as there’s a firm belief that PoS will allow Eth2 to process considerably more transactions per second. There are environmental benefits too, however, with research suggesting that this algorithm will be up to 99% more energy efficient.As Buterin said during that CNN interview: “[We’ll] go from consuming the same energy as a medium-sized country to consuming the same energy as a village.""Blackrock is the world’s largest asset holder — and in a recent forward-thinking letter to business leaders, CEO Larry Fink said the climate transition “presents a historic investment opportunity.” He added: “No issue ranks higher than climate change on our clients’ lists of priorities. They ask us about it nearly every day.”This laser-like focus on environmental, social and governance (ES&G) projects helps to change the narrative. Such initiatives are no longer regarded as a drain on profit margins, but an absolute necessity that the world’s biggest businesses need to embrace. Just like Bitcoin, they too risk being left behind unless they adapt… and fast.Data from Morningstar suggests that the total assets under management in ES&G funds rose precipitously in the final quarter of 2020, surpassing $2 trillion for the very first time. This coincided with the election of Joe Biden as U.S. president, with his administration opting to make climate change a central theme of his presidency.Carbon offsets, plastic offsets and other forms of climate credits have emerged as a new reality in the business world — meaning companies that fall below certain emissions levels can effectively sell their spare capacity to others for a profit. But this isn’t without challenges. Corporations cannot always be certain that what they are purchasing is genuine, and a real need for concrete data has emerged.Although blockchain has regularly been castigated as part of the problem when it comes to the environment, one Albuquerque startup believes this technology has the power to be part of the solution.Devvio has developed an innovative blockchain initiative that advances sustainability efforts — with ES&G infrastructure that provides for “Bitcoin and Ethereum with net-zero emissions.” It has already amassed a series of partnerships with companies focused on ES&G, including waste collectors, renewable energy producers and data analytics companies.Tom Anderson, the company’s CEO, believes that the core strengths of blockchain can establish trust when it comes to verifying ES&G ratings and assets. He stressed that while these networks have become best known as being the home of cryptocurrencies and NFTs, these databases are particularly well-suited to tracking ownership of assets and records. Over time, it has the potential to become the ultimate destination for provable, auditable data — giving corporations a way of updating their progress on ES&G in a way that investors can verify.“Blockchain and environmental sustainability can coexist,” says Anderson. “Distributed ledger technologies aren’t intrinsically wasteful, and blockchain can do far more good for the environment than harm. With Devvio’s efficiency at 1/1,000,000th the energy usage of Bitcoin, you have all the benefit without the environmental cost.”He added: “Bitcoin was literally designed to waste energy in its consensus mechanism, but there are other ways to run a blockchain. I don’t think anyone could have realistically imagined what Bitcoin’s energy use would become, back in 2009. Although we have created a system that is dramatically more efficient, I think that is only the tip of the iceberg in what is needed given blockchain's potential to become a trusted source of truth for all ES&G data and assets.”Firmly focused on enterprise customers, Devvio says the world can no longer ignore ES&G issues. Anderson added that it is an “exciting time” for the businesses, and “enormous opportunities” have emerged as most of the world’s 1,000 biggest companies evaluate their impact on the environment.“It’s rare to see an opportunity in one’s lifetime where there is such a strong business to be built while also being able to do so much good in the world,” he added.Disclaimer.

51,"Bitcoin (BTC) prices pulled back on May 25, wiping a small portion of the gains it had made during the previous session amid another day of volatile trading.The BTC/USD exchange rate fell up to 6.11% after opening the Asia-Pacific session at $38,856. The pair met a strong resistance force near its 200-day simple moving average (20-day SMA) that prompted a majority of traders to secure their intraday profits.As a result, the bids for the BTC/USD pair started dropping while heading into the early London session, eventually finding support at a level that was instrumental in limiting the market's bearish trend during the last week's price crash.Rekt Capital, a pseudonymous cryptocurrency trader, called the blacked horizontal line in the chart above — roughly $37,000 — a ""key retest"" level, noting its significance in determining Bitcoin's short-term market bias.The analyst put a blue arrow above the support level that pointed north, stating that he anticipated BTC/USD to bounce back in the coming sessions. ""Bitcoin turns $37,000 into support in the short-term,"" tweeted Rekt Capital. ""But might need to retest that area once again given how strong yesterday's Daily Close was Still on track for following the blue path.""The statement appeared as Bitcoin continued its whipsaw trend, logging sudden intraday reversals of high percentage margins. The choppy price movements reflected an absence of clear directional bias among traders, especially as analysts weighed equally convincing bearish and bullish catalysts against one another.Victor Dergunov, the founder of Albright Investment Group, admitted that he was buying the Bitcoin price dip, adding that he expects the cryptocurrency to at least reach the $40,000-$42,000 area in the near term.""There was enormous volume leading up to and right around $30K, which is what we want to see at the epicenter of the correction process,"" Dergunov explained in his note.Offsetting Dergunov's bullish opinion was portfolio management and analytics firm, the Income Generator. It said the Bitcoin market risked facing the ""worst crypto winter"" in its twelve-year lifetime, citing the U.S. dollar's bullish response to rising inflation figures that could sap investors' appetite for the cryptocurrency.""It now seems as though rising inflation levels might actually work in the opposite direction and bring renewed buying activity back into the U.S. dollar,"" Income Generator said in a note.Meanwhile, Mike McGlone, the senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, reiterated his bullish stance on Bitcoin, noting that he still sees the BTC/USD exchange rate hitting $100,000 on the prospects of a declining supply rate.""Bitcoin has backed up for reasons that support an extended bull market and a path to $100K,"" he said.With ""greener,"" McGlone cited Elon Musk's proposal to create a mining council in North America that could track and subsidize Bitcoin's carbon emissions.The Tesla CEO was instrumental in crashing the bitcoin prices from $59,000 to as low as $30,000 over the past few weeks. He criticized the cryptocurrency for its potential environmental impact and discontinued accepting it as payment for Tesla's electric vehicles."
52,"Custody services aren’t the most compelling corner of the crypto ecosystem, but 21st-century solutions for storing and safekeeping digital assets are critical if cryptocurrencies are to achieve widespread adoption. For that reason, Cowen Inc.’s recent announcement that the 103-year old United States investment bank wants to hold crypto on behalf of asset managers and hedge funds is noteworthy, especially when coupled with similar statements from traditional bank giants such as Bank of New York Mellon and Deutsche Bank earlier this year.Is it too early to speak of this as a movement? “This is absolutely a trend,” Raphael Polansky, managing director at Boerse Stuttgart Digital Ventures GmbH, told Cointelegraph.Traditional bank giants like Wells Fargo — which also announced that it would begin offering crypto services to its wealthier investors — are being nudged into the business by their customers who are eager to increase their crypto and token activities. “Those customers are also not yet willing to trust those pioneering fintech firms with three-digit million amounts,” explained Polansky, adding: “They want a reliable and trusted partner that they have known for decades, and these are still the traditional banks.”“Yes, more [traditional] banks will offer custody services,” predicted Michael Gofman, assistant professor of finance at the University of Rochester. It’s like building a house, where “custody is the foundation,” he told Cointelegraph. Most users are scarcely aware of the custody function, but it is critical if the house is to endure.Matthias von Hauff, CEO of TEN31 fintech Bank, told Cointelegraph: “Those jurisdictions with a solid financial regulatory regime are in general beginning to appreciate the importance of providing a sound regulatory framework for crypto custody.” He, too, expects more traditional banks to enter the custody space.Legacy banks’ interest in crypto custody might at first glance seem surprising. The fees aren’t lucrative, after all; Coinbase’s custody fees, for instance, are about 50 basis points on an annualized basis. “It won’t make them [i.e., the banks] much money,” observed Gofman. But banks may view it as a kind of loss leader, enabling institutions to sell new custody clients additional — and more profitable — services, like crypto trading.Many providers until now have been offering services virtually free of charge, noted von Hauff, while crypto custody “is a perfectly logical ‘door opener’ for a wide range of cross-selling opportunities,” adding: “It is much like offering free checking accounts to banking clients. You lose money at first, but you have a client to whom you can offer all sorts of financial products.”Also, banks have surely been keeping a watchful eye on Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund colossus that pioneered institutional crypto custody in 2019 and, in October, expanded its digital asset coverage to Asia. Its Bitcoin (BTC) custody business has been “incredibly successful,” Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson told Barron’s in December, adding:With the exception of Fidelity, an outlier, the crypto custody business really began to blossom in 2019, spearheaded by fintech firms. But now, with more established banks entering the arena, its center of gravity could be shifting.“I would not say that the first fintech interest to this sector will invariably be superseded by traditional financial institutions, but that by entering this space, the competition for clients will certainly increase,” Sean Stein Smith, assistant professor in economics and business at Lehman College, told Cointelegraph. It’s possible that certain demographics may actually prefer to deal with fintechs rather than traditional commercial banks, he added.There should be room for partnerships between banks and fintechs, said Polansky. “We foresee a lot of strategic moves in the market where traditional banks will invest in crypto custodians instead of building up their own solutions.”Banks typically aren’t at the forefront when it comes to embracing new technologies, noted von Hauff, so it is “not surprising to see that most banks left this playing field to fintech firms at first. Now it seems like they are beginning to catch up.”The nature of crypto custody could change soon too, particularly as the crypto industry moves from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake transaction validation protocols and as staking becomes more commonplace, Gofman told Cointelegraph. If a user stakes a cryptocurrency, like Ether (ETH), which helps the network to validate blocks on its protocol, that staker could expect a return on investment — e.g., 6.7% over a 365-day period.But who is going to track, secure and document all those additional funds? “In the future, everyone will have to provide staking,” predicted Gofman, but “not every custodian will be able to do that.” It might become the province of smaller crypto-custody specialty firms.Meanwhile, events are moving fast, and Polansky expects to see the crypto custody business largely commoditized within the next three to four years. “The speed with which different companies are building up common infrastructure is amazing.” Besides all the new market entrants, regulations could also shape the future custody business, he told Cointelegraph, adding:This should be a plus for crypto users, who will get accessible, affordable services. In addition, Polansky foresees an “interoperability of custodians” allowing customers to “more easily move tokens and cryptocurrencies between ecosystems.”Recent announcements have focused on crypto custody solutions for institutions, not individual investors, but this isn’t so surprising, given that institutional players and private banking clients simply have more assets to deploy, said Stein Smith, adding: “From a business model perspective, it is logical to offer services to the most valuable clients first.”“Retail clients don’t need it,” added Gofman. They can write their private key on a piece of paper and put it in a safe deposit box. It’s not even needed for tax filing. But it’s a different story for institutional investors. Indeed, in the U.S., qualified investors holding $150,000 or more in assets must keep them under the control of a “qualified custodian.”This makes some sense, Gofman continued. You really don’t want a company’s CEO holding the private keys to the firm’s $1-billion BTC investment. Even though the CEO probably isn’t going to run off to the Cayman Islands with the private key, it’s better to place it for safekeeping with an established financial custodian.Retail custody solutions are behind in terms of usage and functionality, stated Polansky, and he doesn’t expect that to change. “They will remain a valid option for those who want to use them but will not take over the market.”All in all, the fact that financial heavyweights, such as Fidelity, BNY, Deutsche Bank, Northern Trust, DBS Bank and others, want to offer custody for digital assets could be a milestone event for the crypto world, and one might expect that even retirement funds could hold crypto assets soon.“The inclusion of Bitcoin and crypto into retirement planning is actually already underway via the utilization of self-directed IRAs,” Stein Smith told Cointelegraph. “With the increased interest and integration of crypto into traditional custodial and other financial services, it makes logical sense that Bitcoin and other crypto will become an integral part of the retirement planning process.”Related: Bitcoin on balance sheet attracts negative attention from anti-crypto banksCustody is a big deal, said Gofman, the groundwork of the cryptocurrency edifice, and even if custody fees remain relatively low, “1% of $1 trillion is still a lot of money.” Meanwhile, nonprofit organizations, pension funds and other institutional investors must have secure and trustworthy custodial services if they are going to invest in cryptocurrencies.“A big reason that institutional investors have steered clear of crypto until now is the custody issue,” Duke University’s Campbell Harvey told Cointelegraph in April, adding: “They had no mechanism to store private keys. They did not want to bear the custodial risk.” But now multiple solutions appear close at hand."
53,"As the price of Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to establish support at $37,000 on Tuesday, the recent $30,000 lows may have been the bottom, suggests one derivatives market indicator that has a history of accurately predicting BTC/USD cyclical lows following its bear cycles.The last time it predicted a bottom was on Nov. 1, following which the cost to purchase one Bitcoin surged from $13,771 to as high as $64,899 on Coinbase.Dubbed as “rolling basis,” the indicator mathematically represents the relative difference between the price of the futures contract and the spot rate on an annual timeframe. For instance, if a Bitcoin contract trades at a 2.5% premium for its spot price on the three-month basis chart, then its annualized rolling basis comes to be 10%.In hindsight, assets in the futures market trade either at a discount or a premium. When an asset’s spot rate is higher than its futures price, this is is called backwardation (discount). Conversely, when the spot rate trades below the futures one — which is typical in traditional financial markets — it ̦represents the state of contango (premium).Bitcoin futures markets tend to fluctuate between backwardation and contango. An extreme contango often signals a top in a bull market. Conversely, an extreme backwardation helps to find potential bottoms in a bear market.For instance, in June 2019, the Bitcoin Futures market on OKEx experienced a contango rise above the 3.5% level. It peaked around at 6.8% in the same period Bitcoin crossed $11,000. However, the BTC/USD spot rate kept on rising until it reached $14,000. Thereafter, the pair entered a multi-month bear market, bottoming out near $3,100 eventually in December 2019.Ben Lilly, a crypto economist at Jarvis Labs, pitted the reading on the “BTC Futures Annualized Rolling 3 Month Basis” chart against the Bitcoin spot prices, noting that when the former approaches or closes below 1%, the latter takes it as a cue to bottom out and start a new upside cycle.The BitMEX chart above shows several instances wherein the rolling basis reading fell below 1% during Bitcoin’s downside moves in the spot market. The cryptocurrency later started experiencing a rebound rally — a new bullish cycle — before correcting all over again to find a new bottom just as the rolling basis slipped below 1%. Rinse and repeat.For instance, in March 2020, during the coronavirus-led global market crash, Bitcoin futures logged a backwardation rise to just shy of negated 14%, which would mark Bitcoin’s bottom in the spot market at around $3,858.Lilly shared a Skew chart that showed BTC Futures annualized rolling basis slipping below 1% for the first time since November 2020.“This looks promising in terms of finding a bottom,” noted Lilly in his newsletter.He added that based on basis readings alone, it is a good time for Bitcoin spot traders to accumulate, albeit noting that it does not mean opening leveraged long positions in the futures market.The risks appeared higher in the derivatives market due to lack of bullish transactions. Lilly said the sell-off pressure has not subsided even after 6 billion worth of USD Coin (USDC) entered the market — a sign that traders want to use the dollar-pegged stablecoin to buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.“Right now we’re flying in no man’s land,” he added.The statements appeared as Bitcoin showed an extreme bias conflict short term, logging wild intraday price swings in the previous sessions. The Monday session saw BTC’s price get rejected by resistance at the $40,000 level. Currently, BTC is attempting to find support at $37,000, roughly 40% below the all-time high."
54,"The cryptocurrency sector has undergone a seismic shift in recent years as retail investors and publicly listed companies make their way into the space.Globally, estimates suggest that the number of crypto users surged by about 190% between 2018 and 2020.Record-breaking inflows into the market have also taken the number of active addresses on the Bitcoin network, as well as trading volumes, to all-time highs this year.On the face of it, all of this should be cause for celebration — and it is. But here’s the problem: While Bitcoin’s network is enjoying a surge in demand, it could be argued that the blockchain’s infrastructure isn’t keeping up.Bitcoin’s block size of 1MB means that this blockchain can only handle about five transactions per second on average. Extrapolate this to a 24-hour period, and you’re looking at about 86,400 transactions. Despite this network’s immense achievements, this makes it mathematically impossible for the blockchain to fuel global payments in its current form.All of this has caused BTC transaction fees to surge — and according to some estimates last month, they managed to break the record of $62 that was set back in December 2017. A dramatic drop in the network’s hash rate, linked to power outages in the Chinese mining hub of Xinjiang, were blamed. The consequences are obvious, as this means that the blockchain becomes too expensive for many of us to use… especially for smaller transactions.Solutions have been put forward, the most notable of which being the Lightning Network. But as Cointelegraph has reported, adoption has been slow in the three years since launch, with some users opting to endure pricy on-chain transactions because of the technical requirements associated with this L2 alternative.Back in February, research suggested that 88% of Bitcoin transaction inputs also end up paying higher fees than are necessary because they fail to use the SegWit format, which helps ramp up capacity. In the past, estimates have indicated that full adoption of SegWit could result in a block size of up to 2MB. We’re a long way off from achieving this — the latest data from TransactionFee.info shows that just 70% of transactions use SegWit, resulting a block size of 1.3MB.Of course, this isn’t just an issue that’s exclusive to Bitcoin. Ethereum has had its fair share of scalability concerns over recent months — compounded by the current bull market, the rise of DeFi protocols and the explosion in NFTs.All of this has led to a concerted push toward layer-two solutions such as rollups: Smart contract networks that process and store transaction data away from the main blockchain. Vitalik Buterin believes rollups will serve as a sticking plaster that will help the Ethereum network manage current levels of congestion — with improvement proposals also transforming the way that gas fees are calculated.But there are concerns that even the introduction of Eth2 might not be enough to ensure that this network is futureproof. As Matic Operations’ chief operation officer Sandeep Nailwal told Cointelegraph: “Eth2 doesn’t provide Ethereum infinite scalability. The best-case scenario is 64 shards with shards which can be similar to today’s Ethereum chain. Assume a single chain improves with PoS and has 50 TPS. Even then 64 shards can offer 3,200 TPS. The moment the supply of this TPS hits, the Dapps will start utilizing on-chain aspects even faster and the demand will rise faster. We will again end up in the same situation.”Some experts in the blockchain industry believe that the only solution to eliminating scalability woes is to build a network that can handle vast amounts of transactions from the offset.ILCOIN initially began as an alternative to Bitcoin but has now evolved to become its own unique blockchain network. This project shares the same base as Bitcoin SV, Bitcoin Cash and Bitocin itself: SHA-256.In March 2021, the blockchain service provider TAAL claimed that it had managed to process a 638MB block on Bitcoin SV — far beyond the current, theoretical limit of 128MB. That’s a sizeable improvement on the 1MB block size that BTC is limited to, and some way ahead of BCH’s 32MB block size.A 5GB block was produced on the ILCoin blockchain in 2020 thanks to the use of the RIFT protocol, which allowed the block size to increase without transaction speeds being compromised. This can be verified under block number 310280 on ILCoin’s Block Explorer.Overall, the project says that it can deliver true decentralization, all while outperforming speeds on the Visa network by a factor of 10.With financial institutions including Visa and Mastercard paying ever-closer attention to what blockchain technology is capable of — alongside mainstream banks — ILCOIN says it delivers unparalleled infrastructure that’s well-suited to the next generation of payments.Disclaimer.

55,"In the aftermath of the Mid-May crypto market sell-off, gold has seen significant price recovery.Gold prices continued to inch higher on Tuesday, hitting $1,887 per ounce at 3:00 am EDT, according to data from TradingView.Last week, gold reached its highest price level since Jan. 8 at $1,889, marking a four-month high after gold prices dipped to $1,681 in early March. At the time of writing, spot gold is trading at $1,882, up around 0.1% over the past 24 hours.The accelerated growth of the gold market came along with a major downturn in cryptocurrency markets that started on May 12. After topping above $2.5 trillion, the total crypto market capitalization started seeing consecutive slumps, eventually sinking below $1.3 trillion on Sunday, according to data from CoinMarketCap.According to Bob Haberkorn, a senior market strategist at brokerage firm RJO Futures, growing gold prices could be attributed to a weaker dollar accompanied by lower United States Treasury yields. “If the data comes out substantially better than expected, that would probably be bearish for gold because the likelihood of a Fed taper will be sooner rather than later,” he said.A number of financial analysts have drawn parallels between the trends in the crypto and gold markets, with JPMorgan experts suggesting last week that large institutional investors were dumping Bitcoin (BTC) in favor of gold.According to the bank, the new trend reversed a major bullish market driving Bitcoin’s price above $64,000 in mid-April. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $37,111, rebounding after touching $30,000 last Wednesday."
56,"With the hindsight of today's perspective on Bitcoin's (BTC) exorbitant energy consumption, it might come as something of a surprise to learn that the international non-governmental environmental organization Greenpeace was one of its earlier adopters.Back in 2014, the organization set up a facility for accepting Bitcoin donations, yet this enthusiasm has now cooled, as widespread attention has homed in on the climate risks posed by energy-guzzling Proof-of-Work coins like Bitcoin. Last week, news broke that Greenpeace had decided to scrap the facility, holding it to ""no longer be tenable"" in an era of rapid global warming. Much of this concern has been amplified by the fact that this year's unprecedented cryptocurrency bull market was accompanied by a corresponding hike in energy needs: skyrocketing prices led to a doubling of the Bitcoin network's energy consumption by March of this year, according to a recent study from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.In correspondence with Cointelegraph, Greenpeace USA media director Travis Nichols said that as the environmental profile of Bitcoin became clearer to the organization, Greenpeace did indeed decide to scrap its facility, despite the fact that the number of BTC donations it had received was not significant. Nichols contextualized Bitcoin's energy quandary within a wider perspective on global digital infrastructure, writing:Nichols noted that only a fifth of the electricity used in the world’s data centers currently comes from renewable sources — something that will have to be turned around fast if the internet's expansion and role in supporting economic growth are to be made sustainable.To push back against Bitcoin's growing reputation as a “dirty currency,” several industry participants have tried to draw attention to the fact that its energy needs are still overshadowed by those of the global banking system and even the gold market. A recent report from Galaxy Digital contrasted these aggregate figures to show that Bitcoin still consumes less than either, in addition to stressing that data from the banking industry on electricity consumption is significantly less transparent than that available for Bitcoin.However, analysts from outside the industry counter this by emphasizing the relative, not aggregate, figures. A blog post from the London School of Economics published today notes that “each individual bitcoin transaction uses the same amount of electricity as 778,988 credit card transactions” and has “the same carbon footprint as processing 1,218,903 transactions.”Nichols' bottom line was that the internet, like all infrastructure, will need to be powered by “clean energy sources that help, not hinder the crucial challenge of tackling climate change.” Those advocating for Bitcoin's potential to purportedly incentivize renewables adoption will have to prove their case, and fast, or risk the veteran cryptocurrency being “left behind” as the world enters the endgame of climate politics."
57,"The recent tumultuous price action for cryptocurrencies seems to be providing ample opportunity for popular anti-crypto bank HSBC to double down on its negative stance towards virtual currencies.Speaking to Reuters on Monday, HSBC CEO Noel Quinn said that the bank was not interested in running a crypto trading desk or offering cryptocurrency-related investment packages to its clients.Quinn identified volatility as a major reason for the bank’s decision despite the emerging trend of other major financial institutions announcing plans to open up crypto investment avenues for their clients.Earlier in May, investment banking giant Wells Fargo announced plans to debut a crypto investment product for major clients. Also, other major U.S. banks like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are in various stages of rolling out institutional-grade Bitcoin funds for their customers.Earlier in May, the New York Digital Investment Group partnered with fintech outfit Fidelity National Information Services to provide a framework for United States lenders to offer crypto trading services to customers.Detailing HSBC’s reticence on Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto in general, Quinn opined:The HSBC CEO also took a dig at stablecoins calling into question the reputation of the issuers as well as questioning the extent to which stablecoins in circulation are backed by structured reserves.Quinn, however, voiced support for central bank digital currencies stating that CBDCs could simplify cross-border payments.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, HSBC has a noted history of anti-crypto sentiments with the bank blacklisting MicroStrategy stock on its online retail trading platform. At the time, HSBC revealed that the move was due to MicroStrategy’s massive Bitcoin investment drive.Earlier in the year, the bank also reportedly blocked customers from repatriating profits from crypto exchange platforms to their HSBC accounts."
58,"In just over five years since it launched, Ethereum introduced the world to smart contracts, decentralized finance, yield farming and non-fungible tokens, and has long stood just behind Bitcoin as the second-largest blockchain project by market capitalization.Dogecoin (DOGE) is a meme cryptocurrency which has provided no innovation, has no real raison d'etre, and is only popular because it became the plaything of a famous multi-billionaire during the past 12 months.So naturally, as one might expect, the average citizen is already more familiar with Dogecoin than they are with Ethereum. That’s according to the results of a survey conducted by Harris Poll, in conjunction with CouponCabin, which asked over 2,000 adults in the United States to give their thoughts on cryptocurrencies.According to the survey’s findings, 29% of respondents said they were familiar with Dogecoin, compared to just 21% who were familiar with Ethereum.Of the total 2,063 respondents, 89% said they had already at least heard of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was already known to a majority (71%) of respondents, with Dogecoin being the second most well-known coin.Other digital assets that Americans claimed familiarity with included the stablecoin launched by Coinbase and Circle, USD Coin (USDC), of which 21% of respondents said they had knowledge. Some 18% of respondents said they were familiar with Litecoin (LTC), and 10% said Stellar (XLM) was known to them.When asked whether they believed cryptocurrencies would become the future of money, 31% responded positively, and 30% said they thought of crypto as “innovative.” At the same time, 23% of respondents said they regarded cryptocurrency as a get-quick-rich scheme, while 19% characterized the technology as shady or nefarious. Almost half (44%) of respondents said they’d be open to receiving cryptocurrency as part of an online cashback rewards program."
59,"The fallout from this month’s violent crypto market meltdown appears to have flowed into the stock markets, with publicly listed firms with exposure to crypto assets seeing significant losses during May.The month saw Bitcoin (BTC) and other leading cryptocurrencies crash by at least 50%, with BTC plummeting from roughly $60,000 on May 10 to bounce off support at $30,000 last week.The largest publicly traded firm by number of BTC held in its reserves, MicroStrategy saw its share price slump from $657 at the end of April to roughly $450 as of May 21 — a 31.5% drawdown in three weeks. However, MSTR appears to have benefited from Bitcoin’s 50% bounce from the weekend’s lows, having gained nearly 5% in the last 24 hours to last change hands for $472.45.According to Bitcoin Treasuries, MicroStrategy’s 92,000 Bitcoin have appreciated in value by roughly $1 billion in total despite the crypto crash.Tesla also took a beating this month, with its shares tanking 18%, from $709 at the end of April to $581 on May 21. TSLA has rallied 4.4% in the past day to last trade for $606.44.Despite Tesla suspending Bitcoin as an accepted method of payment for its vehicle fleet on May 12, the firm has yet to announce that it has sold any of the 43,200 BTC from its reserves. Bitcoin Treasuries estimates that Tesla’s BTC stash has increased in value by 10% since the vehicle manufacturer invested $1.5 billion into Bitcoin.However, not every firm that purchased Bitcoin in recent months is sitting in profit, with Chinese smartphone manufacturer and app developer Meitu having invested $49.5 million near BTC’s all-time highs during March and April. While the firm’s BTC holdings are now worth $35.9 million, Meitu has also seen its share price plummet 19% from roughly $0.31 to $0.26 since the end of April.Japanese online gaming firm Nexon also announced an ill-timed $100 million BTC purchase on April 28, with the firm’s Bitcoin stash now valued at just $67 million. Nexon’s share price has since tanked 29.5% from $33.35 at the end of April to $23.49 on Tuesday.However, some analysts believe the sell-off in the tech and crypto sectors may be exacerbated by concerns regarding inflation.Speaking to Reuters, David Mazza, managing director of leverage exchange-traded funder issuer Direxion, speculated that “Higher-risk assets, whether in the form [...] of cryptocurrencies or the more speculative growth stocks, are seeing their multiples taken down markedly as investors begin to reassess what impact the potential for inflation will have.”"
60,"Billionaire investor and famed hedge fund manager, Ray Dalio, has stated he would prefer to purchase BTC over bonds during a recent interview at crypto conference Consensus.Speaking on May 6 in an interview that was aired on Monday, May 24, the co-chairman and co-CIO of Bridgewater Associates describe Bitcoin as a superior instrument for saving than government or corporate bonds:Dalio added that the more savings that go into crypto, the less power governments have over ordinary people’s capital.However, despite emphasizing the benefits of investing in BTC, Dalio noted that “Bitcoin’s greatest risk is its success,” speculating that the recently surging popularity and performance of crypto assets may spark the catalyst for a sweeping government crackdown on the sector.“One of the great [...] worr[ies] is the government having the capacity to control [...] Bitcoin, or the digital currencies,” he said, adding: “They know where they are, and they know what’s going on.”The billionaire hedge fund manager admitted to holding Bitcoin in March after again predicting the U.S. may attempt to ban it. Dalio noted that the United States had attempted to prohibit U.S. citizens from owning or trading gold in the 1930s as it was seen to be a competitive threat to Treasury bonds.In January, Dalio warned of increasing regulatory pressure targeting digital assets amid the crypto’s impressive bull run, writing: “I suspect that Bitcoin’s biggest risk is being successful because if it’s successful, the government will try to kill it and they have a lot of power to succeed.”"
61,"Filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission reveal that major IT conglomerate Globant has become the latest big firm to invest in Bitcoin (BTC).The firm declared its crypto-asset purchases for the first three months of the year in a statement to the SEC made on Tuesday, stating:The company’s crypto investments and expenses were listed among its “intangible assets,” alongside licenses, customer relationships, customer contracts, and non-compete agreements in the company’s possession.Globant stated that it declares Bitcoin as an intangible asset because it “lacks physical form and there is no limit to its useful life.” It added that any gains made on digital assets will not be recognized until they are sold.Globant is an IT and software development company founded in 2003 that operates predominantly in Latin America but also has offices in the United Kingdom and the United States.Despite revealing the presence of Bitcoin on its balance sheet, the firm has not revealed the cost-basis paid for its BTC stash. However, with its purchases coming in the first quarter, any BTC buys made from the second week of February onward would currently be sitting at a loss.While numerous publicly traded companies have purchased BTC in recent months, many are currently underwater on their BTC buys. According to Bitcoin Treasuries, six publicly listed firms are currently in the red on their BTC acquisitions now that Bitcoin has retraced back to its early-February price levels.Japanese online gaming firm Nexon announced its $100 million BTC purchase on April 28, with the Bitcoin now worth $67 million. Seetee, a subsidiary of Norwegian energy giant Aker, revealed a $58.6 million Bitcoin purchase in early March that has declined in value to $44.9 million as of Tuesday. Chinese tech company Meitu, which announced $49.5 million in Bitcoin buys during March and April, has seen the value of its crypto holdings shrink to $36 million.Financial consulting firm Brooker Group is also down $2 million on its $6.6 million BTC buy, while enterprise cloud platform Phunware has seen the value of its $1.5 million Bitcoin stash fall by one-third since purchasing.Multinational investment firm BlackRock also appears to have lost 33% of its $360,000 BTC acquisition. However, the firm acquired the position in March as profits from a futures trade it entered into in January, meaning BlockRock did not spend any fiat to accumulate its crypto."
62,"Crypto traders were greeted by green markets on May 24 as the majority of altcoins saw their prices bounce back following last week's downturn that was the “largest deleveraging event since the March 2020 sell-off,” according to an on-chain report from Glassnode. After suffering the biggest monthly price drop in Bitcoin (BTC) history, bulls now look to stage a comeback with a significant amount of support forming near the $37,000 level, and within the last hour, Bitcoin's price pushed up back to the $40,000 level.The capitulation experienced last week was “one for the history books,” with data from Glassnode showing that the magnitude of realized losses on-chain “eclipsed all previous capitulation events” with a new all-time high of $4.53 billion in losses recorded on May 19 and $14.2 billion recorded for the week as a whole.The $2.56 billion in net on-chain losses seen on May 19 was 185% larger than the March 2020 COVID-19 sell-off, with data indicating that:Not all traders were caught off guard by the move, however, as BTC holders with coins 1 to 3 years old managed to spend their coins earlier in the cycle, “likely rotating capital to capture the price out-performance of ETH at that time.” These entities then stopped selling during the capitulation, while newer hands were seen panic-selling as they sprinted for the exits.Overall, last week's “historical capitulation event” resulted in roughly 9% to 9.5% of the current market capitalization registering as unrealized losses, which is actually quite small when compared with previous losses seen in March 2020 and November 2018.Short-term holders have borne the brunt of the market turndown and “currently hold aggregate unrealized loss of -33.8% of the Market Cap on their coins.”May 24’s price turnaround was a welcome sight for the altcoin market, which was hit especially hard during last week's sell-off.One of the biggest gainers on the day has been Polygon's MATIC, which continues to receive extra attention from the cryptocurrency community as it emerges as the preferred layer-two solution for the Ethereum network.The added focus led to a 100% increase in the price of MATIC on May 24 from a low of $0.837 on May 23 to an intraday high at $1.67, while the Maker's MKR token likewise saw its price rally more than 100% to a high of $4,174.May 24's market turnaround also resulted in a 30% gain in the price of Ether (ETH) back to the $2,500 support level, while Binance Coin (BNB) managed to gain 39% and now trades near $320.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.68 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 44.2%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

63,"North America’s Bitcoin (BTC) mining industry appears to be moving towards greater environmental sustainability after MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor brokered a successful meeting between Elon Musk and several prominent business leaders. Saylor and Musk both revealed Monday that the Bitcoin Mining Council has been established following the high-level talks. The council is made up of several industry leaders, including Argos Blockchain, Blockcap, Galaxy Digital, Hive Blockchain, Hut 8 Mining, Marathon Digital and Riot Blockchain. They’ve all agreed to “promote energy usage transparency [and] accelerate sustainability initiatives worldwide,” Saylor tweeted Monday.Yesterday I was pleased to host a meeting between @elonmusk & the leading Bitcoin miners in North America. The miners have agreed to form the Bitcoin Mining Council to promote energy usage transparency & accelerate sustainability initiatives worldwide. https://t.co/EHgLZ9zvDKSaylor also indicated that the new industry group is committed to pursuing broad environmental, social and corporate governance goals concerning Bitcoin mining, as well as educating the marketplace about how the mining process works.Musk, who was the first to tweet about the discussions, said: “Spoke with North American Bitcoin miners. They committed to publish current & planned renewable usage & to ask miners WW to do so. Potentially promising.”Spoke with North American Bitcoin miners. They committed to publish current & planned renewable usage & to ask miners WW to do so. Potentially promising.Bitcoin's price appears to have rallied sharply after the announcement circulated. BTC reached an intraday high of $39,960, building off earlier gains. Tesla's decision to stop accepting Bitcoin payments due to environmental concerns may have contributed to one of Bitcoin's worst-ever declines. Peak to trough, the digital asset plunged 54%, eventually bottoming at sub-$30,000 before recovering. In the process, Musk was subjected to severe backlash from the cryptocurrency community that he had just recently embraced. Although misconceptions about the negative impact of Bitcoin mining on the environment are nothing new, headlines about a Chinese crackdown on crypto miners in light of environmental concerns have weighed on investor sentiment recently. As Cointelegraph recently reported, several Chinese Bitcoin miners are already winding down operations in the country and relocating to more desirable jurisdictions. "
64,"The sentiment in the crypto sector is extremely bearish. On May 23, several altcoins dipped below the May 19 panic low, suggesting that traders continue to sell at every opportunity. However, Bitcoin (BTC) did not violate its May 19 panic low at $29,257.95, indicating buying at lower levels.John Bollinger, the creator of the Bollinger Bands indicator, believes Bitcoin could be forming a W-shaped bottom, which may have a good risk to reward ratio.In another positive sign, PlanB, the creator of the stock-to-flow Bitcoin price model, said that a large part of the selling has been done by traders who had purchased in the $55,000 to $60,000 zone in April. These traders dumped about 1 million Bitcoin in the $30,000 to $35,000 zone in May.According to PlanB, the whales have bought aggressively during the current dip, which is a positive sign as “1 million Bitcoin are in strong hands now.”Another insight about Bitcoin whale purchases was shared by Morgan Creek Digital’s Anthony Pompliano who referenced data from Glassnode. During the crash on May 19, Bitcoin whales owning between 10,000 and 100,000 Bitcoin bought 122,588 Bitcoin. Several crypto hedge funds interviewed by Bloomberg also said they had been buyers at lower levels.What is clear is that whales have been buying the dips. Does this suggest that a bottom may be in place or could crypto prices fall further? Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin broke below the $33,496.82 support on May 23 but the bears could not pull the price down to the May 19 low at $29,257.95. The long tail on the May 23 candlestick suggests the bulls purchased the dips aggressively.The buyers are attempting to build upon the recovery today and have pushed the price above the downtrend line. If the bulls can sustain the price above the downtrend line, the BTC/USDT pair could rise to $42,000 and then to the 20-day exponential moving average ($44,965).If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. That could keep the pair range-bound between $28,850 and $45,000 for a few days.Contrary to this assumption, if the price fails to sustain above the downtrend line, it will suggest that traders are selling on minor rallies. That will increase the possibility of a retest of $28,850. A break below this level could result in a fall to $20,000.Ether (ETH) dipped below the May 19 intraday low at $1,801.60 on May 23 but the long tail on the day’s candlestick suggests the bulls aggressively bought at lower levels. The buyers have extended the recovery today, which is a positive sign.The ETH/USDT pair could rally to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $2,724.05, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance. The moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover and the RSI is in the negative territory, indicating advantage to the bears.If the price turns down from $2,724.05, the bears will make one more attempt to resume the downtrend. A break below $1,703.77 could open the doors for a further decline to $1,547.46 and then $1,289.The first sign of strength will be a breakout and close above the 20-day EMA ($2,959). Such a move will suggest that the downtrend could be over.Binance Coin (BNB) broke below $233.81 on May 23, completing a 100% retracement of the entire leg of the rally that had started on March 26. However, the long tail on the May 23 candlestick suggests the bulls have not given up yet.The buyers are trying to start a relief rally that may face resistance at $348.70 and then again at $428. The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover and the RSI is near the oversold territory, suggesting advantage to the bears.If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the bears will make another attempt to resume the downtrend. If the sellers break the $211.70 to $200 support zone, the selling could intensify further and the BNB/USDT pair could decline to $120.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls defend the $211.70 support during the next decline, it will suggest that the correction may be over and the pair could then start a bottoming process.Cardano (ADA) again dropped near the $1 support on May 23 and the long tail on the day’s candlestick suggests the bulls purchased the dip aggressively. This makes the $1 level an important support to watch out on the downside.The buyers are currently trying to sustain the price above the $1.48 resistance. If they succeed, the ADA/USDT pair could rise to the 20-day EMA ($1.62) where the bears are again likely to mount a stiff resistance.If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the sentiment remains bearish and the pair could then consolidate between $1 and $1.63 for a few days.Alternatively, if the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rally to $1.94 and then to the all-time high at $2.34. On the downside, a break below the $1 to $0.95 support zone could result in panic selling.After staying above the 50-day simple moving average ($0.33) from May 20 to 22, Dogecoin (DOGE) broke below it on May 23. However, the bulls bought the dip and are currently attempting to push the price back above the 50-day SMA.The relief rally is likely to face resistance near the downtrend line and then at the 20-day EMA ($0.40). If the price turns down from either resistance, the bears will make one more attempt to break the $0.21 support.If that happens, the DOGE/USDT pair could drop to $0.15 and then to $0.10. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI below 44 suggest the bears have the upper hand.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA. In such a case, the pair could rally to $0.47 and then to $0.59.XRP slipped and closed below the $0.88 support on May 23, suggesting the bears are in command. However, the bulls have not given up yet and are trying to push the price back above $0.88 today. If they manage to do that, the altcoin could start a relief rally that may reach the 20-day EMA ($1.22).The bears are likely to defend the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from this resistance, the XRP/USDT pair could drop to $0.88 and then to $0.65. A break below this support could result in a decline to $0.56.On the contrary, if the bulls push the price above the moving averages, the pair could rally to the downtrend line. A breakout and close above the downtrend line will indicate that the downtrend could be over.After a brief struggle near the $26.50 level on May 20 and 21, the bears asserted their supremacy on May 22 and pulled Polkadot (DOT) lower. The altcoin dropped to $13.63 on May 23 but the bulls purchased this dip forming a long tail on the candlestick.The bulls are attempting to build upon the recovery today, which may reach the breakdown level at $26.50. If the price turns down from this resistance but stays above $15, then a few days of range-bound action is possible.A breakout and close above $26.50 will be the first sign of strength and the momentum could favor the bulls if they can push the price above the 20-day EMA ($31.93).Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the $15 to $13.63 support zone, the DOT/USDT pair could extend the decline to $7.98.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has witnessed a waterfall decline in the past few days, dropping from a high at $1,638.08 on May 12 to a low at $467.58 on May 23, a 71% fall in a short time. Generally, after such a sharp fall, a strong pullback could be expected.If the bulls push and sustain the price above $686.75, the relief rally could extend to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $914.71. This level is likely to act as a stiff resistance but if the bulls can push the price above it, the BCH/USDT pair could rise to $1,100.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from $914, the pair may oscillate between $467.58 and $914 for a few days. A breakdown and close below $442.96 will be a huge negative as that could result in a drop to $370.Uniswap (UNI) broke below the $17.50 to $16 support zone on May 23 and hit a low at $13. However, the long tail on the candlestick suggests the bulls purchased the dip.The UNI/USDT pair has started a relief rally today that could reach the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $25.22. The downsloping moving averages and the RSI near the oversold territory suggest the bears have the upper hand.If the price turns down from $25.22, the bears will make one more attempt to resume the downtrend. A break below $13 could open the doors for a drop to the next support at $10.Alternatively, a break above $25.22 could push the price to the 20-day EMA ($30.25). This level is again likely to act as stiff resistance but if the bulls can push the price above it, the pair could rise to $36.Litecoin (LTC) rebounded off the $118 support on May 23, which suggests buying at lower levels. The bulls are trying to extend the recovery today. If they can push the price above $187.75, the altcoin could reach the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $230.75.The downsloping 20-day EMA ($246) and the RSI near the oversold territory suggest the bears are in the driver’s seat. If the price turns down from this resistance, the bears will attempt to sink the price below $118.If they succeed, the LTC/USDT pair could drop to $95 and then to $80. This negative view will invalidate if the bulls push the price above the moving averages. Such a move could result in a rally to the 61.8% retracement level at $300.25.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

65,"On-chain metrics suggest Bitcoin’s (BTC) bull market is very much intact as so-called “no-coiners” buy the dip, according to popular cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo. In a series of tweets on Monday, Woo said the latest price correction for Bitcoin and altcoins mirrored the Covid-19 “white swan” event that allowed money on the sidelines to enter the market at discount rates. That means the market uptrend that began in October 2020 has yet to be broken, which should negate any speculation that the current four-year cycle is playing out like a “2013 double pump.”BTW a key observation here is that this is not looking like a 2013 double pump. It's so far it's structurally playing out like a COVID white swan where people on the sidelines took the opportunity to come in. (Other on-chain charts point to the same structure too) https://t.co/Pt4dcKchQ4“No-coiners are taking this opportunity to buy the dip,” Woo said, referring to a chart by Glassnode showing the rise in net entities on the Bitcoin blockchain.Bitcoin’s 2013 cycle was marked by not one, but two mania tops that were separated by a massive 83% correction. Several analysts have speculated that Bitcoin could be charting a similar pattern as 2013 following the most recent 54% dump. That dump was unlike anything we saw during the 2017 bull market that witnessed six price corrections of between 29% and 38%.Last week’s coordinated selloff allowed institutions and other whales to accumulate more BTC at discount rates. As Cointelegraph recently reported, Bitcoin whales accumulated over 122,500 BTC during May 19 price crash. Much of that buying came from U.S. and other Western investors, as evidenced by the larg BTC premium on Coinbase. Bitcoin price traded as high as $38,800 on Monday, according to TradingView data. It was last seen hovering just above $37,500 for a daily gain of 8%. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap dipped to a low near $31,000 on Sunday before staging a rebound. The overall cryptocurrency market rallied more than 19% on Monday, with the major large-cap altcoins reporting gains of 15% ore more."
66,"The crypto market bloodbath that is currently engulfing the entire industry will likely go down in history as one of the key points to remember regardless of whether the prices recover or continue going downward. To recap, the crypto market plummeted after a week of bad news as both Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the Chinese government threw spanners into the works of crypto miners, sending Bitcoin (BTC) all the way down to $30,000. This marked the largest-ever monthly decline in the value of BTC in monetary terms as it more than halved in value in comparison to the all-time highs of around $64,000. And where Bitcoin goes, the altcoins also tend to follow, and so they did.Huge liquidations have occurred across the board, so much so that the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market has dipped from $2.5+ trillion to just under $1.5 trillion since May 12, thereby showcasing a decrease of nearly 60%.Providing his take on the current state of the market, Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz opined that as Bitcoin continues to face a high degree of volatility — thereby discovering its bottom in the process — it seems as though it will take this yet evolving market a fair amount of time to consolidate and stabilize.Overall, in terms of what’s driving the aforementioned market turbulence, there seem to be myriad factors at play. For starters, crypto prime broker Genesis Global Trading noted that recently, many major Bitcoin sell-offs were witnessed thanks, in large part, to forced liquidations and leveraged closeouts.Furthermore, the recent price drops can potentially also be attributed to investors migrating their investments after news broke that China had allegedly banned its citizens from gaining access to any crypto exchanges and transacting using digital currencies.What’s going on with the crypto market, and where might the industry at large be headed in the near to mid-term? Joel Edgerton, chief operating officer of cryptocurrency exchange bitFlyer, told Cointelegraph he believes that a perfect storm of negative stories — such as Musk going bearish on BTC, Binance facing possible United States regulatory penalties, tax season selling, etc. — have swamped the crypto market and have generated severe fear, particularly among retail traders, adding:Similarly, Jack Lu, founder and CEO of interoperability-focused blockchain platform Wanchain, pointed out that with the digital asset market having grown quite steadily over the last six months or so, it seemed as though it was only a matter of time that such a correction would happen. He believes that once the industry is able to navigate this latest round of monetary turbulence, it will “recover all of its lost value and reach new highs this bull cycle.”Konstantin Anissimov, executive director at cryptocurrency exchange CEX.IO, believes that although the reasons for this latest dip may be manifold, the market is displaying an extraordinary amount of maturity to actively shrug off any incoming bearish volatility — a trend that was lacking in previous bull runs — telling Cointelegraph:Another subject worth delving into, especially in light of the recent market crash, is whether or not the crypto industry will be able to expand and grow as it has over the past year or so. On the subject, Lu opined that the decentralized finance market has gained a considerable amount of traction recently, with this segment’s total value locked and the number of applications growing exponentially.Furthermore, he also highlighted that with a growing number of blockchain interoperability solutions now making their way into this space, it seems as though the decentralized finance market will continue to grow and pique the interest of many new investors across the globe.In addition to the DeFi sector, the crypto market has also given birth to the nonfungible token boom, which according to many experts is a space that seems primed to evolve and keep growing in the future, especially as more and more artists, musicians and content creators continue to adopt these novel digital offerings.Lastly, it should also be pointed out that the use cases of blockchain are not only confined to cryptocurrencies, as in recent months, a number of countries including the Bahamas, Cambodia and China have all tested or launched their very own central bank-backed digital currencies. Therefore, the cryptocurrency industry is quickly moving beyond being a tool for speculative investment, as the great majority of tokens cannot be characterized as currencies or investment vehicles and, instead, could be utility tokens of various functions or collectibles.According to Daniel Peled, co-founder and president of Orbs — a public blockchain infrastructure — the current downturn is consistent with what was seen during the past bull runs, where there were also significant downturns in the short term, as he told Cointelegraph:He further highlighted that investors should bear in mind the fact that the crypto market has always been volatile, and it’s important to look at fundamental indicators other than just the price of an asset to make sense of the market. “Based on the major fundamentals, including the pace of adoption of BTC, the ongoing innovation in the Ethereum ecosystem, hash rate, and inflows vs. outflows, we are still in a bull market,” he added.Kevin Liu, co-founder of MetisDAO — a layer-two decentralized autonomous organization protocol — told Cointelegraph that much like the current volatility, the bull run of 2017 also saw multiple large corrections followed by triple-digit run-ups, basically suggesting that nothing out of the ordinary is taking place right now.Therefore, amid all the turmoil, it stands to reason that price volatility is an expected byproduct of large price moves but that staying calm against all odds could shield away from making a bad choice. Thus, it is best if individuals make decisions that are well informed and based on the technical/fundamental data rather than hearsay or an impulse reaction."
67,"The high-profile coin purchases by corporate entities like MicroStrategy and Tesla were credited in part with pushing up the price of Bitcoin (BTC) throughout the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021.Allotting billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin to their balance sheets had a knock-on effect on the stock prices of Tesla and MicroStrategy, both of which were subject to 340% and 808% pumps, respectively, from the moment their CEOs began stacking sats and posting crypto memes.But the glow afforded Tesla and MicroStrategy by their headline-grabbing Bitcoin purchases proved to be short-lived. After the share prices of both stocks peaked in early February, MicroStrategy shed value on its way to 64% losses, and Tesla went on to experience its worst losing streak in three years after losing 36% in the past three and a half months.Tesla shares were worth $580 on Monday, down from February’s high of $880. MicroStrategy’s shares were worth $448, down from February’s high of $1,272.Comparatively, MicroStrategy was priced at $140 prior to its first Bitcoin purchase in August 2020. Tesla shares were worth around $200 in mid-2020 when CEO Elon Musk began tweeting Bitcoin and Dogecoin (DOGE) memes in earnest.Bitcoin’s ongoing surge amid these stock losses could imply that traditional investors were less willing to gamble on Bitcoin’s continued success than those in the crypto space. Bitcoin climbed in value for two more months before hitting its recent peak of $65,000, and then it summarily crashed, eventually going on to record 52% losses before a strong rebound.Tesla and MicroStrategy’s failure to retain their gains from their Bitcoin exposure, and Musk’s failure to move markets the way he used to, could be a sign that the crypto space is becoming immune to such corporate meddling — or that the weight of the current market crash is too much for even Musk’s influence to reverse.Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin recently suggested as much, stating that the influence wielded by people like Musk would wane over time. “I do think that the markets will learn. Elon is not going to have this influence forever,” said Buterin."
68,"Wall Street megabank Goldman Sachs has initiated coverage of United States cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase with a buy rating following a major crash on crypto markets.In a note to clients on Monday, Goldman Sachs analyst Will Nance stated that Coinbase stock is the best way for investors to gain exposure to the crypto industry, CNBC reported. According to the report, shares of crypto companies like Coinbase should be regarded as a hedge against the parabolic volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC).“While we believe the core business today offers an attractive growth profile with the potential to drive new high levels of profitability, we see significant white space for new initiatives to drive more stable and recurring revenue streams to complement the core trading business over the longer term,” the analysts reportedly wrote.In the buy rating for Coinbase shares, Goldman Sachs analysts set a 12-month price target of $306, implying a share price increase of 36%. However, Coinbase’s longer-term fate will depend on the continued success or failure of cryptocurrencies as an asset class, the client note reportedly reads.Following the newly initiated buy rating, shares of COIN rose nearly 3.5% to over $235 in premarket trading. The stock debuted on Nasdaq on April 14 at a price of $381. The price rebound comes in line with a notable uptick on crypto markets, with Bitcoin surging more than 4% over the past 24 hours to trade above $37,400. The latest buy rating is not the first time that Goldman Sachs mentioned Coinbase as a successful stock. In late April, Goldman Sachs mentioned Coinbase as one of 19 U.S. stocks performing significantly better than the S&P 500.Previous reports in December 2020 suggested that Coinbase was looking to Goldman Sachs to handle its public filing. The latest news comes shortly after Goldman Sachs reportedly launched Bitcoin derivatives trading to Wall Street executives in early May."
69,"Bitcoin (BTC) could shoot higher if it completes a W-shaped bottom, says veteran analyst John Bollinger.In a tweet on May 24, the Bollinger Bands creator told traders to ""stay tuned"" for a possible lucrative continuation signal on BTC/USD.Last week, Bollinger called Bitcoin's rebound from $30,000 to $42,000 ""logical"" given the significance of the latter price level. Now, he said, that upper bound could be forming the middle peak of a W-shaped price formation — a double-pronged bottom followed by an exit to the upside.In this situation, $30,000 was the first bottom and May 23's $31,000 dip the second.""$BTCUSD is working on a short-term W bottom at a logical place,"" he reiterated.Bitcoin had gained around 6% on the day at the time of writing, hitting more than $38,000 before continuing to range on short timeframes.In further commentary, popular trader Crypto Ed likewise included the ""W"" scenario as a potential outcome. The other scenarios were less bullish, namely a $37,000 focus or a fresh dip to $34,000#BTC update

I'm seeing a 5 legs structure building here, which would imply more up after;
* a bit more up (37k?)
* an ABC correction (34k?)
* continuation up (41-42k) pic.twitter.com/uKptSiuNVzOn social media, meanwhile, other traders were hoping for a Bitcoin short squeeze to develop after repeated punishments for long traders.In a show of solidarity over the worst of the price dip being over, sources highlighted negative funding rates across exchanges and a three-month low in open interest as suitable conditions for a bullish comeback.Shorters would suffer from a breakout above the $42,000 mark, in particular.Additionally, Scott Melker cited the relative strength index (RSI) flashing ""oversold"" as cause for optimism. As Cointelegraph reported, the RSI is a key indicator for market rotations.""Potentially have the oversold daily divergence with RSI that I have been waiting for,"" he told Twitter followers."
70,"Russian lawmakers are reportedly weighing a partial reversal of the country’s ban on cryptocurrency payments.Pavel Krasheninnikov, chairman of the Russian Duma’s Committee on State Building and Legislation, announced that the government is considering amending civil law to allow crypto payments as a “contractual medium.” According to Interfax on Monday, Krasheninnikov noted that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) do not currently represent a legal payment method in Russia, which means that merchants are not required to accept it. The planned amendments would allow crypto payments in Russia under contractual law — meaning that such payments would be only possible with the consent of all involved parties:As previously reported, Russia enforced its cryptocurrency payment ban this January, officially prohibiting residents from making and accepting payments in crypto in the country. Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the Russian State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, argued last year that legalizing crypto payments would essentially mean the “destruction of the financial system.” Aksakov is confident that Russia’s not-yet-launched central bank digital currency is poised to be the “highest form of money” and will have become an integral part of national settlements by 2023 or 2024."
71,"The volatility of the cryptocurrency space was on full display again on Monday as several altcoins experienced gigantic price rebounds following the market crash of the past week or so.Two altcoins, in particular, doubled in value in just over 12 hours leading into Monday morning as Polygon (MATIC) and Maker (MKR) recorded over 100% growth amid a strong market bounce.Polygon had climbed from a valuation of $0.75 late on Sunday afternoon to a peak of $1.51 by early Monday morning — marking 101% gains in less than a day.The rapid rebound comes shortly after Polygon suffered 72% losses in less than a week as it fell from a valuation of $2.68 to $0.74 since Tuesday.A similar pattern was observed in the governance token of the MakerDAO protocol, Maker, on Monday. The coin price had risen from $1,835 on Sunday to $3,694 by Monday morning, equating to a 101% increase.Like Polygon, Maker’s miraculous pump follows a 71% decline since the coin hit an all-time high in early May, and a 63% decline in the past week alone.The intensity of the rebounds experienced by coins on the day appeared to be tied to the severity of their recent market crashes. As such, the altcoin market proved to be the ripest venue for day traders on Monday, many of whom could feasibly have doubled their money between supper and breakfast.Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) were subject to less dramatic rebounds, with the foremost cryptocurrencies gaining 17% and 32%, respectively. Both coins experienced less volatility throughout the duration of the recent market pump, and their subsequent losses proved to be less severe, with BTC and ETH losing 51% and 60%, respectively, since their recent all-time highs.Many traders rejoice in such volatility, yet the harsh fact remains that day trading is a full-time job, and according to some estimates, as little as 1% of day traders actually turn a profit."
72,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) general downtrend continued on Monday morning despite the coin showing a strong 17% rebound overnight. As the coin continues to nurse wounds from its recent 43% price drop from an all-time high, more turbulence could yet be in store for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market.Several large Bitcoin miners opted to cease operations in China this past weekend following the news that Chinese authorities were planning a crackdown on cryptocurrency mining.By Monday morning, three Bitcoin mining pools had announced plans to halt activities in China. BTC.TOP, which accounted for as much as 2.5% of the overall Bitcoin hash rate during the past week, said it would close up shop on the Chinese mainland and shift its operations to North America.Huobi cryptocurrency exchange’s offshoot company, Huobi Mall, also announced on Sunday that it would no longer sell crypto mining rigs in China and that it would suspend its mining operations there. Meanwhile, mining company HashCow said it would cease purchasing new Bitcoin mining rigs for the time being.On Friday, Hong Kong authorities announced an impending ban on cryptocurrency retail trading, in a move that would restrict trading to only accredited investors with more than $1 million in their portfolios.Three of China’s major trade associations released coordinated warnings against cryptocurrency investing last week. Telephone hotlines were set up in Inner Mongolia to encourage citizens to report any crypto mining activities they may have witnessed.Bitcoin’s hash rate — a measure of how much computing power is being aimed at the blockchain by miners — dropped 30% leading up to the commencement of China’s recent spate of warnings. The hash rate fell from 171 exahashes per second to just over 118 EH/s leading up to Saturday. This could be interpreted as a sign that miners abandoned Bitcoin when the China news landed, or, that they moved onto other more profitable coins amid BTC’s price drop.China’s renewed crackdown on the cryptocurrency space is nothing new, yet the superpower’s announcements continue to wreak havoc on the cryptocurrency space. Alongside Elon Musk’s earth-shaking tweets, China’s recent announcements have been blamed for sinking the cryptocurrency market — which remains $1 trillion worse off than this time just 12 days ago.However, given that many coins and tokens just jumped anywhere from 500% to 2,000,000% in perceived value in the space of months, and given that the forces of gravity are still in play, other explanations for the market crash are very much available."
73,"Bitcoin (BTC) is circling $35,000 at the start of the week after a fresh dip panics weak hands and fuels a whale feast — what’s next?After hitting $30,000 in a “capitulation bottom” event, a rebound to $42,000 had many thinking the worst was over for Bitcoin. The weekend proved them wrong.Cointelegraph takes a look at five things that could help set the trajectory for price action in the coming days.Throughout the May sell-off, one process has reappeared over and over — new coins flowing to old hands.In other words, those coins that moved at higher prices near to the $64,500 all-time highs have moved again at much lower prices. Their destination, via exchanges or otherwise, seems to have been large-volume investors (whales) or wallets with little history of selling.Long-Term Holders are stacking through the dip. pic.twitter.com/0cpKPiaAy8The phenomenon has been seen before during previous price dips, but the scale of the transfer this time has grabbed analysts’ attention.It was noticed by PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow Bitcoin price models, who argued that whales are now taking maximum advantage of new investors’ cold feet.He uploaded a chart showing at what price every single Bitcoin moved. For April and May 2021, trading habits are clear.“In the chart you see at what price level each of the total 18.7M BTC was last moved. So what happened in May? Weak hands sold ~1M BTC in May at $30k-35k .. which they bought in April at $55k-60k: a staggering ~$20B loss,” he explained.This panic selling appeared to be little match even for whales’ own clout. As Cointelegraph reported, large clusters of buy-ins between $50,000 and $60,000 were wiped out with ease as the market fell, this continuing all the way down to $30,000.“For bitcoin veterans it is indeed unbelievable and embarrassing, but for noobs this volatility can be too much,” PlanB added in separate Twitter comments.With that said, it will come as no surprise that overall market sentiment in crypto — judged by factors tha cover all participants — is extremely cautious.On Monday, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is measuring just 10/100, its lowest in over a year and even lower than during the $30,000 test.Fear & Greed, a crypto-based analog of the same indicator used for the wider economy, uses a basket of factors to determine overall market sentiment at a certain time.Its implications can be used to decide whether a market is oversold or, conversely, due for a correction at a given level.On May 12, the Index still measured 68/100, a fairly middling level corresponding to “greed” on the market but still with plenty of room left before a correction could take hold.The shakeout upended sentiment and therefore the Index, which subsequently fell to its lowest levels since just after the March 2020 cross-asset crash.“The more fearful, the better the time to buy,” Steve Courtney, CEO and founder of education resource Crypto Crew University, summarized last week.Courtney speaks for a growing number of longtime punters who argue that it is better simply to buy BTC at lower levels than give in to media narratives that focus only on short-term events.“I am holding the most $BTC I have ever had by far,” popular trader Scott Melker revealed this weekend.At the time of writing, BTC/USD is hovering at around $36,600 — 1.5% up versus Sunday but 20% lower than the same time a week ago.Traders’ patience is being tested. The initial $30,000 episode resulted in a rebound to $42,000, the site of February’s all-time high, but this failed to hold for long.Instead, Bitcoin dipped back into the $30,000 corridor after mainstream media panic over comments from China over mining and crypto-based commerce. These levels have endured as mainstream consumers are fed with more and more alleged risk factors.“While you’re concerned with FUD, Bitcoin simply continues to work as intended, securely producing block after block, like clockwork, following a deterministic supply schedule, controlled by no one, unstoppable since more than a decade,” Rafael Schultze-Kraft, co-founder and chief technology officer of analytics service Glassnode, countered on Monday.That “noise” remains especially audible from mainstream publications, among which the phrase “gyrations” to describe volatility has returned as the mot du jour.Schultze-Kraft’s words, meanwhile, echo the feelings of well-known crypto names, and while super-bullish short-term price forecasts are currently few and far between, there is similarly no doubt about the overall trajectory.Nonetheless, as Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards noted, BTC/USD is currently on track to log the biggest monthly red candle in its history.Few long-term indicators provide such a calming view of Bitcoin like stock-to-flow.Throughout the volatility this month, and indeed throughout all periods of volatile price action, stock-to-flow has remained the go-to resource for those seeking proof that it is all “business as usual” for Bitcoin.As its creator, PlanB, underlined in recent days, this time is no different. Even its correction of more than 50% versus all-time highs did not make Bitcoin violate stock-to-flow’s predictions.“Actual bitcoin price is at the lower bound of S2F model. Am I worried? No,” he summarized on Sunday alongside data from the model.PlanB explained that in essence, BTC/USD has room to range approximately 50% around the all-time high in either direction and still conform to expectations.“It is not OK if we stay at $32K for multiple months, but I expect BTC price to bounce back next days/weeks,” he added.That would even permit the record monthly downwick and preserve the bull market. As Cointelegraph reported, depending on the stock-to-flow model used, the current four-year halving cycle calls for an average Bitcoin price of at least $100,000. So far, it has never been disproven.The old adage “price follows hash rate” may need some extra time to prove itself to hopeful bulls.This week, Bitcoin’s network fundamentals are still making sense of recent events, and their impact on miners appears to be more widespread than initially thought.According to data from various resources including MiningPoolStats, Bitcoin’s hash rate currently measures 136.7 exahashes per second, around 30 EH/s below all-time highs.Other estimates put the hash rate more than 10 EH/s higher, but a precise figure is ultimately impossible to attain.Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s next automated difficulty readjustment, due in six days’ time, will open up mining to more potential hashing power, incentivizing miners to come on board.This may be sorely needed, as talk has turned to miners selling BTC en masse in recent days.“I’ve effectively been able to confirm this. Miner selling is a huge driver of price action here. Make of that what you will,” Nic Carter, co-founder of data resource Coin Metrics, said in a series of tweets.Carter touched on the China narrative and forecast that mining operations would indeed end up being redistributed more evenly — but that this would come with a temporary price.“Everything I’m seeing indicates an absolutely seismic shift of hashpower out of China and into the world at large,” he continued."
74,"During strong uptrends, every correction is aggressively purchased as the sentiment is positive and traders expect higher levels in the future. Therefore, corrections during a bull phase are shallow and the trend reasserts itself quickly.However, when the trend changes from up to down, traders wait to sell on rallies because they believe lower levels are likely. In a bearish market, support levels are easily violated and the asset continues to slide.Generally, a downtrend that is followed after a roaring bull market does not end before a capitulation phase where most bulls have given up on the hope for a sharp recovery. After that happens, the asset class bottoms out.In the midst of all the volatility, traders should keep an eye on the fundamentals and the long-term story of cryptocurrencies. Instead of panicking, they should take an informed decision.Let’s look at the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may attempt a relief rally in the next few days.Bitcoin (BTC) dipped and closed below the 200-day simple moving average ($40,235) on May 19. Institutional investors watch this indicator closely and usually avoid buying if the price sustains below it for an extended duration.Buyers pushed the price back above the 200-day SMA on May 20 but they could not sustain the price above it. This shows that bears are selling on rallies. The BTC/USDT pair could now drop to $28,850. This is an important support to watch out for because if it cracks, the selling could intensify further with the next stop at $20,000.The downsloping 50-day SMA ($53,500) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the oversold zone suggest advantage to the bears.However, if the price rebounds off the $28,850 support, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above the 200-day SMA. If they succeed, the pair could rise to the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern.The 4-hour chart shows the relief rallies to the downtrend line are being sold by the bears. This suggests the sentiment has turned negative and traders are viewing the pullbacks to overhead resistance levels as a shorting opportunity.The 50-SMA is sloping down and the RSI has been trading in the negative zone, indicating advantage to the bears. The first sign of strength will be a breakout and close above the downtrend line. Such a move could open the doors for a rally to $42,401 and then $46,000.Ether (ETH) broke below the 50-day SMA ($2,776) on May 19. The bulls tried to push and sustain the price above the 50-day SMA on May 20 and 21 but failed. This shows that traders sold on rallies.If the price sustains below $1,801.60, the ETH/USDT pair could drop to the 200-day SMA ($1,578). This level is likely to act as strong support. If the price rebounds off it, the pair could rise to the 50-day SMA where the bears are again likely to mount stiff resistance.If the price turns down from the 50-day SMA, the pair may remain range-bound for a few days. Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the 200-day SMA, panic may set in and the pair could drop to $1,289.09.The 50-day SMA is flattening out and the RSI is approaching oversold levels, indicating the short-term trend is negative but the medium-term trend is neutral.The pair is trading inside a descending channel on the 4-hour chart and the moving averages have completed a bearish crossover, suggesting the short-term trend is negative. If the bears sink and sustain the price below the support line of the channel, the selling pressure could increase and the pair may drop to $1,289.09.On the contrary, if the price rebounds off the support line of the channel, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the pair above the channel. If they succeed, it will suggest the downtrend could be over and the pair may rally to $3,000.Cardano (ADA) rebounded off the $0.95 level on May 19 and the bulls extended the relief rally on May 20 but higher levels attracted profit-booking and the price dipped back below the $1.48 support on May 22.The $1 to $0.95 level is likely to act as strong support on the downside. If the price rebounds off this support, the ADA/USDT pair could again try to move up to $1.48. The flattening 50-day SMA ($1.44) suggests a possible range-bound action.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink and sustain the price below the support zone, the pair could drop to the 200-day SMA ($0.77). A strong rebound off this level will suggest the markets have rejected the lower levels. The bulls will then once again try to push the price above $1.If that happens, the pair may enter a consolidation. This view will invalidate if the pair breaks below the 200-day SMA.The 50-SMA on the 4-hour chart has started to turn down and the RSI is in the negative zone, indicating advantage to the bears. However, the bulls are likely to step in and buy the dips near the critical $1 support.If that happens, the pullback could reach the downtrend line, which is likely to act as stiff resistance. If the bulls drive the price above the downtrend line, the pair could rise to $1.48. This positive view will nullify if the pair breaks below the $1 to $0.95 support.Solana (SOL) broke below the 50-day SMA ($37) on May 19 but rebounded sharply on May 20. However, the long wick on the May 20 candlestick suggests traders booked profits at higher levels and bears initiated short positions.The selling picked up momentum on May 22 and the SOL/USDT pair broke below the 50-day SMA. The selling has continued today as the price dropped to the strong support at $21.10.If the price rebounds off this support, the pair could attempt to rise to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $35.48. A breakout and close above the 50-day SMA will suggest the short-term trend could be tilting in favor of the bulls.Alternatively, if the price turns down from $35.48, the bears will again try to sink the price below $21.10. If they are successful, the pair could drop to the 200-day SMA ($14.29).The 4-hour chart shows the moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover, indicating advantage to the bears. However, the RSI has slipped deep into the negative territory, suggesting the selling may be overextended in the short term.If the price rebounds off $21.10, the bulls will try to push the price above the downtrend line. If they manage to do that, the pair could attempt to rally to $35.48 and then to the 50-SMA.Conversely, if the price turns down from the downtrend line, it will increase the possibility of a break below $21.10.Polygon (MATIC) has witnessed a sharp decline since hitting the all-time high at $2.70 on May 18. The altcoin has given up all the gains that it had accrued since May 11 and dropped to the 50-day SMA ($0.78).The bulls are likely to defend the 50-day SMA and if the price rebounds off the support, the MATIC/USDT pair could rally to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.53. A breakout of this resistance will be the first indication that the selling pressure may be reducing.On the other hand, if the price turns down from $1.53, the pair could drop to the 50-day SMA. The flattish 50-day SMA and the RSI below 45 point to a possible consolidation in the short term.This view will invalidate if the bears pull the price below the 50-day SMA. If that happens, the pair could drop to $0.68 and then to $0.54.The 4-hour chart shows the bulls are attempting to stall the waterfall decline at $0.80. However, any rebound is likely to face stiff resistance at the downtrend line. If the price turns down from this resistance, the downtrend may extend to $0.68.The 50-SMA has started to turn down and the RSI is in the oversold territory, indicating advantage to the bears. This negative view will be negated if the price rebounds off the current levels and sustains above the downtrend line. Such a move could result in a relief rally to $1.53.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

75,"Large Bitcoin (BTC) holders appear to be aggressively buying the dip amid the latest price correction, raising optimism that the coordinated selloff could be about to end. Using data from Glassnode, Morgan Creek Digital’s Anthony Pompliano recently concluded that the so-called Bitcoin whales — entities who hold between 10,000 and 100,000 BTC — purchased 122,588 BTC during the height of the market crash on Wednesday. Much of the foot traffic to crypto exchanges came from the United States, as evidenced by Coinbase’s $3,000 BTC premium at one point.Crypto hedge funds interviewed by Bloomberg have also reiterated that they were, in fact, dip buyers. MVPQ Capital and ByteTree Asset Management, both based in London, along with Singapore’s Three Arrows Capital, all bought the dip.Kyle Davies, co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, told Bloomberg:As Cointelegraph recently reported, at least one prominent whale, who sold BTC at a price of $58,000, has not only reaccumulated but added to their holdings. The unknown entity sold 3,000 BTC on May 9 before buying back 3,521 BTC in three separate trades on May 15, 18 and 19.The Bitcoin price languished below $32,000 on Sunday as traders continued to test the limits of a new bearish range. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization briefly fell below $30,000 on Wednesday — a level that appeared highly unlikely to ever be penetrated again — before quickly shooting back up to $37,000. However, overhead resistance has limited BTC’s rally to no greater than $42,000."
76,"Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider cryptocurrency experienced another wave of overnight selling which deepened on May 23 as the majority of tokens pummeled to multi-month lows. The market-wide sell-off resulted in the total cryptocurrency market cap shedding another $250 billion in value to $1.33 trillion. The total market cap has now experienced a 46% pullback from the May 11 all-time high at $2.56 trillion, but the stunning turn of events has left the vast majority of traders scrambling to lock in any gains experienced during the run up.This newest wave of selling pressure managed to successfully break below the $36,000 support level, sending BTC price as low as $31,000. Ether (ETH) was hit with a 20% drawdown in price that smashed its value back below $2,000 for the second time in a week, marking a 56% decline in its price from its all-time high at $4,362 which was established just 11 days ago on May 12.While the magnitude of the Bitcoin pullbacks is starting to diminish following several weeks of price declines, the continued selling has hit the altcoin market hard with Sunday's price rout shaving at least 30% off a majority of the coins in the top 100 as capitulation set in for traders from around the globe.Polkadot (DOT) fell more than 40% to a low of $14 and Solana (SOL) shed 36% of its value to hit a low at $19.Polygon (MATIC), which reached an all-time high at $2.68 just 5 days ago, has now fallen 69% and trades below $0.84 at the time of writing.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.285 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 46.9%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

77,"The dichotomy between centralization and decentralization in human history seems to be opposing forces gradually overcoming or being overcome by each other. And while one replaces the other, people are justifying both, finding philosophical or theoretical reasons for the existence of both of them.In the middle of the 17th century, British philosopher Thomas Hobbes published a book titled Leviathan (or, The Matter, Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil), where he formulates social contract theory. According to Hobbes, roughly simplified for this article, humans started from a summum malum — greatest evil — or a constant fear of violent death. People, driven by this fear, created a Leviathan, which is a state to which they delegate their power and the ruler promises them protection. This was the start of a prolonged process of centralization within society.French philosopher Paul-Michel Foucault in the middle of the 20th century went deeper into this process of centralization of power. In his book titled Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, Foucault uses the image of Jeremy Bentham's plan for the “optimal prison”: the panopticon. In short, it represents a government that seeks control over the biopower and humanizes the punishment practices by making individuals feel as if the guards are a direct part of them.And with that, the centralized system achieves its goal: the safety of citizens gradually rising over time, as Canadian-American cognitive psychologist Steven Arthur Pinker shows in his famous book The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined. According to Pinker, Hobbes’ Leviathan and Foucault’s panopticon, centralized, top-down, command-and-control structures and systems prove to be a working mechanism. But is it so?The extreme representation of centralized governments is, on both ends, communist and fascist states, which many cannot claim to be working systems of control, considering the amount of violence those highly centralized states seem to cause. Another example is the World Wide Web, which was originally developed as a decentralized platform. But look at Silicon Valley tech giants now: they control and monopolize all the data and value contained in the Web 2.0. And another one — central banks, which even last year printed an absurd amount of money, causing high inflation rates all over the globe.Related: Twitter, GameStop… enough! The world needs true decentralizationBack in 1990, Nobel Prize-winner Elinor Ostrom, an American political economist, stated in her book Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action: “As long as a single center has a monopoly on the use of coercion, one has a state rather than a self-governed society.” And she continues:We now have those theoretical explanations, thanks to the invention of blockchain technology. Decentralization is simply the process of dispersing power and functions away from a central authority. Decentralized or peer-to-peer networks are participatory systems that resist control by a single, centralized power, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum/Ether (ETH) being the most known examples of decentralized architectures and systems. It is usually difficult — if not impossible — to discern a particular center.Related: Digital decentralization is just the beginning. The real world will followLast year, the world witnessed the great rise of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, which has started a significant shift toward decentralization. Monopolized data, controlled by a few companies in Web 2.0, causes the redistribution toward individual users in the rise of the Web 3.0 movement, even to decentralized governance that is now theoretically, technically and practically possible.Blockchain-backed, driven decentralization can potentially redemocratize society by regaining trust in the election process, or as some argue, by protecting democracy around the globe. While blockchain cannot solve everything, it still has the potential to solve a lot of economic and social problems such as increasing diversity and inclusion, bridging the gender gap, empowering the unbanked and combating economic injustice.Centralization versus decentralization represents the law of the unity and contradiction of opposites, which is one of three core concepts of dialectics. One seems impossible without the other.Digital currencies were invented as decentralized systems, but then central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) appeared to counter the decentralization process, which makes some argue that they are killing the concept of decentralization by bringing back control to governments, not people. Others argue that CBDCs will pique the interest of the masses only if they regain decentralization at their core.The similar dialectical process has happened with exchanges, with some arguing that centralized crypto exchanges have the chance to lead the crypto space to the future, or even that centralization is necessary and that true decentralization comes from the roots of centralization. At the same time, some argue that decentralization has lost its meaning over time and it must be regained.Another dialectical nature of the dichotomy between centralization and decentralization lies in the crypto regulation space. While it’s obvious that crypto has no future without regulation, and that compliant DeFi is a must for an industry to mature and flourish, what could be at what stake by sacrificing privacy and leading toward financial exclusion?A circle has no end and no beginning, so the dichotomy of centralization versus decentralization should not be viewed in black-and-white, polarized colors. Finding a suitable consensus would be the best option. To find out what experts in the crypto and blockchain space think about this dichotomy, Cointelegraph reached out to them with the following questions: What’s your view on decentralization versus centralization? Would people embrace the more decentralized approach?“The world that we live in is actually very much centralized, meaning that there are natural elements, natural things that are decentralized; but society, the structure of a country, regulation, they are all centralized. So, it's always a mix and match, it's always yin and yang. And we're going back and forth.For example, gold is decentralized, but when companies that offer gold for sale or investment step in, they centralize it — whether it's the issuance of gold coins or it's the offering of gold securities and ETFs.Central Asian currencies started off as decentralized when digital currencies appeared. But when exchanges offer custodial storage, when exchanges offer trading, it turns out to be a centralized solution, if you will. But of course, there will be a continuation of more decentralized solutions, including decentralized exchanges, for example.But at the same time, there has to be some centralized nature to things just because some people want professionals to come in and do things right, even investment vehicles. So, it's going to be a mix and match. I don't think the world will completely go decentralized.”“With the development of blockchain scenarios, especially decentralized finance (DeFi), we can no longer think about the choice of decentralization or centralization from the perspective of maintaining the basic operation of a public chain. If a few years ago the underlying architecture of the blockchain was not yet mature when it comes to how to build a worldwide decentralized blockchain, then people would be more inclined to explore the architecture design and solution of decentralization of rights, that is the first principle. And with the main network of many public chains starting and maturing, more and more upper layer protocols and scenarios began to appear and be applied.It is no longer the first principle that some protocols or applications require complete decentralization of rights, as long as the underlying chain or scene ecology they are attached to is rights decentralized enough. These applications and protocols will pay more attention to a balance between decentralization and commercial operation, with commercial efficiency improvement as the first principle.When people choose blockchain, they will still accept more decentralized methods. As mentioned above, people always strive for the right balance between decentralization and efficiency according to the actual situation.”“The decentralized immutable and transparent blockchain foundation is the real magic of crypto, and will be embraced by those who really understand the value. Before Bitcoin, there were numerous attempts at digital cash, but the transactions were not immutable and trustless.The ability to transact in a trusted and transparent fashion without a central authority and the transparency to see the journeys of transactions to understand what is happening across the network isn't something that could be siloed or centralized financial networks can offer. If central banks want to gain adoption of their CBDCs, they should adopt a distributed architecture with transparency to encourage trust. Central bank-issued programmable money that can automatically pay fees or taxes without open transparency will create fear and drive more people to other cryptocurrencies.The explosive decentralized finance innovation that is taking place has experienced some growing pains, although we will continue to see this space evolve. When it comes to exchanges, there is value in centralizing the on- and off-ramps to traditional financial systems. It makes it easier to force a KYC process at the endpoints.”“From my perspective, I believe it’s clear that decentralization and centralization will exist on a spectrum in the future given both sides’ unique advantages and fallbacks — however, users will possess a true choice in terms of how and to what extent they embrace centralization versus decentralization.Within the current paradigm, users oftentimes do not possess complete control over their data — rather, it is fragmented and scattered around the internet throughout various platforms and databases. By developing key decentralized technologies — from data storage protocols to DeFi — users can take back control of their data and directly engage with each other for optimized benefits. As the ongoing DeFi boom has proved, people are ready for decentralization, and I believe it will only accelerate from this point forward.”“Above all, the product market fit and usability like a good UI/UX and low transaction costs (e.g., gas fees) are the most important factors of a blockchain.There are also different levels of decentralization, and what works for a user depends on their needs. For example, you could say DeFi on Binance Smart Chain is more centralized than DeFi on Ethereum, but it is still more decentralized than a bank.Under the hood, decentralization is critical for a layer-one blockchain like Nervos. It is the base for security and the reason why we are here today. Nervos was designed with a unique layered architecture that provides the security and immutability of a fully decentralized public chain, while also enabling users to scale on our layer two with varying levels of decentralization.”“Decentralization as a whole has the advantage that systems answer the needs of a broader group of stakeholders. What I appreciate about decentralization is the leveling effect for participants — both the technology and the control are distributed and can be accessed by all.People who have trouble with decentralization are generally those who fear a loss of control, as they are stakeholders in a centralized system. And with decentralized networks, there is no single point of failure like with a closed network that all rely on the same server; if a closed network’s server goes down, the service can fail.On a practical level, what we need in order to embrace decentralization is to communicate exactly how it solves real-world problems. When decentralized systems allow economic opportunity, such as for the unbanked and underbanked, or enable frictionless financial transactions for businesses in developing countries, there’s a real motivation to adopt. Worldwide at different levels, women are marginalized and excluded from participating in their own economic success. Decentralization can bring access to financial services and empower women economically, which elevates and improves the economies where they work, earn and live.Finally, the power of decentralized open networks is that it allows creativity and growth to come from everywhere, and specifically allows developers the opportunity to leverage the same technology while solving the problems and challenges that they see in their own region for their own users.”“Decentralized services are absolutely the way of the future. People are tired of their data and access being manipulated by centralized gatekeepers, and are opting-in to services that respect their privacy and put them back in control. Decentralization is going mainstream, and it only takes one interaction with that power to get hooked for life.”“We are living in exciting times, where we are experiencing a rapid shift from centralization to decentralization, as we reimagine the anatomy of our infrastructures. This shift to decentralization is happening within the workplace, transportation, retail, travel, currency, finance and beyond; therefore, this shift is impacting mostly all facets of life — positively.Consider this: We are working remotely, hopping in an Uber to get from point A to point B, and turning to cryptocurrencies as a means of value and exchange. We’ve even seen the decentralization of department stores and hotels, a la Amazon and Airbnb, respectively. That said, it’s likely that everyone reading this article has experienced this evolutionary shift to decentralization, in one way or another. Further, it’s likely we will continue to embrace this shift because of its efficient and empowering attributes.The efficient and empowering attributes of decentralization provide compelling fuel to sustain and support this increasing evolution. Decentralization is efficient and empowering because of its ability to solve for the historically asymmetrical nature of our infrastructures, where one side benefited more than another (many). Said differently, decentralization is here to stay, largely because of its bilaterally focused, incentive engineering. May the paradigm of win/win, win. ”“Decentralized is better, but much, much more difficult to execute and remain committed to over time, as most of the business world doesn't understand how to partner or work within a decentralized organization. But the benefits are substantial. This is particularly true in the massive creator economy, as creators have gotten the raw end of the deal while enriching big, centralized tech platforms. Being able to control their financial destiny and connect with their fans on their own terms has been a significant driver of interest in social tokens.100% decentralization is more difficult to achieve than some in our industry would care to admit. But I am fully committed to ensuring Rally becomes increasingly decentralized every quarter that goes by. The user experience for decentralized governance has improved immensely in the past few years, and will only get better. This model will become the ‘new normal’ in a lot of cases, as more companies turn to decentralized models guided by their communities, and people see how much more democratic it is for everyone to take the decision-making power out of the hands of a select few.”“I think centralization and decentralization are both a way of organization. We can't say which one is good or which one is not. In practice, we can both find a good application model. Under the management of the central government, China can operate efficiently and manage orderly. It can also deal with complex problems and find reasonable solutions.Many Western ideas are suitable for decentralization, and the development of democracy in the west is also very good. Therefore, different historical and cultural conditions and different scenes determine which way is more suitable for the national conditions. For the people, we still need to see what kind of organizational form can bring more improvement and convenience to their lives. This is the most appropriate way.”“I love decentralization. My incentive and my love for Bitcoin is around trust and freedom. A decentralized token like Bitcoin has so many people watching that we can trust it implicitly. The more centralized tokens that have a leader driving them are good as long as the leader is benevolent.”“In general, I consider decentralization to be the approach that is much more equitable and scalable. We believe that people everywhere will gladly embrace a decentralized approach… if/when they understand the tremendous value and opportunity being offered.”Cointelegraph China contributed to four interviews.These quotes have been edited and condensed.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors’ alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
78,"Individuals have different choices when it comes to storing their cryptocurrencies. They can use a hosted wallet (sometimes called a custodial wallet), which involves an intermediary (a host) that usually receives, stores and transmits the assets on behalf of their clients. For example, a centralized crypto exchange can be a hosted wallet provider, with which an individual sets up an account/wallet. In such cases, the value stored belongs to the account holder, but the funds are controlled by the wallet provider/host (pursuant to the contractual arrangement and instructions from the client).Alternatively, cryptocurrencies can be stored in an unhosted wallet (sometimes called also a self-hosted, or non-custodial, wallet), which is effectively software installed on a computer, phone or other devices. The funds in an unhosted wallet are controlled by an individual, without the need for an intermediary, similar to the real cash in a physical wallet. Users of unhosted wallets can usually interact directly with a digital currency system without the involvement of a financial institution, service provider or another intermediary. Users of unhosted wallets can receive, send and exchange their crypto assets with other unhosted wallets, or on an exchange platform, without revealing their identity. Naturally, transactions involving unhosted wallets are more difficult to trace and scrutinize for Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing compliance.Unhosted wallets have now started to attract increasing attention and scrutiny from authorities. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) — the United States authority with a mandate to protect the financial system from illicit use, money laundering and terrorism financing, and to promote national security — expressed the view that transactions using unhosted wallets increase AML/CTF risks. Its concerns also relate to wallets hosted by a foreign financial institution not subject to effective AML regulation — “otherwise covered wallets” — for example, from countries such as Burma or North Korea. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the intergovernmental policy-making body that monitors and sets international standards for AML/CTF rules, has similar concerns.Related: The United States updates its crypto AML/CFT lawsEven though data on public blockchain networks tends to be open and transparent, and could be used to help trace network activity, authorities like FinCEN do not consider this sufficient for mitigating the risks of unhosted wallets.In December 2020, FinCEN issued a proposal called “Requirements for Certain Transactions Involving Convertible Virtual Currency or Digital Assets,” with a broader aim to address the illicit finance threat perceived to be brought on by unhosted or covered wallets. FinCEN proposed establishing a new reporting and recordkeeping requirements, similar to the rules for traditional funds transfers.The new requirements would be applicable to transactions involving unhosted or otherwise covered wallets, including deposits, withdrawals, exchanges, and other payments or transfers of convertible virtual currency or digital assets with legal tender status (central bank digital currencies) through a bank or money service businesses (MSBs).According to the proposal, if a transaction exceeds $10,000 (or is one of multiple transactions within a 24-hour period that, in aggregate, exceeds that amount), the bank or an MSB will have to file a report with FinCEN and include certain information in relation to the transaction, the counterparty (name and physical address) and a verification of the identity of its customer. If a transaction exceeds $3,000, banks and MBSs will be required to keep records of the transaction and counterparty, including verifying the identity of their customer.Related: The crypto FBAR: Implications beyondShortly afterward in March 2021, the FATF issued a draft guidance for a risk-based approach to virtual assets (VA) and virtual asset services providers (VASPs). It recommends that virtual asset transfers to or from unhosted wallets should be treated as higher-risk transactions by VASPs and should be subject to enhanced scrutiny and limitations.Related: FATF draft guidance targets DeFi with complianceThe FATF also recommends that individual countries should understand how peer-to-peer transactions are being used in their jurisdiction, and what the potential money laundering and terrorism financing from such transactions. If these risks are considered unacceptably high, countries should aim to improve the visibility of P2P transactions and limit their exposure to them. They could achieve this through measures such as issuing guidance or imposing controls, equivalent to currency transaction reports or reporting of cross-border instrument transfers.The FATF is very explicit that its recommendations do not place AML/CTF obligations on individuals, but on intermediaries between individuals and the financial system. Therefore, pure P2P transactions would not be subject to those obligations. However, in the case of VA transfers where only one party is an obliged entity — like a VASP, and the other is an unhosted wallet, for example, the FATF recommends that such virtual assets transfers are treated as higher-risk transactions by VASPs. The FATF is effectively seeking to extend the application of the Travel Rule to VASPs if a virtual asset transfer involves an unhosted wallet.Related: FATF guidelines updated to combat money-laundering and terrorism financing in EuropeIf a country considers the risks from P2P transactions unacceptably high, the FATF also recommends mitigating measures including enhancing on-site and off-site supervision or denying licensing to VASPs that enable unhosted wallet transactions. Countries may also oblige VASPs to accept transactions only to and from other VASPs, or place additional recordkeeping and due diligence requirements on those VASPs that accept transactions with unhosted wallets. Countries are also directed to consider additional limitations, controls or prohibitions targeting unhosted wallets. VASPs could choose to limit or prohibit transactions to and from unhosted wallets, or to or from wallets that previously carried out P2P transactions.FinCEN and the FATF are not the only authorities seeking to close the gap on unhosted wallets. For example, Switzerland and the Netherlands have already introduced stricter controls.The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority already imposes stricter requirements on transactions above 1,000 Swiss francs (approximately $1,020) involving private wallets. These requirements include identification of the party, establishing the beneficial owner and verifying such party's power of disposal over external wallets.In the Netherlands, the Dutch National Bank (DNB) now requires that crypto service providers looking to officially register with the central bank must demonstrate their compliance with verification requirements under the 1977 Sanctions Act. It involves establishing the identity and place of residence of the counterparty, screening it against the sanctions lists and establishing that this person or legal entity is actually the recipient or the sender. This additional requirement has been met with a lot of criticism and is now being challenged in court.FinCEN and the FATF seem to have aligned their approach to unhosted wallets. Their proposals have yet to be finalized and have been met with intense debate and criticism. The FinCEN proposal alone received over 7,700 comments. Initially, FinCEN controversially allowed only 15 days for comments, justifying such a short consultation period with their foreign affairs function, significant national security imperatives and previous engagements with the cryptocurrency industry. However, in mid-January 2021, FinCEN reopened the comment period for additional 15 days for reporting requirements, and 45 days for recordkeeping and counterparty reporting obligations. By the end of January 2021, FinCEN further extended the comments period for another 60 days; comments were closed by March 29. On the other hand, the FATF consultation period ended on April 20.A number of concerns have been raised by the stakeholders, including legal, procedural, technical and ethical issues. There are privacy issues, since uncovering an identity behind an unhosted wallet would reveal an entire log of transactions recorded on a public network, which far exceeds the information that is being collected under the Travel Rule in traditional banking transactions. New rules would subject service providers to additional compliance obligations with regard to parties that are not their clients, and would also force individuals to disclose personal information to their counterparty’s service provider. It is not unlikely that some service providers would choose not to support transactions with unhosted wallets to avoid additional compliance burden, which would effectively amount to an indirect ban on such transactions.There are also a number of technical and operational issues with the implementation of these requirements. For example, DNB suggested solutions for screening counterparties that include screen sharing or video conferencing at the time of logging in, signing a transaction or sending back a small amount of crypto to the provider on request, all of which raise many issues on their own and seem unfeasible.New rules could also undermine financial inclusion as unhosted wallets provide opportunities for access to financial services for unbanked or underbanked population. Imposing strict controls on unhosted wallets could also complicate things like charitable fundraising in crypto funds, since the charities do not control who makes donations and donors often wish to remain anonymous.As the crypto market stands at around a $2 trillion market capitalization following the recent incredible bull run, there are a lot of interests at stake when it comes to additional compliance requirements. The stakeholders eagerly await the final word from FinCEN and the FATF.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph, nor the Warsaw University of Technology or its affiliates.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal advice."
79,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $34,000 on major exchanges including Binance as the cryptocurrency market's corrective phase continues.Large inflows of Ether (ETH) into exchanges were spotted before the latest downturn, suggesting that ETH whales might have led the most recent sell-off in the market.In the near term, the major macro level for Bitcoin and Ether remain at $30,000 and $2,000, respectively.According to traders like TraderKoz, if Bitcoin can remain above $37,000 throughout the weekend and recover to around $37,500, the chances of overtaking $42,000 become high.The $42,000 level is currently the major resistance area, and rallying above that would increase the chances of a newfound rally.However, if Bitcoin remains below $37,000, the likelihood of a range between $30,000 and $35,000 would increase sharply in the short term.Referring $37,000 as the ""midrange"" for Bitcoin, TraderKoz wrote:Eugene Ng, the head of business development in Asia at Gemini said that systematic algorithms turned short and during the weekend, Bitcoin and Ethereum are likely to see bigger drops to previous lows.He said:The market has been weaker than many traders expected, as technical analysts anticipated consolidation until the U.S. and London markets opened on Monday.It is crucial for Bitcoin to retain the $33,000 support level to avoid another test of the $30,000 support area in the near termOn May 21, analysts at Whalemap identified $39,931 as a large whale cluster after spotting inflows of around 115,000 BTC.Hence, to recap, $33,000 and $35,000 remains crucial support levels in the near future, while $39,931 and $42,000 are the major resistance levels.But, one silver lining in the market is that Bitcoin miners are currently not selling, according to trader Lex Moskovoski.He wrote:"
80,"As the spotlight returns to Bitcoin (BTC), helped by some tweets by a certain mercurial celebrity, the raging debate over its energy use has once again reignited. It centers around one, seemingly clear-cut question: Does Bitcoin use too much energy?The basic contours of the issue are clear. Bitcoin secures its network from a hostile takeover using proof-of-work (PoW), a process that expends significant quantities of electricity due to the computing power required. Every time we have this discussion, the all-too-familiar battle lines are redrawn.Critics argue that Bitcoin’s energy use simply cannot be justified. At various stages in recent years, reports have estimated that the network uses as much electricity as entire states such as Denmark or Ireland, for instance.Related: Is Bitcoin a waste of energy? Pros and cons of Bitcoin miningOn the other side of the fence, Bitcoin’s proponents contend that the network might spur the greater use of renewables. Furthermore, they point out that we are not accounting for the energy use of the alternative. We cannot gauge the relative efficiency of Bitcoin as a means to secure and exchange value unless we compare it with the total energy use of the traditional banking system. Just as we should move beyond the narrow metric of tailpipe emissions to measure the environmental impact of vehicles, Bitcoin advocates assert that we need a comprehensive audit of the environmental impact of traditional finance, including all the infrastructure, brick-and-mortar buildings, travel and hardware that support it. In addition, lurking in the background, are the other alternatives — what about consensus mechanisms such as proof-of-stake (PoS), the approach that Ethereum is transitioning to?Related: Proof-of-stake vs. proof-of-work: Which one is ‘fairer’?It is a fact, and noncontroversial, that mining technology for blockchain consumes vast amounts of energy. This is particularly stark when comparing the cost of producing and circulating currency.Bitcoin, for instance, is estimated to consume 123.77 billion kilowatt-hours of energy annually, compared with 2.64 million kWh for cash. According to Digiconomist founder Alex de Vries, if Bitcoin became the world’s reserve currency, global energy production would need to double.Others claim that miners will eventually gravitate to wherever energy costs are lowest, or become the green energy buyers of last resort. Whether the argument stands up over the long haul remains to be seen, given the degree of regulation in energy markets, the physical costs of relocation and the potential security implications of concentrating miners.Of all these arguments, comparing the energy use of cryptocurrencies with the traditional banking sector — or fiat, in particular — is relatively new. Comparisons with legacy payment systems, however, overlook the difference in transaction volume: While the Visa network completed over 185 billion transactions in 2019 alone, Bitcoin has facilitated 643 million since its inception. Furthermore, commercial entities like Visa are well integrated with energy markets, which are highly regulated in many countries. In the mental models where miners move en masse into new energy markets, it is highly likely that transition costs (as well as the resistance of incumbents) are being discounted. Again, these tendencies are not surprising, as cryptocurrency advocates tend to look optimistically to the future, imagining that markets work more efficiently than they actually do.Setting aside the non-trivial, highly complicated implications of energy use for the security of blockchains, the idea that miners will follow cheaper electricity prices does not necessarily mean cleaner energy, as cheaper is often dirtier. But even more importantly, the idea that miners will eventually just switch to renewables ignores the opportunity cost of energy. According to the United States Energy Information Administration, global energy usage will grow 50% by 2050. The emergence of unforeseen computational requirements posed by smart cities or integrated supply chains, for instance, will require blockchain to be more energy efficient — all while humanity needs to keep an eye on climate goals.Related: Blockchain tech makes sustainable development goals more achievableSo, while Bitcoin maximalists are undeterred in their belief that Bitcoin is the first best use for energy, and while proponents of Ethereum — which is moving to a different model, in part apparently due to energy use concerns — may think they have a long-term solution, the general public may not be convinced that cryptocurrency (and nonfungible tokens built on technologies like that of Ethereum) have a sustainable answer to the question: What will be best for society?Blockchain is now receiving mainstream attention, which gives those of us in the industry a chance to restate the problem in a way that speaks to all of us. Do we think the benefits of blockchain will be worth the opportunity cost? When it comes to memecoins built on mining chains — which are fads, peaking and waning in price with popular sentiment (and new memes) — and the many scams and imitations that have popped up (to the continual embarrassment of serious projects in this space), blockchain technologists are rightfully afraid the public will decide it is not.However, if we are discussing the benefits of new blockchain technologies that take resource use seriously and open new markets as the internet did, that is an entirely different matter. In that case, the correct comparison is not merely with the opportunity cost of staying with the status quo in finance but with the intermediated economy as a whole.While the debate about the efficiency of cryptocurrency tends to be dominated by the discussion of mining, less attention is given to the alternatives. PoS protocols sidestep the need for mining by changing what bad actors stand to lose if they try to falsify transactions. While with PoW such actors could potentially lose the energy they invested, on a PoS network they would forfeit cryptocurrency staked in advance. But this solution also comes with energy considerations.Suppose that some of these stakers are centralized exchanges: Their first incentive will be profitable trading, not monitoring the energy efficiency of the underlying blockchain. In this respect, we need to consider how information is disseminated among nodes. Mainstream blockchains typically use peer-to-peer gossip networks to communicate. Put simply, such networks pass transaction data from node to node until it is known by all participants. As a result, however, the same message may be repeatedly sent to peers who have already received it from others, wasting resources. And the protocols that assume that security and transaction volume will be able to attract a sufficiently large number of nodes to maintain accuracy in some fashion — whether they are new delegated PoS protocols, directed acyclic graphs, layer-two solutions or cross-chain bridges — are similar to PoW in their assumption that the correct transactions will be confirmed and propagated wherever the network needs that information to be.However, if we manage to overcome the limitations of gossip networks, a whole new world opens up. For instance, nodes on Geeq blockchains use a hub-and-spoke structure to communicate, in order to transmit a minimal set of messages without defaulting to a centralized power structure. Any honest (and potentially anonymous) node may serve as a hub for one block and communicate with the nodes on that blockchain’s active node list (the nodes that happen to be on active spokes).Unlike a gossip network, where each node sends messages (gossips) to every node around it, meaning that a particular node could receive the same message redundantly from all of its gossiping buddies, this structure results in messaging that is parsimonious, predictable and verifiable. As a result, the use of resources is lower by magnitudes compared with PoW or PoS based protocols, bringing computation, bandwidth and storage costs per transaction as low as a hundredth of a cent, making micropayments feasible.Furthermore, future blockchain architecture will need to be multichain and flexible, providing a set of parameters that can be adjusted according to the specific requirements — such as speed, transaction throughput or security — of a given use case. A more lightweight, “smarter” blockchain would certainly have a smaller environmental footprint, but it would also be easier to adopt, and could even provide the underlying infrastructure for more sustainable societies.One promising application in this regard is P2P energy trading. Currently, large utility companies supply entire cities with electricity through centralized networks. However, smart cities in the future could rely on a more flexible web of microgrids instead. To satisfy local consumption, these localized, autonomous electricity networks would use mainly local sources like power generators or photovoltaic panels.Related: Talking digital future: Smart citiesBlockchain technology has always been a promising way to execute, validate and record P2P energy transactions, letting anyone on a local microgrid become either a producer or a buyer of electricity. However, up until now, the technology has not been up to the challenge. In order for the market to work well, units of energy as low as a few kilowatts would need to be traded, which would equate to a monetary value of just a few cents. Such transactions are infeasible given current blockchain transaction fees. When transaction costs are fractions of a cent, however, this hurdle would be eliminated. In turn, this would allow blockchain to serve as the technological bedrock of smart cities, allowing millions of Internet of Things devices like smart meters or solar panels to seamlessly interact and interface with digital wallets, often without human intervention.For example, before going to work in the morning, you could charge your electric vehicle from the energy gathered from photovoltaic panels installed on your roof. Later you may decide to sell unused electricity to your neighbors before going on a vacation. It would also be possible to set up networkwide demand response rules, written in smart contracts. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, for instance, the cost of “vampire electricity” consumed by plugged-in but unused devices is circa $165 per household, amounting to 4.6% of the total residential electricity production in the United States. Hence, an electric toothbrush left on the charger would be turned off during certain time periods automatically. To override network rules, you would need to pay a small compensatory fee, incentivizing producers to offset extra demand while discouraging users from wasting energy.In addition, blockchain-based applications — decentralized applications, or DApps — may be built to ensure the traceability of clean energy. Thus, when purchasing electricity, you could check via an app whether it came from a sustainable source. Empowering the consumer to make these decisions is only possible with decentralized technology; otherwise, intermediaries will be able to distort markets to their own tastes. With the rise of global environmental consciousness, traceability may become a key tool to incentivize the production of renewable energy.With such a drastic growth in global energy consumption predicted, it is easy to see why blockchain’s environmental footprint is coming under scrutiny. However, it is also important not to throw out the baby with the bathwater.As well as taking a holistic view of the relative energy consumption of blockchain compared with traditional finance, we should begin a wider discussion about the net positives and negatives of the technology for society more broadly. In order for blockchain to fulfill its transformative potential, underpin smart cities and support low-carbon economies, we need to focus on developing smarter, more affordable blockchain architecture.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
81,"A versatile asset, Bitcoin can wear multiple hats, including its function as a currency. One Nigerian on Twitter recently detailed how Bitcoin has helped him overcome a slew of monetary difficulties. “Growing up in Nigeria, I see #Bitcoin with a different lens than you do if you grew up in the US for example,” said the CEO of Bitnob, Bernard Parah, in a tweet on Thursday. His tweet was part of a thread detailing a bevvy of monetary difficulties, pointing toward Bitcoin as a solution.“You cannot spend more than $100 on international sites using your card - You can't spend your own money, you can't buy that PS5 if you wanted to because of monetary controls,” Parah explained as one difficulty.“You got lucky to go abroad, find some work and want to send money home to mom but have to pay ridiculous fees to do that. If it's an emergency, those funds might not get there on time,” he noted as another example.Money in the world can be siloed, especially when it comes to crossing borders. Sending bank wires requires transacting during banking hours, while other forms of money transfer take time to settle on the backend and may require personal information in the process. Bitcoin, on the other hand, works pseudonymously, without regard for borders or hours of operation.Inflation can also be a problem in some countries, so storing native currency can be an issue, which Parah also mentioned in one of the tweets. Parah also pointed toward the control financial institutions have if money is stored with them. “Having your bank accounts blocked because you took part in or donated to a protest,” he posted as a difficulty suffered by younger folks. “If they own the money, they own you.”After noting the internet’s improvements on the world, as well as the existence of web-based currency, he added: “This allows us to be global citizens from day 1, to trade with the world, to enjoy the prosperity being shared on the internet.” He also noted: “While you see magic internet money, what we see is a shot at freedom, a shot at prosperity and we don't plan to stop going for this.” Parah covered a number of other points in his tweet thread.#Bitcoin allows us to build a future for where one might never need to open a bank account in order to participate in commerce with anyone around the world.

The internet has changed our lives, mostly for the better. Now we have money that works on the internet"
82,"This is Part One of a multipart series that aims to answer the following question: What is the “fundamental value” of Bitcoin? Part One is about the value of scarcity, Part Two — the market moves in bubbles, Part Three — the rate of adoption, and Part Four — the hash rate and the estimated price of Bitcoin.In recent months — and throughout 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic and its negative effects on the economy — central banks around the world have issued unprecedented quantities of money in order to try to counter an inevitable economic crisis. We live in a world where each generation of newly issued money, printed by central banks, leads to inflation, or the reduction of the purchase value of the currency itself and consequently, an increase in the price of goods.To give an example, last year alone the amount of U.S. dollars printed equals almost 20% of all dollars generated throughout time, based on the registered value of the money supply of dollars in the world. 20% in a single year is absurd, only made possible by breaking the pact that obligates governments to keep the dollar quantity in circulation linked to the quantity of gold in the central bank’s vaults (the famous 1971 Bretton Woods Pact).Consequently, the more dollars that are printed, the more we can see their worth decreasing over time. The opposite of inflation is deflation — in other words, as time passes, the more a currency appreciates and its purchasing power grows.It is important to understand that Bitcoin (BTC) was designed to grow in value indefinitely. I say this because the smallest quantity, known as a satoshi, is equal to 0.00000001 Bitcoin. It’s obvious that its creator imagined a deflationary system for his creation, one that could help it reach ever-increasing values. In the moment that a satoshi has grown to be worth a U.S. dollar, a Bitcoin will equal $100,000,000. This is the value that Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind for his own Bitcoin.Not immediately, obviously, and not even in the short term. The path will likely be long and paved with several bubble bursts. Only the most courageous and tenacious who resist will succeed in the enterprise. But alas, this is the story of the financial markets.Because there are 7 billion people in the world, and there can only be 21 million Bitcoin circulating at the end of its generation cycle. As of 2020, it is estimated that around 20 million people worldwide have more than a million dollars of wealth — do you think there is enough Bitcoin for all these rich people? Many of them won’t be able to own a whole Bitcoin because getting one will cost too much in a few years, and because those who own them would never think about selling them. This is the phenomenon of scarcity.Whereas we are used to inflation, or the increasing amount of money being printed by central banks, this doesn’t exist in the crypto world. In some cases, there are special cryptocurrencies that are designed to decrease the number of tokens in circulation over time.Scarcity, coupled with an increasing circulation of cryptocurrencies, is the main reason why the price tends to rise and will continue to do so over time. You understand now that owning an entire Bitcoin will be a luxury that only a few people will be able to afford, at most a few million people — given that the first million is rumored to be firmly deposited in Satoshi's wallets.Related: 4 reasons why the top 15 richest Bitcoin wallets still matter in 2021This is the most concrete possibility we know of in terms of getting rich fast, in a relatively short amount of years. Still, for a small group of people the scenario of becoming millionaires thanks to cryptocurrencies (about 100,000 in the world) has already happened.The concept of scarcity is well present and known in commodities, such as with gold, silver, palladium or platinum. These precious materials are all the more precious the more scarce their production is. But is there a mathematical model that can estimate what the correct value of goods should be, based on its scarcity?If we think about phenomena such as Ferrari, Rolex, ancient paintings by famous painters, etc... all these assets are valued significantly higher than their cost of realization due to their scarcity — induced or generated — by those who created the assets themselves, just like Bitcoin. In fact, there is a mathematical model known as stock-to-flow, or SF, that estimates price based on the quantity already present in the world (stock) with the quantity that is extracted every year (flow).The smaller the quantity extracted every year, the higher the value the precious metal has. And since it takes many years to double the stock currently in circulation, it itself has value because it is scarce.In this table, SF is measured as years required for the current stock to double. As you can see, gold is extracted at an amount of 1.8% per year compared with the current stock, so its total value is greater than the other commodities.This relationship is more evident if the relationship between market value and supply growth is applied to a power diagram (Cartesian plane with both axes using a logarithmic scale).From this graph, you can clearly see that there is a power law governing the scarcity of goods along with their overall market value. The power law is deduced by how linear the existing relationship manifests on a Cartesian plane with both logarithmic axes, as shown in the previous figure.Does this law also apply to Bitcoin, designed to have an ever-increasing stock-to-flow ratio? (i.e., an ever-decreasing number of Bitcoin mined over time).From the graph, it is clear that even Bitcoin, albeit with a different scale, follows the same power law.The three breaks in the graph represent the three halvings, a phenomenon of halving mined Bitcoin that occurs approximately every four years, which makes Bitcoin increasingly scarce compared with the stock in circulation.From this graph, we can see that the value of $20 trillion is anything but impossible to achieve, and indeed, it is only a matter of time — once the percentage of Bitcoin mined in a single year will be equal to or less than 1%, a situation that will occur at the next halving in 2024.This article was co-authored by Ruggero Bertelli and Daniele Bernardi.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

83,"In bull and bear markets, wise cryptocurrency investors know that the primary focus should be on project longevity rather than jumping on every short-term price movement. As the crypto ecosystem expands and new sectors arise, protocols that offer the most value to the community stand the best chance at long-term survival and price appreciation.The goal of this newsletter is to take a more thematic, macro view of niche sub-sectors within the cryptocurrency market and identify projects whose signal they will be successful within the space.It isn’t about the token price; it’s about the tech, the fundamentals of the project, and how each one must help push the sector forward to the next level.In a recent conversation with Cointelegraph, Élie Le Rest, partner at digital asset management firm ExoAlpha, said: “Sector trends and crypto are big and are here to stay, but idiosyncratic risk must be taken into account while weighing portfolios.”According to Le Rest, the “crypto market tends to work on comparable principles,” which is a repeating trend seen multiple times in its history.With that said, let’s take a deeper dive into the current market cycle rotation taking place in the wider crypto market to get a better grasp on where new money and participants coming into the market are beginning to focus their attention.Layer-one is a term used to describe the main underlying blockchain architecture of a network, while layer-two solutions are protocols that operate on top of the underlying L1 blockchain and cannot function without the framework that they provide.Bitcoin is by far the dominant L1 solution in terms of value, while the Ethereum network has been fundamental in reshaping the crypto market landscape over the past few years thanks to smart contracts and the rise of sectors such as decentralized finance and nonfungible tokens.While Ethereum has received a majority of the attention when it comes to discussions about smart contract platforms, several projects have been rising in prominence of late as high fees and a low transaction-per-second count on the Ethereum network have enticed projects to build on up-and-coming networks.Ethereum’s success has demonstrated to the world the capabilities of smart contract platforms, but its continued struggles have opened the door for protocols like Polkadot, Solana and Cosmos, which offer a similar value proposition along with solutions to the underlying problems mentioned, to grow in terms of price and relevance over the past year.Polkadot has become one of the most well-known and successful L1 projects in the crypto space besides Ethereum in 2021 thanks in large part to the project’s approach of interoperability and cooperation as opposed to the previous “Ethereum killer” approach taken by many.Created in part by Gavin Wood, who also played an instrumental role in the creation of Ethereum, the Polkadot network has taken a more complementary approach as an open-source sharding multichain protocol that enables cross-chain bridges so that projects and developers can choose the network that best suits their needs and easily transfer their protocols if necessary.Not limited to just tokens, Polkadot’s multi-chain functionality enables the cross-chain transfer of any data or asset types, helping to establish a wide range of interoperability between separate blockchain networks.Polkadot’s ecosystem is one of the largest and most active in the space, with a rapidly expanding list of projects launching on the protocol and looking to obtain one of the limited parachain slots in the upcoming parachain auctions.As seen in the graphic above, the Polkadot ecosystem has rapidly expanded to incorporate the major sectors of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, including DeFi platforms, nonfungible token protocols, oracles and decentralized autonomous organizations.The network also has a growing list of applications that facilitate interacting with the protocol, including a wide range of wallets that support Polkadot’s DOT and Polkadot-based assets, as well as multiple network explorers, including Polkascan.Popular projects that are currently operating on the Polkadot testnet and are favored to win a parachain slot include DeFi ecosystem Acala Network and the Polkaswap decentralized exchange, which are both available now for testing and can be accessed using the Polkadot-js wallet browser extension.Once the parachain auctions are finished and the projects go live on Polkadot, the network’s launch will officially be complete. While there is no definitive date yet set for when the parachain auctions will begin, excitement for DOT has continued to build, which has translated into its price increasing more than 800% in 2021.With the prospect of full network capabilities set to launch within a period of weeks to months and mainstream attention beginning to arrive, many investors feel that Polkadot is well-positioned to see further growth in price and adoption as a key player in the future of interoperability across blockchain networks.Solana is a fast, secure and censorship-resistant blockchain network that “provides the open infrastructure required for global adoption,” according to the project’s website.The project’s connection with the FTX cryptocurrency exchange and its CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, who also had a hand in the creation and operation of the Serum decentralized exchange, which operates on the Solana network, has been beneficial for the protocol in terms of financial backing and media exposure.Aside from those positive associations, the underlying technology of the Solana network has attracted the attention of a wide range of projects interested in launching or bridging to its high-speed, low-cost environment.The rapid expansion of the Solana ecosystem over the past year began with a focus on decentralized finance and has been bolstered by the success of the Serum, which users can interface with using several wallets that support Solana, including Sollet, Ledger and Math Wallet.While a majority of the tools and supporting infrastructure on the network have been geared toward DeFi, recent additions to the network, such as the decentralized music-sharing and streaming protocol Audius, show that the protocol is beginning to branch out and attract the attention of other types of projects interested in its capabilities.The Solana protocol utilizes an innovative hybrid model consisting of a proof-of-history consensus combined with the underlying proof-of-stake consensus of the blockchain to increase the network’s overall scalability.More recently, the network has seen a number of new projects launch that have employed some of the same tactics that drummed up activity and enthusiasm on the Ethereum network in 2017, including airdrops and copycat projects.While some may see this as a negative, it demonstrates the increased adoption and allure of a low-cost environment as well as showing that Solana is a developer-friendly network.These influences, combined with a multitude of other factors, have helped boost the price of Solana (SOL) by more than 3,200% so far in 2021.Given that DeFi and other hot sectors of the cryptocurrency sector still in their infancy, Solana is well equipped to see its ecosystem expand and token value increase as global cryptocurrency adoption increases.Cosmos refers to itself as “the internet of blockchains” consisting of “an ever-expanding ecosystem of interconnected apps and services, built for a decentralized future.”The network arose out of the Tendermint project, which is considered “the gateway to the Cosmos ecosystem” and launched via a token sale in 2017. The protocol utilizes a PoS consensus algorithm that allows token holders to stake their coins to help keep the project’s flagship blockchain Cosmos Hub secure, while also earning a yield that is paid out in Cosmos (ATOM) tokens.Momentum for the project in 2021 was kicked up a notch in February following the Stargate update, which included the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol, an interoperability layer for Cosmos blockchains.The IBC allows projects built with the Cosmos software development kit, like Kava and Band Protocol, to easily interoperate and bridge tokens across other blockchains on the Cosmos network, which currently hosts more than 240 apps and services.The capabilities of the IBC will eventually connect with other blockchain networks, such as the Binance Smart Chain, helping to increase interoperability across the cryptocurrency ecosystem.With a transaction speed of 7 seconds and an average fee of $0.01, transacting on the Cosmos network is a welcome experience for users fleeing high fees on Ethereum.The May 10 completion of the Gravity decentralized exchange testnet trading competition shows the protocol is gearing up to offer solutions similar to Uniswap for a fraction of the fees, hinting at a promising future for this growing ecosystem.Growing ecosystems and the planned development and integration of interoperability features are strong indicators of longevity for layer-one projects in the rapidly growing cryptocurrency space.Potential threats to the success of L1 solutions include projects, such as Polygon and Fantom, which provide cross-chain bridges to other more capable networks and L2 solutions that eliminate the scaling issues that plague the Ethereum network.While these threats are real, each network or protocol will eventually run into its own unique set of challenges that hamper its capabilities and open the door for competitors to offer a better solution.Ethereum introduced the world to smart contracts and expanded the scope of what could be done on L1 solutions beyond what was previously achievable on Bitcoin.Limitations in the original and current design of the Ethereum network have opened the door for newer L1 solutions like Polkadot, Solana and Cosmos to establish themselves as viable contenders thanks to faster transaction times and an already-established proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

84,"On May 21 the crypto market was hit with a fresh round of fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) which sparked another, albeit more muted, sell-off in Bitcoin (BTC) price and a majority of the altcoins. For the second time in less than 3-weeks, China was again the culprit as rumors that regulators were looking to crack down on Bitcoin mining and trading. Media also reported that authorities in Hong Kong proposed banning retail traders from cryptocurrency trading.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that Bitcoin (BTC) bulls were holding the $40,000 support level prior to the announcement from China but quickly lost it and had to regroup at the $36,000 support before further downside ensued.While the turnaround seen across the market on Thursday helped assuage fears of the return to a crypto winter, some analysts, including Jarvis Labs co-founder Ben Lilly, correctly assessed that “we are not out of the woods” prior to Friday’s drawdown. Still, there is room for hope that the price of BTC could manage to hold its ground and climb higher as activity seen in whale wallets showed heavy inflows at $39,931, indicating a new possible level of support. Significant inflows to whale wallet happened at $39,931 (around 115k BTC). This should now be a support for #Bitcoin. Closest resistances are at 52 and 56k. pic.twitter.com/XnsNQ35BFZCryptocurrency exchanges played a big part in Wednesday’s price action as highlighted in the recent Delphi Daily report by Ashwath Balakrishnan. According to Balakrishnan, Binance was responsible for:This marked the “single highest day of volume for all DEXes” on record led by Uniswap (UNI) which saw “nearly $6 billion of volume” transacted as retail traders ran for the exits.According to Micah Spruill, managing partner and chief investment officer at S2F Capital, approximately $9 billion in value was liquidated during this week’s correction in a similar washout to what was experienced in March 2020.Spruill also pointed to the “historic levels of Bitcoin being moved off the exchange on May 19 when compared to the net exchange outflows over the last several years,” highlighting the fact that this was the highest dollar denominated amount of net outflows in history and is “extremely bullish.”To get a better grasp on the current sentiment of traders in the market, Spruill pointed out that retail wallets have continued to grow in numbers despite the market turmoil with the dip being quickly bought by retail investors, which is “a sign of continued growth and adoption.”Spruill said:The continued pressure on Bitcoin spilled over into the altcoin market causing the majority of tokens in the top 100 to drop deeper into the red.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.4 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 44.3%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

85,"Bitcoin’s price fell significantly this week as the $30,000 price level waved hello to the frantically falling asset. Willy Woo, a popular Bitcoin (BTC) analyst, however, thinks the curtain call for Bitcoin’s overall upward rally has not occurred yet. During an interview with podcaster Peter McCormack, posted on the What Bitcoin Did YouTube channel on May 21, Woo talked about a number of points, including Bitcoin’s recent network and price activity, and its current state. Woo noted that many macro indicators point toward price positivity for Bitcoin. “There’s an immense amount of activity on the network between investors compared to the valuation,” Woo said, referring to data from Bitcoin’s NVT ratio, which shows blockchain network activity in relation to market cap.“We haven’t seen any kind of mania,” Woo continued. “We dumped down from a level which was highly organic — no speculative premium,” he said. “The 2017 top, for example, we were I think 3.8% higher than the organic evaluation.”“This is just a middle of the bull market derivatives unwind,” Woo said of the current state of Bitcoin. Bitcoin reached around $65,000 in April, based on TradingView data. Subsequently, the asset declined down below $50,000 for a period, recovered above the level for a time, reaching nearly $60,000 before beginning its descent down to the $30,000 range.“I think it’ll take a bit of time to recover, just from the sheer amount of coins that we dumped out,” Woo said. “I think ultimately, if you look at the network health, this is a good thing,” he said, seemingly referring to the overall situation.McCormack asked Woo straight: “So it’s not the end of the bull market?” To which Woo responded: “No, not at all.”Looking at his chart, Woo said price targets and details depend on the days ahead, although he expects Bitcoin’s price to hit levels higher than $100,000 per coin. Woo and McCormack also chatted about a number of other points during the interview."
86,"The stream of negative regulatory news concerning Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies has been nonstop over the past couple of weeks. Today's FUD — fear, uncertainty and doubt — news that failed to cite any actions and merely refreshes old information from China. A statement from the Chinese government revealed plans to ""crack down on Bitcoin mining and trading behavior.""While retail traders are easily scared by this type of news, whales and market makers know how to spot a buying opportunity, which was the case for today's drop to $36,200.The Chinese Financial Stability and Development Committee minutes presented general guidelines on multiple issues, including reforming mid-sized financial institutions and cracking down on illegal securities activities. Therefore, it was neither a targeted attack on Bitcoin nor did it differ from the actions and discourse from previous years.On May 18, trade associations under the People's Bank of China warned financial institutions and other member organizations to not engage in crypto business transactions.However, crypto trading in China has been banned since September 2017, and concerns regarding the carbon emissions of Bitcoin mining operations were expressed over three weeks ago by Chinese state media outlet PengPai.Even market-making platforms have been targeted by Chinese authorities since 2018. Some crypto trading sites continued to operate illegally in the country, but most were identified and shut down by authorities in 2019.Exchange-provided data highlights traders' long-to-short net positioning. By analyzing every client's position on the perpetual and futures contracts, one can obtain a clearer view of whether professional traders are leaning bullish or bearish.Whales and market makers on OKEx reached a 1.08 long-to-short ratio in the early hours of May 21, favoring longs by 8%. It is worth noting that this level was the lowest in 30 days, indicating a lack of conviction. However, these pro traders entered bullish positions over the day as Bitcoin retraced below $37,000, favoring longs by 62%.Trading volume is the best indicator to confirm whale activity, and those peaks need to coincide with price bottoms. Even though every trade has a buyer and a seller, extreme volatility can occur on low trading volumes, therefore not necessarily involving pro traders.By looking at the above data, there should be no doubt that whales and market makers aggressively bought the $36,200 dip on May 21. Spot exchange volumes surpassed $5.6 billion in four hours, which is extreme even for a 12% price movement.To put things in perspective, the daily average volume over the past month stands at $11 billion. Therefore, by combining this data with derivatives exchanges' long-to-short ratio, one should assume that some heavy players were brave enough to buy today's dip.Although no one can precisely forecast whether $35,200 will hold over the weekend, one should expect those heavy hands to maintain their position for a very long time.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

87,"While Iran’s regulatory relationship with Bitcoin runs hot and cold, a new report from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic indicates that regulated mining activities may be driving upwards of $1 billion in revenues and helping the country evade economic sanctions imposed by the United States.An excerpt of the report published today points to research indicating that Iran currently accounts for 4.5% of total global Bitcoin mining operations, earning the state hundreds of billions which have been used to circumvent the oil embargo in particular.“The US imposes an almost total economic embargo on Iran, including a ban on all Iranian imports and sanctions on Iranian financial institutions,” reads the report. “Oil exports have plummeted 70% over the past decade, leaving the country in a deep recession with soaring unemployment and periods of civil unrest.”“In the face of these sanctions, Iran has turned to an unlikely solution - Bitcoin mining.”The report notes that cheap, abundant oil means that energy-intensive mining operations are comparatively inexpensive for Iran. As such, foreign investors, especially from China, are playing a key role in the country’s expanding crypto economy — sometimes with the assistance of the Iranian military.“Several Chinese businesses have been granted mining licenses and have established operations in the country. These companies have described establishing good relationships with ‘the army in Iran’, and one particularly large facility in the Rafsanjan Special Economic Zone was reportedly built in collaboration with a ‘military organization’,” the report says.Ultimately, these state-sanctioned mines produce Bitcoin which can then be used to help the country sell its oil by proxy: excess energy and oil is used to produce Bitcoin, which can then be sold on global markets.The report also notes that this dynamic “has become all but an official policy.” In late April Iran passed laws that will enable banking entities to purchase imports with cryptocurrencies, and then in May the government appeared to try and strengthen its grip on crypto with a law banning the use of foreign-mined BTC for imports.Despite now appearing to function as a key part of Iran’s global trade strategy, the official relationship with Bitcoin hasn’t always been so rosy. In January officials tried to place the blame for endemic power outages on illegal mining operations (though experts said that a decrepit power grid was the more likely culprit), and earlier this morning reports emerged that the country is using its intelligence agency to hunt down illegal farms."
88,"After Bitcoin’s (BTC) capitulation on May 19 and the pullback on May 20, the next big question on everyone's mind is whether the correction is over or will the downtrend resume. Let’s study the supply and demand picture to gain more insight.Chainalysis chief economist Philip Gradwell pointed out that whales who had purchased more than 1,000 Bitcoin after 2017 added 34,000 Bitcoin to their holdings on May 18 and 19. This suggests the whales bought during the crypto meltdown.Additional on-chain data also suggests that the huge spike in over-the-counter Bitcoin outflow is a signal of accumulation by institutions or high net worth individuals.Although institutional investors may be buying, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin said in an interview with CNN on May 18 that the crypto sector was in a bubble. Being non-committal, Buterin said that the bubble may have already burst or could do so after a few months.Guggenheim CIO Scott Minerd who till recently was projecting a $600,000 target on Bitcoin, did a ‘U turn’ on his opinion and termed crypto as “Tulipmania.” This shows how some newer crypto investors flip their views on every minor dip.The market participants seem to be divided on the next possible move. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the path of least resistance.Bitcoin’s long tail on the May 19 candlestick suggests the bulls aggressively bought the drop to $29,257.95. The buyers continued their purchases on May 20 but the price has reversed direction from $42,217.17 today.The downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($47,964) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the oversold territory suggest the bears are in command. Even if the price rises above $42,500, the BTC/USDT pair is likely to face resistance at the neckline and then at the 20-day EMA.If the price breaks below $35,000, the pair could drop to $28,850. A strong rebound off this support will suggest accumulation at lower levels and may result in a consolidation. A breakout and close above $51,538 will signal advantage to the bulls while a break below $28,850 may start the next leg of the down move that could reach $20,000.Ether’s (ETH) rebound off the $1,801.60 level on May 19 is facing stiff resistance at the 50-day simple moving average ($2,779). This suggests that bears are trying to flip the 50-day SMA into resistance.The 20-day EMA ($3,201) has turned down and the RSI has dropped below 40, indicating that bears have the upper hand. If the sellers can sink the price below $2,145, the ETH/USDT pair could drop to $1,801.60. A break below this support may pull the price down to $1,547.46 and then $1,289.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up and breaks above $3,000, the bulls may challenge the 20-day EMA. A breakout and close above $3,450 will suggest the downtrend has ended.Binance Coin’s (BNB) pullback from the $280 low on May 19 has hit a wall at $428. This suggests the selling may not be over yet and the bears will make one more attempt to resume the downtrend.The bearish crossover on the moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory suggest the bears are in control. If the bears sustain the price below $348.70, the BNB/USDT pair could again drop to $280. A break below this support could aggravate selling and pull the price down to $233.81.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the current level and rises above $348.70, it will indicate that traders are not waiting for a deep correction to buy. That will increase the possibility of a break above $428. If that happens, the pair may rally to $480 where the bears are again likely to mount a stiff resistance.Cardano’s (ADA) long tail on the May 19 candlestick shows the bulls aggressively purchased the drop to $0.95. The buyers continued the recovery on May 20 and pushed the price above the 20-day EMA ($1.71), indicating strength.However, the bears have not given up yet. They are again trying to sink the price below the $1.48 support. If the price rebounds off this support, the ADA/USDT pair may consolidate between $1.48 and $1.94 for a few days.The flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. This balance will tilt in favor of the bears if the price breaks and closes below the 50-day SMA ($1.44). Such a move could open the gates for a drop to $1.On the other hand, if the buyers drive the price above $1.94, it will suggest the correction is over. The pair could then retest the all-time high at $2.34.Dogecoin (DOGE) rebounded off the $0.21 support on May 19 and the bulls managed to sustain the price above the 50-day SMA ($0.31). They again successfully defended the 50-day SMA on May 20.If buyers propel the price above the downtrend line, the DOGE/USDT pair could rally to $0.47. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair may remain range-bound between $0.47 and $0.30 for a few days.The 20-day EMA ($0.44) has started to slope down marginally and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating a minor advantage to the bears.A break and close below $0.30 could result in a drop to $0.21. Conversely, a breakout and close above $0.47 could open the doors for a move to $0.57.The bulls managed to defend the $0.88 level for the past two days, indicating demand at lower levels. However, if the bulls do not push the price above the moving averages quickly, XRP could once again slide down to $0.88.A breakdown and close below this support will suggest that supply exceeds demand. That may extend the downtrend to the next support at $0.56. The moving averages on the verge of a bearish crossover and the RSI is in the negative zone, suggesting the bears are in control.Alternatively, if the price rebounds off $0.88, the XRP/USDT pair may rise to $1.26 and consolidate between these two levels for the next few days. The bulls will have to push and close the price above $1.70 to gain the upper hand.Polkadot (DOT) closed below the $26.50 to $44 range on May 19 but the bulls managed to push the price back into the range on May 20. However, the bulls have failed to sustain the price above $26.50, indicating selling on rallies.If the bears sink the DOT/USDT pair below $21.20, a retest of $18 will be on the cards. A breakdown and close below this critical support could indicate the start of a new downtrend. The 20-day EMA ($36) has turned down and the RSI is in the negative territory, suggesting the bears are in the driver’s seat.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls push the price back above $26.50. Such a move will suggest strong buying on dips. A breakout and close above $31.28 may start the pair’s journey toward the 20-day EMA. That will enhance the prospects of the pair remaining inside the range for a few more days.The relief rally in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) could not even reach the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $918.58, which suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.The downsloping 20-day EMA ($1,054) and the RSI in the negative territory indicate advantage to the bears. If the price breaks below $686.75, the BCH/USDT pair could retest the panic low at $473.84. A break below the $473.84 to $442.96 support zone could pull the price down to $370.On the contrary, if the pair turns up from the current level or from $473.83, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. A breakout and close above the $940 resistance will be the first indication of strength. The negative view will invalidate if the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA.Litecoin’s (LTC) pullback is facing stiff resistance near the support line of the wedge. This suggests the bears are attempting to flip this level into resistance. If they succeed, the altcoin may resume its downtrend.If the bears sink the price below $166.56, the LTC/USDT pair could drop to $143.57. A strong rebound off this level may lead to a few days of consolidation with the boundaries at $143.57 and $224.85.If the bulls push and sustain the price above $224.85, the pair may rally to the 20-day EMA ($277), which is likely to act as stiff resistance. If the price turns down from this level, the pair may drop to the support line of the wedge. A strong rebound off this support will be the first indication that the downtrend may be over.Uniswap’s (UNI) recovery on May 20 hit a wall just above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $27.07. The altcoin has turned down today as the bears try to cement their advantageThe moving averages have completed a bearish crossover and the RSI is near the oversold territory, which suggests the bears have the upper hand.A close below $22.50 will be the first sign of weakness and that may result in a retest of the $17.50 to $16 support zone. A strong bounce off this zone will indicate buying at lower levels and could be followed by a few days of range-bound action.Conversely, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above $27.07, the UNI/USDT pair could rally to the 20-day EMA ($33.82).The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

89,"Ben Hunt, founder of Second Foundation Partners and lead author of the Epsilon Theory blog, is convinced institutional adoption poses an existential threat to Bitcoin's identity as an instrument of financial freedom. As investment funds, banks and tech companies continue getting involved in the space, Bitcoin's (BTC) fundamental properties — permissionless access and censorship resistance — are becoming increasingly marginalized, Hunt told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview. “What we are seeing is the Facebook-ization of Bitcoin. And it becomes absolutely controlled and in service to Wall Street and the government,” said Hunt.According to Hunt, institutions have created  “securitized,” “permissioned” versions of Bitcoin, allowing investors to get exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency without holding it directly.In Hunt’s view, governments are encouraging Wall Street’s co-option of Bitcoin, as it will make the leading cryptocurrency easier to control. As Hunt points out, financial institutions in the United States are required to disclose their customers’ identities and transaction information according to the Bank Secrecy Act.“If you put money into a Bitcoin-related private fund, there's no more revolution, there's no more resistance associated with that,” he said. But is it really too late to preserve Bitcoin’s revolutionary identity?To find out, watch the full interview on our YouTube channel, and don’t forget to subscribe!"
90,"Major privacy-centric email service ProtonMail is not giving up on Bitcoin (BTC) despite the extreme volatility leading to its price to plunge to nearly $30,000 on Wednesday.ProtonMail announced Friday on Twitter that the company has continued to hold a significant amount of Bitcoin in order to help the company stay independent:By announcing the news, ProtonMail echoes moves by companies like MicroStrategy whose CEO Michael Saylor announced Wednesday that entities under his control acquired about 111,000 Bitcoin, worth $4.5 billion at the time of writing. Those entities “have not sold a single satoshi, BTC forever,” Saylor stated.ProtonMail introduced Bitcoin payments for ProtonMail subscriptions back in August 2017 to support the company’s commitment to principles of freedom and privacy. In 2019, ProtonMail announced that it had not cashed in any of Bitcoin it accepted as payment since the new payment option was adopted. ProtonMail has also been accepting Bitcoin for donations, with the currently listed BTC donation address having received a total of 2.2 BTC, or around $90,500.ProtonMail’s latest remarks on Bitcoin bring some optimism amid major turbulence on crypto markets as firms like Tesla hinted at potential dump of BTC from their balance sheet after purchasing $1.5 billion worth of BTC earlier this year. Last week, Tesla suspended Bitcoin payments for car purchases citing carbon concerns over BTC mining, spurring major outrage in the crypto community and apparently contributing to Bitcoin’s blood path to $30,000.ProtonMail did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment."
91,"Bitcoin (BTC) saw a fresh price dip on May 21 amid reports that China had reiterated its pledge to crack down on mining and trading.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that BTC/USD shed 10% in minutes on May 21 as mainstream media turned up the volume on familiar bad news.The pair had recently regained $42,000 after a record-breaking recovery from a $30,000 dip on May 19, with the latest concerns erasing some of its progress.These focused on a Chinese government statement that revealed plans to ""crack down on Bitcoin mining and trading behavior, and resolutely prevent the transmission of individual risk.""As Cointelegraph reported, China had already reiterated its plans to control cryptocurrency activities within its jurisdiction, but media sources had taken comments from officials as a threat to the industry. With no official changes in policy coming on May 21 either, commentators were likewise quick to lay the blame on those spreading bad publicity.China bans banks from doing business in #bitcoin. http://t.co/KLU7MWq4g1""Let China actually ban Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining,"" popular commentator WhalePanda responded.Research previously showed that the Bitcoin network is resilient to changes in conditions, with a loss of mining power in one location soon compensated elsewhere.In a separate development, regulators in Hong Kong are planning to ban retail trading of cryptocurrency — with an exception for millionaires.As of the time of publication, Bitcoin was already rebounding from local lows of $36,680.More broadly, the impact of negative news slowed following the $30,000 dip, potentially due to the market now being cleansed of overleveraged traders.A tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk on May 20 further criticizing Bitcoin's energy consumption likewise failed to cause the same shock as the first tweet last week.""Bitcoin hashing (aka mining) energy usage is starting to exceed that of medium-sized countries. Almost impossible for small hashers to succeed without those massive economies of scale,"" he claimed.Meanwhile, popular Twitter account Documenting Bitcoin became the latest to highlight the uncanny bullish consequences of Chinese FUD — fear, uncertainty and doubt — surrounding Bitcoin. BTC/USD tends to see its biggest gains in the period following a round of doomsday noises from Beijing."
92,"May 19's price crash in the Bitcoin (BTC) spot market wiped about $7.56 billion worth of long-leveraged positions from cryptocurrency derivatives markets.The event marked the biggest bullish leverage wipeout since March 2020. Retail and institutional investors borrowed from leading exchanges to amplify their potential returns.But a sudden reversal in Bitcoin spot rates, reportedly led by Elon Musk's anti-Bitcoin tweets over the weekend and fueled by China's reiteration of a ban on crypto transactions, blew up bulls' leverage ratios. That led to a so-called liquidity cascade in the derivatives market.In traditional markets, investors use cash as collateral to back their leveraged bets, but the cryptocurrency industry enables Bitcoin-backed collateral. So, when BTC prices fall, their downside move catches bullish traders — ones with leveraged positions on higher BTC prices — on the wrong foot.The event led many analysts to simmer down their bullish bias in the Bitcoin market, with Scott Minerd, chief investment officer of Guggenheim Partners, referring to crypto as ""Tulipmania."" Earlier, the Wall Street executive had called for a $600,000 price target for Bitcoin.But the mind-boggling long liquidation event has not made everyone bearish. On the contrary, some analysts have highlighted the wipeout as a catalyst for the next big bullish setup in the Bitcoin market.For instance, pseudonymous trader ""Twitterati CL207"" posted a long thread on Twitter explaining why he thinks a drop in open interest has made Bitcoin stronger in the long run.Twitterati CL207 highlighted the role of market makers in running a cryptocurrency derivatives platform. The analyst explained how their strategies assisted in transferring Bitcoin from weaker hands to stronger hands during the May 19 dip.In retrospect, the Bitcoin futures market is typically excessively long. That prompts market makers to gain exposure on the other side of the bullish trades. So, they open short positions.But that does not necessarily make the liquidity providers bearish. They prefer to back up their short positions by hedging in spot markets by purchasing BTC or other bullish derivatives exposure (options, futures, perpetual swaps, etc.)""Sometimes,"" said Twitterati CL207, ""there's hedge/short demand hitting the market maker too so that the market maker can sell their shorts back to them, but generally in crypto, its long-biased, and thus market maker holds [the] spot as collateral to their shorts.""The analyst added that market makers buy spot coins against high leverage demand from bulls, noting that leveraged long position holders are ""the weakest possible hands"" — most vulnerable to liquidations should the spot Bitcoin rate turn lower.When the long liquidation occurs, market makers close their shorts against them to provide liquidity. They also sell their spot positions to remain neutral.6/7

and during a long liquidation heavy move, the MM constantly get hit by longs closing, so now they have to close their shorts against them (to provide liquidity) while selling spot (to remain neutral) to unwind this entire processThe trader explained what happened on May 19 when roughly $5 billion worth of long positions was liquidated as Bitcoin's price fell from nearly $40,000 to $30,000 within three hours. But then, the BTC/USD exchange rate quickly recovered back to $40,000.At the same time, the Bitcoin futures open interest did not follow the spot price recovery.""This means we just had the most significant weak hands to strong hands transfer in probably since March 12, 2020,"" noted Twitterati CL207, adding that strong hands with real cash bought BTC on the cheap from market makers. He said:Meanwhile, analyst Willy Woo wrote in his latest newsletter that long-term prospects in the Bitcoin market remain healthy, reiterating what fellow trader Twitterati CL207 highlighted in his Twitter thread: that the coins are going into the pockets of long-term investors.A long-term investor in the Bitcoin market, or a ""hodler,"" is typically an entity that sees the cryptocurrency as a hedge against fiat currencies. Capital injection policies undertaken by Western central banks to cushion the impact of coronavirus pandemic on their economies have raised fears of inflation.For instance, the United States Federal Reserve announced last year that it wants to push inflation above 2%. The central bank has been maintaining a policy of near-zero interest rates and has been buying $120 billion worth of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities every month.""There is no need for Bitcoin to replace fiat currencies to maintain value completely,"" said Vincenzo Furcillo, a risk analyst at Seeking Alpha. He added:"
93,"Following a major cryptocurrency sell-off, Canada’s central bank stated that digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC) remain a highly risky asset despite their adoption by institutional investors.The Bank of Canada issued on Thursday its financial system review, an annual report outlining the most important financial risks and economic vulnerabilities. As part of the review, the central bank paid specific attention to cryptocurrencies, stating that crypto volatility is an emerging vulnerability to Canada’s financial system:The warning comes shortly after the crypto market saw one of its wildest crashes in history, wiping about $1 trillion in market value in a matter of days. After surging above $64,000 last month, Bitcoin experienced a massive sell-off, tumbling to nearly touch $30,000 on Wednesday, marking another milestone of extreme volatility on crypto markets.But volatility is not the only subject of the Canadian central bank’s concern. The central bank also pointed out risks associated with stablecoins — a type of cryptocurrency that is typically backed by assets like national currencies or traditional financial assets to avoid volatility. According to the bank, the less volatile nature of stablecoins could make them more suitable for use as a means of payment and store of value.“But stablecoins still share some of the same risks as other crypto assets. Notably, unless stablecoins are backed exclusively by Canadian dollars, their widespread adoption could inhibit the Bank’s ability to implement monetary policy and act as lender of last resort,” the bank stated.The Bank of Canada mentioned that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have been increasingly popular over the past year, with the crypto market capitalization surging above $2 trillion in May 2021 from just $200 billion in early 2020. The authority also noted that crypto has become more accessible to investors in Canada with the arrival of closed-end funds as well as exchange-traded funds.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Canada is one of the first jurisdictions around the world to approve a Bitcoin ETF. In April, Canada-based investment fund manager 3iQ launched a Bitcoin ETF in partnership with major European digital asset manager CoinShares. Other fund managers such as Purpose Investments and Evolve Funds Group previously launched Bitcoin ETFs as well, with nearly $1.3 billion and $100 million in assets under management as of mid-April, respectively."
94,"Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins have “entered the mainstream” after this week’s price dip and will become stronger as a result, said Bloomberg Intelligence. In a tweet on Friday, Mike McGlone, the research unit’s senior commodity strategist, described Bitcoin as being in a “discounted bull market.”Cryptocurrencies fell en masse along with Bitcoin during the Wednesday crash, which saw BTC/USD dip to $30,000 before recovering.As Cointelegraph reported, altcoins then put in an awe-inspiring comeback, with some gaining in excess of 70% in under a day. For McGlone, the bull market is still on, with the dip ensuring that tokens are now a steal at current prices.“Bitcoin’s Advantage vs. Equities: A Discounted Bull Market,” he summarized.He highlighted advantageous volatility versus traditional stocks, along with a chart that suggested Bitcoin “may have passed the correction test.” McGlone is not alone in considering the broader market trend to be intact after the week’s volatility. Earlier, Cointelegraph noted statistician Willy Woo’s estimate that Bitcoin is only halfway through its current bull cycle. Woo was in turn joined by PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow family of Bitcoin price models, who in an appearance on the Wolf Of All Streets Podcast likewise guessed at the bull market being 50% complete.“Both models show that we’re certainly not at the end of the cycle,” he told host Scott Melker.The comments were made last week, before the price dip, with PlanB since sticking to his perspective on the market.“Not Tweeting about BTC for a while,” veteran trader Peter Brandt added."
95,"Hong Kong regulators have moved to ban retail trading in Hong Kong after months of intense speculation about a likely prohibition.According to a report by Reuters on Friday, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau of Hong Kong has released the results of its consultation on a possible retail crypto trading ban, which began back in November 2020.As part of its conclusions, Hong Kong’s FSTB called for a comprehensive licensing regime for crypto exchanges while restricting trading only to qualified investors. Per Hong Kong law, only individuals with portfolios worth 8 million Hong Kong dollars (about $1 million) qualify as professional investors.For the FSTB, the retail crypto trading ban is necessary at least in the early stages of the comprehensive crypto licensing regime. The FSTB reportedly plans to present its conclusions before legislators in Hong Kong to facilitate the passage of the proposal into law.If passed, the proposed licensing regime will also replace the current opt-in paradigm for crypto exchanges in the city.By limiting crypto trading in Hong Kong to persons with portfolios worth at least $1 million, the FSTB is potentially excluding up to 93% of the city’s population from gaining access to cryptocurrencies.Several stakeholders in Hong Kong’s vibrant crypto industry have expressed their dissatisfaction with the plan in the past, arguing that the move was inimical to the government’s goal of encouraging financial innovation.In another related development, Hong Kong’s government is reportedly planning to empower the city’s Securities and Futures Commission to withdraw the licenses of already authorized crypto exchanges.Tweeting on Friday, Chinese crypto media outlet 8BTC News revealed that the SFC may soon be given the power to exercise the right at will.Back in November 2020, the SFC announced a proposal to expand its crypto oversight responsibilities beyond security tokens to cover all digital asset service providers."
96,"Teucrium Trading, an agriculture-focused exchange-traded fund provider, is planning to expand its ETF suite with Bitcoin.On Thursday, the company filed an application with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a Bitcoin (BTC) ETF that would track a benchmark of Bitcoin futures contracts.Dubbed Teucrium Bitcoin Futures Fund, the planned ETF is designed to provide investors with a way to gain price exposure to the Bitcoin market. Should the SEC approve the new product, Teucrium will issue shares that trade on the NYSE Arca stock exchange under the symbol BCFU. The contract would be settled in cash, “However, the Fund may from time to time trade in other exchange listed Bitcoin interests based on the spot price of Bitcoin,” the application reads. “Because the Fund’s investment objective is to track the price of the Benchmark Bitcoin Futures Contracts, changes in the price of the shares may vary from changes in the spot price of Bitcoin,” Teucrium noted.Headquartered in Vermont, Teucrium currently provides several agricultural ETFs trading on NYSE Arca, including the Teucrium Corn Fund, the Teucrium Wheat Fund, the Teucrium Soybean Fund, the Teucrium Sugar Fund and the Teucrium Agricultural Fund.The news comes shortly after the SEC issued an investor warning pointing out the risks of some mutual funds with exposure to Bitcoin futures. The commission stressed that Bitcoin is a “highly speculative investment,” stating that the market is not properly regulated and vulnerable to fraud or manipulation. "
97,"Many retail Bitcoiners bought the dip amid this week’s crypto market bloodbath, with on-chain data showing the small guys have accumulated an additional 12,000 Bitcoin (BTC) in the last month.Analyst William Clemente III shared data compiled by on-chain analytics provider Glassnode showing that the number of entities holding between 0.01 and 0.1 BTC surged as BTC’s price dropped.This is awesome.

Plebs stacked harder than ever during this dip. pic.twitter.com/kpXpI0xLS5Crypto market data aggregator CryptoQuant, meanwhile, shared data showing a net outflow of roughly 4,000 BTC (approximately $163 million) from centralized exchanges.Net outflows to centralized exchanges are typically inferred to suggest coins are being moved into secure storage after being accumulated, while net inflows suggest coins are being moved out of cold storage to be sold on exchanges.The weekly netflow suggests this shift from selling to buying occurred only in the last two days.$BTC netflow across all exchanges became negative.

Clemente III also noted a massive spike in OTC Bitcoin outflows since Tuesday, which he believes evidences significant buying from institutions or high-net-worth individuals. Morgan Creek Capital Management founder and CEO Mark Yusko shared Clemente III’s tweet, hinting that now is not the time to panic sell:Moskovski Capital chief investment officer Lex Moskovski also believes many investors are now buying, tweeting: “$5.28B of stablecoins were deposited to exchanges in 24h. This is absolute ATH. Even bigger than pre-Tesla announcement move. Lots of people bought the dip.”Binance founder Changpeng Zhao similarly noted recently surging stablecoin inflows alongside BTC and various ERC-20 tokens in a podcast interview this week with Scott Melker, aka the Wolf Of All Streets. However, Zhao did not mention seeing Ether (ETH) inflows.Arash Ghaemi, director of strategy at digital asset manager Two Prime, asserted that while Binance saw its biggest BTC inflow ever, ETH outflows were growing at a similar rate. He concluded that “people are rotating out of BTC into ETH which is why ETH/BTC held up during the pullback.”On the largest day of #BTC inflows to Binance ever, $ETH posts its 2nd largest outflow day ever.

ETH continues to leave exchanges as BTC inflows to exchanges accelerate.

98,"The Iranian government is using intelligence officers to find and stop large-scale farms that have been set up to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Bloomberg reported on Friday.The Iranian Students’ News Agency reported the testimony of a distribution coordinator at a state-run grid operator, who said the Ministry of Intelligence had begun setting up committees across the country to find and seize crypto mining farms.Iran recently increased its efforts to curb the illicit mining of cryptocurrencies after the nation’s electricity grids began to falter under heavy consumption. The state-run energy grid operator, Tavanir, was forced to restrict power to certain parts of the country due to increased energy usage by miners, resulting in power cuts, and the dimming of street lights.It’s not just large-scale efforts that Iranian officials are eager to stop. A spokesperson from the country’s Ministry of Energy recently reminded citizens that mining crypto at home was also illegal and that anyone caught doing so would face heavy fines if caught.Cryptocurrency mining is considered a legitimate industrial activity in Iran. It is subject to licensing, and the pricing of electricity used in the process is regulated by the government. A spokesperson for Iran’s Ministry of Energy, Mostafa Rajabi, stated that as much as 87% of cryptocurrency mining in Iran was considered illegal.One fruitful source of information for the government on the operation of mining farms is reportedly local whistleblowers, who are incentivized with cash rewards to notify authorities of illegal activity. This year, the national grid operator doubled the maximum reward for successful tip-offs, raising it to 200 million rials ($873) — more than four times the median monthly salary in the country."
99,"Crypto derivatives trading platform BitMEX, which has had its fair share of bad press over the past year, is trying to contribute to cleaning up the wider industry's image by taking action to address growing climate concerns over the carbon footprint of Proof-of-Work currencies like Bitcoin (BTC).In an announcement published on May 21, the exchange said that while there are ostensibly “wildly divergent views and accuracy of information” regarding the climate risks posed by some cryptocurrencies, BitMEX feels it has a “responsibility to take positive action.”This action will take the form of an attempt to offset its carbon footprint by donating  $0.0026 for every $1 of blockchain fees its users pay out. Exactly which organization will be the recipient of these donations is yet to be confirmed. BitMEX says it is currently researching whom to partner with and will release further details in due course. The exchange concedes:BitMEX has taken its $0.0026 figure from rough calculations published by Sam Bankman-Fried, the CEO of crypto derivatives exchange FTX and Alameda Research. Bankman-Fried's suggestion, admitting “large error bars,” is that this sum should be enough for crypto firms to offset their carbon emissions.  A more robust response from the industry may be needed, as BitMEX seems to recognize. This month, the European Central Bank's recent Financial Stability Review highlighted the “exorbitant carbon footprint” of crypto-assets as grounds for concern. Meanwhile, organizations ranging from Greenpeace to Tesla have begun ceasing to accept BTC payments due to the energy-intensity of mining and transactions."
100,"Bitcoin’s price volatility is once again the subject of criticism from bankers as analysts from Société Générale take aim at the premier cryptocurrency.In an investor note quoted by CNBC, analysts at the bank argued that Bitcoin’s (BTC) “erratic price movements” devalued its place in investment portfolios.According to the investor note, the looming threat of government crackdowns across the globe puts significant downside pressure on future Bitcoin price action.Indeed, the recent BTC price plunge has also coincided with several negative regulatory moves from government agencies across the world. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the United States Treasury is looking to mandate reporting of crypto transactions above $10,000 to the Internal Revenue Service.The Société Générale analysts also touched on the Bitcoin and gold comparisons, agreeing that investors see both assets as hedges against monetary debasement. However, beyond partial protection, the analysts identified positive price movements and fear-of-missing-out buying as the only claim to fame to both store of value assets, stating:Despite the recent price troubles for Bitcoin, BTC is up 38% year-to-date and 312% in the last year. While some bankers may identify volatility as a bug, proponents like Mark Yusko, CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Management, see volatility as a feature of Bitcoin’s long-term value potential.Speaking to CNBC on Thursday, Yusko argued that volatility was a necessary part of Bitcoin’s 223% per annum positive compounding capability over the last decade.""#Bitcoin has the same amount of volatility as Amazon stock...when was the right time to sell Amazon?

101,"“Proof of work is proof of burning,” is fast becoming the dominant view of Bitcoin (BTC) among those who are serious about tackling the climate crisis. The words are from a United Kingdom government representative for this year's COP26 UN climate talks, cited this week in the Financial Times.The same article indicates that climate campaigning groups — who have, until now, been slow to take a firm line against Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies — are catching up and becoming more aware of the climate risks involved. Greenpeace, which set up a facility for accepting Bitcoin donations back in 2014, is now planning to scrap the channel. The organization told reporters that, while the option has not in fact been widely used to date:Much of the current awareness of Bitcoin's energy problem has undoubtedly been galvanized by Elon Musk's recent high-profile intervention when the Tesla CEO announced the company would no longer be accepting BTC as payment for vehicles due to concerns about the high energy consumption of Bitcoin mining. While Musk's decision had a dramatic and immediate impact on the cryptocurrency markets, sparking a sharp decrease in Bitcoin's price, the shift towards Bitcoin's reputation as a “dirty currency” has long been in the making. Longstanding concerns about the currency's high energy consumption are increasingly gaining traction against the backdrop of a new consensus in high finance that is increasingly focused on centering sustainable investing strategies.  Critics of green measures set in motion by the European Union and others — which involve an attempt to escort capital into sustainable development assets — point to the ample room for “greenwashing” that current strategies underwrite. Nation-states are increasingly stepping in to “derisk“ development assets i.e. to guarantee profits against demand-side, political and climate-driven investment shocks, while the world's largest asset managers are able to co-opt and capitalize on the green agenda for their own ends.As the political battle over green finance continues to be waged, many political and financial actors are, nonetheless, increasingly taking the line that Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies are a “dirty business.” The European Central Bank's recent Financial Stability Review has highlighted the “exorbitant carbon footprint” of crypto-assets as grounds for concern, while the Bank of Italy's comparison of its Target Instant Payment Settlement with Bitcoin highlighted that the former already had a carbon footprint that was 40,000 times smaller than Bitcoin's by 2019.Outliers persist: the increasing, potentially lucrative involvement of megabanks such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup in the crypto industry reveals the true priorities behind these actors' lip service to meeting sustainable finance goals. Some analysts continue to argue that where crypto mining is fueled by hydroelectric power and other clean sources, climate risks are less of an immediate concern. While over 70% of BTC mining does use some form of clean energy, renewables nonetheless account for under 40% of the total energy used in the Bitcoin sector. Moreover, off-grid and informal mining practices make the figure hard to quantify and keep tabs on. Cointelegraph reached out to Greenpeace for comment and will update this article should they respond."
102,"Coinciding with news that United States President Joe Biden’s proposed tax plan would require tax reporting on business transactions exceeding $10,000, the value of privacy coin Monero (XMR) climbed 31% on Friday.Biden’s American Families tax plan would require exchanges and custodians to implement tighter reporting measures to help detect tax evasion and money laundering. Banks and financial institutions would also be required to report account inflow/outflow information to the Internal Revenue Service to help uncover unreported income.The Treasury Department’s agenda, which was published on Thursday, stated that cryptocurrency business activity remained relatively small but was expected to increase in the next decade.“Despite constituting a relatively small portion of business income today, cryptocurrency transactions are likely to rise in importance in the next decade, especially in the presence of a broad-based financial account reporting regime,” stated the report.Just over 24 hours later, Monero led the charts among the cryptocurrency market capitalization top 100 with 31% growth. The coin price climbed from $230 to $304 overnight, adding to a now 84% rebound since Monero sank to a three-month low of $165 during Wednesday’s market crash.Supplemental technologies that can anonymize the transactions of many well-known cryptocurrencies now exist, but Monero remains one of the few coins focused solely on privacy and is the largest of its kind by market cap.Launched in 2014, Monero has since become a currency of choice on the drug markets of the dark web, replacing more well-known coins such as Bitcoin (BTC) in recent years. Blockchain analysis poses a threat to anyone using Bitcoin on the dark web, from drug dealers to anonymous journalists. Monero transactions cannot be traced in the same way. The technology has drawn the attention of government agencies worldwide, many of which have offered bounties to anyone who can make the opaque cryptocurrency transparent.Google Trends data shows that Monero search interest has increased by close to 1,000% in the past year, as the coin price rose 1,300% from March 2020’s valuation of $34. Despite the surge in interest, historic search queries remain a quarter of what they were in December 2017, when Monero’s presence in the market cap top 10 gave it a more visible position in the cryptocurrency shop window."
103,"Bitcoin is still ""halfway"" through its current bull market, and this week's price dip turned out to be a ""win"" for hodlers, according to on-chain analyst Willy Woo.In the latest edition of his market updates, which he made publicly accessible, the popular statistician outlined multiple factors that all suggest that Bitcoin (BTC) is anything but bearish.BTC/USD recovered strongly after hitting lows of $30,000 on May 19, preserving its gains after the sharpest recovery in its history. ""Are we in a bull market? Long range macro indicators like NVT ratio are very healthy, that remains unchanged,"" Woo wrote.NVT, or network-value-to-transaction ratio, is a popular metric that aims at identifying profitability among hodlers. As Cointelegraph reported earlier this week, even before the dip NVT was signaling a buying opportunity at price levels around $42,000.NVT price, which Woo calls an ""organic"" valuation of Bitcoin, still lies at $55,000, which along with stock-to-flow-based projections of $60,000 suggest that BTC/USD is considerably undervalued.The largest cryptocurrency may already have the tools it needs to regain its lost ground, thanks to a shakeout of leveraged traders and the now-muted effects of Elon Musk tweeting negative comments.In fact, the dip may have been just what Bitcoin needed.""Newish whales dumped out, retail bought a chunk of the dip, coins getting more distributed, I'll take that as a win,"" Woo added.Notably, the sharp drop to $30,000 resulted in Bitcoin funding rates flipping negative across the board to record lows, which could provide fuel for a massive short squeeze.""That cleanse set up Bitcoin for $100k. Funding rates largely reset,"" Messari analyst Mira Christanto commented regarding the latest Bitcoin funding rate data. She added: On the topic of a trader shakeout, fresh data from Glassnode shows just how much leverage was flushed from the market during the drop to $30,000 and the rise back to $40,000.Over the course of the day, open interest in Bitcoin futures fell from above $17 billion to below $13 billion and stayed at those levels.""Goodbye leverage,"" analyst William Clemente commented regarding the figures.For new buyers entering the space, Blockstream CEO Adam Back, meanwhile, had some cautionary words.""Thoughts on leverage. *don't*!"" he summarized in a series of tweets."
104,"The CEO of Ark Investment Management, Cathie Wood, believes the controversial Tesla CEO and Dogecoin proponent, Elon Musk, will again embrace Bitcoin once greater adoption of renewable energy has occurred within the mining sector.Despite relations between Musk and the Bitcoin community souring, Wood predicted: “Elon will come back and be part of [the Bitcoin] ecosystem.”Wood’s comments come on the same day that Ark’s Sam Korus published an update the firm’s “open-source Solar+Battery+Bitcoin mining model” to allow historic testing of the system’s efficacy.Korus concluded: “The takeaway is that regardless of a Bitcoin bull of bear market, Bitcoin mining can incentivize additional solar and battery installations,” adding:Musk replied to the post, noting that while such a system could be achieved over time, the recent “extreme” growth in Bitcoin’s hash rate could not have been supported by renewables.He advocated for the top 10 mining pools by hash rate to post audited breakdowns of their energy sources.Can you post audited numbers of renewable energy vs not of your private jets?With Wood anticipating renewables will soon represent a larger share of the energy fueling the mining sector, the Ark Invest founder is steadfast in her predictions of $500,000 BTC for the future despite the recent crash that saw prices tumble more than 50% over the course of two weeks.Wood characterized the markets as having entered a “capitulation phase,” asserting it is “a really great time to buy” despite acknowledging: “You never know how low is low when a market gets very emotional.”Wood is putting her money where her mouth is too, with Ark Invest accumulating shares in Coinbase while the stock has been trading below its direct listing reference price of $250.The crypto downturn accelerated with Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s apparent u-turn on Bitcon, with Musk criticizing the environmental impacts of Bitcoin mining.Wood also believes the heavy market retracement improves the prospects of U.S. regulators approving a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or ETF, stating: “The odds are going up now that we have had this correction.”"
105,"This weekly roundup of news from Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong attempts to curate the industry’s most important news, including influential projects, changes in the regulatory landscape, and enterprise blockchain integrations.FUD watchers got a glimpse of an old favorite as three government bodies in China, including the China Internet Finance Association, the China Banking Association and the China Payment and Clearing Association re-warned the public about the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies. This dates back to a 2017 ruling that all exchanges must close and a 2018 ruling on ICOs. But is it actually illegal?For starters, these types of announcements are a good indication that cryptocurrencies are starting to flare up in popularity. Whenever speculative digital assets begin to grab headlines and seep into more mainstream culture, these warnings and reminders are common as a method of discouraging more open adoption.Last year it was established that owning virtual currencies was not in itself illegal, only that virtual currencies could not be used as legal tender. Even though exchanges are supposed to be illegal, numerous exchanges operate within the country, even partnering with government organizations in free trade zones and hosting large events. There is very much an understanding of being free to innovate, as long as it doesn’t start breaking other laws, such as money laundering, fraud or aiding capital flight. If not for this convenient truth, there probably wouldn’t be much of a column left for Our Man in Shanghai to write about.The China FUD seemed to be the tipping point as people’s fears of a 2018-like bear market began to seem real. “Cryptocurrency crash” became some of the hottest keywords on the Chinese internet, showing up third on the trending list of both search engine Baidu and micro-blogging platform Weibo. An asymptomatic COVID-19 case in central Anhui province took the number one spot, in case anyone was wondering.The Nervos Foundation has launched an innovation fund with CMB International, a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Merchants Bank. China Merchants Bank is one of the top ten banks by holdings, with over 84,000 employees. The joint fund is intended to kickstart ecosystem building on top of Nervos and provides strong validation for the Hangzhou-based blockchain network.If you were looking to meet top blockchain influencers and projects in China this week, odds are Shanghai was the best place to find them. The Bellagio hosted the World Digital Assets Summit, a glamorous event which featured panels, keynotes, charity auctions, and banquets for many of the top projects and VCs in the space. The offline events calendar is back in full force in China, which has managed to avoid the major lockdowns faced by many other countries in 2021.Huobi Group, which owns the top cryptocurrency exchange by the same name, set up an investment arm on May 14th. This fund will primarily target projects that support NFTs, gaming, and Huobi’s very own smart chain, HECO. Huobi Ventures will inject $100 million into projects via strategic investments and mergers and acquisitions over the next three years."
106,"On May 21 at 8:00 AM UTC, $930 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) weekly options will expire. As usual, the leader Deribit holds a 90% share, but the recent market drop might have given bears too much power.While traders and analysts scramble to find a rationale for the 53% drop from the $64,900 all-time high, ExoAlpha CIO David Lifchitz perfectly described the recent market conditions when he said:The correction was so strong that even avid Bitcoin defenders flipped, including the global Chief Investment Officer of investment giant Guggenheim, who dubbed crypto markets as ‘tulipmania’.Regardless of the reasons behind the price action, traders that held previously inexpensive rights to sell Bitcoin at $45,000 or $46,000 are now celebrating.Although the current setup looks balanced between call (buy) options and the neutral-to-bearish put (sell) options, Bitcoin’s 30% drop has shifted the balance to favor bears over the past two weeks.Out of the 11,872 call options, only 15% have been created using $44,000 and lower strikes. This means the remaining 85% became worthless, as there are less than 14 hours left for the weekly expiry. Therefore, the 1,850 neutral-to-bullish call options below $44,500 represent a $75 million open interest.On the other hand, 88% of the put options have $36,000 or higher strikes. Those options allow its buyer to sell Bitcoin at a fixed price, so most commonly used on neutral-to-bearish strategies.Unlike futures contracts, there is not much gain in rolling over a losing position to the following week. As we approach the expiry date, a right to acquire Bitcoin at $50,000 is effectively worthless right now. That’s the reason why bears’ current advantage will likely continue exerting pressure.Overall, the put options at $36,000 and higher amount to $400 million in open interest. The $325 million difference favoring the more neutral-to-bearish options is a decent advantage as we approach Friday’s expiry.However, it is important to highlight that monthly options usually handle most of the action, and May 28 will be no different with $1.95 billion open interest. While it seems premature to call it, bears will likely continue to pressure markets considering there are almost no call options at $38,000 or lower for next week.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

107,"Still reeling from a historic price collapse this week, Bitcoin (BTC) received positive news on Thursday after a mysterious whale reportedly reaccumulated a large stash of the digital asset. The whale managed to snatch up 3,521 BTC over three separate purchases on May 15, 18 and 19, according to the Itsblockchain news publication. The first purchase, on May 15, was for 753 BTC, and came a few days before the now infamous May 19 flash crash. The subsequent purchases, of 965 BTC and 1,803 BTC, respectively, were made as the market was plunging.The average BTC price for the three purchases were $50,050.54, $44,782.37 and $41,897.02, respectively.Interestingly, this same whale offloaded 3,000 BTC on May 9 for an average price of $58,503.39.The same whale reportedly offloaded nearly 12,000 BTC in January at a price of between $35,000 and $40,000 before reaccumulating later.Market participants monitor whale activity in an attempt to gauge where prices could be headed next. Large, oversized holders of BTC have the ability to influence prices by purchasing and offloading a large quantity of their holdings.The BTC price briefly dipped below $30,000 on Wednesday but has since recovered nearly 34%. Still, the largest digital currency is 37% away from its recent peak above $64,000. At the time of publication, Bitcoin was valued at $40,217, having gained 3.3%.Large corrections are nothing new for seasoned cryptocurrency traders, but the size of the recent pullback has caught many by surprise. Peak-to-trough, BTC corrected more than 53% between Apr. 14 and May 19. It remains to be seen whether the decline has negated the bull market or whether we are in the midst of a 2013-style correction ahead of a major blow-off top later in the year. Four-year cycle theorists maintain that, if Bitcoin repeats past cycles, the current bull market could peak during the fourth quarter of 2021 or perhaps early in 2022. "
108,"For the crypto faithful who have been in the space since 2017, the market moves over the past few days have caused flashbacks for some, stirring up long-repressed memories of Bitcoin’s (BTC) fall from $20,000 to $3,000 at what was the start of a long, two-year ""crypto winter.""The 50% plunge in Bitcoin's price from just shy of $60,000 on May 10 to a low of $30,000 during the worst part of the May 19 sell-off has prompted many to say the top is in for the 2021 bull market, but a recent article by Chainalysis chief economist Philip Gradwell highlighted some key data points that indicate that the market may still have higher ground to claim in the months ahead.To kick things off and bring a little perspective to the matter, Chainalysis pointed out that there have been four other occasions since 2017 where Bitcoin's price has fallen by more than 25% over a seven-day period. The massive price collapse to $4,000 in March 2020 is the most recent example.While this week’s price drop in both Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) followed their recent all-time highs, the current price levels remain elevated from a historical perspective, with further upside potential after an undetermined period of consolidation.Gradwell highlighted the fact that now that the wider cryptocurrency sector has grown in prominence and is part of the mainstream narrative, “The industry needs to answer questions about environmental impact, use cases, illicit activity and regulation.”As for whether or not another crypto winter is approaching, Gradwell appears inclined to believe that the market is not quite there and referred to the “many differences between now and the major price declines in March 2020 and December 2017” as backing up this point of view.The rising popularity of cryptocurrency in 2021 has brought a large number of new entrants into the market who have bought large amounts of cryptocurrency, raising the stakes for the market as a whole and increasing the overall market capitalization.According to Gradwell, on-chain data suggests that:This data should help to dispel the rumors that institutions have been one of the main driving forces behind the recent sell-off.As seen in the chart above, Bitcoin inflows to exchanges over the past week were low compared wit previous sell-offs, with 412,000 BTC being deposited over the last three days versus 412,000 BTC deposited on just March 13, 2020.According to Gradwell:To further back this understanding, Gradwell pointed to the following chart showing the “change in Bitcoin held by post-2017 investor whales for the 14 days before the price bottom of the current and past declines.”As seen in the chart, post-2017 investor ""whales"" bought 34,000 BTC between May 18 and 19 after reducing their holdings by 51,000 BTC during the two weeks prior, showing a stronger response than did investors in March 2020.This indicates that while still cautious, whales have been tempted to buy this dip rather than sell into it, suggesting that the larger participants in the crypto economy still feel there is further upside ahead for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market in the bull run of 2021.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

109,"On April 14 Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high at $64,850 and many of the crypto sector’s top analysts were calling for BTC to carry on to at least $100,000 before the rally showed any signs of possible exhaustion. Fast forward 37 days and Bitcoin now trades nearly 50% down from its all-time high after dropping as low as $30,000 to mark the sharpest correction in BTC price since March 2020.The general reaction among analysts has been mixed as some cite various metrics which suggest that $30,000 is the bottom for BTC. Others advise caution as the failure of BTC price to show a strong bounce from the current oversold conditions is a signal that further downside could be in store.To get a better handle on exactly what happened to Bitcoin and where the price might go from here, Cointelegraph spoke with David Lifchitz, managing partner and chief investment officer at ExoAlpha.Cointelegraph: What led the market to this precipice and in your opinion what pushed Bitcoin price over the edge?David Lifchitz: Last week, just a few hours before Elon Musk's incendiary tweet about Bitcoin, we warned that there was more downside potential than upside potential for Bitcoin due to a lack of any upward catalyst on the horizon, and we have been served.Believe me or not, but on May 18, we discussed that when looking at Bitcoin on a weekly basis, we could see an ugly head and shoulders pattern with a neckline around $45,000. The top of the left shoulder reached during the week of February 8, the head (top) above $60,000 during the week of April 5, and the right shoulder top reached during the week of May 3.CT: Why was this head and shoulders pattern problematic?DL: Bitcoin was trading then around $43,000 right below the neckline, which was not very healthy as the expected output of such pattern would be a downward move of the same amplitude as between the neckline level and the top of the head, which were respectively about $45,000 and $60,000.This would mean a potential slide down to $30,000 which is where Bitcoin initially found support after taking a breather after its fall 2020 bullrun. This was just some technical analysis and probabilities but nothing guaranteed a return to $30,000. The price breaking down below $50,000, a level which had acted as previous support, drastically weakened Bitcoin in the short term.Moreover, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) trading at a historical discount could also be putting pressure on Bitcoin prices and if Grayscale doesn't act swiftly to reduce the discount, which it doesn't seem to have decided to do just yet, but we won’t go into to much detail on that.CT: Were institutions or retail behind the drop?DL: The head and shoulders pattern we discussed with a downside target around $30,000 that we discussed earlier has been spot on, even if it occurred quite quickly!However, as the dip at $30,000 has already been bought back up to $38,000 and as $40,000 looks like now to the new resistance level, let's see how Asia will react and how the US-time zone then reacts to the activity that occurs overseas.What could have sparked the selloff? Definitely some heavy selling of Bitcoin. Some might be wondering if Musk eventually dumped his Tesla Bitcoin (after having loaded up on puts of course) or was Grayscale forced to sell some of their holdings to meet a large investor request? Who knows! But the overleveraged environment in which crypto traders evolve definitely works in both ways.Moreover, traditional markets being overstretched to the point of letting go probably didn't help as well.Disclaimer.

110,"Trust in state-backed digital currencies will be “immeasurably higher” than trust in public cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Russian former Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev argued.Medvedev, the incumbent deputy chief of Russia’s Security Council, spoke on cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, at the Saint Petersburg International Legal Forum on Tuesday, local news agency TASS reported.The official pointed out the crucial role of digital transparency associated with emerging financial technologies like public cryptocurrencies. “It’s time to recognize their importance,” Medvedev noted, also stressing the role of new digital forms of money like central bank digital currencies.“It is essentially a new form of money, and their trust will be immeasurably higher than trust in cryptocurrencies,” Medvedev declared. The official also emphasized that the development of state digital currencies should involve input from all the stakeholders in the financial market:The news comes shortly after the Bank of Russia's first deputy governor Olga Skorobogatova confirmed the central bank’s plans to complete a digital ruble prototype by the end of 2021. Earlier this year, Bank of Russia Deputy Governor Alexey Zabotkin announced that Russia was expecting to start pilots for its CBDC in 2022 after initially introducing digital ruble plans in late 2020.While Medvedev is confident that CBDCs like a digital ruble would be associated with more trust than crypto, some major crypto players think otherwise. Changpeng Zhao — CEO of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance — believes that CBDCs would be less attractive for the crypto community due to limited freedom of use and uncapped supply.The third president of Russian Federation, Medvedev has been paying close attention to the cryptocurrency industry in recent years. Following a major bear market of 2018, Medvedev claimed that a massive crypto crash was “not a reason to bury” cryptocurrencies. The official also suggested that the government should not prioritize cryptocurrency regulation due to “decreasing” cryptocurrency popularity in May 2019."
111,"Bitcoin (BTC) hit $42,000 on May 20 as altcoins joined the largest cryptocurrency in its record-breaking comeback.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows BTC/USD spiking to previous all-time highs from February on Thursday.At the time of writing, volatility was back as bulls sought to tackle what was once formidable resistance. As Cointelegraph reported, the past 24 hours have been a test like no other for Bitcoin as selling pressure drove it to $30,000, only to evaporate and allow a run to $40,000 — all within around five hours.On Thursday, higher levels remained, with brief spikes hinting at major buy-ins frontrunning a concerted push higher.Versus the local lows, BTC/USD gained an unparalleled 40% in less than 24 hours. ""The most spectacular rallies happen when emotions within the market at their most extreme,"" popular Twitter trader Rekt Capital said as part of multiple posts as the market rose.Rekt Capital noted that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a key indicator of sentiment, was practically repeating behavior from March 2020 when cryptocurrencies broadly crashed. As such, others were beginning to reveal long positions on the day in a further signal of the belief that the worst of the dip was over.#BTC is currently inside the $38000-$44000 range

Two things to watch out for in the short-term:

• Can ~$38000 hold as support during a retest attempt?

• Will ~$44000 turn into a resistance once tested?$BTC #Bitcoin https://t.co/cfdEZ2BVKt pic.twitter.com/Ha6u8EEHV2With altcoins, opportune moments for gains were also flowing in, with Cardano's ADA up over 70% and Dogecoin (DOGE) up 55%.The latter was flying high once again thanks to Twitter activity from Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who on Thursday hinted at a plan to drive DOGE/USD to $1.How much is that Doge in the window? pic.twitter.com/bxTkWOr50VThe top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization saw 40% daily returns or more as Bitcoin led battered tokens back to where they were just days before.Ether (ETH) was up 40% at the time of writing, having previously briefly dipped below $2,000."
112,"The Bitcoin (BTC) market bias stands divided on how to interpret the BTC price crash this week, wherein the pair lost more than 35% of its value at one point on Wednesday, crashing to as deep as $30,000 on Coinbase.Global media outlets attributed the plunge to China reiterating its anti-crypto business stance and Tesla suddenly discontinuing Bitcoin payments for its electric vehicles.Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, managing director for global market strategy at JP Morgan, further noted an ongoing decline in the capital that flows into publicly listed Bitcoin funds. He suspected a rotational investment setup, wherein institutional investors were winding up their positions in the Bitcoin futures market and reallocating the proceeds to build long positions in gold funds.“It is not clear what is driving this shift,” Panigirtzoglou added.He nevertheless reminded that Bitcoin’s momentum signals remain in positive territory. Thus, it is still too early to declare the end of the bull market.Stack Funds head of research Lennard Neo also presented a similar, near-term upside setup, citing a potential rotational setup, but from altcoins to Bitcoin.Lennard cited the recent directional trends in the Bitcoin market and its strength against a vast pool of alternative digital assets, dubbed as the Bitcoin Dominance Index. He noted that the net crypto market capitalization surged by around 40% as Bitcoin’s dominance against altcoins declined from 73.5% to 40.5%.That suggests many investors remained entrenched within the cryptocurrency markets, focusing mostly on transferring their Bitcoin gains to altcoins that seemed promising in the short term. Neo added that Ether’s 180% year-to-date surge late last month emerged from the same Bitcoin-to-altcoin setup.But now, the capital will want to fly back into the Bitcoin market, the former Bloomberg analyst stated, adding:Veteran hedge fund manager and investor Ben Miller also came out in support of Bitcoin’s bullish bias, calling its recent downside correction a “routine pullback.”“If I liked something at higher prices, it is a safe bet I will like it even more at lower prices,” said the former Legg Mason Capital Management chief investment officer as he cited similar Bitcoin price dumps during the mammoth 2017 bull market.But bearish woes continue to offset the bullish predictions, especially as Guggenheim chief investment officer Scott Minerd, who called for a $600,000 price target for Bitcoin, did a complete backflip while referring to the cryptocurrency as “Tulipmania.”Meanwhile, Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of UBS Global Wealth Management, called Bitcoin an unreliable store-of-value asset over its high price volatility. Julius de Kempenaer, a senior technical analyst at Stockcharts.com, also noted that Bitcoin’s recent price crash dampened its safe-haven outlook.Bitcoin was trading above $40,000 at the time of this writing, up more than 30% from its sessional low of $30,000."
113,"The ripples created by the cryptocurrency market crash, which saw $1.1 trillion evacuate the global market capitalization in a matter of days, continued to reverberate on Thursday as a majority of coins experienced notable rebounds.After losing 64% of its value since May 12, when it fell from $40.50 to $14.43, the multipurpose blockchain project Waves experienced a 95% bounce for its native WAVES token earlier on Thursday. WAVES' price climbed to $28.09 shortly prior to publication, in effect paring the coin’s weekly losses to just over 25% for the time being.Internet Computer, a recent entrant to the top 10 by market capitalization, also saw a strong bounce with its native ICP token. ICP's price soared to over $600 just after it commenced trading on May 10. By Wednesday, the coin's price had fallen to $100 — a loss of 81%.But by Thursday, ICP had rebounded to the tune of 117%, climbing to a price of $217. The coin’s daily trading volume rose to its highest value to date, with over $1.6 billion worth of ICP changing hands on the day.Bounces like these are not unexpected during tumultuous times in the cryptocurrency market, and many day traders rejoice in the opportunities afforded them by such attractive, yet dangerous, volatility.Bitcoin’s (BTC) bounce was less pronounced, but it still managed to gain close to 30% on its then value of $31,000 as it climbed back to over $40,000.The price of recent gainer Dogecoin (DOGE) sank 67% over the course of the previous seven days, dropping to the $0.23 range after peaking at $0.73 just days earlier. Dogecoin’s 78% rebound from $0.23 to $0.420 was notable on Thursday, as it saw the coin price return to a humorous peak previously set by traders on April 20, or 4/20 day."
114,"Bitcoin (BTC) is working to flip $40,000 to support after a record $10,000 bounce in four hours on Monday — what are the price levels to watch?After its stunning recovery from $30,000 lows, BTC/USD has held onto its gains, practically erasing the previous day’s carnage. With spot price still well below expectations, however, analysts are keenly eyeing possible resistance levels — as well as support — should a fresh dip take hold of the market.Bullish signs are everywhere at the time of writing. Funding rates are deeply negative; outflows from exchanges reached sky-high levels in the past 24 hours; and leveraged traders have been effectively washed out of the market with $8 billion in liquidations.Now, attention is turning to two price levels in particular, with these marking a likely floor and ceiling, respectively.First is $46,000, around $6,000 or 15% above spot price. As noted by on-chain monitoring resource Whalemap, this former support level is apt to act as resistance should Bitcoin see a further impulse move on short timeframes.$46,000 is also where the significant 20-week weighted moving average (WMA) currently lies. Traditionally, during bull runs, weekly candles stay above the rising 20WMA, and a violation of the trend could yet be a bad omen.“In terms of TA, 33k looks like a support,” Whalemap explained alongside charts.While those comments were made before the capitulatory move to $30,000, the appetite for selling remains closer to $50,000 and beyond.On the flipside, Whalemap warns, a comparative lack of buyer support below Wednesday’s lows could potentially open up a path to a further capitulation run as low as $19,000.“We need to hold 29k,” the Whalemap team told Cointelegraph.Momentary spikes in spot price on exchanges suggested that large trades to the upside were being entered at levels around $40,000 overnight.“If you buy something because price went up, you will sell as soon as price stops going up or goes down... If you buy something because you believed current price was below fair value or future growth would increase value, when price falls you will buy more...,” Mark Yusko, founder, CEO and chief investment officer of Morgan Creek Capital Management, told Twitter followers overnight.The volume of stablecoins flowing into exchanges stands as testimony to the level of interest in acquiring cryptocurrency at the $30,000 price point. According to data from CryptoQuant, this has reached a new all-time high."
115,"Major financial regulators in the United States are considering establishing an interagency group dedicated solely to cryptocurrency matters.Michael Hsu, the new head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, announced that the agency has been in talks with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation about setting up an “interagency policy sprint team” focused “just on crypto.”At a virtual hearing of the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, the OCC head said that he discussed the initiative with Fed vice chairman of supervision Randal Quarles and FDIC chairman Jelena McWilliams. “This is a really important issue. The rise of crypto has got a lot of attention,” Hsu noted.Quarles said that the Fed has been working with other agencies in a joint effort to come up with a clear regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry, including unified definitions, stating:Quarles also noted the Fed’s growing efforts to explore a central bank digital currency, stating that the authority is actively involved in central bank digital currency research with international central banks. “These questions about digital currency are important. I think we need to do a very careful study of that, not just in this jurisdiction but globally as well,” he said."
116,"Long-time cryptocurrency critic and Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman said in a string of tweets on Wednesday that Bitcoin (BTC) could very well survive indefinitely, but only as a fundamentally useless cult.Krugman’s harsh words were prompted in response to Wednesday’s market plunge which saw numerous coins lose close to 50% in value, and resulted in close to $1 trillion in value departing the global market cap before a recovery bounce brought some of that sum back.“I don't write much about Bitcoin because there aren't any fundamentals to discuss,” tweeted Krugman, who wrote about Bitcoin as early as 2013 in his New York Times blog, calling it “evil” at the time.“BTC isn't a new innovation; it's been around since 2009, and in all that time nobody seems to have found any good legal use for it. It's not a convenient medium of exchange; it's not a stable store of value; it's definitely not a unit of account,” continued Krugman, taking aim at the two use-cases generally attributed to Bitcoin: a means of payment, and a store of value.While the crypto faithful may be quick to defend Bitcoin against any and all attacks (perceived or real), Krugman’s critique chimes with many figures in the cryptocurrency space who believe Bitcoin’s utility has been hamstrung in recent years by ill-conceived and misguided development decisions.For example, Bitcoin’s average transaction fee rose to as high as $62.77 in late-April — a single statistic that causes Bitcoin’s attributed reputation as a day-to-day currency to dissipate before our eyes. This is largely because the Bitcoin block size is still limited to 1MB (third-party applications increase this figure somewhat), despite it being capable of much higher transaction throughput.The block size debate caused a rift in the Bitcoin community in 2017 and saw a big-block faction break away to form Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Bitcoin Cash increased the foundational protocol’s block size to 8MB and then 32MB in pursuit of achieving the vision of peer-to-peer electronic cash laid out by Satoshi Nakamoto in the original whitepaper.Bitcoin developers’ refusal to raise the block size was followed by a narrative shift in which Bitcoin was rebranded as “digital gold” — a store of value, and not something to be used as a transactional currency. This shift was reasoned as necessary because increasing the block size to include more transactions would mean the blockchain would grow larger and demand more hard drive space from node operators over time.Opponents of the digital gold vision argue that hard drive space is something growing cheaper by the day, and would not pose an obstacle to would-be miners or node operators. Indeed, since 2015 alone the average cost of hard drive space per gigabyte fell from $0.038, to the current price of $0.021 witnessed at the time of publication. The 400GB Bitcoin blockchain could fit 25 times over onto a consumer hard drive that can presently be purchased for around $200.And while analysts claim Bitcoin will eventually find price stability at some point in the future, that day has not yet arrived. Recent price volatility is an obvious reminder of this, as is the ever-constant flow of large sums of BTC to centralized exchanges, as whales constantly look to capitalize on market fluctuations.Krugman said the perceived value of Bitcoin rested on the illusion that it was a technological solution to the impending collapse of the fiat system, something he suggested was a libertarian folly.“Its value rests on the perception that it's a technologically sophisticated way to protect yourself from the inevitable collapse of fiat money, which is coming one of these days, or maybe one of these centuries,” Krugman said, adding, “Or, as I say, libertarian derp plus technobabble.”Krugman signed off on a week of drama in the crypto space by extending a barbed olive branch to the Bitcoin crowd. Krugman suggested Bitcoin’s longevity was assured, but only because new members would constantly be recruited to its “cult.”“But I've given up predicting imminent demise. There always seems to be a new crop of believers. Maybe just think of it as a cult that can survive indefinitely,” he said."
117,"Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business, has tipped Ether (ETH) as having a better chance of becoming a commodity than Bitcoin (BTC).Speaking to CNBC, the NYU professor argued that Ethereum’s upside potential outweighs that of Bitcoin in a possible future paradigm dominated by blockchain-based technology.According to Damodaran, ETH will trump BTC as a better lubricant for blockchain commerce. As for Bitcoin, the NYU professor said that the premier crypto was a speculative play, adding:Indeed, decentralized finance as an emerging market segment has grown massively on the Ethereum network. According to DappRadar, the adjusted total value locked in ETH-based DeFi protocols is above $65 billion as of the time of writing.Earlier in May, Uniswap — an ETH-based decentralized exchange — flipped Bitcoin on daily revenue indicating the scale of the transaction volume disparity between Ethereum and Bitcoin.Damodaran’s Bitcoin critique is not new as the NYU professor called BTC an “inefficient currency” earlier in May. Back in August 2017, Damodaran, popularly dubbed Wall Street’s “dean of valuation” described Bitcoin as a “pricing game with no good ending.”The NYU professor of finance also called for a more nuanced crypto nomenclature that better captures the differences among existing cryptocurrencies. According to Damodaran, “I think we need to start to separate the crypto space into those cryptos that are trying to be currencies, those cryptos that are trying to be collectibles — millennial gold — and those cryptos that are actually commodities.”As previously reported, the crypto market is in the middle of a massive downtrend with Bitcoin dipping more than 30% in the last eight days. The total market capitalization has also taken a huge dent, losing over $800 billion within the same period."
118,"Stack Funds — an issuer of crypto access products that include trackers, indexes and structure vehicles for institutions — has released a new report predicting that Bitcoin (BTC) dominance is set to ratchet back up to former highs in the near future.As of the start of 2021, Bitcoin dominance — the cryptocurrency's share of the total market capitalization of all crypto assets — has been on a steady decline, down from 72.3% in January to roughly 40% this week. As Stack Funds' head of research Lennard Neo notes, that figure represents a three-year low since May 2018. Whilst BTC dominance has continued to go south, total market capitalization has gone in the opposite direction, gaining 40% in value over the same time frame. For Stack Funds, this implies that investors' capital remains locked in the crypto markets. Neo notes that key sectoral rotation has been at play, with investors seeking to maximize opportunity costs, as seen by the rise of Ether's (ETH) price by almost 180% at last month's highs.However, the dynamics between dominance and the wider markets suggest a swing back in trends. For Stack Funds, BTC dominance is long due for a rebound:Stack Funds' report also notes the dramatic volatility of the past week, echoing other commentators and analysts who have pointed to the impact of comments from Elon Musk and his company Tesla, as well as bearish news of a potentially renewed crypto crackdown in China."
119,"Bitcoin (BTC) saw a dip like no other on Wednesday, falling to $30,000 in a frantic three-hour shakeout that upended the market.As the dust settles, however, it’s no longer about the dip, but rather the recovery — what makes current BTC price action special?It took around one hour for BTC/USD to go from $39,000 to $30,000 on Wednesday. This is a formidable drop but nothing unheard of when it comes to historical price action.In dollar terms rather than a percentage, however, that hour was unlike anything seen before. Even during the COVID-19 crash in March 2020, Bitcoin’s 60% correction was smaller when measured in United States dollars.$BTC: Officially a +50% correction.

First one in more than a year.If that weren’t enough, what happened next was even more unusual. After bouncing at exactly $30,000, Bitcoin shot up to $37,000 almost immediately, going on to crack $40,000 shortly after. This was the biggest rebound ever seen, squarely beating March 2020 in both percentage and raw USD terms. As skeptical sources called a “dead cat bounce,” Bitcoin held fast, still circling at around $39,000 over 12 hours after the bounce at the time of writing.Bitcoin’s market composition changed over the past 24 hours and is now likely made up of a different class of trader.This is due to the veracity of both the dip and the recovery. In total, daily liquidations among traders totaled over $8 billion.This was also far from a rare occurrence, as price volatility regularly claims the wealth of large numbers of leveraged traders in particular. Due to the size of the dip in USD, however, anyone with a long bet likely got frozen out of the market with nothing.The way back up likewise took care of those banking on a further retracement toward the old all-time highs of $20,000. Support levels, order book data showed at the time, were broadly absent below $30,000, meaning that such a scenario was a real possibility.Just how nervous traders have become as a result of recent events is shown by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index.The classic sentiment indicator dropped to just 11/100, firmly within its “extreme greed” zone and its lowest reading since April 2020. Fear & Greed was at 73, or “greed,” as recently as May 9, making its own drop something of a unique event in its existence. The implication, therefore, is that sentiment around cryptocurrency is currently unduly skewed to the downside, with a correction of oversold token prices expected.“Bitcoin at 40k and appetite for risk is still rock bottom,” popular Twitter account Bitcoin Archive commented on the Index."
120,"China’s blockchain-linked equity stocks have been doing notably better than the rest of the global crypto equity market during a flash crash on Wednesday.According to a Bloomberg-curated basket of eight Chinese A-share equities tied to the blockchain industry, China’s blockchain equity stocks were down less than 2% as of 6 a.m. UTC on Thursday, Bloomberg reports. The equity basket comprises shares of IT services company Shenzhen Forms Syntron, business management firm Ygsoft, and data exchange-focused company Brilliance Technology.Ygsoft — a Chinese company specializing in blockchain-based tools for supply chain and product traceability — is down around 1.6% over the past 24 hours at the time of writing, according to data from TradingView. Brilliance Technology, which develops payment and transaction tools implementing big data and blockchain, slipped over 2% at publishing time.The losses of China’s blockchain-linked stocks are significantly smaller than those of the industry equity market in the rest of the world, compared to more than 5% average plunge for a Bloomberg’s basket of 24 global blockchain and crypto shares outside the country.Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase closed Wednesday trading with nearly 6% losses, slipping to $224. Michael Saylor’s business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, which holds a substantial amount of Bitcoin (BTC), sank nearly 7%.The contrast between blockchain-related equity markets in China and the rest of the world can be attributed to China’s prior crackdowns on crypto. The country banned cryptocurrency trading and token issuance back in 2017, significantly narrowing the nature of its publicly traded blockchain-tied companies. This made China less affected by movements inthe crypto market, according to Vijay Ayyar, head of Asia Pacific at Singapore-based crypto exchange Luno."
121,"As Bitcoin's price took a sharp dive to “pre-Elon Musk pump” levels of $30,000, mainstream media took an unsurprising approach covering the marketwide crash by announcing that Bitcoin is dead.The end of Bitcoin (BTC) has now been announced more than 400 times in 12 years, according to the Bitcoin Obituaries archive. There are 414 obituaries for Bitcoin since its inception in 2010, and Wednesday's post-mortem assessments of Bitcoin are still being added.The obituaries range from calling Bitcoin the biggest Ponzi scheme in history to comparing BTC to Monopoly money.The first year of crypto shows only one record, when Bitcoin's price was $0.23, explaining that Bitcoin can’t be a currency. More than a quarter of the submissions are related to the 2017 Bitcoin bull run and the huge crash afterward.While the negative stories on Bitcoin arrive primarily in times of price crashes, Bitcoin obituaries data shows that it’s not unusual to have an article burying the largest cryptocurrency while the market is still growing.Bitcoin has always been a good topic for the mainstream media to criticize. Its price volatility, the still-unsolved mystery of creator Satoshi Nakamoto, and its decentralized structure that enables usage in illegal transactions make Bitcoin an easy target for sensational headlines.This week’s price dip similarly triggered apocalyptic headlines from a slew of mainstream media outlets. Over $350 billion was lost in cryptocurrency market capitalization, and altcoins saw a 15%–30% price dip throughout the day. Some major crypto trading platforms such as Coinbase, Binance and Gemini experienced downtimes due to the unusual market activity.Despite the crash, some experts are convinced that the market will bounce back. Yesterday, Cointelegraph organized a livestream to analyze and understand the market’s situation, with Charlie Burton and Michaël van de Poppe as guests. The question “Was today’s market movement the end of the bull cycle?” received a solid “No” from both guests."
122,"In complete 180 on his stance just a few months ago, the global Chief Investment Officer of investment giant Guggenheim has reacted to the crypto market crash by referring to it as ‘Tulipmania’.It seems like Elon Musk is not the only wealthy person to make a u-turn on their position towards Bitcoin and crypto assets. As late as February, Guggenheim’s CIO Scott Minerd was calling for a long term Bitcoin price of $600,000 based on Guggenheim’s “fundamental research”.But with markets plunging Minerd alluded to a bubble with his comments earlier today that claimed that “supply has swamped demand”.Crypto has proven to be Tulipmania. As prices rise, tulip bulbs and #crypto currencies multiply until supply swamps demand at previous market clearing prices.Tulipmania is a phrase derived from a period during the Dutch Golden Age when prices for some bulbs of the fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels, and then dramatically collapsed.Compound Finance founder Robert Leshner argued that Minerd's tweet was inaccurate:Other industry experts also chimed in with crypto YouTuber Lark Davis replying with “wasn't your company going to invest hundreds of millions into Bitcoin? This comment shows you guys must have done almost no research on the topic, shocking.”Others speculated that the investment company was trying to push prices down so that they could buy more.It is not the first time Minerd has flip-flopped with his stance on crypto assets. In January he said that BTC would dump to $20,000 adding that it would go no higher than its price at the time which had just topped $40,000.The FUD followed Guggenheim's proposed SEC filing to buy $500 million in BTC with critics arguing it may have been an effort to keep markets low to facilitate cheaper purchases. These bearish statements also came after a declaration in December in which he stated that the asset should be one day worth $400,000.In April, Minerd was back with his predictions of doom and gloom calling for a return to $20,000 after Bitcoin had already blasted past $50,000. In the weeks that followed the asset went on to reach an all-time high of $65,000 before the inevitable correction began.The pullback as it stands is currently at 43.5% with BTC hitting an intraday low of $36,700 in late trading on Wednesday, May 19."
123,"Traders have become accustomed to perpetual futures markets trading pretty much in line with the regular spot markets. After all, there are incentives for arbitrage desks to buy those contracts at a discount.However, during periods of extreme volatility, market makers typically are not able to meet the demand. This movement could happen due to connectivity problems with the exchanges serves or the market makers' lack of funds to add more positions.While these situations are rare, today's performance was nothing short of unusual as some altcoins dropped by 30% or more. This movement caused anomalies on futures contracts, which created a buying opportunity for those savvy enough to take advantage.Take notice of how Ether/USDT perpetual contracts at Binance reached a $1,400 intraday low while the regular spot market bottomed at $1,888. This $488 difference, or 26%, was likely caused by aggressive liquidation orders, which totaled $2 billion at Binance.It is worth noting that users were not harmed by the price difference as liquidations are triggered by the index price, which is an average from multiple spot exchanges. Thus, even if the perpetual futures trade below the reference, the automatic stop orders are not triggered.As one move to less liquid altcoins, the situation tends to get worse. This is caused mainly due to light orderbooks, fewer market participants, and less interest from market makers due to lower volumes.Sushi perpetual futures at Binance hit a $5.80 low, while regular spot markets bottomed at $10.25, a 43% difference. Notice that such extreme gaps seldom last for more than 15 minutes, as new market participants enter the scene to buy at a discount.The above chart shows Litecoin's September futures at OKEx, which traded over $250 million over the past 24 hours. Despite the liquidity, it traded at $128.20 low, while spot exchanges had a $152.50 bottom. The 16% price difference shows how both perpetual futures and monthly contracts price might face momentarily price distortions.While the price gap won't trigger liquidation orders, it does affect traders that entered stop orders based on 'last' or 'mark' price. Most derivatives exchanges will allow users to choose which pricing source should be used.As shown above, it's crucial that futures traders hoping to avoid price distortions like the one seen today select the 'index' price, as this is calculated by the average price on spot exchanges instead of the perpetual contract itself.For traders who might have been liquidated on today's move, it's better to avoid entering new positions at the moment. A better move would be to study the market and better understand how volatility impacts leverage trading, a topic which was thoroughly discussed by Cointelegraph recently.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

124,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) massive bloodbath on May 19 resulted in panic selling across the board. Several major altcoins nosedived between 25% to 50% during the day. The extent of the fall shows that many large traders may have dumped their positions and leverage traders may have been roasted.In a report to its clients on Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase analysts pointed out that institutional investors were abandoning Bitcoin in favor of gold. Considering the volatility ratio of Bitcoin to gold, JP Morgan believes Bitcoin’s current fair value is $35,000.The massive fall today is likely to scare several institutional investors and delay their entry into the space. Although there will be periodic rebounds and sharp bear rallies, the next bull run may not start in a hurry.Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz also told CNBC that the decline feels like capitulation and this breakdown may not be fixed quickly.After the sharp decline and the subsequent rebound, let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the support and resistance levels.Bitcoin’s close below the neckline on May 17 completed the bearish head and shoulders pattern. The buyers attempted to push the price back above the neckline on May 18 but failed as seen from the long wick on today’s candlestick.The selling picked up momentum today and turned into capitulation as the BTC/USDT pair plunged to $29,257.95, exceeding the H&S pattern target at $31,653.73. This fall has pushed the relative strength index (RSI) deep into the oversold territory for the first time since March 2020.Generally, after such a sharp fall, a pullback can be expected because traders who initiated short positions at higher levels may book profits and aggressive bulls may have purchased near the critical support at $28,850.The long tail on the candlestick suggests strong buying on dips but the rise from the current levels may not be easy because the bulls are likely to encounter massive supply at the neckline. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair could consolidate in a large range between $28,850 and $44,000 for the next few days.Ether (ETH) broke below the 50-day simple moving average ($2,760) and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $2,467.78 today. This resulted in panic selling and the biggest altcoin plummeted below the 78.6% retracement at $1,949.41 to hit an intraday low at $1,801.60.However, a minor positive is that buyers have aggressively bought the dip as seen from the long tail on the candlestick. If the bulls can sustain the price above the 50-day SMA, the ETH/USDT pair could rally to the 20-day exponential moving average ($3,370). This move is likely to attract selling from the bears because the sentiment has turned negative.If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the pair may drop to the 50-day SMA. If this level holds, the pair may consolidate between the moving averages.On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA, the pair may gradually drop to $1,801.60. If this level holds, the pair could remain range-bound for a few days. However, if the bears sink the price below $1,801.60, the down move may reach $1,289.09.The buyers defended the $480 support on May 17 and 18 but the incessant selling today dragged Binance Coin (BNB) to $280. With today's decline, the altcoin came close to a 100% retracement of the bull run that started from $233.81 on March 26.The moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover, indicating the trend has changed from bullish to bearish. Any relief rally from the current level is likely to face stiff resistance at $428 and again at $480.If the price turns down from either level, the BNB/USDT pair may retest $233.81. If this level also gives way, the next support is at $186.10. The bulls are likely to defend this zone aggressively.Cardano (ADA) formed an inside-day candlestick pattern on May 18, which showed indecision among the bulls and the bears. The uncertainty resolved to the downside today, resulting in a massive long liquidations by the bulls.The capitulation pulled the ADA/USDT pair down to $0.95 today, its lowest level since April 23. However, the bulls have purchased the dip aggressively as seen from the long tail on the day’s candlestick.If the bulls can sustain the price above the 20-day EMA ($1.74), it will suggest strong demand at lower levels. The pair may then consolidate between $1.48 and $2 for a few days. Conversely, if the price turns down and breaks below $1.48, the pair could gradually drop to $1.Although Dogecoin (DOGE) sustained above the 20-day EMA ($0.46) for the past few days, the bulls could not achieve a strong rebound. This showed a lack of demand at higher levels.The DOGE/USDT pair broke below the 50-day SMA ($0.30) and hit an intraday low at $0.21. The bulls have purchased the dip aggressively as seen from the long tail on the day’s candlestick.If the bulls can sustain the price above $0.35, the pair could rise to the 20-day EMA. This level is likely to attract selling and the pair may then remain range-bound between the moving averages for a few days.XRP pierced the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle on May 18 but the long wick on the candlestick suggests the bulls could not sustain the breakout. The price reversed direction today and plummeted below the support line of the triangle, which may have resulted in huge long liquidations.However, the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests the bulls purchased the dip to the critical support at $0.88. The buyers will now try to push the price back into the triangle but they are likely to face stiff resistance at the moving averages.If the price turns down from the 50-day SMA ($1.31), the XRP/USDT pair could again gradually drop to $0.88. If the support holds, the pair may consolidate between $1.20 and $0.88 for a few days.Polkadot (DOT) attempted to take support at the moving averages on May 18 but the demand fizzled out at $42.59. The altcoin turned down today and deep dived to $18, the lowest level since Feb. 3.If the price closes below $26.50, the bears may continue to pound the DOT/USDT pair and retest the $18 support.On the contrary, if the relief rally sustains above $26.50, it will suggest the capitulation may be over. The pair could then gradually move up to $32.50 and then to the moving averages.If the price turns down from the overhead resistance but stays above $26.50 during the next decline, a range-bound action may ensue.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) attempted at recovery on May 18 but could not rise above the 20-day EMA ($1,134). The long wick on the day’s candlestick showed that traders are selling on rallies to stiff resistance levels.The selling picked up momentum after the BCH/USDT pair broke below $940 and the next critical support at $686.75. The pair finally hit an intraday low at $473.84, its lowest level since March 26.Aggressive bulls seem to have purchased at lower levels, resulting in a strong recovery as seen from the long tail on the candlestick.However, the relief rally is likely to hit a hurdle near $940. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair could consolidate in a large range between $442.96 and $940 for the next few days.The bulls defended the 50-day SMA ($272) on May 17 but they could not extend the recovery above the 20-day EMA ($299) on May 18. This suggests that traders sold their Litecoin (LTC) positions during the relief rally.Today, the selling resumed and the LTC/USDT pair plunged below the 50-day SMA and the support line of the broadening wedge pattern. This may have resulted in panic selling, dragging the price down to $143.57, the lowest level since Feb. 05.If the price closes below the support line, the bears may resume selling and a retest of $143.57 may be on the cards. Conversely, if the price climbs back into the wedge, the pair may rise to the moving averages where it is again likely to encounter selling from the bears.Uniswap (UNI) broke below the support line of the ascending channel on May 17 but the bulls pushed the price back into the range on May 18. However, the buyers could not clear the hurdle at the 20-day EMA ($36), indicating selling at higher levels.The UNI/USDT pair turned down today and broke below the support line of the channel. The selling picked up momentum after the $25.52 support cracked. This may have caused long liquidation, resulting in a drop to an intraday low at $16.However, the positive sign is that the bulls purchased this dip and are attempting to start a relief rally. This rally may face stiff resistance at $30 and then again at the moving averages. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair may drop to $25.52 and remain range-bound for a few days.Alternatively, if the price closes below $25.52, the bears may try to build on their advantage and sink the price to $16.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

125,"The fundamental value drivers of cryptocurrencies have been questioned a lot since the 2017 bull run. Professional investors that are considering an allocation into digital assets are wondering what the assets’ real value is. A recent report by crypto-asset manager Iconic Funds and Cryptology Asset Group, a leading European asset manager for crypto assets and blockchain-based businesses, aims to shed light on this topic. The fundamental value of each cryptocurrency depends on its unique use case, which makes it impossible to apply a single valuation method to every token. For example, Bitcoin (BTC) can be analyzed with traditional commodity valuation models because one of its use cases is as a hedge against monetary depreciation. On the other hand, Ether (ETH) does not have a capped supply like Bitcoin. Other coins such as MakerDAO’s MKR token are governance tokens designed to empower community governance in decentralized finance, or DeFi, protocols.The new report by Iconic Funds and Cryptology suggests a way to value a diverse range of digital assets. The study — which was authored by Robert Richter, a research fellow at the Frankfurt School Blockchain Center, and Philipp Rosenbach, an investment banking analyst at Alantra, identifies 19 value drivers for cryptocurrencies within five clusters: financial factors, development activity, social media dominance, network usage, network size and sophistication. One of the report’s notable finds is that the number of online searches for Bitcoin is not a significant predictor of its price; however, social media presence is a real value driver for altcoins.Read the research report issued by Iconic Funds and Cryptology here.According to the analysis, the value of Bitcoin appears to be primarily driven by its stock-to-flow ratio. Another variable that could serve as a fundamental value driver for Bitcoin is the number of active addresses: The data shows that the number closely tracked the price until mid-2020. In other words, increasing adoption of the biggest cryptocurrency may have steered its price. However, it poorly explains Bitcoin’s recent rise to new all-time highs.For Ether, the number of verified smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain tends to be a solid price predictor. Because the number of active users on the blockchain represents the popularity of Ethereum as an ecosystem of decentralized applications (DApps), there is a case for using the number as a valuation tool for ETH. The prices of other blockchains designed to create DApps — such as Polkadot, Neo or EOS — are more correlated with Ether’s price than with their own network’s development activity, surprisingly.The other tokens analyzed in the report include payment coins such as Dash, Stellar’s Lumen (XLM) and Litecoin (LTC). These tokens’ prices are dependent on Bitcoin’s movements, whereas financial attributes such as transaction volume or velocity — which were expected to drive the price of payments coins — barely impact the price of the assets.Furthermore, the report surmises that the price movements of crypto exchange tokens are driven more by market sentiment than by their use on exchanges. The only cryptocurrency that appeared to respond to Bitcoin and Ether prices directly was Binance Coin (BNB), while the primary driver for Huobi Token (HT) was the exchange’s number of Twitter followers. Nevertheless, the market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio proved to be a fundamental value driver for three out of five coins in the exchange token category, according to the report, which suggests that the ratio is a relatively good driver for this type of cryptocurrency."
126,"Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that the initial price dump that pushed BTC below the $43,000 support level on May 18 accelerated into the overnight trading session as $110 billion worth of trading volume fueled the wick down to $30,000.The market downturn sparked outages and other delays across a few of the top cryptocurrency exchanges, and the prices of the vast majority of altcoins cratered alongside the price of Bitcoin, with Ether (ETH) briefly plunging to $1,900 and Dogecoin (DOGE) bottoming out at $0.236.As with any significant downturn in the crypto market, derivatives and leveraged traders were hit especially hard by the rapid $8,000 price drop in BTC that resulted in a record 10,525 BTC being liquidated in one hour at the peak of the market squeeze.While leveraged traders were wiped out, some well-positioned traders and larger entities with dry powder used this opportunity to buy the dip and promptly put their newly acquired Bitcoin into personal wallets, as evidenced by the outflow of 16,895 BTC in a span of 10 minutes earlier on May 19.As for what to expect next for Bitcoin, some clues have been offered by the team at Whalemap, which identified $33,000 as the new major support level for BTC, with the previous support at $46,000 now becoming a major resistance level should the price try to bounce higher.#Bitcoin supports, where are they + some analysis

1) In terms of TA, 33k looks like a support. A very similar set up can be observed at 46k which is shown below.

Previous support at 46 should also be resistance if we bounce from 33. pic.twitter.com/hdk2EHD9MeFurther analysis from the team also highlighted support levels at $37,400 and $34,200 and indicated that should the price continue to fall lower, it is crucial that the $29,000 support hold or the price could flush as low as $19,000.While a price dip below $29,000 may seem dire to some, Whalemap instead closed its analysis by stating: The saying that “As goes Bitcoin, so goes the rest of the market” held true in this most recent downturn, resulting in red across the board for altcoins.Some of the hardest-hit coins in the top 30 include Litecoin (LTC), Polkadot's DOT and EOS, which have seen their prices fall by roughly 30% over the past 24 hours. As the market corrected, a series of price manipulations on the Binance Smart Chain-based Venus decentralized finance platform led to a 60% drop in the price of XVS.Out of the top 200 cryptocurrency projects, the only two that managed to see positive gains amid the market turmoil were Celer Network's CELR, which gained 3.33% on the day, and Unus Sed Leo (LEO), which saw its price increase by 5.25%.The overall cryptocurrency market capitalization now stands at $1.786 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 42.1%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

127,"After an agonizing 35% loss in the past 24-hours, Bitcoin (BTC) finally bounced at $30,000 earlier today in the May 19 trading session. A total of $3.5 billion in liquidations took place, which might have accelerated the movement, but they can't really be entirely blamed for the move.However, the weakness in derivatives markets did give some strong signals that panic was instilled, causing unsustainable levels. These can be measured by the price gap between the futures markets and regular spot exchanges, along with the negative funding rate on perpetual contracts.Pinpointing the exact culprit of the price movement is a daunting task, although Elon Musk's remarks on Bitcoin mining coal usage likely played some role. However, May 19 marked the deadline for Tether Holdings Limited's breakdown of Tether's (USDT) reserves to the Office of the New York Attorney General.Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Avanti Financial, stated that traders might have felt compelled to sell other cryptocurrencies to reduce their total risk exposure given the credit risk that emerged from Tether's reserve disclosure.As reported by Cointelegraph, regulatory uncertainties entered the spotlight earlier this month when United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler expressed their concerns about the cryptocurrency sector.On May 18, a banking and trade association under the People's Bank of China issued a statement titled ""Preventing the risk of virtual currency transaction speculation."" It then went on to call on member institutions to abide by existing regulatory provisions regarding digital currencies.The combination of these bearish factors resulted in the 50% correction seen in the past nine days, and its impact on futures markets finally showed clear signals of exhaustion. By analyzing the futures markets' price difference versus regular spot exchanges, one can better understand how the price move has impacted professional traders.Typically, the three-month futures should trade with an 8% to 15% annualized premium, comparable to the stablecoin lending rate. By postponing settlement, sellers demand a higher price, causing the price difference.Over the past couple of weeks, the indicator sustained above the 8% level, signaling confidence. However, during the dip to $30,000 on May 19, the situation changed drastically as a backwardation emerged for the first time in a year. In this case, the futures markets trade below the regular spot exchange prices — a very concerning situation.As the futures premium quickly reestablished a healthy 7% level, one might conclude that it had been caused by stop loss and liquidation orders that pushed the price down to $30,000.To better assess whether this movement was something specific to the monthly and quarterly futures, we should look at the perpetual futures contracts. These derivatives, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate usually charged every eight hours to ensure there are no exchange risk imbalances.Whales, arbitrage desks and market makers avoid exposure on these contracts due to their variable funding rate. When longs demand more leverage, they are the ones paying the fee. The opposite holds when shorts are using more leverage, thus causing a negative funding rate.As shown above, the indicator entered unsustainable levels, as a -0.20% rate equals a 4.3% weekly fee paid by short-sellers. This situation is seldom sustainable for more than a couple of days, as it incentives buyers to enter long positions.Both the U.S. regulatory uncertainty and Office of the New York Attorney General's action on Tether's disclosure might take months or years to develop. Meanwhile, China's actions show no difference from the September 2017 move when the country announced the shutdown of all exchange operations and initial coin offerings.Thus, considering the negative futures premium and perpetual contracts funding rate impact, it is safe to say that $30,000 was the rock bottom of liquidations.The 54% price correction from the $64,900 all-time high marks the exaggerated market reaction to speculation rather than the reaction to news that could harm Bitcoin's functionalities and importance as a scarce, censorship-resistant asset.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

128,"Wells Fargo Investment Institute announced that it will soon open an investment product for its wealthy clients, with president Darren Cronk declaring the firm’s stance that the cryptocurrency space has finally come of age.The research division of Wells Fargo Wealth & Investment Management, which oversees close to $2 trillion in assets, is in the process of evaluating and onboarding its cryptocurrency investment platform for qualified investors. The platform is expected to be launched by around mid-June, after the final stages of the due diligence process.“We think the cryptocurrency space has just kind of hit an evolution and maturation of its development that allows it now to be a viable investable asset,” said Cronk in an interview with Business Insider.As recently as December 2020, Wells Fargo Investment Institute was hesitant to state any interest in the cryptocurrency space, with its head of real asset strategy, John LaForge, telling a media conference that the institute had little interest in crypto.Cronk said there was still risk involved, referencing a $2 trillion global market cap — which has since shrunk to $1.3 trillion at the time of writing as Bitcoin (BTC) and the cryptocurrency space experience one of the worst bloodbaths in recent memory.Customer protections and regulations were on Cronk’s mind when he looked ahead to the product launch, noting the still-evolving landscape ahead.“There's a whole element of consumer protections and regulations that have to still evolve with the changing landscape. So we're not without risk, it's just that we think there can be a viable investable option for those clients who show an interest,” said Cronk."
129,"Amid Bitcoin touching five-month lows near $30,000, JPMorgan Chase analysts suggested that large institutional investors are now dumping Bitcoin (BTC) in favor of gold.In its Tuesday note to clients, JPMorgan suggested that institutional investors are going back to gold, reversing a major bullish cryptocurrency market action that drove Bitcoin's price above $64,000 in mid-April.Citing open interest data in Bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the American megabank said that BTC futures now saw the first biggest decline since the bull market that started in late 2020:Despite pointing out the latest trend reversal of gold over Bitcoin, JPMorgan still maintains its previous forecast that Bitcoin is on track to hit $140,000 in the long term. “This $140k price should be thought of as a long-term theoretical target assuming a convergence of bitcoin volatility to that of gold and an equalization of bitcoin allocations to that of gold in investor portfolios,” the new investor note reads.According to JPMorgan, the current fair value for Bitcoin based on a volatility ratio of Bitcoin to gold would be one-quarter of $140,000, or $35,000.In January, JPMorgan analysts forecast that Bitcoin could potentially evolve into a compelling alternative to gold and hit $146,000 over the long term. “A convergence in volatilities between Bitcoin and gold is unlikely to happen quickly and is in our mind a multiyear process,” JPMorgan noted.JPMorgan’s remarks come amid Bitcoin experiencing one of its wildest historic crushes in a day, falling from an intraday high of above $43,000 to below the $32,000 price mark. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has somewhat rebounded since then, trading at $37,137 at the time of writing, down around 16% over the past 24 hours. With a continued bloodbath on the market, BTC is still up nearly 300% over the past year, now trading at levels of mid-January."
130,"Bitcoin bulls should brace for aggressive downside market corrections in the sessions ahead, especially as the benchmark cryptocurrency breaks below a critical support level.Dubbed the 20-week exponential moving average (EMA), the wave has historically served as a primary downside target for bulls to accumulate Bitcoin (BTC). For instance, the BTC/USD exchange rate maintained its bullish bias all across 2020 while trading above the 20-week EMA wave. It eventually closed the year up more than 400%.Similarly, the 20-week EMA wave supported massive bullish rallies in the April–June 2019 session. Meanwhile, the price floor overstayed its welcome in the 2015–2017 session as Bitcoin surged from $250 to $20,000.Conversely, slipping below the 20-week EMA wave brought havoc to the Bitcoin market. For instance, the January–December 2018 session logged a 72% decline after the BTC/USD rate slipped below the 20-week EMA. It repeated the same pattern in the September 2019–March 2020 trading session; the pair fell by around 60% after breaking below said wave support.Negative fundamentals also fueled sell-offs in 2018, 2019 and 2020. In 2018, traders offloaded their Bitcoin positions under the influence of initial coin offering scams. Meanwhile, in 2019, worries over Facebook's Libra token launch, coupled with the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard fork and its potential impact on the Bitcoin network, pulled prices lower.In 2020, the coronavirus pandemic prompted a global market crash. In February, Bitcoin, which was sitting atop attractive rebound profits, became an ideal scapegoat for investors to withdraw their profits to cover their losses in other traditional markets.Bitcoin's break below the 20-week EMA support this week appeared out of a flurry of panic-inducing events. First, Elon Musk, who had invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin via his electric vehicle firm Tesla, reversed his decision to accept the cryptocurrency as payment, citing environmental concerns.The ""emotional billionaire,"" as described by Anthony Pompliano, doubled his attack on Bitcoin over the weekend after raising alarms that he would unload his $1.5 billion investment in the cryptocurrency.That thoroughly coincided with a breakdown in Bitcoin's price. First, it fell from $55,000 to $50,000, then to nearly $42,000.The 20-week EMA during the price-decline period was near the $46,000 level. This week, BTC/USD crashed to a new sessional low of $30,000 on Coinbase.The technical fractals alone suggest that Bitcoin's price eyes an extended downside correction toward its 50-week simple moving average (SMA) (the blue wave in the chart above). Part of the reason is the cryptocurrency's tendency to test the 20-week EMA wave for pullbacks.The ""Fractal 2"" box in the chart above shows the same: Bitcoin maintained support above the blue wave before crashing below it in the wake of pandemic FUD — fear, uncertainty and doubt. The ""Fractal 1"" box also shows the same.Meanwhile, when even the 50-week SMA did not hold up strong against bears, the prices crashed toward the 200-week SMA. At present, the 200-week SMA sits near $12,800.""If we see the low $30,000s soon, it will then be a question of will we see $10,000–$20,000,"" noted Clem Chambers, chief executive of financial research outlet ADVFN.""To me, that’s possible because when the ‘I bought at the top’ brigade stampedes for the exit, it will get extremely spicy,"" he added.Higher inflation remains one of the core bullish catalysts behind the yearlong Bitcoin price rally. It has soared by more than 300% in the previous 12 months, despite the recent downside correction, taking cues from the Federal Reserve's aggressive quantitative easing policy that has lifted investment appeal off traditional safe-havens, including government bonds and the U.S. dollar.Bitcoin bulls present it as a provably scarce asset, citing its limited supply cap of 21 million coins. That has prompted veteran investors such as Stan Druckenmiller, Paul Tudor Jones, and Mike Novogratz to gain exposure in the cryptocurrency market.Meanwhile, corporate houses other than Tesla, which include Square and MicroStrategy, have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a measure against inflation. Institutional banking systems such as JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have also announced Bitcoin-enabled investment services for their wealthy clients, pointing that they would be preparing for a spike in demand from mainstream investors.Novogratz reminded people on Tuesday that Bitcoin is still trading about 32% higher on a year-to-date timeframe, telling CNBC that sometimes markets get ahead of themselves and correct lower to neutralize the overall sentiment. He added:""We are seeing more and more institutions,"" says @Novogratz. ""I just see an inexorable move from financial institutions and tech companies into the #crypto space. Will it all be #bitcoin or #ethereum?

131,"Luis de Guindos, vice president of the European Central Bank, has dismissed the value proposition of cryptocurrencies as investment assets.Speaking to Bloomberg TV, the ECB vice president remarked that crypto should not be seen as a real investment. “When you have difficulties to find out what are the real fundamentals of an investment, then what you’re doing is not a real investment,” de Guindos argued, adding:According to de Guindos, the current market drawdown is not different from the explosive surge recorded between quarter four of 2020 and quarter one of 2021. Indeed, the ECB executive opined that the present decline is symptomatic of the volatility of the cryptocurrency market.Earlier in May, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey warned that crypto investors were liable to lose their money. While de Guindos’s argument on Wednesday hinged on weak fundamentals and volatility, Bailey contended that crypto lacked intrinsic value during a conference held earlier in the month.Indeed, crypto prices have been on the decline in the last week, with Bitcoin (BTC) shedding over $15,000 from its price. In all, the market has lost over $750 billion, with about half of the slump occurring in the last 24-hour trading period.The current decline has seen the percent of unique Bitcoin entities in profit slide to its lowest level since the Black Thursday crash of 2020.Bitcoin has rebounded on the three previous occasions when this metric fell amid a significant bullish advance, and crypto proponents will most likely be hopeful of a repeat in this regard.Meanwhile, record Bitcoin inflows are hitting crypto exchanges, with data from crypto on-chain monitoring service Glassnode indicating that newer entrants are responsible for the bulk of the selling pressure."
132,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell by $8,000 in hours on Wednesday as hodlers saw a return of levels not seen since the start of February.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD stumbling to new lows of $32,200 on Wednesday.Selling pressure, already high, kept coming as claims of a fresh Chinese crackdown combined with a stocks rout and a strengthening United States dollar.In what is being called by some a “capitulation bottom,” Bitcoin failed to hold $40,000 support and began abrief freefall below its significant 200-day moving average. While the dip in dollar terms was average by Bitcoin’s standards, it caused mayhem among speculative traders, with a single hour seeing $2.7 billion of liquidations. Total 24-hour liquidations stood at $6.5 billion.“Long leveraged traders liquidation spike on that move down in the past hour,” Philip Swift, founder of analytics resource LookIntoBitcoin, tweeted alongside a chart. Rafael Schultze-Kraft, co-founder of fellow analysis resource Glassnode, added that short-term BTC investors were now at a loss and that current prices represented a line in the sand.He referenced Glassnode’s Short Term Holder MVRV indicator, which looks at the price of unspent transaction outputs 155 days old or less.“Short-term holders now under water, as STH-MVRV drops below the neutral line. Key level,” he commented.At the time of writing, Bitcoin was attempting to cement a floor above $37,000 amid uncertain conditions.On altcoins, the picture was similarly grim, with many major-cap tokens shedding nearly 30% on the day.Among the biggest drops were Telcoin (TEL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), both of which had previously booked significant gains.Ether (ETH), meanwhile, briefly lost sight of $2,000 before recovering.A silver lining for Bitcoin bulls was its market capitalizatio dominance, which rose from below 40% to nearly 45%."
133,"The United States’ banking regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is set to review cryptocurrency-related rule-making following the departure of Brian Brooks. Michael Hsu, the newly appointed acting comptroller of the currency, has requested a staff review of former OCC rule-making regarding the crypto industry as part of his testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.In prepared remarks, Hsu asked the OCC staff to review its cryptocurrency-related actions like updating the framework for chartering national banks and trust companies, interpreting crypto custody services as part of the banking business, and establishing an Office of Innovation. “At the OCC, the focus has been on encouraging responsible innovation. I have asked staff to review these actions,” the official said.Hsu argued that the review of the OCC’s crypto rule-making aims to address a fragmented agency-by-agency approach to major financial trends and set a proper regulatory perimeter. “To the extent there is interagency coordination, it tends to be tactical, to deal with a pressing issue, such as Facebook’s Diem,” he noted, continuing:The new Comptroller of the Currency stressed that his focus will be ensuring that OCC-supervised banks “operate in a safe and sound manner, meet the credit needs of their communities, treat all customers fairly, and comply with laws and regulations.”Brooks departed the OCC in January 2021 after joining in March 2020. Also the former head of the legal team at Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase, Brooks is now the CEO of Binance.US, the United States-based affiliate of the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance.The OCC made a number of major regulatory decisions for the crypto industry under Brook’s tenure, including the authorization of federal U.S. banks to hold reserve currencies for stablecoins. In April, the OCC granted major stablecoin company Paxos a federal charter to form a national trust bank. "
134,"Bitcoin (BTC) is down almost 30% in the last seven days, and this dip has triggered an almost commensurate plunge in the percentage of wallets in profit.Data from crypto data provider Glassnode shows that Bitcoin’s price drawdown has led to almost a quarter of unique on-chain entities being at a loss. This situation also bears some parallels to previous extreme downside price action periods that interrupted bullish advances.During the Black Thursday crash of March 2020, unique on-chain entities at a loss also approached the 25% mark as Bitcoin fell almost 50%.Further back, the 2019 rally from the $3,500 bottom of the 2018 bear market also had a similar temporary break that saw the percentage of unique wallets at a loss also slide toward 25%.In all previous situations where the percent of entities at a loss approached 25% during a bullish advance, Bitcoin quickly rebounded to post a new high.Glassnode’s price drawdown from the all-time high chart also paints a similar picture of the severity of the current BTC decline. Bitcoin’s price drawdown from ATH is currently at 33% — the most since BTC smashed the $20,000 price barrier back in November.Back in January, the price drawdown from ATH also briefly touched 27% as Bitcoin’s uninterrupted price quadrupling that began in September 2020 cooled off as BTC lost about $10,000 within a week.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin inflows to exchanges have surged over the past week, reaching levels not seen since Black Thursday.The massive selloff has seen the total crypto market capitalization lose about $700 billion within the last seven days. More than half of that decline happened in the last 24 hours as several cryptocurrencies shed between 15% and 30% in one-day trading prices."
135,"Bitcoin (BTC) has hit its lowest price since Feb. 8 and is struggling to maintain $40,000 — but is Elon Musk wholly to blame?Cointelegraph takes a look at other factors working against Bitcoin bulls this week as the market returns to levels that some thought would never appear again.Tesla CEO Elon Musk bashing Bitcoin’s energy consumption is the narrative of the moment everywhere, but some classic hurdles to fresh price gains are also back this week.Among them is the strength of the United States dollar, which is attempting to stage something of a comeback after a losing streak that began in late March.At the time of writing, the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY), which measures the USD against a basket of trading partner currencies, had bounced off long-term support to reverse its downtrend.DXY is traditionally inversely correlated with Bitcoin, and together with limp stocks, the conditions are right for tripping up bulls’ progress.Nonetheless, Wednesday’s DXY close was its lowest since Jan. 6.Elsewhere in the macro picture, tech stocks are suffering — and that’s also something that tends not to bode well for Bitcoin.Following a curious report by Reuters about China allegedly banning further aspects of cryptocurrency commerce, stocks began to come under pressure.As Cointelegraph and many others noted, however, nothing new has come from Beijing, and trade associations have sought only to reiterate existing restrictions.Among the equity losers, however, was MicroStrategy, the corporate Bitcoin whale, which lost 5.2% on the day. The rout also afflicted Tesla in a somewhat ironic postlude to Musk’s Bitcoin criticism. In addition to being relegated to the world’s third-richest man, Musk has presided over Tesla’s BTC gains almost entirely disappearing.There may be light at the end of the tunnel. A curious tradition shows that after a China scare, crypto markets tend to produce huge rallies.When the country officially halted crypto trading in September 2017, Bitcoin and altcoins promptly shot to then all-time highs.Copycat moves by other jurisdictions are likewise known for their lack of bite. These include Donald Trump’s criticism from 2019 and India’s ban from earlier this year — something that is already being reconsidered.“Figure out a way to participate in buying the dip. However you can,” author Jason Williams told Twitter followers.Exchange inflows, which in the past 24 hours reached their highest since the March 2020 crash, captured the fear among traders.“People are scared,” analyst Lex Moskovski commented on the data."
136,"Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $5,000 higher in South Korea than in other markets on Wednesday as capital flow controls continue to enforce the “kimchi premium.” While Bitcoin was trading at $39,932 on Coinbase at the time of publication, the price on the Korea-based Bithumb exchange stood at $45,115.According to a recent Bank of America statement, the kimchi premium is a result of capital flow controls aimed at stopping the cross-border transfer of “hot money,” reports Reuters.“The onshore price for cryptocurrencies in Korea is persistently above international prices suggesting this to be a result of effective capital control that prevents effective arbitrage of onshore and offshore prices. Korean capital controls allow the ‘Kimchi premium’ to persist,” the Bank of America said in a report on Tuesday.The 12.5% premium on Bitcoin in Korea persists despite the coin’s recent 32% losses and signs of increased transfers to centralized exchanges. The Bank of America’s report noted that daily cryptocurrency trade volume reached new heights in Korea in the first quarter of 2021, exceeding 1,480 trillion won ($1.3 trillion).While demand for crypto continues in South Korea, so too does demand for gold. Gold prices rose four days in a row leading up to Tuesday, hitting heights not witnessed since January.The current price per gram of 68,200 won ($60.36) is 9.4% higher than it was two months ago in what the Korean Herald identifies as a sign of increasing inflation concerns. While still well below historic levels, the Korean inflation rate jumped 1.5% in April alone. Since 2019, the inflation rate climbed from below zero to 2.3%."
137,"Russia's State Duma has approved a new draft bill in its first reading that would require election candidates to disclose their crypto holdings, expenditures and purchases.The draft bill also asks election candidates to indicate a source of income for cryptocurrency purchases and requires crypto declarations not only from the actual candidates but also their spouses and minor children for the past three years.Introduced in March, the draft bill includes a set of amendments to existing Russian law like those on presidential and State Duma deputy elections, guarantees of the electoral rights, as well as the country’s major cryptocurrency bill, “On Digital Financial Assets,” which was officially enacted in January. The next step in the draft bill’s development will be the consideration of potential amendments in mid-June.Elections for the State Duma are scheduled for September, with the pro-Kremlin ruling party, United Russia, expecting to take over two-thirds of the Duma’s 450 seats.The Duma is apparently concerned about the crypto activity of new deputies as the Russian opposition is widely known for accepting Bitcoin (BTC). Russia’s “Anti-Corruption Foundation” — founded by jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and now declared an extremist organization — had accepted Bitcoin donations since 2016.The Russian government levied crypto reporting requirements on public officials earlier this year, even forcing some to sell their cryptocurrencies."
138,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $40,000 on Wednesday as bearish sentiment continued to dictate price direction resulting in the cryptocurrency market losing $350 billion in value.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView tracked BTC/USD as it put in lows of $38,500 before bouncing higher.Coming after a week of successive drops, Wednesday’s dip put Bitcoin at its lowest level since early February and 40% below its all-time highs.“Bitcoin putting in new lows, probably buy more soon,” popular trader Scott Melker told Twitter followers in a post that characterized the conversely calm mood among market veterans.As Cointelegraph reported, those closer to the data were anything but bearish throughout the week, and even a sub-$40,000 BTC price failed to dampen their spirits.“16,835 Bitcoin withdrawn from exchanges in last 10 minutes,” analyst Lex Moskovski noted at the time of writing.Elsewhere, the spotlight remained on Tesla CEO Elon Musk. After taking the blame for the volatility in recent days, Musk was widely held to have cost himself and his company more than most others with his remarks.With its return below $40,000, Bitcoin thus traded nearly at the same price on Wednesday as that at which Tesla bought $1.5 billion.Its announcement came on Feb. 8, a matter of weeks after a likely transaction took place. Nonetheless, its profits from its BTC, which at one point totaled more than its entire history making electric cars, evaporated.“We are back at Feb 8 open price of $39K, when Tesla made the bitcoin announcement,” stock-to-flow model creator PlanB summarized.According to monitoring resource Bitcoin Treasuries, Tesla’s stash was worth just over $1.72 billion at the time of writing.PlanB had been one of the most vocal critics of Musk, being joined by figures such as Saifedean Ammous, author of The Bitcoin Standard.To clarify speculation, Tesla has not sold any BitcoinFor his part, Musk had confirmed that Tesla had yet to sell any of its allocation."
139,"The global cryptocurrency market capitalization lost in excess of $350 billion overnight leading into Wednesday as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and a majority of the altcoin market lost between 15% and 30%.Tuesday night’s plunge leaves the global market cap more than $750 billion worse off than it was this time last week. That figure equates to 30% of the $2.5 trillion peak reached by the combined market cap one week ago on May 12.Bitcoin lost 15% on the day as the coin price sank from $45,632 to $38,787 in a matter of hours. That takes the coin’s weekly losses to over 32%. The only time Bitcoin lost as much as this in such short a time frame was in late 2017, just as BTC’s bull run at the time came to a screeching halt.Ether lost more than 19% on the day as it fell from $3,562 to $2,881 and added to weekly losses of 33.8%.Other altcoins, particularly recent gainers, were subject to even worse reversals. Internet Computer (ICP) lost 32% during the past 24 hours, which took weekly losses to over 61% and sent the coin crashing out of the market cap top 10 after appearing there so suddenly less than a month ago.Other tokens that hit all-time highs during the past week saw similar losses to ICP. Nexo lost 30% of its market value last night, taking the weekly pullback to 43%.Shiba Inu (SHIB) lost 29% on the day, which added to weekly losses of 66%. Shiba Inu’s sharp reversal predictably followed a barking mad surge that saw the Dogecoin (DOGE) imitator’s perceived value increase by over 2,000,000% since the start of the year.Inflows of Bitcoin to major centralized exchanges soared during the past 24 hours. More coins were sent to trading posts than at any time since the “Black Thursday” crash of 2020 — a fact that led Lex Moskovski, chief investment officer of Moskovski Capital, to conclude: “People are scared.”"
140,"Australians’ knowledge of cryptocurrency could use some improvement, as more than half of them think that Elon Musk created Bitcoin (BTC), according to a new survey.Finder, Australia’s most visited comparison website, conducted a survey of 1,004 Australians to find out more about what they know about crypto, The Australian reported on Wednesday.According to the survey results, 56% of Australians are unaware of mysterious Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, believing that Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder Musk is the founder of the world’s largest cryptocurrency. A significant number of respondents also did not know that the Bitcoin supply is limited to 21 million coins, with 44% of them thinking that Bitcoin has unlimited supply just like fiat money.The survey also found that many Australians are already in crypto or willing to get into the industry, with 25% of respondents either owning or planning to own crypto by the end of 2021. Despite a remarkable willingness to buy crypto, as many as 20% of Australians don’t know how to buy it, according to the survey.Finder’s new survey comes in conjunction with the firm launching a Bitcoin trading service through its app. Finder co-founder and CEO Fred Schebesta said that the new service will help Australians move into crypto. “We‘ve removed all the complexity and with the Finder app, you can buy a Bitcoin in three minutes. You sign up, enter your details, deposit your money, that’s it,” he said.Schebesta further predicted that the Bitcoin price will have hit $250,000 by 2021. “The current dip is just a short-term thing. The price of Bitcoin has moved because China said something, or Elon said something, or another government said something,” the executive stated.Crypto markets crashed last week following Musk’s announcement that Tesla was suspending BTC payments for car purchases. The market tumbled even more when the CEO hinted at dumping BTC from Tesla’s balance sheet in the second quarter of 2021. "
141,"Bitcoin (BTC) inflows to centralized exchanges have surged, prompting bearish speculation that the crypto markets could be building up to a violent wash-out.Lex Moskovski, chief investment officer of Moskovoski Capital, shared data showing that 22,917 BTC was transferred onto centralized exchanges in a single hour on Tuesday. Moskovski noted the hourly inflow was the largest since the March 2020 “Black Thursday” crash.22,917 #Bitcoin in a single hour were deposited to exchanges yesterday.

This hourly inflow is rivaled only by the March, 2020 crash.

People are scared. pic.twitter.com/uH4lBL6OnkWith outflows from exchanges typically being inferred as indicating crypto assets are being moved into cold storage for security or DeFi protocols for yield generation, inflows are interpreted as assets being moved onto centralized platforms to be sold.Data compiled by on-chain crypto analytics firm Glassnode shows the past two days have seen consecutive all-time highs produced for net transfer volume of Bitcoin onto leading centralized exchange Binance. The data was shared by Twitter analyst William Clemente III to his 70,400 followers, triggering bearish price predictions on social media.Largest day of BTC inflows to Binance ever. pic.twitter.com/HG56s37mtvThe chart indicates roughly 35,000 Bitcoin worth more than $1.4 billion has been deposited on Binance in the past 48 hours.“Feels like capitulation,” said Kraken growth lead Dan Held. Clemente replied: “Let’s see one final nasty liquidation wick.”Despite Bitcoin’s price grinding down to post local lows below $40,000, some analysts are finding reasons to be bullish.Popular analyst Lark Davis noted the recent downturn has pushed Bitcoin’s 14-day relative-strength indicator into oversold territory for the first time since March 2020, suggesting the crash may be nearing its plateau.Others are welcoming capitulation as a likely catalyst for a bullish recovery, predicting a swift return to upward momentum once selling has become exhausted.Twitter user YHRW80 noted surging flows into Bitcoin’s spot and derivatives markets during 2021, concluding that the dominant emotion gripping the markets is “greed” rather than fear.However, Bitcoin’s Fear and Greed Index disagrees with YHRW80’s analysis, describing current Bitcoin market sentiment as “extreme fear.”There was some welcome news today, with Indian media reporting the country’s government is set to rethink its planned crypto ban and form a new panel of experts to explore regulating crypto assets in India.Some analysts suggest the catalyst for the surging inflows is tomorrow’s looming deadline for controversial stablecoin issuer Tether to disclose its quarterly financial records as part of its settlement with the New York Attorney General’s office.Last week, Tether posted a breakdown of its reserves for the first time, asserting three-quarters of the assets backing its stablecoin are cash, cash equivalents, other short-term deposits and commercial paper."
142,"As Bitcoin (BTC) tested the $43,000 support for the third consecutive day, whales bought the dip on derivatives exchanges. While there has been no significant price change, the Bitcoin futures premium reached its lowest level in six months. This indicator matches Dec. 11, 2020, when Bitcoin hit a $17,600 low just 10 days after making an all-time high at $19,915.In December 2020, derivatives action triggered a 95% rally in 23 days, taking Bitcoin to a new high at $42,000. In addition to the futures premium bottoming, rumors of potentially harmful United States regulation played a central-stage role in the market downturn in both instances.This time around, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stated at the Washington Square Journal CEO Council Summit on May 4 that:On May 6, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler punted to Congress the idea of providing more regulatory oversight to the crypto space. Gensler said:Adding to the regulatory haze, on May 11, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued an investor warning pointing out risks of mutual funds that have exposure to Bitcoin futures.As Bitcoin reached a $19,915 all-time high on Dec. 1 and the futures premium spiked above 15%, the premium reacted to the price correction. Although the 8% low seems near the previous month’s average, it is very modest considering Bitcoin had rallied 90% in two months.Notice that as soon as the $17,600 level proved its strength, the futures premium spiked to 15%, indicating optimism.The current situation began differently, as the market has been excessively optimistic from the start. However, the situation drastically changed over the past week as Bitcoin dropped 26%. This move caused the futures premium to reach its lowest level in six months at 8%.However, the bearish sentiment on May 17 lasted for a very short period, as whales finally decided it was time to buy the dip.The top traders' long-to-short indicator is calculated using clients' consolidated positions, including margin, perpetual and futures contracts. This metric provides a broader view of the professional traders' effective net position by gathering data from multiple markets.Top traders on OKEx moved from a 1.62 long-to-short ratio on May 16 to a 2.74 peak as Bitcoin tested the $43,000 support in the early hours of May 17. This data indicates that whales and market makers had long positions almost three times larger than shorts, which is very uncommon.While their bullish bet remains, it signals a complete pattern from the previous week. Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy also scooped up another $10 million worth of Bitcoin at an average price of $43,663.Although it might be too soon to declare that the correction phase has ended, there seems to be enough evidence regarding the futures premium bottoming and whales' intense buying activity below $43,000.If history repeats and a 95% rally follows suit, Bitcoin could reach $83,000 in mid-June.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

143,"On May 18, Bitcoin (BTC) and the overall cryptocurrency market faced another round of selling as FUD — fear, uncertainty and doubt — impacted investor sentiment after Reuters and various social media outlets reported that China would ban financial institutions and payment companies from providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions.According to these reports, China also issued a warning to several Chinese trade associations about the dangers of cryptocurrency investing.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that bulls attempted to push the price of Bitcoin back above the $45,000 resistance level on May 18 only to have the price battered back below $43,000.While the conditions for Bitcoin may appear dire to some, several fundamental developments including, increased BTC outflows from the top United States crypto exchange Coinbase and the revelation that MicroStrategy used this most recent dip to buy another $10 million worth of BTC, indicate the potential for further upside for the top cryptocurrency.The precarious nature of the current market conditions for Bitcoin is perhaps summed up best in the following tweet from cryptocurrency analyst and Twitter personality Rekt Capital, which highlights the importance of the upcoming daily close for BTC.Every time #BTC Daily Closed inside green support or above it - a bullish reversal would take place#Bitcoin is back at green support again but instead is hovering below it now

Green may flip to new resistance if BTC can't Daily Close inside/above greenhttps://t.co/2p4FgWWEIi pic.twitter.com/2iGcjLkAgUDespite the full-frontal FUD assault that the crypto market has been under in recent weeks, many altcoins have seen their prices breakout over the past couple of days as traders rotate out of underperforming tokens and into tokens that have turned bullish.The standout performance of the week goes to MATIC, the native token of Polygon, a rapidly rising Ethereum layer-two solution that has morphed into an oasis for traders looking for lower fees.According to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro, market conditions for MATIC have been favorable for some time, as evidenced it's the recent VORTECS™ Score of 99 on May 15, which was recorded roughly 50 hours before its price rallied 83% from a low of $1.47 on May 17 to a new all-time high at $2.70 on May 18. This move took place as there was a record $6.84 billion in 24-hour trading volume.Synthetix Network Token (SNX) has also received a boost in trading volume on May 18 that lifted its price 40% to an intraday high at $25.64, while the Binance Smart Chain-based DeFi platform Venus' XVS token rallied 63% to an intraday high of $143.41.Other notable double-digit gainers include 40% gains for ARK and Celer Network's CELR, as well as 20% gains for AAVE and Helium Network Token (HNT).The overall cryptocurrency market capitalization now stands at $2.076 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 39.4%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

144,"Despite the ongoing sideways trend in the cryptocurrency markets, Bitcoin (BTC) still remains a crowded trade. According to a new survey from Bank of America, this could indicate that the current bull cycle's market top is still to come.Bank of America's most recent fund manager poll suggests that the “long Bitcoin” bet is now the most crowded trade across all markets, with nearly 45% of respondents indicating it ahead of other trades like “long tech,” Bloomberg reported Tuesday. The new BofA survey captured responses from 194 fund managers with $592 billion worth of assets under management.In the survey remarks, BofA notes that trades identified as crowded have historically heralded an incoming top for their respective markets. Indeed, Bitcoin was trading just around $36,000 when BofA’s survey identified long Bitcoin as the most crowded trade in January. Bitcoin's price subsequently surged to break new all-time highs above $50,000 in February, eventually rising above $64,000 in mid-April.Long Bitcoin was also chosen as the most crowded trade in Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s global fund manager survey back in September 2017. At the time, Bitcoin traded at around $4,000 before breaking $20,000 in December 2017 for the first time in history.The latest BofA survey may add some optimism to cryptocurrency markets, which are currently experiencing mixed signals after a major market pullback. The ecosystem shed hundreds of billions of dollars after Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced the suspension of BTC payments for car purchases due to environmental concerns. He also hinted at dumping BTC from Tesla's balance sheet in the second quarter of 2021. However, some crypto players like CoinShares chief strategy officer Meltem Demirors believe that the latest BTC price action should be attributed to other reasons, such as tax-day selling.In another survey in mid-April, BofA reported that 75% of professional investors see Bitcoin as a bubble. Some crypto activists suggested on Twitter that the majority of BofA fund managers do not trade Bitcoin.The BofA survey of fund managers, 99% of whom can't trade bitcoin, think ""long bitcoin"" is the most crowded trade. The last time they did so was in January. It doubled 3 months later."
145,"Bitcoin may have lost 35% since its all-time highs of $64,500, but its current price is actually “logical.”That’s according to veteran analyst John Bollinger, creator of the Bollinger bands trading indicator.In a tweet on May 18, Bollinger, who is well known as a source of Bitcoin (BTC) analysis despite decades in the market, called for calm following fresh volatility.“~43,000 is what we call a logical level for $BTCUSD. It is defined by the January peak and the March trough,” he explained.Bollinger referred to Bitcoin’s previous all-time high at around $42,000, which is also a level at which it bounced in early March during another retracement.As Cointelegraph also reported on May 18, the focal level is something of a natural support line in the sand — it represents the average 35% correction from a high, which Bitcoin has seen throughout its history.Even for more bearish voices, the significance of the $42,000 level cannot be discounted. Among them was CNBC regular Carter Worth, who has predicted that a further downward move for BTC/USD could send the pair as low as $29,000.Meanwhile, the Bollinger bands indicator itself continues to track BTC/USD with precision. Its constricting and widening bands have successfully called episodes of price volatility up and down, including the past week’s moves. The bands are fixed around a 20-day simple moving average using a single standard deviation.Bollinger himself has also had his moments of Bitcoin price clairvoyance.With the exception of trader concerns over China adding to selling pressure, Bitcoin is broadly in a resilient mood — and multiple other indicators and analysts alike remain bullish on the future.""Bitcoin still on track as always. We could see an incredibly bullish month or 2 ahead,"" Danny Scott, CEO of exchange CoinCorner, added on May 18, comparing 2021 to previous bull cycles."
146,"Elon Musk and COVID-19 have something in common: They have both panicked investors — at least once — into dumping their Bitcoin (BTC) holdings.The similarities notched up higher in the previous six days as Musk doubled down on his chaos-inducing perspective toward Bitcoin. The billionaire entrepreneur engaged in a Twitter spat with top cryptocurrency advocates over the weekend, including podcaster Peter McCormick, as he projected his favorite token, Dogecoin (DOGE), as superior to Bitcoin.Obnoxious threads like this make me want to go all in on DogeAt one point in time, Musk almost admitted that he would have Tesla unload the $1.5 billion investment that it had made in Bitcoin in February. Meanwhile, the bids for the flagship cryptocurrency kept on declining with each of Musk’s tweets. First, they went to $50,000, then sub-$45,000, eventually to bottom-out near $42,000.Musk later clarified that Tesla has not dumped its bitcoin holdings.To clarify speculation, Tesla has not sold any BitcoinBut his clarification did little in offsetting Bitcoin’s downside bias. The cryptocurrency eventually extended its bearish correction to more than 35% when measured from its all-time high of nearly $65,000.That also marked one of the quickest and deepest top-to-bottom retracement moves in the cryptocurrency’s recent history, with on-chain indicators showing that its impact on the market bias was as bad as the one caused by the Black Thursday crash in March 2020 in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Meanwhile, blockchain analytics platform Glassnode reported a decline in the profits of Bitcoin’s circulating supply via its proprietary metric.The “BTC Percent Supply in Profit (7d MA)” showed readings near 81.122 as of London morning on Tuesday, its lowest level since October 2020. The readings were also weak during the March 2020 crash, wherein Bitcoin declined by more than 50%.More on-chain indicators point out similar readings between the current, Musk-led Bitcoin price crash and the one that appeared amid the coronavirus panic in March 2020.For instance, the Bitcoin transfer volume tracker at Glassnode showed a spike in BTC inflow across all the exchanges. Its scale was comparable to the inflows seen during the March 2020 sell-off and the distribution by the PlusToken Ponzi scheme in 2019.A higher BTC inflow indicates a higher probability of traders selling those tokens for other assets, including fiat and altcoins. Conversely, a higher outflow shows traders’ willingness to hold BTC for longer periods.Glassnode’s Bitcoin transfer volume data, meanwhile, provided two stark investment perspectives between retail and institutions. In its weekly newsletter, the analytics platform broke down its observation based on the inflow/outflow data collected from two of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges: Binance and Coinbase.Binance is a non-United States entity that attracts mostly retail traders and investors around the world. Meanwhile, Coinbase’s standing is higher among U.S.-based institutional investors. Glassnode noted that Binance was the biggest receiver of the Bitcoin inflows during the Musk-led market crash.“This provides further indication that the recent inflows are likely to be driven by both new market entrants (panic sellers) and potentially due to capital rotation into other crypto-assets,” wrote Glassnode in a weekly note.Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant — a South Korea-based blockchain analytics platform — also noted that most BTC inflows went to Binance, adding that it is not necessarily a bearish signal.“I’m going to wait until the inflow signal cools off,” he added, nonetheless.On the other hand, Coinbase has logged higher new Bitcoin outflows ever since the cryptocurrency broke above the $20,000-price milestone last year. The trend continued even in the current week, showing that institutional investors were absorbing the retail market’s selling pressure.In other words, rich investors purchased Bitcoin at local lows as average ones sold them under the influence of Musk. “Don’t listen to what they say,” said early-stage investor Anthony Pompliano in his note to clients on Monday. He added:Pompliano added that Bitcoin remains the best-performing macro asset, an “apex predator” with vastly outperformed stocks, bonds, real estate and commodities. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, whose payment company Square added Bitcoin to its balance sheet to beat inflation fears, also noted on Friday that his team would “forever work” to make Bitcoin better.The comments came in contrast to Musk’s support for Dogecoin. Veteran investor Paul Santos wrote in his Seeking Alpha piece that the Tesla CEO might want to make money out of thin air by exploiting the so-called cryptocurrency euphoria. "
147,"Bitcoin (BTC) could drop to $29,000 and still be testing current support in line with past dips, claims CNBC’s “Chartmaster.”In an appearance on the network’s Fast Money segment on Monday, Carter Worth, chief market technician of Cornerstone Macro, warned that the BTC bottom may be far from in.Analyzing recent price activity and comparing it to past Bitcoin bottoms, Worth said that current levels at around $45,000 represent the top of a support zone.“Were we to go down 55%, we’d be in the lower end of support,” he summarized.A 55% drop from current all-time highs would mean BTC/USD bottoms out at just above $29,000.For Worth, this is a useful reference point, as 55% marks the average of every major price dip of 30% or more since 2011. As Twitter users noted, however, his calculations include events such as the 80% decline from all-time highs in 2017 — a process that took over a year to unfold.Remove these, and the average is more like 36% — just about where BTC/USD bottomed this week.The mood among mainstream media more broadly on Bitcoin and altcoins is once again cautious in light of the publicity generated by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.Added to this, the mixed fortunes of Coinbase’s COIN mean that bearish sentiment remains de rigueur for analysts who have spent months in shock at the pace of the industry’s gains.As Cointelegraph reported, however, seasoned analysts from within Bitcoin circles are far from concerned, highlighting intact long-term price trends and even signs of bullishness already appearing.On Monday, PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow BTC price model, sought to draw a line under the Musk episode.“OK moving on .. with current volatility, BTC at $44K and transaction volumes high, Bitcoin momentum (200 Week Moving Average and Realized Value) is still up and onward,” he commented on an accompanying chart.Realized value represents the price at which the entire Bitcoin market bought BTC and continues to advance despite recent volatility."
148,"The United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is looking for information and public comments on banks' cryptocurrency-related activities.The FDIC is the major provider of deposit insurance to U.S. commercial and savings banks, originally created to address bank runs during the Great Depression. On Monday, the FDIC officially announced a request for public input to get more information on the industry and consumers’ interests in the market as well as the role of banks in the digital asset ecosystem.“Banks are increasingly exploring several roles in the emerging digital asset ecosystem, such as being custodians, reserve holders, issuers, and exchange or redemption agents; performing node functions; and holding digital asset issuers’ money deposits,” the FDIC stated.The corporation is particularly looking to improve its understanding of digital asset use cases in financial markets and intermediation, as well as in settlement and payment systems. The FDIC is also seeking input on the risk and compliance management of insured depository institutions and their affiliates in conducting digital asset-related activities.FDIC Chairman Jelena McWilliams noted that the public input will help the agency to better understand the market in terms of regulations. “At the FDIC, we are laying the foundation for the next chapter of banking by ensuring we have a regulatory framework that allows responsible innovation to flourish. This RFI gives us an opportunity to gain additional insight into the market, and what role banks might play in the future,” McWilliams stated.The agency’s interest in digital asset use cases for financial institutions comes as U.S. banks actively move into the crypto industry. In early May, investment bank Goldman Sachs launched a cryptocurrency trading desk, allowing institutional partners to trade derivatives products. Previously, Morgan Stanley added Bitcoin (BTC) exposure to 12 investment funds after announcing plans to offer crypto services to wealthy clients."
149,"Cryptocurrency adoption on a United Kingdom-based payment app is booming in the first quarter of 2021, but whether that trend continues could depend on the actions of Bitcoin (BTC) evangelists like Elon Musk, warns STICPAY director James Bay.The mobile payments app reported a 48% increase in crypto deposits in the first quarter of the year, while fiat deposits remained static. Bitcoin is apparently the currency of choice for most of STICPAY’s e-wallet users, with Bitcoin deposits eclipsing deposits of Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT) and Litecoin (LTC) 38 times over.The firm also reported a 185% increase in the number of users converting fiat to crypto via the wallet’s built-in currency converter, compared to the same time last year. This was accompanied by a 12% decrease in the number of users swapping crypto back to fiat.Client service director James Bay said more cryptocurrencies were gaining reputations as potential stores of value but said Bitcoin was still at the forefront.“Cryptocurrencies are increasingly being accepted as a trusted store of monetary value. But we have to say it’s Bitcoin that’s leading the change in payment habits and outlook that’s challenging fiat currencies,” said Bay.“The switch to cryptocurrencies is moving at breakneck speed, but whether that trend continues remains to be seen,” warned Bay, whose comments come as the cryptocurrency market experiences a violent dip after months of rapid growth.Bay thinks the continuation of the trend could depend on the actions of public figures such as Elon Musk, whose influential tweets have been shown to boost (or sink) the prices of whichever coin he mentions.“Even today, high-profile Bitcoin evangelist Elon Musk announced Tesla will no longer be accepting the currency citing environmental concerns, all of which comes after March’s announcement that the business would take payment in Bitcoin,” said Bay, referencing Elon Musk’s sudden reversal on Tesla’s decision to allow Bitcoin as a payment method for its electric vehicles.Another high-profile Bitcoin evangelist, MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor, announced the purchase of another 271 BTC on May 13, hours after Musk’s reversal on Bitcoin payments. The total amount of Bitcoin on MicroSTrategy’s balance sheet stands at 91,850 BTC, with various amounts having been purchased at different prices beginning last year.Meanwhile, over $1 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin remains on Tesla’s balance sheet — a fact that has drawn criticism from industry observers who see Musk’s willingness to profit from a coin he deems environmentally hazardous as a sign of hypocrisy."
150,"A luxury yacht firm has announced it will begin accepting cryptocurrency for its services and expects to see an immediate 40% growth increase from Bitcoin (BTC) payments in the first year.In addition to accepting Bitcoin payments, the firm also announced that it would base its web and mobile services on blockchain technology as it provided more transactional security than any other system.The firm stated that it expects to see $6.5 million in revenue in the coming year, primarily from its yacht charter service and the bespoke experiences it hosts for clients.Co-founded by two Colombians and operational in North America, Prime Experiences has apparently ear-marked Miami as a possible future source of collaboration. The company’s president, José David Tobón, said the firm was already in talks with Miami’s crypto-friendly mayor, Francis Suarez, who has previously pushed for progressive cryptocurrency laws, and recently suggested Miami’s citizens should be able to receive salaries in Bitcoin.“With this type of currency many doors have opened, we are currently in talks with the Miami Mayor, who is interested in expanding bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the city. Miami could be the next Silicon Valley as most of the large companies such as Tesla, Facebook and Google are looking to enter the city,” said Tobón.The range of services opting to accept cryptocurrency as a means of payment has grown more varied in recent years. Once largely the currency of choice for mostly web-based services, more and more physical establishments have started to accept crypto of late, including real-estate firms, auction houses, music schools, and baseball teams."
151,"CoinShares’ weekly “Digital Asset Fund Flows” report has revealed last week saw the largest outflow of Bitcoin (BTC) in the report’s history as Elon Musk’s Twitter account again wreaked havoc in the crypto markets.The May 17 report notes $98 million exited Bitcoin investment products last week, equating to 0.2% of total assets under management. “While small, this marks the largest outflow we have recorded,” CoinShares noted.Amid the tumultuous market conditions for Bitcoin, institutional investors appear to have ramped up their accumulation of Ether (ETH) and other alternative cryptocurrencies, with the report identifying inflows to crypto asset investment products of $48 million when excluding Bitcoin.Ether represented more than half of the flows to altcoin investment products with $27 million. Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot’s DOT also saw increased inflows of $6 million and $3.3 million, respectively.CoinShares also notes that May is shaping up to be the first month in which investment volume for institutional Ether products has outpaced that of Bitcoin products. The report stated:Digital asset investment products saw a net outflow of $50 million, marking the first week to post a net outflow since October 2020.The institutional pivot toward Ether and altcoins reflects recent trends in the broader crypto asset ecosystem, with Bitcoin market dominance sinking to a three-year low of roughly 40% as of Monday."
152,"While new entrants to Bitcoin (BTC) markets have been panic selling at a loss, the recent market slide has not vexed the old hands.Heavy selling in response to hints from Elon Musk that Tesla may soon sell its BTC stash saw Bitcoin prices tumble to their lowest levels in 20 weeks as the markets found support near $42,000 on Monday.According to on-chain analytics provider Glassnode, the crash predominantly saw newer traders exiting from their positions at a loss, while long-term hodlers stood their ground.Glassnoded noted Bitcoin’s adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR), a metric that shows whether BTC was in profit or at a loss when it was last transacted on-chain, fell below 1.0 amid the dip. An aSOPR of less than 1.0 indicates aggregate losses have been realized on-chain and are most pronounced in short-term holders (coins younger than 155-days) — traders who purchased during the 2021 bull market.The total number of addresses holding a non-zero BTC balance has also retreated by 2.8% from its recent all-time high of 38.7 million as more than 1 million traders liquidated their positions. Glassnode stated:Glassnode asserted the volatility in the share of supply represented by short-term holders is indicative of panic selling, noting the similarity between recent patterns in supply distribution and those observed amid the macro peak of the 2017 bull season. Markets usually find a macro peak when new holders hold a relatively large portion of the total supply.Coins held by short-term holders recently hit a peak of 28% of the circulating supply or around 5.3 million BTC.Glassnode estimates Bitcoin has shed more than 28% since tagging an all-time high of $63,600 on April 13. The retracement is the deepest correction of the current bull market."
153,"It is well known that as goes Bitcoin (BTC), so goes the rest of the cryptocurrency market, as time and again, major price moves from Bitcoin create ripples across the altcoin market, impacting sentiment and momentum.This appears to be the same for blockchain-related stocks that trade in the traditional financial markets, and a quick glance at the charts shows they have mirrored Bitcoin's performance over the past several months. The cryptocurrency ecosystem was all abuzz just over one month ago when the much anticipated Coinbase stock listing finally arrived on April 14, a date that also marks the most recent all-time high in the price of BTC at $64,863.Since its debut, the price of COIN has steadily declined below both its direct listing price of $381 and its reference price of $250 to a current value of $245, coinciding with a roughly 35% drop in the price of BTC, which has also put pressures on other blockchain-related stocks including Riot Blockchain and Marathon Digital Holdings.COIN’s struggles since launching, which have resulted in its valuation dropping from a high of $100 billion to its current valuation of $49 billion, have centered around concerns about whether or not the exchange will be able to achieve future profit expectations in the face of an increasingly competitive landscape, with new centralized and decentralized players emerging weekly and looking for a piece of the action.Matthew Wheeler, global head of market research at Forex.com, recently highlighted the increasingly competitive landscape Coinbase now faces as cryptocurrency adoption increases on a global scale. These concerns have led some analysts, including New Constructs CEO David Trainer, to warn that the price of COIN could fall below $100: While the struggles faced by COIN can be chalked up to it being a newly listed stock that is still looking to establish its fair market value, downtrends in Riot Blockchain and Marathon Digital Holdings, which had both outperformed BTC in 2021, also demonstrate the effect that a struggling BTC price has on crypto-related stocks.A survey of the wider financial markets indicates that the overall tech sector pullback and concerns related to rising inflation have further hampered price growth in blockchain-related stocks, and there are few signs that these pressures will resolve in the near term.The prices of both RIOT and MARA have followed Bitcoin price movements since the 2017–2018 bull market, so it is likely that further price growth for these and other blockchain-related stocks will depend on how BTC performs going forward.It is curious to note that the price of RIOT and MARA rallied ahead of Bitcoin in 2021 to reach new all-time highs, indicating the possibility that they could be used as a leading indicator for future price movements for BTC and altcoins while offering traditional market investors exposure to the asset class without having to hold cryptocurrencies directly.However, depending on how the market plays out moving forward, it should be noted that Bitcoin remains the dominant market indicator for all things blockchain- and cryptocurrency-related — meaning as goes BTC, so goes the rest of the market.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

154,"Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted to an intraday low near $42,000 today, dropping 35% from its all-time high at $64,849.27. Over the weekend the selling intensified as news that Tesla may have sold its Bitcoin holdings made waves, and even after this was proven to be untrue, Bitcoin’s market dominance had still been pulled down to a three-year low below 40%. While this decline in Bitcoin may have scared new investors, stock-to-flow creator PlanB said the performance of the current bull phase is still better than the 2017 bull run. PlanB also warned investors to expect several 30% dips during Bitcoin’s climb to a new all-time high.Although the long-term story remains intact, the sharp bearish moves in Bitcoin on every minor negative news tidbit suggest nervousness among investors. The lack of a sharp recovery even after Elon Musk’s clarification that “Tesla has not sold any Bitcoin” suggests investors are not buying aggressively on positive news.Will Bitcoin’s weakness stall the altcoin season or is Bitcoin getting ready for a sharp relief rally? Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin broke below the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern on May 16 but the bears could not achieve a close below it. By the end of the day, the price rebounded and closed above the neckline.However, the selling resumed today and the bears have pulled the price below the neckline. If the BTC/USDT pair closes below the neckline, the head and shoulders pattern will complete.If the bulls do not push the price back above the neckline quickly, the selling is likely to intensify further. The pair could then start its decline toward the pattern target at $31,653.73.The downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($52,265) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the oversold territory indicate the bears have the upper hand.Any pullback is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA. This negative view will invalidate if the bulls push the price above the stiff overhead resistance at $60,000.Ether (ETH) is correcting the sharp uptrend of the past few days. The price dipped below the 20-day EMA ($3,431) today but the bulls are trying to arrest the decline near the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,195.98.If the price rebounds off the current level and rises above $3,600, the bulls will try to push the price to $4,200. However, the 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has dropped near the midpoint, suggesting the bullish momentum may be weakening.If the buyers fail to defend the $3,195.98 support, the decline could extend to the next support at the 50-day simple moving average ($2,709). Such a deep fall is likely to delay the start of the next leg of the uptrend.Binance Coin (BNB) broke below the 50-day SMA ($520) for the first time since Dec. 13. The 20-day EMA ($585) has started to turn down and the RSI has slipped below 42, suggesting the bears are trying to gain the upper hand.If the current recovery turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that traders are closing their positions on rallies. That will increase the possibility of a break below $480. If that happens, the BNB/USDT pair may drop to $428 and then to $348.70.The first sign of strength will be a breakout and close above $615. Such a move will suggest that the correction is over and the pair may be ready to resume the uptrend. A breakout and close above $691.77 could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $796.64.Cardano (ADA) is in a strong uptrend. It reached a new all-time high at $2.34 on May 16 where profit-booking set in. If the price breaks below $1.95, the altcoin may drop to the 20-day EMA ($1.71).A strong rebound off the 20-day EMA will suggest the sentiment remains bullish and traders are buying on dips. On the contrary, a break below the 20-day EMA will indicate that supply exceeds demand and that may pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($1.39).Instead, if the price turns up from the current level and rises above $2.34, the ADA/USDT pair may resume its uptrend. The next target objective on the upside is $2.82 and then $3. The rising moving averages and the RSI above 63 indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside.The bulls are currently attempting to defend the 20-day EMA ($0.46). If they succeed, Dogecoin (DOGE) could move up to $0.59 where the bulls are likely to encounter stiff resistance from the bears.If the price turns down from $0.59, the possibility of a break below the 20-day EMA increases. If that happens, the DOGE/USDT pair could drop to the critical support at $0.35. A strong rebound off this support could keep the pair range-bound between $0.35 and $0.59 for a few days.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls drive the price above $0.59, the pair may retest the all-time high at $0.73. A breakout of this resistance could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $0.83 and then $1.The bulls purchased the dip to the support line of the symmetrical triangle today, indicating buying at lower levels. The buyers will now try to propel XRP above the resistance line of the triangle.If they succeed, the XRP/USDT pair could pick up momentum and rally to the 52-week high at $1.96.This level may act as stiff resistance but if the bulls can overcome it, the pair may rally to $2.68.The flat 20-day EMA ($1.43) and the RSI above 53 do not signal a clear advantage to the bulls. If the price turns down from the resistance line of the triangle, the pair may extend its stay inside the triangle for a few more days.The trend will turn in favor of the bears if the price breaks below the triangle. That could result in a decline to $0.88.Polkadot (DOT) broke out of the $44 overhead resistance on May 14 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. The bears pulled the price back below the breakout level at $44 on May 15.The 20-day EMA ($39.34) is flattening out and the RSI is near the midpoint, suggesting the range-bound action may continue for a few more days.A break below $32.50 could open the gates for a decline to the critical support at $26.50. A bounce off this support will suggest accumulation at lower levels.On the other hand, if the price rises from the current level and breaks above $44, it will suggest that sentiment remains positive and the bulls continue to buy at lower levels. That will increase the possibility of a retest of the all-time high at $49.78.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) broke and closed below the 20-day EMA ($1,178) on May 15. The bulls attempted to push the price back above the 20-day EMA on May 16 but failed to sustain the higher levels. This led to further selling today and the price dipped to the psychological level at $1,000.The bulls are currently attempting to defend the support at $1,000. However, any relief rally from the current level is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($1,170) and then at $1,362.74.If the price turns down from this level, the BCH/USDT pair may remain range-bound for a few days.This neutral view will invalidate if the pair continues lower and breaks below the 50-day SMA ($922). Such a move could open the doors for a further decline to $700. The trend may favor the bulls on a break and close above $1,362.74.The failure of the bulls to build upon the breakout of the ascending broadening wedge formation could have attracted aggressive profit-booking from short-term traders. This pulled Litecoin (LTC) to the 20-day EMA ($308) on May 12.Although the bulls attempted a recovery on May 13 and 14, the rebound fizzled out at $339.10. The selling resumed on May 15 and sent the LTC/USDT pair below the 20-day EMA.Today, the bulls are attempting to defend the 50-day SMA ($270). However, the 20-day EMA has started to slope down and the RSI is below 45, suggesting the bears are trying to make a comeback.If the pair breaks below the 50-day SMA, the selling could intensify and the pair may drop to the support line of the wedge. This negative view will be negated if the bulls push the price above $340.Uniswap (UNI) broke below the support line of the ascending channel today but the bears could not capitalize on this weakness. The bulls are currently attempting to push the price back into the channel.However, the 20-day EMA ($37.72) has started to turn down and the RSI has dipped into the negative territory, suggesting the bears have a slight advantage. If the price closes below the channel, it will indicate a possible change in trend.The UNI/USDT pair could then drop to the $27.50 to $25 support zone and then to $20. This negative view will invalidate if the buyers propel the price above $40.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

155,"Bitcoin's 51.4% crash in March 2020 was the most horrific 24-hour black swan event in the digital asset's history. The recent price activity of the past week has probably resurrected similar emotions for investors who experienced the Black Thursday crash. Over the past week, Bitcoin's (BTC) price dropped 29% to reach a three-month low at $42,150. $5.5 billion in long contracts were liquidated, which is undoubtedly a record-high in absolute terms. Still, the impact of the March 2020 crash on derivatives was orders of magnitude higher.To understand why the current correction is less severe than the one in March 2020, we will start by analyzing the perpetual futures premium. These contracts, also known as inverse swaps, face an adjustment every eight hours, so any price gap with traditional spot markets can be easily arbitrated.Sometimes, price discrepancies arise during moments of panic due to concerns about the derivatives exchange's liquidity or market makers being unable to participate during times of extreme volatility.On March 12, 2020, the Bitcoin perpetual futures initiated a much larger descent than the price on spot exchanges. This move is partially explained by the cascading liquidations that took place, creating a backlog of large sell orders unable to find liquidity at reasonable prices.The aftermath of the bloodbath resulted in futures perpetual contracts trading at a 12% discount versus regular spot exchanges. BitMEX, the largest derivatives market at the time, went offline for 25 minutes, causing havoc as investors became suspicious about its liquidity conditions.By comparing this event with the most recent week, one will find that sustainable price discrepancies are very unusual. Even a temporary 12% gap doesn't occur, even during the most volatile hours.Take notice of how the perpetual contracts reached a peak 4% discount versus regular spot exchanges on May 13, although it lasted less than five minutes. Market makers and arbitrage desks could have been caught off guard but quickly managed to recoup liquidity by buying the perpetual contracts at a discount.To understand the impact of those crashes on professional traders, the 25% delta skew is the best metric, as it compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options' pricing. When market makers and whales fear that Bitcoin's price could crash, they demand a higher premium for the neutral-to-bearish put options. This movement causes the 25% delta skew to shift positively.The above chart displays the mind-blowing 59% peak one-month Bitcoin options delta skew in March 2020. This data shows absolute fear and an incapacity to price the put (sell) options, causing the distortion. Even if one excludes the intraday peak, the 25% delta skew presented sustained periods above 20, indicating extreme ""fear.""Over the past week, the skew indicator peaked at 14%, which isn't very far from the ""neutral"" -10% to +10% range. It is indeed a striking difference from the previous months' negative skew, indicating optimism, but nothing out of the ordinary.Therefore, although the recent 29% price drop in seven days could have been devastating for traders using leverage, the overall impact on derivatives has been modest.This data shows that the market has been incredibly resilient as of late, but this strength might be tested if Bitcoin's price continues to drop.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

156,"Raoul Pal wants Bitcoin investors to mobilize their trades against Elon Musk. The macro investment strategist advised traders to either accumulate or preserve their Bitcoin (BTC) holdings just as the flagship cryptocurrency suffered massive declines over the weekend and at the beginning of this week.In retrospect, bulls came under pressure after Elon Musk started rattling the cryptocurrency market. On May 12, the billionaire entrepreneur reversed his company Tesla's decision to accept Bitcoin payments for its electric vehicles, citing environmental issues related to the Bitcoin mining industry.Nevertheless, he noted that Tesla would keep holding more than a billion dollars' worth of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. The company had revealed the said crypto investment in a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in February.But over the weekend, Musk hinted at another U-turn. He engaged with an alleged cryptocurrency scammer on Twitter when the latter discussed the prospect of Tesla dumping its entire $1.5 billion Bitcoin stash on the market. Musk responded with an ""indeed,"" prompting traders to believe that he would indeed sell all of Tesla's Bitcoin holdings.Musk later clarified that Tesla has not sold its Bitcoin.But the damage was done. As Bitcoin's price fell, Musk's comments lead to an out-and-out Twitter spat with the Bitcoin community, prompting prominent investor and crypto influencer Anthony ""Pomp"" Pompliano to call the Tesla CEO an ""emotional billionaire.""We were anticipating nation states and central banks, but instead got an emotional billionaire with a Twitter account.On the other hand, Pal suggested Bitcoin traders ignore the ""weekend FUD"" and focus on the cryptocurrency's strong technical setup that indicates a bullish breakout, stating:""BTFD"" is an acronym for ""buy the fucking dip"" — saying that traders should accumulate more assets as their prices go down. Meanwhile, Pal appeared very bullish on the latest Bitcoin correction after spotting a falling wedge pattern.Falling wedges are bullish reversal patterns. They appear when price trends lower inside a range defined by two downward sloping trendlines — as the reaction highs and reaction lows forming on them converge.It typically leads to the price breaking above the upper trendline by the maximum wedge length. The technical theory serves as the basis of Pal's bullish bias on Bitcoin.A mirrored image of Pal's BTC trade setup from TradingView shows that the BTC/USD exchange rate could rise by almost $14,000 on the next upside breakout move.Meanwhile, fundamentals such as network hash rate and other metrics continue to flash bullish in the Bitcoin market. However, some macroeconomic factors may also provide a boost for Bitcoin, particularly as the dollar slumps. Additionally, the U.S. Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its April meeting on May 19, which are expected to say that the central bank will keep interest rates near zero, purchasing government bonds and mortgage-backed securities at the pace of $120 billion per month — at least until 2023.""We expect the minutes ... to reiterate that policymakers consider the pick up in inflation to be transitory,"" commented Kim Mundy, a currency strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney. Mundy also told Reuters:"
157,"Disclaimer: This article has been updated to include comments from the Pi Network, which claims that no Vietnamese identity cards were held on its servers.Pi Network, a cryptocurrency mining app for mobile users, may have been connected to 17GB worth of personal data leaks, a Vietnamese news outlet reported on Monday.The treasure trove of personal data was apparently taken from the Know Your Customer checks of users of Pi Network, according to the person who posted it to hacker hangout RaidForums on Thursday.The identity cards of an estimated 10,000 Vietnamese citizens were placed for sale, along with connected home addresses, phone numbers and email addresses. The seller placed a price tag of $9,000 on the data, payable in either Bitcoin (BTC) or Litecoin (LTC).Phien Vo, a moderator of a Vietnamese Pi Network group chat channel, told VnExpress that Pi Network’s KYC checks are performed by a third party, adding that Vietnamese identity cards like those in question aren’t compatible with the app. However, Vo did indicate that an older version of the app was compatible with the cards at one point.“To perform KYC verification on Pi Network, Vietnamese would need to use their passports. Only some users who used earlier versions of Pi could perform KYC verification using their driver licenses, but so far the system has yet to accept Vietnamese identity cards,” Vo said.Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security's cybersecurity division has since launched an investigation into the matter.An independent investigation into Pi Network’s perceived value was recently conducted by Cem Dilmegani, a tech entrepreneur and founder of AIMultiple. Written weeks prior to the recent data leak, the review concluded that Pi Network bore the hallmarks of a multilevel marketing scheme, or an affiliate marketing program.The Pi app reportedly demands users log in every day and click a button to receive their PI coins. No blockchain consensus algorithm, like proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, is used in the app, and users can gain increased mining rates by referring other people. The PI token is not yet traded on exchanges and has no dollar value.The app reportedly sells data for advertising revenue from the moment its usage begins. Given that ad space can sell for a higher value with personal user info included, many have been led to speculate that the Pi app is designed only to siphon personally identifying information from its users.Cointelegraph reached out to a Pi Network spokesperson for comment. Justin Wu, of Pi Network's marketing and growth team, reiterated that the app's KYC was carried out by a third party, and that no Vietnamese identity cards were held on Pi Network's servers. Wu added that an internal check did not uncover any evidence of a data leak.

158,"Tesla and SpaceX CEO and self-proclaimed ""Dogefather"" Elon Musk should sell his Bitcoin holdings, said hodlers.A new petition on Change.org is currently gathering signatures to make Musk divest himself of his personal stash of Bitcoin (BTC).Its goal is modest:100 signatures at first, of which a grand total of 62 have already been gathered. For the creator of the petition, however, billionaire Musk has touched a nerve.""Elon Musk has accumulated at least $1.5bn of bitcoin on the Tesla balance sheet, and very likely has a larger personal holding he has not revealed,"" its description begins.Musk is currently at the center of furor over his professed love of meme-based altcoin Dogecoin (DOGE), which he has championed while criticizing Bitcoin.The impact on both cryptocurrencies ended up being negative this weekend as BTC/USD fell to near $42,000 and saw its market dominance drop to three-year lows.Reactions pinned the blame firmly on ""Technoking"" Musk, while some seasoned analysts argued that his actions would end up being inconsequential in the face of the overall bullish Bitcoin price trajectory.Until he sells his BTC, however, there will be an opportunity for Musk to influence market sentiment unfairly to the detriment of every other hodler,  the petition claims.""He should sell his bitcoin, and hope it all ends up with a better custodian,"" it continues.As Cointelegraph reported, another gauge of investors' feelings on the future of Bitcoin in light of recent events is more hopeful. A survey by Stock-to-Flow price model creator PlanB shows that most see BTC/USD hitting $100,000 in 2021.At the time of writing, over 70,000 responses have confirmed that $100,000 is a reasonable price target, with only 25% believing that the largest cryptocurrency will peak lower. PlanB himself came out fighting against Musk, calling his actions an attempt to ""destroy"" Bitcoin.""If you want to make a statement, selling your Tesla stock and buying Bitcoin instead could be very effective IMO,"" he told Twitter followers."
159,"The Iranian government continues to closely monitor the cryptocurrency mining industry by initiating new measures against home crypto miners, according to a new report.Mostafa Rajabi, a spokesperson for Iran's Ministry of Energy, said that crypto mining with household electricity is not legal and, thus, home miners will have to pay heavy fines if discovered, local news agency The Tehran Times reported Sunday.Crypto miners using household energy will be also required to provide compensation for potential damages caused to the electricity network, the official stated.Rajabi said that the government has undertaken these measures in order to get a handle on Iran’s power shortage — the result of foreign sanctions on hydrocarbons and decreased hydroelectric production due to less-than-average rainfall.  Rajabi stated that unauthorized crypto mining can damage the local power grid and lead to blackouts. He said last week that as much as 87% of crypto mining operations in Iran are illegal.The energy crisis in Iran has led the government to strictly control the energy-intensive industry. Back in 2018, the secretary of Iran's Supreme Cyberspace Council said that various ministries of the country’s government had accepted mining as an industry. Eventually, the Iranian government approved crypto mining as an industrial activity in 2019, subjecting it to a licensing scheme and regulated electricity price regime.In April, the central bank authorized banks and licensed foreign exchange shops to use cryptocurrency as payment for imports to mitigate the impact of sanctions imposed by the United States."
160,"Bitcoin (BTC) is facing a make-or-break moment this week as a classic indicator signals a price watershed. According to the network value to transaction (NVT) price, BTC/USD is in line for a reset at recent lows of just above $42,000.After dipping on negative sentiment as a result of tweets from Elon Musk, Bitcoin is attempting to establish definitive support near its old all-time highs from February.At the same time, NVT, which is used to discover potential local price polarities, suggests that the market is looking at an event similar to early 2018 or last March’s cross-asset crash.The start of 2018 heralded a year-long bear market, while last year, Bitcoin conversely bounced from lows to new all-time highs — a bull run that analysts argue is still in action.With the $42,000 dip bringing Bitcoin below NVT price, however, statistician Willy Woo drew attention to similar events throughout its 12-year history.“Here is some hopium for those of you losing your minds,” Filbfilb, co-founder of trading suite DecenTrader, added about the indicator.As Cointelegraph reported, NVT and its derivatives correctly called the explosive growth of Q1 2021.NVT is far from the only tool in bulls’ arsenal for calling a continuation, however, and fresh data is also highlighting a distinct difference between old and new BTC hodlers.The price dip, for instance, came as recent buyers sold in panic, overwhelmingly at a loss. Older entities, by contrast, happily bought up the available liquidity.“Translation: BTFD opportunities like this don’t come often,” analyst William Clemente flatly commented on the NVT data."
161,"Disclaimer: This article has been updated to reflect that BTC.Top has begun signaling for Taproot activation.The top-10 Bitcoin (BTC) mining pools by hash rate distribution are now signaling for Taproot activation with BTC.Top being the latest among them as of the time of writing.Indeed, 90% of Bitcoin’s hash rate briefly signaled for the protocol upgrade with the figure now standing at about 73%.Tweeting on Monday, crypto exchange giant Binance announced that Binance Pool had begun signaling for Taproot. According to the Taproot Signal Twitter bot, Binance Pool’s maiden Taproot signal occurred at block height 683,878.Based on community feedback, #Binance Pool has begun signaling for Taproot.

It is estimated that #Binance Pool will fully support Taproot before Friday this week. https://t.co/eukp3FlEA8As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the two largest Bitcoin mining pools — AntPool and F2Pool — were among the earliest supporters of the protocol upgrade in the mining arena. SlushPool — the 12th-largest pool by hash rate distribution — was the first to mine the first transaction block with a Taproot signal.BTC.Top, the last of the top-10 pools to signal for Taproot, did so on block height 683,945. The mining pool had previously announced that it had completed the testing protocols necessary to begin including Taproot activation signals in mined transaction blocks.Data from Taproot.watch, a webpage created by Bitcoin developer Hampus Sjöberg, shows there have been multiple occasions of at least 10 successive blocks with Taproot signals during the current difficulty epoch.However, with 190 non-signaling blocks so far, Taproot activation being locked in during this current difficulty window appears unlikely. The protocol upgrade can only move forward if 90% out of the 2,016 mined blocks in a difficulty epoch include an activation signal.At 190 blocks, the non-signaling blocks are now over 9%. At 202 non-signaling blocks, the Taproot lock-in threshold requirement will be pushed to the next difficulty adjustment in about 11 days.Taproot activation must be locked in before Aug. 11 for the network upgrade to happen in November. If that happens, it will arguably be the most notable protocol-level improvement in the last four years for the largest crypto by market capitalization.The Taproot upgrade will essentially mask spending conditions prescribed by transacting parties, a feature touted to have significant implications for both privacy and smart contract capabilities of the Bitcoin protocol."
162,"Bitcoin (BTC) is nearing $40,000 this week as “Dogefather” Elon Musk deals out pure pain to hodlers — what’s next?After a traumatic weekend for many crypto investors, Monday is setting the stage for the next chapter in the wild 2021 bull market.Cointlegraph takes a look at five factors that could shape what Bitcoin and altcoins do next.It’s all about one man yet again this week: Elon Musk. In characteristic fashion, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO caused uproar on Twitter when he came out bearish on Bitcoin.BTC/USD sold off immediately on news that Tesla was halting BTC payments for its products, but for Musk, this was not enough.Further tweets over the weekend, including criticism of Bitcoin’s decentralization and how he “believes in crypto,” added fuel to the fire.It was a hint that Tesla may already be planning to sell its holdings, however, that caused the most misery. Bitcoin fell to near $42,000, retesting this previous all-time high level before steadying as Musk stressed that no sale had occurred.“To clarify speculation, Tesla has not sold any Bitcoin,” he wrote on Monday.With Musk versus the cryptocurrency community beginning to look like a full-on war, Bitcoin is thus unsurprisingly volatile as all eyes remain on the Twitter battlefield.At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at around $44,800, still down 8.7% over the past 24 hours.As analyst Alex Krueger noted, however, the clarification tweet may be unwittingly acting as a local bottom signal, as Musk posted it just as BTC/USD hit a key 61.8 Fibonacci retracement level.“Elon Musk must be an outstanding technical analyst,” he commented.Musk’s activities have had a detrimental impact on Bitcoin and altcoins alike.Despite continuing to praise Dogecoin (DOGE), even the meme-based token failed to avoid losses over the weekend, with the majority of large-cap altcoins following Bitcoin down.There were some less significant losses, such as those of Cardano (ADA), which on Saturday was still bucking the overall downtrend to even post new all-time highs.In terms of bearishness, however, nothing shows how much the average Bitcoin holder is suffering like market dominance.On Monday, Bitcoin’s overall market capitalizatio share dipped below 40% for the first time since June 2018.Already on the way out, dominance was dealt a significant blow thanks to the recent Bitcoin price pressure, while altcoins, such as Ether (ETH), benefitted.“The Bitcoin dominance is still falling,” popular Twitter trader The Moon summarized over the weekend.For all the nerveracking price action, meanwhile, nothing provides a bullish counterpoint to the current Bitcoin narrative than its network fundamentals.Even after its dip to $42,000, Bitcoin is more attractive than ever for miners, and its network security is, therefore, also more solid than ever before.As Cointelegraph reported, both the hash rate and difficulty have staged a miraculous recovery in recent weeks, reclaiming all-time highs after a miner washout caused its own brief price crash.The weekend proved to be no different, with the weekly average hash rate topping 180 exahashes per second for the first time.The difficulty is still on track to increase by over 10% at the next automated readjustment in 11 days’ time. The previous readjustment on Friday, at 21.5%, was the largest positive shift since June 2014.“Bitcoin’s mining difficulty hitting an all-time high just after tesla’s announcement is a chef’s kiss,” Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital, said last week.Taking a break for crypto-specific triggers, the wider macro picture may yet provide some inspiration for price trajectory.After plunging late last week, the strength of the United States dollar is returning. The U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) is bouncing off familiar support — surges in its strength tend to provide teething problems for BTC/USD.At the same time, stocks are bullish in China but performing averagely in Europe and the United States. The coronavirus, with localized peaks in some jurisdictions but fewer cases in others, joins the melting pot.Among traders, however, it is inflation that is a key issue. A broad global rebound from the time of lockdowns and other restrictions creates problems for those attempting to engineer it — specifically, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks.“The global economic recovery is well under way; that’s what’s fueling the inflation fears,” Olivier d’Assier, Qontigo head of APAC applied research, told Bloomberg.After stock markets’ rip roaring year, he added, appetite for profit taking will be understandably increasing.Is it 2013 or 2017 in terms of the Bitcoin bull market?Among the industry’s best-known names, there is no hint of bearishness — all that remains to do is analyze the nature of the current retracement and compare it to years past.This week, stock-to-flow creator PlanB notes that for all the Musk drama, Bitcoin is still performing better than during its 2017 run to $20,000. This despite the $42,000 dip officially being Bitcoin’s biggest this bull cycle and since the cross-asset crash of March 2020.“Today feels like 2017 bull market (esp. during the fork war),” he tweeted on Monday, invoking memories of the birth of Bitcoin Cash (BCH).Calling for calm and zooming out is a key feature among seasoned Bitcoiners. As Cointelegraph reported last week, stock-to-flow remains unviolated by Musk or any other episode of downward volatility.An accompanying survey, meanwhile, revealed that a majority of 35,000 respondents believe that BTC/USD will still hit $100,000 this year."
163,"Transaction fees on Bitcoin and Ethereum have fallen by 81% and 71%, respectively, over the last few weeks as the broader cryptocurrency market continues to descend from its recent all-time high.The average cost of using the Ethereum blockchain fell from $69.92 per transaction on Wednesday to $20.06 by Sunday, according to data from Bitinfocharts. In the same time period, Ether’s (ETH) spot price both peaked and crashed, falling from an all-time high of $4,358 on Wednesday to $3,183 just prior to publication — a 27% decline.Before 2021’s market surge, Ethereum’s current average fee of $20 would have been an all-time high by some margin. As recently as 2020, average usage costs were lower than $0.10. The rapid surge in the cost of using Ethereum comes after the emergence of decentralized finance apps — which now make up four out of the top five gas burners on the blockchain — and the increased attention brought to the blockchain amid 2021’s market boom.Ethereum’s daily user count has quadrupled since the beginning of 2020, climbing from around 400,000 to 1.6 million according to Bitinfocharts. This number does not account for transactions taking place on Ethereum’s layer-two protocols.A similar trend was observed on Bitcoin, which saw its transaction fees fall 81% since mid-April when the BTC coin price was close to $65,000. Average transaction costs of around $62.77 marked a new all-time high for BTC, exceeding 2017’s high of $55, which signaled the top of Bitcoin’s bull run at the time.Bitcoin was priced at $42,440 early on Monday morning, marking a 34% decline since April’s recent peak. Bitcoin dominance, which measures Bitcoin’s share of the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization, fell as low as 39.9% on Monday, sinking from a high of 70% in December.While generally indicative of a swelling altcoin market, this figure can also be misleading due to the difference in the size of the crypto market cap at various times. For example, in 2017, Bitcoin’s market dominance was close to 90%, but the global market cap was only $2 billion, or 0.1% of what it is now. At the same time, the global market cap figure can easily be boosted by anyone who can be bothered to launch an arbitrary token with a high supply and even just a modest starting price."
164,"Amid the ongoing concerns over Bitcoin’s (BTC) energy consumption, a new study states that the traditional banking system consumes much more energy than the Bitcoin network.Michael Novogratz’s cryptocurrency firm, Galaxy Digital, released a report Friday titled “On Bitcoin’s Energy Consumption: A Quantitative Approach to a Subjective Question,” providing open-source access to its methodology and calculations.Compiled by Galaxy’s mining arm, the study estimates Bitcoin’s annual electricity consumption to stand at 113.89 terawatts per hour, including energy for miner demand, miner power consumption, pool power consumption and node power consumption. This amount is at least two times lower than the total energy consumed by the banking system as well as the gold industry on an annual basis, according to Galaxy’s estimations.While Bitcoin’s energy consumption is transparent and easy to track in real time by using tools like Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, the evaluation of energy usage of the gold industry and the traditional financial system is not that straightforward, Galaxy Digital Mining stated.“The banking industry does not directly report electricity consumption data,” the report says, adding that the retail and commercial banking system requires multiple settlement layers, while Bitcoin offers final settlement. Given Galaxy’s estimations of power usage by banking data centers, bank branches, ATMs and card networks’ data centers, the total annual energy consumption of the banking system is estimated to be 263.72 TWh globally. In order to calculate the energy consumption of the gold industry, Galaxy Digital Mining implemented estimates for the industry’s total greenhouse gases emissions provided in the World’s Gold Council’s report titled “Gold and climate change: Current and future impacts.” As estimated in the study, the gold industry utilizes roughly 240.61 TWh per year. “These estimates may exclude key sources of energy use and emissions that are second order effects of the gold industry like the energy and carbon intensity of the tires used in gold mines,” Galaxy noted.Galaxy Digital’s analysis on Bitcoin’s energy consumption comes amid a major crypto market crash that follows Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s decision to stop accepting BTC as payment for car purchases due to environmental concerns. “Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment,” the CEO wrote on Twitter last week.Musk’s move spurred wide-scale criticism from the crypto community, with some stating that SpaceX would have to switch its rockets to “more sustainable energy” in order to not “look like a clueless big hypocrite.”Crypto markets shed over $500 billion after Musk took to Twitter with his announcement, with Bitcoin today slipping below $43,000 for the first time since early February. The executive apparently brought more stress to the market by hinting that Tesla has plans to dump Bitcoin from its balance sheet soon."
165,"Elon Musk appears to have again been the catalyst for Bitcoin’s (BTC) price shedding more than 10% over the weekend after Tesla’s CEO appeared to suggest the firm may be planning to dump BTC from its balance sheet this quarter.On Sunday, Musk replied to a tweet predicting that Tesla may dump its BTC holdings this quarter. To the chagrin of the Bitcoin community, Musk simply replied: “Indeed.”IndeedWith Musk’s popularity already dwindling within the crypto community after he criticized the energy efficiency of Bitcoin amid Tesla’s suspension of support for vehicle purchases using BTC, his one-word comment has elicited further condemnation from many leading figures in cryptocurrency.Peter McCormack (who has since changed his handle to “McObnoxious”), the host of the What Bitcoin Did podcast, stated that Musk’s recent criticism of BTC is “poorly informed” and that adding this support for Dogecoin (DOGE) may make him “perfect troll.”1/ Dear @elonmusk. The perfect troll is one where people don't know whether it is a troll or not. Your recent poorly informed criticism of #bicoin + support for Doge may be the perfect troll...or you might actually believe this (God I hope not).McCormack’s comments appear to have riled up Musk, with Tesla’s CEO stating: “Obnoxious threads like this make me want to go all in on Doge.”Yearn.finance developer “banteg” also jumped in to imply that Musk’s apparent support for Dogecoin over Bitcoin has comprised an elaborate pump-and-dump scheme, stating: “I guess you really need all retail in the world to unload 28.34% of Dogecoin supply.”At the time of writing, DOGE prices have dumped 32% since their peak of $0.73 on May 8, with losses accelerating following Musk’s appearance on Saturday Night Live on the same day.Musk also asserted he has a superior understanding of money than crypto analysts due to his previous executive positions at PayPal’s precursor, stating:MicroStrategy CEO and prominent Bitcoin proponent Michael Saylor highlighted the differences between PayPal and Bitcoin, stating: “The world needs a decentralized, secure, deflationary store of value like #Bitcoin much more than it needs the more centralized, less secure, inflationary medium of exchange that you describe above.”PayPal lead engineer Daniel Brain also chimed in to emphasize the expanded utility Bitcoin offers over PayPal.Even at PayPal, we understand the difference between a settlement layer and a transactional layer. :)The comments suggest relations between Saylor and Musk may be cooling.In August 2020, Saylor’s leading business intelligence firm MicroStrategy became the first prominent mainstream company to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet when it purchased 21,000 BTC for an aggregate price of $250 million.In December 2020, Musk was spotted asking Saylor about the ease with which a large firm could purchase hundreds of millions/billions worth of Bitcoin. The friendly advice given precipitated Tesla’s own purchase the following month.In February, news broke that Tesla had invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, sending prices skyrocketing to new all-time highs above $43,000 at the time.Responding to Saylor’s defense of Bitcoin today, Musk tweeted: “He should wear outfit for Halloween, but with ‘Bitcoin’ tattooed high on thighs.”BTC is down 10% over the past 24 hours, having last traded hands for $43,400.UPDATE: Roughly one hour after the original publication of this article, Elon Musk tweeted: “To clarify speculation, Tesla has not sold any Bitcoin.”"
166,"The crypto sector is in a bull market, and frequent evidence comes from anonymous traders who post their five-, six- and seven-figure investment returns as screenshots on Crypto Twitter.This condition creates a FOMO-like situation where everyone gets greedy. The temptation to boost potential earnings by twenty times or more is often irresistible for most novice traders.Today, almost every cryptocurrency exchange offers leveraged trading using derivatives. To enter these markets, a trader has to first deposit collateral (margin), which is usually a stablecoin or Bitcoin (BTC). However, unlike spot (regular) trading, the trader cannot withdraw from a futures market position until it has been closed.These instruments have benefits and can improve a trader's outcomes. However, those who often rely on incorrect information when trading futures contracts end up with heavy losses rather than profits.These leveraged futures contracts are synthetic, and it is even possible to short or place a bet on the downside. Leverage is the most appealing aspect of futures contracts, but it is worth noting that these instruments have long been used in stock markets, commodities, indexes, and foreign exchange (FX).In traditional finance, traders measure daily price change by calculating the average closing price changes. This measure is widely used in every asset class, and it's called volatility. However, for various reasons, this metric isn't helpful for cryptocurrencies and can harm leverage traders.To be brief, the higher the volatility, the more often an asset price presents wild oscillations. Contrary to the expectation, moving up by 7% to 10% every day represents a low volatility indicator. This happens because the deviation from the mean is small, while random fluctuations between a negative 3% to a positive 3% present a much wider range.Knowing the general range of how an asset oscillates is extremely important when opening leverage positions. Take the British Pound Sterling (GBP), for example, and one will notice that its volatility is usually below 1% as surprise aggressive daily price changes are unusual.FX markets are relatively stable markets when compared with stocks and commodities. Therefore, some regulated brokers offer even 200x leverage, meaning a 0.5% move against the position would cause a forced liquidation.For a cryptocurrency trader, the Swiss Franc's (CHF) daily change versus the U.S. dollar would likely be seen as a stablecoin.However, the 3.4% daily Bitcoin volatility hides a more dangerous price fluctuation. While measuring daily closing prices for traditional markets makes sense, cryptocurrencies trade non-stop. This difference potentially creates much wider movements within the same day, although the daily closing often masquerades it.The average change between the Bitcoin intraday high and low of the past 180 days is 6.5%. As shown above, these 'intraday moves' surpassed 10% on 25 occasions. Meaning, in reality, BTC price oscillations are much larger than expected for a 3.2% daily volatility asset.To put things into perspective, a 5% move in the wrong direction is enough to liquidate any 20x leveraged Bitcoin position. This data is clear evidence that traders should really consider risk and volatility when leverage-trading cryptocurrencies.Fast profits are nice, but what is more important is being able to survive the usual daily price swings to hold on to those unrealized gains.Although there's not a magical number to set the best leverage for every trader, one must account for the effect of volatility when calculating liquidation risks. Those aiming to keep positions open for more than a couple of days, aiming for 15x or lower leverage, seem to be 'reasonable.'The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
167,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been struggling to rise above the $50,000 mark, which could have resulted in traders dumping their Bitcoin positions to invest in altcoins. Glassnode data suggests that whale addresses owning more than 1,000 BTC have reduced from about 2,500 in February to 2,100.If large investors continue to sell, Bitcoin could witness a sharp correction until institutional investors step in and buy at lower levels. While MicroStrategy announced the purchase of 271 Bitcoin on May 13, other existing institutional investors appear to be adopting a wait and watch approach.In an interview with Financial NewsSquare, Square chief financial officer Amrita Ahuja said, at this point, the firm does not have any plans to add Bitcoin to its existing haul of roughly 8,027 Bitcoin purchased in October 2020 and February of this year.If other institutions also stay away from buying at current levels, Bitcoin’s price is likely to slide further. However, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner Tom Lee believes Bitcoin’s rally still has legs. Lee has increased his year-end Bitcoin target from $100,000 to $125,000.With action becoming coin specific, let’s look at the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may lead the charge in the next few days.The bulls again purchased the dip to the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern today but the long wick on the candlestick suggests profit-booking at higher levels. Bitcoin’s sentiment seems to have changed from buy on dips to sell on rallies.If the bears sink and sustain the price below the neckline, the H&S pattern will complete. This setup has a target objective at $31,653.73. The downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($53,297) and the relative strength index (RSI) below 36 indicate the bears are in control.However, the bulls are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to stall the decline in the $43,000 to $40,000 support zone but if they fail, the decline could be sharp.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the current level and rises above $51,550, the BTC/USDT pair may rally to the 20-day EMA. A breakout and close above the $60,000 resistance will suggest the bulls are back in the game.The rebound from $46,435.02 fizzled out at the 20-EMA. This suggests the sentiment is negative and traders are selling on rallies to the 20-EMA. If the bears sink the price below the neckline, the selling could intensify.However, if the bulls again defend the neckline, the pair may attempt to rise above the 20-EMA. If that happens, the rally could extend to $51,538.22 where the bulls are likely to encounter stiff resistance.If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair may consolidate between $46,000 and $51,500 for a few days.XRP is currently trading inside a symmetrical triangle, which usually acts as a continuation pattern. If the bulls can drive the price above the resistance line of the triangle, the altcoin could retest the 52-week high at $1.96.A breakout and close above $1.96 could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $2.68. The RSI has risen into the positive territory but the 20-day EMA ($1.43) is yet to turn up, which suggests that bears are likely to defend the resistance line aggressively.If the price turns down from the resistance line, the XRP/USDT pair could extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. The pair could turn negative if the bears sink and sustain the price below the triangle. Such a move may pull the price down to $0.88.The price has dipped to the moving averages on the 4-hour chart. If the pair rebounds off the current levels with strength, it will suggest buying on dips. The bulls will then try to push the price above the triangle.Alternatively, if the bears sink and sustain the price below the moving averages, the pair could drop to $1.35 and then to the support line of the triangle. A break below this support could signal advantage to the bears.Polkadot (DOT) broke out and closed above the overhead resistance at $44 on May 14. The bulls continued the momentum and pushed the price to a new all-time high at $49.78 on May 15 but could not sustain the higher levels. Profit-booking has pulled the price back below the breakout level at $44.If the bulls do not give up much ground from the current levels, it will suggest buying on dips. The DOT/USDT pair could then make one more attempt to rise above the psychological level at $50.If that happens, the pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $63.68. The marginally upsloping 20-day EMA ($39.54) and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.Contrary to this assumption, if the price sustains below $44, the pair could drop to the moving averages. A break below this support could pull the price down to $32.50.The 4-hour chart shows the bears pulled the price below the 20-EMA but the bulls are attempting to reclaim the support. The buyers will have to push the price above $47 to regain the advantage. If they succeed, a retest of $50 is likely.On the other hand, if the price fails to climb above the 20-EMA, it will suggest a lack of buying support. That could pull the price down to the 50-simple moving average. The flattening 20-EMA and the RSI near 50 suggest a balance between supply and demand.Stellar Lumens (XLM) is attempting to start a new uptrend. The bulls purchased the dip to the 20-day EMA ($0.61) on May 13 and pushed the price to a new 52-week high at $0.79 today. However, the long wick on the day’s candlestick indicates profit-booking at higher levels.If buyers can sustain the price above $0.73, the XLM/USDT pair could rally to $0.85 and then to $1. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 63 indicate that bulls have the upper hand.Contrary to this assumption, if the price sustains below $0.73, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA. A strong rebound off this support will suggest the sentiment remains positive. The bulls will then make one more attempt to resume the uptrend.This positive view will invalidate if the price breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that traders are closing their positions in a hurry and not buying the dips. That could result in a drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.53).The 4-hour chart shows the formation of an inverse head and shoulders pattern. This bullish setup has a target objective at $0.90. The upsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls are in command.During strong uptrends, corrections are likely to be shallow. Therefore, the current dip may find support at $0.72. A strong bounce off this level could increase the possibility of the resumption of the uptrend.This bullish view will invalidate if the price dips and closes below the neckline. Such a move could trap the bulls, resulting in long liquidation. The pair may then decline to $0.55.Solana (SOL) had been range-bound between $40 and $49.99 for the past few days. A tight consolidation near the high is a positive sign as it shows that traders are not booking profits in a hurry.The 20-day EMA ($42.86) is sloping up and the RSI has risen above 65, indicating the path of least resistance is to the upside.If the bulls can sustain the price above the psychological level at $50, the SOL/USDT pair may resume its uptrend. The next target objective on the upside is $60 and then $69.On the contrary, if the price fails to sustain above $50, the pair may re-enter the range and extend its consolidation for a few more days. This positive view will invalidate if the pair breaks below $40.The 4-hour chart shows the bulls pushed the price to a new all-time high at $52.60 today but the long wick on the candlestick indicates profit-booking at higher levels. The price has dipped back below $50 but it may find strong support at $46.A strong rebound off this level will suggest that traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then again try to resume the uptrend. The rising 20-EMA and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest advantage to the bulls.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below $46, the pair may drop to the 20-EMA. Such a move will suggest aggressive selling above $50 and that could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

168,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price slipped below $46,000 on Sunday for the second time in four days, raising the specter of a deeper short-term correction for the flagship digital currency.Bitcoin fell to a session low of $45,127.01, according to TradingView, before staging a modest recovery to around $45,400. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is down 5% on the day and over 20% in the last seven days.The selloff in BTC contributed to a market-wide correction for crypto assets, as Ether (ETH) fell 7%, Polkadot’s DOT declined 10%, and Binance Coin (BNB) edged down 3%.Market sentiment toward cryptocurrencies has soured in recent days after it was revealed that Tesla is no longer accepting Bitcoin payments for its automobiles. Headlines about a possible investigation into Binance by the United States Justice Department have also raised concerns about a potential regulatory backlash.Meanwhile, Caitlin Long of Avanti digital bank believes that Tether’s first-ever reserve disclosure has spooked investors. In a Twitter thread posted on Saturday, Long said Tether’s “probability of default [and] loss severity in default just went up” because of its credit exposure. Namely, almost two-thirds of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are stored in commercial paper.Despite all the noise in the market today, institutions are accumulating Bitcoin with ever-growing conviction, offering compelling evidence that the bull market is far from over.Bitcoin Treasuries, which tracks corporate and institutional exposure to BTC, reported Saturday that institutions have accumulated 215,000 Bitcoin in the past 30 days. That’s equivalent to roughly $10 billion.Institutions have accumulated 215,000 #bitcoin in the past 30 days.Corporations with Bitcoin on their balance sheets have generated a significant return on investment. As Bitcoin Treasuries reported on Wednesday, the value of MicroStrategy’s BTC reserve has grown by 2.3 times; the value of Square’s Bitcoin stash is up 2.1 times; and Riot Blockchain’s holdings have increased in value by 9 times. These figures have declined slightly amid the latest market correction.Institutions have been flooding Bitcoin for the better part of a year. These so-called smart money investors are one of the biggest reasons for BTC’s ascent from just $10,000 last summer to a high of around $64,000 in April. "
169,"Just this week, Ether (ETH) breached the $4,000 mark while Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, recently hit another all-time high at over $63,000. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues its roller-coaster ride after ""Dogefather"" Elon Musk's appearance on Saturday Night Live and news about digital artwork fetching eye-watering prices in the form of nonfungible tokens is all over the airwaves.Crypto is hot, whether you like it or not.Still, not everyone is convinced. Janet Yellen, the newly-minted United States secretary of the treasury, previously questioned the legitimacy and stability of cryptocurrency as a store of value. After all, it was only three years ago when we saw the last Bitcoin bubble burst. After a meteoric rise in 2017, which saw BTC crest the $20,000 mark, a 2018 sell-off cratered the asset and attracted “Tulipmania” comparisons.Related: Did Bitcoin prove itself to be a reliable store of value in 2020? Experts answerBitcoiners have been called “cultists” due to their zealous backing of this new, volatile and arcane technology. But don’t be confused: it’s not just technophiles and eccentric billionaires like Elon Musk diving into cryptocurrency. From JPMorgan to PayPal, bona fide Wall Street bluebloods and Silicon Valley stalwarts have been buying Bitcoin in a big way.Related: Will PayPal’s crypto integration bring crypto to the masses? Experts answerThe amount of BTC in circulation is now worth over a trillion dollars. Most of the major financial institutions — including investment giants and payment firms — are now backing the cryptocurrency, and there is growing interest from retail investors. Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly important part of the global financial system.At the same time, Bitcoin still exists in a regulatory gray area as different governing bodies have knit together a patchwork of cryptocurrency rules over the past 10 years. In many cases, this patchwork isn’t enough to give mainstream investors confidence in the market, as some of the most basic principles about cryptocurrency governance are still up for debate. For example, are cryptocurrencies considered assets or securities? Well, that all depends on who you ask...One of the big misconceptions about Bitcoin — and cryptocurrencies in general — is that the market is some sort of “Wild West”: outside the scope of regulators and rife with scammers, outlaws and crooks. That’s simply not true.Any business that touches consumers in the U.S. and other jurisdictions is subject to some form of regulatory standards and rules, which also apply to digital assets. There may not be a framework created with cryptocurrencies in mind, given that we are at the frontier of a new, disruptive technology. But various rules regarding consumer protection, prevention of money laundering, anti-fraud and other fields apply to the different activities that take place. Crypto companies can work with law firms to interpret the rules in relation to their business and comply with them to the best of their ability.The current crypto rulebook has been cobbled together over the past 10 years as regulation has played catch-up to innovation. But that might soon change: The confirmation of Gary Gensler — a former head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, who has taught classes on blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — as the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, indicates that the current administration is going to treat digital assets seriously and attempt to provide comprehensive oversight and regulatory guidance for this nascent market.Gensler has intimated that he’s awaiting the completion of Yellen's review of crypto before enacting a regulatory agenda on digital currencies. Meanwhile, Congress is also taking a hard look. Last month, lawmakers introduced a bill to create a working group composed of industry experts and representatives from the SEC and CFTC to evaluate the current legal and regulatory framework around digital assets.Related: Crypto-friendly faces poised for positions in Biden administrationIt is hard to predict what we will see in terms of regulations for cryptocurrency and the various business models in the industry in the near future. Still, we have observed regulators becoming increasingly sophisticated and constructive, as they recognize that they have a duty to actively protect consumers, promote innovation and create a positive economic environment.With a plethora of crypto firms cropping up against this confusing regulatory backdrop in recent years, it’s important for institutional investors to understand what pitfalls to avoid when choosing a partner to entrust with their digital assets. It is crucial to know how the firm is regulated, information that should be publicly available on their website and verified on the regulator’s website.In addition, it is worth understanding every business model, as not all firms are the same. The basic concept of paying yield may look the same, but the risk profile may be quite different. If a firm is not transparent in how it operates and creates yield, it should be a cause for concern, and if their rates are materially different from competitors, I think it’s important to understand why. Always read the fine print!Some companies may opt to work in jurisdictions known for light regulation, but skirting oversight comes at the expense of building trust and long-term business. Any company worth working with will have a proactive and collaborative stance with regulators. It is a complex landscape to navigate, and it can be expensive for startup companies, but it is part of the cost of building long-term value.Cryptocurrency lenders who want to be at the forefront of the digital revolution need to embrace the regulatory overhaul that is bound to come and welcome the dialogue with regulators. Investors should seek partnerships with firms that value transparency, compliance, expertise and fairness.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

170,"As corporate finance leaders prepare to set sail into the post-COVID-19 world amid inflation storm warnings, an increasing number of corporations are taking stock of their treasury reserve holdings. If the worst happens, and the dollar and other reserve currencies weaken, are they sure that all their balance-sheet cash is lashed down securely?It surely hasn’t escaped their notice, after all, that a number of public companies that “joined” Bitcoin (BTC) in a big way over the past year recently broadcast strong Q1 2021 earnings. Square, which holds $472 million worth of BTC, for instance, reported a quarterly gross profit increase of 79% year-over-year, doubling analysts’ expectations. While Tesla, which plunked down $1.5 billion — 8% of its cash — into BTC in February, posted record earnings with revenues surging 74%. MicroStrategy, which made Bitcoin its primary corporate reserve in 2020, notched a 10% gain in Q1 revenues.“If inflation picks up, or even if it doesn’t, and more companies decide to diversify some small portion of their cash balances into bitcoin instead of cash, then the current relative trickle into bitcoin would become a torrent,” wrote storied investor Bill Miller in a market letter earlier this year. Already, “companies such as Square, MassMutual, and MicroStrategy have moved cash into bitcoin rather than have guaranteed losses on cash held on their balance sheet,” he added.Elsewhere, Ark Investments commented in a company newsletter: “Microstrategy, Square, and now Tesla are showing public companies the way to add bitcoin as a legitimate alternative to cash on their balance sheets.”But Bitcoin remains a volatile asset — as the most recent BTC price drop to $46,000 reminded users again — so maybe its embrace by corporate treasurers is really just a short-term happenstance? On the other hand, if the trend does have legs, is it really appropriate for all companies? If so, at what level of allocation is appropriate?Overall, what does this say about the global economy if public firms now look to a 12-year-old digital currency to keep its cash stockpiles liquid and secure?“I do not view this as a fad,” Paul Cappelli, a portfolio manager at Galaxy Fund Management, told Cointelegraph. Bitcoin’s “inelastic supply curve and deflationary issuance schedule” make it a “compelling hedge against inflation and poor monetary policies that could lead to cash positions becoming devalued over time,” he told Cointelegraph, predicting:David Grider, lead digital asset strategist at Fundstrat, informed Cointelegraph that as crypto becomes more mainstream, he expects to see “more corporates holding crypto for legitimate business purposes.” Exchanges could hold it as inventory, tech companies might use it to stake tokens and participate in networks, while multinational corporations could accept it for payments.“I expect two types of companies to consider early adoption of crypto — ones led by leaders who are strong believers in crypto, as well as companies that may have unique cross-border needs that are a good fit for Bitcoin transfers,” Gil Luria, director of research at D.A. Davidson & Co., told Cointelegraph.If so, doesn’t this represent a sea change for corporate finance officers? “When I did my treasury exams, the thing we were told as number one objective is to guarantee security and liquidity of the balance sheet,” Graham Robinson, a partner in international tax and treasury at PricewaterhouseCoopers and adviser to the United Kingdom’s Association for Corporate Treasurers, told Reuters. BTC with its volatility might simply not fit the bill.If Bitcoin were to be used as a corporate treasury reserve, and its price plunged, that company might not be able to meet its working capital requirements, noted Robert Willens, adjunct professor of Columbia Business School, in January, when he described it as “a high-risk, high-reward strategy.”Has Willens changed his views? “I still believe it is a high risk/high reward strategy,” he told Cointelegraph, acknowledging that “lately, the rewards have far outweighed the risks.” He does see more firms following the lead of Tesla and Square, “as crypto investments become more ‘respectable’ and emerge as a viable outlet for corporate cash balances.” Asked who might lead the way, Willens answered:Fundstrat’s Grider, citing the OTC trading firm Genesis’ Capital trading data, told Cointelegraph that more corporations may be buying crypto than has been reported in earnings statements. The Genesis Q1 2021 “Market Observations Report,” for example, reported a striking jump in “corporates’” share of crypto trading volume to ~27% from ~0% in the quarters prior. “As corporate clients began buying bitcoin for their treasuries in Q1, our ratios shifted,” noted Genesis.Assuming that a company believes that crypto should be part of its treasury reserves, how much should it actually allocate? Last year, Cappelli told Cointelegraph that an investment of 50 basis points to 2% of reserves was about right, given crypto’s volatility. But since then, crypto prices have skyrocketed, and Tesla allocated a whopping 8% — or $1.5 billion — to its corporate cash reserves. Is the recommended allocation growing?“I don’t think there’s a bright-line rule that we can apply here across the board,” Willens told Cointelegraph, “but I think something well north of 2% would be appropriate — perhaps as much as 8%–10% might even be acceptable.”“It will all depend on the company,” Cappelli said this past week. “Corporations manage their balance sheets to fund operations and maintain a certain amount of liquidity.” Bitcoin is still a very volatile asset, “so while it does provide a hedge against inflation, it does come with a certain amount of market risk. I’d be very surprised to see a company allocation much more than a ballpark of 5% currently, but that may change over time.”Still, what about Robinson’s contention that a corporate treasurer’s job is to guarantee liquidity and security of the balance sheet — and could Bitcoin not do that?“If you think about crypto purely as cash, it is still very volatile relative to the dollar,” Grider told Cointelegraph. “But some assets like Bitcoin are becoming less volatile lately, and we are seeing strong liquidity emerge in crypto, which is encouraging.”One way a firm could think about holding crypto is as an alternative to cash, continued Grider, “but you can also think about it like inventory or a marketable securities investment or an intangible long-term asset. That means even if not an ideal treasury asset in all respects, corporates could still hold crypto for other reasons,” such as:“I think the liquidity concern is a valid one,” responded Willens, “but limiting the investment to 8%–10% of the investible funds ought to insulate treasurers from criticism since the balance of the funds would be deployed in cash and cash equivalents with a readily realizable value.”There is a sizing exercise that occurs for every investment, added Capelli, and “taking all balance sheet investments into account” is part of any corporate treasurer’s or chief investment officer’s job. Meanwhile, Luria declared that “crypto assets are liquid enough that this should not be a constraint.”A more significant disincentive to using crypto as a corporate treasury reserve, in Willens’ view, may be the accounting treatment to which it is subjected at present — i.e., “the odd way investments in crypto are accounted for — they are treated as ‘indefinite-lived intangible assets,’ and thus any declines in the value of the asset must be reflected in income from continuing operations, whereas price increases cannot be so reflected.” He described this “unfavorable accounting treatment [...] as the most unattractive aspect of an investment therein.”All in all, the current monetary environment has raised serious corporate concerns about inflation and the continued strength of the United States dollar. It should not be surprising, as Grider said, “that corporations would become more open to alternatives like crypto.”But something even larger may be going on. As Perianne Boring noted recently in the New York Times, a “tectonic shift” may be underway in global finance thanks to cryptocurrency. “Digital assets have brought forth a new paradigm in global finance,” concurred Cappelli, though we are still in the very early stages:"
171,"As the headlines pile up about Bitcoin’s calamitous environmental impact, one group of investors and supporters have stepped up to the plate to defend the world’s largest digital asset with the help of a crowdfunded, FUD-fighting documentary film. First announced by investor, podcast host, and Bitcoin fanatic Brad Mills on Twitter, the goal of the film is to act as a “definitive” argument for “why Bitcoin will transition the world to renewable energy faster than governments.”I found the filmmaker (@jamie_jk) to make the definitive short film on why Bitcoin will transition the world to renewable energy faster than governments.

It will only cost $20-30k for a professional mini-doc on BTC energy FUD.

I will put up $5k in, who’s with us?#GreenBitcoin https://t.co/7MSPTUlArPMills’ choice of director is Jamie King, best known for STEAL THIS FILM — a documentary series about BitTorrent and one of the earliest examples of a crowdfunded, free-to-share effort. In an interview with Cointelegraph, King said that the narrative about Bitcoin’s energy consumption pushed him into action. “The idea for this new project, which we're raising funds for right now, came about as a result of the increasing amount of attention being paid to Bitcoin's energy usage,” King said. “Obviously this came to a head with Elon's announcement about not accepting BTC for his cars for the time being -- but it's also a piece of 'FUD' we're seeing repeated with greater and greater intensity.”Earlier in the week, billionaire Elon Musk Tweeted that his company Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin for payments — a comment that set off accusations of hypocrisy, but whose contents were echoed loudly in the mainstream media.Despite Elon’s gripes, specifics about how much “dirty” energy Bitcoin consumes is difficult to calculate, however, and even estimates based off of Chinese consumption may only paint a rough picture.Regardless, King and crew aren’t trying to argue that Bitcoin is clean, green tech.“I think it's important to acknowledge Bitcoin uses energy. A lot of it. That's part of its design,” says King. “The question we need to ask is: is it worth it.”To be clear, I strongly believe in crypto, but it can’t drive a massive increase in fossil fuel use, especially coalKing said that those who instinctively answer “no” to that question likely haven’t done their research, and that “in a broader social, political and economic context” the case for Bitcoin’s energy consumption is self-evident. So far the community has responded warmly, raising .5 BTC in just 48 hours. King also notes that while Bitcoin’s Lightning Network hasn’t seen the adoption some hoped for, after the project opened up to Lightning donations small backers began pouring in.“I guess what we can see is that Lightning is very real for small Bitcoin donations, I’m glad to say,” he joked.In the end, King’s goal isn’t to fling mud back at the FUD-sters, but instead to educate and elevate."
172,"Historically, activity surrounding the Bitcoin (BTC) monthly futures and options expiry has been blamed for weakening bullish momentum. A few studies from 2019 found a 2.3% average drop in BTC price 40 hours before the CME futures settlement date. However, as Cointelegraph reported in June 2020, the effect faded away. While 2020 seems to have rejected the potential negative impact of CME expiries, so far, the current year appears to validate the theory. Bitcoin’s price has been suppressed ahead of futures and options expiry in the first three months of 2021.Some investors and traders have pointed out that Bitcoin’s incredible rally after the recent futures and options expiry dates has become a trend.$BTC options expiry in about 8 hours...

Last Friday of every month has been a pretty good entry point for past 8 months ...

Past 3 months price has been hammered in the hours / days leading up to expiry

Observation not advice. Let's see if the pattern holds. pic.twitter.com/3CJqI6m6jlBTC has effectively rallied in the days following the expiry, but expanding this analysis uncovers a less-than-satisfactory trend.The past 13 months have been nothing short of spectacular for Bitcoin, as the cryptocurrency posted 788% gains. August 2020 turned out to be the worst month, as BTC presented a 7.5% negative performance. Thus, choosing random starting points within the month will likely show a similar positive trend.For example, if one uses the “last quarter” moon phase as a proxy, the odds that a rally takes place after each event are very high.As depicted above, indeed, Bitcoin rallied after five out of the last six instances. The only conclusion might be that positive trends are the norm rather than the exception during bull runs.Although there might be some explanation to the reason behind Bitcoin’s end-of-the-month underperformance, these are only hypotheses.While market makers and arbitrage desks could benefit from suppressing the price after a rally, other forces, including leverage futures longs and call option holders, would balance that out.Therefore, it makes sense to analyze the potential price suppression ahead of the expiry instead of looking for explanations for a rally during a bull market.Both October and December 2020 expiries failed to present any negative pressure ahead of such dates. Meanwhile, the 12% positive performance on the five days that preceded the most recent April 30 expiry also puts a big question mark on how meaningful the CME event really is.Considering there hasn’t been a price decrease ahead of monthly futures and options expiries in three of the last seven instances, this evidence should put a nail in the coffin of the unfounded myth.As mentioned earlier, trying to develop theories on why sellers acted more aggressively on specific dates is unlikely to yield results.As shown above, Bitcoin’s price failed to underperform in three out of the last seven expiries. A 57% success rate should not define a trend when a positive performance after a specific date has been proven common during a bull run.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

173,"Strategic investor Lyn Alden is convinced Bitcoin has still the potential to reach $100K in the current bull cycle — despite growing uncertainty and increasing volatility. “We are seeing a lot of froth throughout the industry”, she said, referring to the latest rally in a number of meme coins such as Doge.“Those are kind of warning signs for the cycle”, she added.Alden said that with the bull run slowing down and growing risks of a correction, it makes sense for some investors to take some money off the table and put it into some other assets.“For people who would have trouble with drawdowns or periods of volatility, it can make sense to rebalance”.Overall, Alden’s position remains bullish given her confidence in the strong fundamentals of the Bitcoin network:Despite a number of altcoins outperforming Bitcoin this year, she doesn’t think Bitcoin is anywhere near losing its leading position in the crypto market. Most altcoins, she pointed out, didn’t manage to sustain the same degree of growth throughout multiple business cycles.“ I'd be more concerned if I saw protocols that chip into Bitcoin's market dominance in one cycle and then chip even more into it in the next market cycle”.Don’t miss the full interview on our YouTube channel and don’t forget to subscribe!"

The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score peaked a 93 on March 12 before declining to the 60 range over the next 48 hours as MATIC price consolidated in a tightening range.According to data from Cointelegraph Pro NewsQuakes, on May 14 Kraken exchange announced that it would list MATIC, GHST and RARI and a second NewsQuake highlighted that MATIC deposits and trading had commenced. Hours before both NewsQuakes announcements the VORTECS™ score began to increase, peaking at a new high at 99 on May 15 as MATIC price rallied to $1.89Others, such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum Classic (ETC), delivered mild losses in line with the general trend. Bitcoin, having recovered some of its lost ground after falling 20% earlier in the week, stayed near the lower end of its trading range without managing to reclaim $50,000.On short timeframes, however, fellow trader Scott Melker nonetheless highlighted bullish signals for Bitcoin's relative strength index (RSI) — something which could deliver more solid progress in the coming days. For PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow family of BTC price models, the RSI behavior was ""typical"" and comparable to the ranging seen before BTC/USD hit all-time highs in late 2017. ""Bitcoin relative strength index (RSI): we are at the typical mid-bull-cycle drop in RSI (yellow circles), in between 2013 and 2017,"" he commented alongside an accompanying chart."
175,"Even though the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has yet to fully recede, an increasing number of countries are beginning to open up their borders to tourists once again. Furthermore, with large-scale vaccination drives taking place all over the world, it appears as though by the time summer rolls around again, it will become possible for many individuals to travel to certain holiday destinations once again.In fact, according to the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, American tourists will be able to pay a visit to their favorite European Union countries during summer 2021, given that they are able to fulfill the EU’s vaccination requirements.In this regard, it should be pointed out that according to a tracker made available by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 35% of all American citizens have already been fully vaccinated, while 46% have received at least one shot.Lastly, these vaccination numbers seem to be growing at a rapid rate, thereby hinting at the possibility that by the onset of June, a vast majority of the U.S. population — which includes many cryptocurrency enthusiasts — will be able to travel abroad.Though the last year and a half have been quite a rough ride for pretty much everyone across the planet, there is no denying that the crypto industry has recently been on the receiving end of some insanely bullish market action, especially over the course of the last six to twelve months.To put things into perspective, since the start of 2021 alone, the total market capitalization of the digital asset sector has risen from approximately $780 billion to $2.4 trillion, exhibiting insane growth of over 200%. As a result, many crypto investors have seen their portfolios increase manyfold, giving them access to spare capital that they can use to take a much-deserved break.So, here is an outline of some of the top destinations that crypto HODLers can visit to unwind. The list takes into account factors such as the ease of visa procuration, internet accessibility and low COVID-19 infection rates.The picturesque island nation of the Bahamas has been a go-to holiday destination for many Americans and Canadians for decades now, thanks in large part to its proximity to the Americas. In fact, around 92% of all tourists visiting the West Indian nation are from either North or South America.As things stand, the Bahamas has a relatively low number of active COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, because the country already boasts of an infrastructural framework that is tailor-made for Westerners — i.e., high-speed internet and premium living locales — the Bahamas stands to be the perfect getaway for many tourists this summer.To enter, American passport holders can forgo testing — a requirement that is applicable for other visitors — if they are able to provide legitimate proof of vaccination. That said, before flying, they are required to fill out a simple “Travel Health Visa” application that can be processed online.Lastly, for crypto enthusiasts, it should be pointed out that the Bahamas was one of the first countries in the world to roll out its very own central bank digital currency, the Sand Dollar. In fact, it is the world’s first CBDC to go beyond a pilot phase and achieve an official launch. Moreover, regulators will be actively pushing to increase adoption of the CBDC this summer, so crypto participants traveling there could witness a historic event unfolding right before their eyes.Situated in the Mediterranean Sea, Cyprus is another island nation that draws in millions of tourists annually. One of the main reasons that hordes of visitors flock to the country is its incredible weather, with both the summer and winter months remaining mildly warm and dry when compared with other parts of Europe.Cyprus’ stance toward the crypto sector is quite friendly, despite the government recently warning its citizens against investing in Bitcoin (BTC). It is possible to convert various cryptocurrencies into local fiat via a number of exchanges that operate in the country, such as BitPanda and eToro, making it an ideal getaway for HODLers.To enter, travelers simply need to share their vaccination documents with the Cypriot government via its “Flight Pass” tool. That being said, it should be pointed out that as per the Cypriot government’s recent guidelines, even vaccinated travelers may be asked to take random tests during their stay.The southeastern European nation of Greece is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, attracting millions of people to its many islands across the Aegean and Ionian Seas.This is, in large part, due to the country boasting of some of the most scenic beaches in Europe — like the black sand beaches of Santorini — as well as some of the most elite party resorts in the world, which are situated primarily in and around Mykonos. For example, WorknParadise and Sweat Vacay are offering a five-day crypto escape on the island, combining morning yoga with networking, and panels on all things crypto into one experience. Furthermore, since it is possible to buy/sell/convert a wide array of cryptocurrencies in Greece using established platforms such as Coinbase and eToro, crypto holders have even more incentives to pay a visit to the country.In terms of traveling to the European nation, Greece has started opening its doors to American visitors who have gotten their recommended COVID-19 vaccine shots. However, it should be mentioned that in order to seamlessly enter the country, the second shot should have been administered at least two weeks prior to the trip. Travelers from all other nations are required to produce a COVID-19 negative test result upon arrival.Though many in the West may not be familiar with Georgia, as the nation is tightly wedged between Europe and Asia, the country boasts of a highly picturesque landscape and affords its travelers a high degree of safety. In fact, Tbilisi, Georgia’s capital, is consistently cited as one of the safest cities in the world.For crypto enthusiasts in particular, Georgia is an excellent travel destination, as it provides digital-asset owners with seamless access to multiple crypto-fiat gateways. In addition, individuals in Georgia are exempt from income tax on any profits received from the sale of cryptocurrencies. Not only that, but any crypto-to-fiat transactions are not subject to value-added tax (VAT). This includes the lari, Georgia’s fiat currency.To enter, travelers are required to furnish their COVID-19 vaccination records. Furthermore, U.S. residents who are not vaccinated are also allowed to enter, provided they have only traveled through certain nations and are carrying a negative test result with them.The tiny nation of Grenada is situated in the Caribbean and is the southernmost island in the Antilles archipelago. It offers unsoiled scenic landscapes and provides tourists with access to all of the amenities that they may be looking for in their ideal holiday destination.The local crypto market is unregulated at the moment, and crypto enthusiasts can make use of many prominent exchanges such as Binance, CEX.IO and Coinmama to seamlessly switch between various cryptocurrencies and the Eastern Caribbean dollar — the national currency of Grenada — making shopping and payments a breeze.Currently, the Grenadian government is allowing all vaccinated Americans to enter its borders. However, upon arrival, all entrants — even those who have been vaccinated — have to quarantine for 48 hours while officials conduct a COVID-19 test."
176,"Bitcoin (BTC) continues to look for direction, but as this occurred, Ether (ETH) and altcoins bounced higher from the Thursday sell-off. Dogecoin (DOGE) shocked investors with its 47% rally that kicked off after Coinbase announced that it would list DOGE in the coming months. DOGE’s price also rallied after Elon Musk tweeted that he was “working with Doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency. Potentially promising.”While many altcoins have seen double-digit gains during the recovery, the price of Bitcoin has continued to languish near the $50,000 level as whale wallets containing at least 1,000 BTC have declined by 4.7% compared to the previous month, indicating possible profit taking or a rotation into different assets.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that while the Bitcoin recovery has been muted, demand for Ether led to an 18% rally as the altcoin notched an intraday high at $4,173 on Friday.Gains in the top altcoin come amid mixed fundamental developments, with data from Glassnode showing that wallets holding at least 32 ETH have been steadily declining in recent months, which suggests that fewer people are interested in becoming “full validators” for the network’s upcoming proof-of-stake blockchain.While the debate about whether or not the market is officially experiencing an altseason rages on, one of its trademark characteristics is a sideways trading Bitcoin that leads to traders refocusing their attention on the altcoin market and leading to a decline in Bitcoin dominance.One of the breakout stars of 2021 is Polygon (MATIC), which has seen its price rally 60% over the past 24-hours to reach a new record high at $1.75.Another project whose price surged 45% from the lows on Thursday is iExec RLC (RLC), a decentralized cloud computing network that got a boost of adrenaline earlier in the week after Coinbase revealed that it would list the token.Other notable performances include an 80% increase in the price of Ergo (ERG) and a 48% increase in the price of Sora (XOR), which lifted the token’s price back above $800.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $2.307 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 40.3%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

177,"The energy consumed by mining — the process that keeps Bitcoin’s blockchain running — has been an increasingly popular topic of discussion in recent weeks.On Friday, CNBC posted an interview with SUKU CEO Yonathan Lapchik, during which he explained the Bitcoin mining scene as it relates to renewable energy. The interviewer noted Lapchik previously claimed that 75% of Bitcoin mining comes from renewable energy.“We think that 75% is an actual figure,” Lapchik told CNBC, “The miners are truly incentivized to use renewable energy."" Turning his thoughts to electric car-maker Tesla, which recently announced it would no longer accept Bitcoin for purchases due to environmental concerns, Lapchik said “It’s surprising that Elon didn’t consider that before getting into the space, before accepting Bitcoin as a payment mechanism for Tesla.”Tesla opened its doors to payments via Bitcoin by United States clientele back in March. The move went public following the car company’s purchase of $1.5 billion worth of BTC, announced in February.Musk, however, recently stated disapproval of the fossil fuel energy Bitcoin mining calls on, via a Tweet on Wednesday. He also discontinued payments to Tesla in BTC, albeit seemingly a temporary move until Bitcoin mining reaches satisfactory energy usage levels.“Really the data has been there forever,” Lapchik said of the 75% number. “We’ve been proving over and over and over that that’s a real case for miners in the Bitcoin network.”"
178,"Over the course of 2020 and 2021, Square bought over $200 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC). At present, the payments company does not anticipate picking up more of the asset, according to its chief financial officer, Amrita Ahuja. In an interview with Financial News published on Friday, Ahuja said: “We don’t have any plans at this point to make further purchases.” She added: “There’s no plans at this point to re-evaluate where we are from a treasury standpoint.""Cointelegraph reached out to Square for additional comments but did not receive a response in time for publication. In October 2020, Square announced buying $50 million worth of Bitcoin, which equated to 4,709 BTC, given the asset’s prices back then. In February, the company announced picking up $170 million worth of additional Bitcoin, which paid for roughly 3,318 coins.May has hosted sideways and downward price action from Bitcoin, although Square has still seen some significant profit from its BTC holdings. “In Square’s most recent quarterly earnings, published on 6 May, the company said it had lost $20m on its bitcoin investment despite its fair value rising to $472m based on market prices,” Financial News detailed.Square’s Bitcoin involvement does not stop at its purchasing of the asset, however. The company’s Cash App facilitates free Bitcoin transactions, unveiled in March, as per Square’s May 6 earnings document. Square’s Cash App also hosts Bitcoin trading.""Lots of other opportunities for [Square] to learn with bitcoin” exist, Ahuja told Financial News following her comments on the company’s stance on its Bitcoin holdings.She also said in the interview:Square’s CEO, Jack Dorsey, has spoken positively of Bitcoin on a number of occasions."
179,"The Crypto Fear and Greed Index has dipped to levels not seen since April 2020, indicating that traders are nervous about Tesla backtracking on accepting Bitcoin (BTC) payments, Bitcoin's multi-week technical weakness and U.S. regulator's supposed investigation into the business operations of Binance exchange. This nervousness also led to a massive inflow of 30,000 Bitcoin to the exchanges, the highest number since the March 2020 crash. This suggests some traders are booking profits on their long positions. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said that whales have continued to send more coins to exchanges than usual, implying that near-term bearishness may not be over yet.However, popular statistician Willy Woo believes that recovery after the Elon Dump has started and analyst William Clemente also painted a positive picture as he said that “Bitcoin held up very well” given the “largest day of exchange inflows since the March crash last year”.The short-term picture is uncertain with analysts divided in their opinions, but what does the long-term picture project? Let’s analyze the weekly charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin’s uptrend has been facing stiff resistance at the 100% Fibonacci extension level at $60,959.64. Although the bulls had pushed the price above this resistance, they could not sustain the breakout, indicating a lack of demand at higher levels.The BTC/USDT pair has formed a head and shoulders pattern, which will complete on a breakdown and close below the neckline. If that happens, the pair could drop toward the pattern target at $28,939, which is just above the 50-week simple moving average ($27,335).The 20-week exponential moving average ($47,444) is flattening out and the relative strength index (RSI) has formed a negative divergence, indicating signs of weakening momentum.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls drive the price above the $60,000 to $64,849.27 resistance zone. The pair could then rally to the 161.8% Fibonacci extension level at $80,803.39.Ether (ETH) has been in a strong uptrend but the large moves in the past two weeks indicate frenzied buying, which usually ends in a topping formation. The RSI has risen above 88, indicating the rally is over-extended in the short term.The bulls are likely to face stiff resistance in the zone between the 161.8% Fibonacci extension level at $4,052.21 and the all-time high at $4,374.67.If the price turns down from the current level, the ETH/USDT pair is likely to find strong support at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,195.98. Due to the uptrend, the bulls are likely to buy the dip and attempt to resume the up-move.If they succeed, the pair could rally to the psychological level at $5,000 and then to the 261.8% Fibonacci extension level at $5,759.94.Conversely, if the pair drops below $3,195.98, the next stop could be the 50% retracement level at $2,831.88 and then the 61.8% retracement level at $2,467.78.The uptrend in Binance Coin (BNB) has hit a wall at the 161.8% Fibonacci extension level at $680.03. However, the bulls are not willing to let go of their advantage as they have purchased the dip to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $513.45. This suggests the sentiment remains bullish.If the buyers can thrust and sustain the price above $680.03, the BNB/USDT pair could resume its uptrend toward the 200% Fibonacci extension level at $796.64 and then to the 261.8% extension level at $985.30.However, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance once again, the pair could witness profit-booking that may pull the price down to the 50% retracement level at $458.37 and then to the 61.8% retracement level at $403.29.Dogecoin (DOGE) has been in a strong uptrend for the past few weeks. The large weekly ranges show increased trader activity as both the bullish and bearish moves are exaggerated.The long wick on last week’s candlestick showed aggressive profit-booking at higher levels. However, the bears could not capitalize on the opportunity and keep the pair down as the bulls bought the dips this week, as seen from the long tail on the candlestick.When the bulls buy the dips and bears sell at resistance, the asset usually enters a range-bound action and the volatility drops. In this case, the DOGE/USDT pair may consolidate in a large range between $0.35 and $0.73 for the next few weeks.After a sharp up-move from $0.33 to $1.48, Cardano (ADA) had been range-bound between $1 and $1.48 for several weeks. A consolidation near the highs is a positive sign as it shows that traders are buying on dips and not dumping their positions on corrections.The ADA/USDT pair broke out of its consolidation phase last week, indicating that the bulls have overpowered the bears. The rally could now reach the 100% Fibonacci extension level at $2.14. If the bulls can thrust the price above this resistance, the next target is the 138.2% extension level at $2.60.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought territory, indicating that the bulls are in control. This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down and drops below the breakout level at $1.48. If that happens, the pair could drop to the 20-week EMA ($1.06).XRP spent considerable time trading between $0.21 and $0.78. Generally, the larger the time spent in a range, the stronger is the eventual breakout from it. When the price broke above $0.78, the altcoin soared to $1.96 within two weeks.However, vertical rallies are rarely sustainable and that is what happened. Since reaching a high of $1.96, the XRP/USDT pair has been witnessing volatile moves, which has resulted in the formation of a symmetrical triangle.After the large range moves of the past few weeks, the volatility is likely to drop and the pair may enter a tight range trading once again. The rising 20-week EMA and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest the bulls have the upper hand.If buyers thrust the price above $1.76, the pair may rally to $1.96 and then resume the uptrend that may reach $2.63. This positive view will invalidate if the price breaks below $1.20. This could pull the price down to $1 and then to the breakout level at $0.78.Polkadot (DOT) has been consolidating between $26.50 and $44 for the past few weeks. Several attempts by the bulls to resume the uptrend failed to attract buyers at higher levels. Due to that, the price again re-entered the range.However, the positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to drop below $26.50. This suggests accumulation at lower levels.If buyers propel the price above the $44 to $48.36 resistance zone, the DOT/USDT pair may resume its uptrend and march toward the target objective at $63.68. The rising 20-week EMA ($30) and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the bulls are in command.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the overhead resistance and plummets below $26.50. Such a move could signal the start of a downtrend.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been consistently making higher highs and higher lows for the past few months, indicating an uptrend. The altcoin has been facing profit-booking above $1,430 as seen from the long wick on the previous week and this week’s candlestick.However, a minor positive is that the bulls purchased the drop to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,113.61 this week. This suggests that traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.If the bulls can push the price above $1,430, the BCH/USDT pair could retest $1,638.08. A break above this resistance could start the next leg of the up-move that may reach $2,050.21.On the contrary, if the price turns down from $1,638.08, the pair may remain range-bound for a few weeks. The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $951.60.Litecoin (LTC) has been in a strong uptrend for the past few months and it has consistently stayed above the 20-week EMA ($219). The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the bulls have the upper hand.Last week, the bulls pushed the price above the 2017 high at $370, which is a positive sign. The bulls followed it up with a new all-time high at $412.76 this week but they could not sustain the higher levels and profit-booking set in.The LTC/USDT pair has again dipped below the breakout level of $370, suggesting the markets have rejected the breakout. If the price sustains below $370, the pair could gradually correct toward the 20-week EMA.A strong rebound off this support will suggest that bulls remain in control and the pair may then gradually move up to $370. A break below the 20-week EMA will suggest a change in trend.Uniswap (UNI) is in an uptrend and it has been trading inside an ascending channel for the past few weeks. Although the price had dipped to the support line of the channel this week, the long tail on the candlestick suggests aggressive buying at lower levels.If the buyers push the price above $45, the UNI/USDT pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach the resistance line of the channel at $56.50.A breakout and close above the channel could signal a pick up in the momentum and the next target objective is the 138.2% Fibonacci extension level at $68.89.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and plummets below the support line of the channel, the pair could drop to $25 and then to $16.84.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

180,"A tax authority in Argentina is reportedly looking to scrutinize operations involving cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC).Argentina’s Federal Administration of Public Income, or AFIP, has ordered domestic crypto exchanges and payment firms to provide monthly reports of all kinds of operations by users on their platforms, local news agency Buenos Aires Económico reports Tuesday.In a notice to local crypto firms, the authority asked virtual currency service providers to maintain regular lists of all user accounts and identity verifications of clients, as well as their income, expenses, and monthly balance. The AFIP reportedly cited an information regime form 8126 comprising data about administration and intermediation of virtual accounts, virtual wallets, investment and financing.The report stresses that the AFIP’s crypto regulation relates not only to cryptocurrency exchanges but also payment processors including popular crypto-friendly payment application Mercado Pago. Companies will have to file all necessary information each month by the 15th of the following month, the report notes.The news comes against the backdrop of the crypto industry booming in Argentina amid the country’s economic downturn, inflation, and the massive devaluation of the Argentine peso. In late April, Mercado Libre, the largest Latin American online marketplace, launched a real estate section dedicated to crypto, potentially ushering a new wave of crypto adoption in its top three markets, Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico. Previously, local digital asset company Ripio acquired major Brazilian crypto exchange BitcoinTrade.Argentina’s regulators have been paying closer attention to the crypto industry recently. In early April, the Central Bank of Argentina reportedly asked domestic banks to forward them information about its customers dealing with Bitcoin. In late 2020, Argentine congressman Ignacio Torres announced plans to introduce a cryptocurrency-related bill in the Argentine Parliament."
181,"As Bitcoin looks to recover on Friday from a stomach-churning dip on the back of a strong bid, on-chain data indicates that high-net-worth ""whale"" wallets may not be part of the effort. Bitcoin (BTC) — along with most crypto markets — suffered a staggering series of losses this week following a string of negative tweets from the world’s second-richest man, Elon Musk.Tesla & Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/YSswJmVZhPWhile prices have begun to rebound, “whale” wallets — a playful term for Bitcoin addresses with 1,000 or more BTC — have nonetheless been dwindling in the midst of the dip, indicating that big money players are moving into risk-off mode. According to data from Glassnode, the total number of wallets with 1,000 BTC or more clocks in at just over 2,100 addresses — down nearly 4.7% from the month prior, and down from nearly 2,500 in February.However, tracking whale wallet behaviors as an indicator of possible price movements has been an exercise in mixed signals as of late. Perma-bull MicroStrategy added another 271 BTC to its corporate treasury this week, raising its total number of BTC to 91,850 — a stockpile worth over $4.7 billion at today’s prices. However, exchange inflows — often a sign that whales and other investors are selling BTC — hit 30,000 coins last week as well, though experts say the price managed to withstand the pressure well.One key metric, however, is inarguably flashing bearish signs. Analysis last month showed that whales and sellers have continued to offload BTC, despite failing to make profit on their trades. This could indicate that sell-side pressure may lead to a breakdown in price for BTC. "
182,"Beams of light flashing out of a person’s eyes are not an uncommon sight in the world of comic books and superhero movies. In recent months, however, these so-called “laser eyes” have been making the news, not because of a movie or web series, but because of Bitcoin (BTC). To be more specific, an increasing number of celebrities, tech entrepreneurs and media personalities have been adding laser eyes to their profile pictures. This is a symbolic way of showcasing their bullish outlook for BTC and the crypto market in general.While the origin of the meme is unclear, most point toward the suggestion that the idea behind laser eyes, at least upon its inception, was to help spur the flagship cryptocurrency’s value all the way up to the $100,000 mark by the end of 2021. Since then, the meaning of the meme has changed, with it now being a way of showing one’s support for the crypto sector.Below are some of the biggest names who have recently adopted this trend, increasing the overall visibility of the digital asset industry.Widely considered to be the greatest football player of all time, Tom Brady has continued to defy time while getting better with each passing year. At his ripe old age of 43, he just won his seventh Super Bowl, showcasing that age is really just a number.In addition to his amazing sporting pursuits, Brady is also known to be an avid financial investor — something that recently led the legendary quarterback to adopt the laser eyes photo. As soon as he did this, many people claimed that the sports star had become the latest big-name celebrity to acquire a sizable sum of Bitcoin.It’s also worth noting that this development came less than a day after Blockworks co-founder Jason Yanowitz challenged Brady to update his picture. Just last month, the National Football League star announced he would be backing an all-new NFT platform called Autograph.As the name seems to quite clearly imply, the project will serve as a marketplace where investors can buy officially licensed digital collectibles backed by some of the biggest names in the world of sports and entertainment.Michael Saylor has got to be one of the most obvious names on this list. This is because as of May 14, his company MicroStrategy — an enterprise business intelligence application software vendor — has under its possession a total of 91,850 Bitcoins (acquired at an aggregate purchase price of $2.24 billion).Upon changing his profile photo, Saylor went on to claim that by making the move, he was making his intentions clear that he sees Bitcoin as an instrument of economic empowerment and change. “Laser eyes proclaim a technology to guarantee the human rights of life, liberty and property,” he added.Before Kim Kardashian came along, Paris Hilton was widely recognized as being the biggest celebrity on planet Earth. However, despite her popularity waning a little over the last decade or so, Hilton, who is an heiress to the Hilton hotel empire, still carries with her approximately 17 million followers on Twitter.From minting nonfungible tokens to generally being quite active within the crypto sector, Hilton has pushed to become an unexpected flag bearer for this rapidly evolving industry. During the first week of April, she adopted the laser eyes meme as a means of showcasing her growing support for Bitcoin.Tesla CEO Elon Musk broke many crypto-loving hearts on May 13 when he announced that Tesla would cease accepting Bitcoin for its cars due to the environmental impact from mining. But he was still a part of this bullish crypto trend.On Feb. 20, Bitcoin was trading at a relatively stable price point of around $51,700, when Musk — aka “Dogefather” — changed his Twitter profile picture to the laser eyes meme, while adding the following note: “Just for a day.”As expected, within just 48 hours of Musk making this move, the value of Bitcoin started soaring, climbing up to a relative high of around $58,000.Earlier this year, Tesla announced that the company was going to invest some $1.5 billion into BTC. The result of this news sent shockwaves across the global financial landscape, helping spur the value of BTC from $38,000 to $43,000 within a matter of minutes.Though criticized for being a bandwagoner when it comes to adopting crypto trends, the first woman to represent Wyoming in the Senate, Senator Cynthia Lummis tweeted in February that she was also going to be adopting the laser eyes photo for a day, showcasing her support for Bitcoin, which she referred to as being a “sound” form of money.In recent years, Caitlin Long’s crypto resume has become legendary. From leading Wyoming’s Blockchain Task Force between 2018 and 2019 to being named the #8 person of the year in Cointelegraph’s top 100 in 2021, Long is widely considered to be a pioneer within the crypto industry, and the laser eyes on her Twitter profile indicate that she is indeed a believer.The founders of cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, both Tyler and Cameron have been quite vocal about their support for the crypto industry as a whole. The brothers recently changed their profile pictures to ones depicting the laser eyes meme earlier this year, adding more fuel to an already raging fire.Can this symbolic photo change actually help spur global crypto adoption? Nick Rose, CEO of Ethernity — a digital art marketplace designed to produce authenticated nonfungible tokens — told Cointelegraph that celebrities entering this space is fantastic for the market, adding: “Widespread adoption is still to come. I can’t wait to see the authenticated NFT market in five or even 10 years or more. I have already spoken to Tom Brady’s team — they are onto something.”Similarly, Antoni Trenchev, managing partner for crypto lending platform Nexo, told Cointelegraph that crypto is currently the place for all major movers and shakers to “see and be seen” — much like how New York City was back in the 1960s, “ungovernable but never boring.”Nick Spanos, co-founder of Zap Protocol — an open platform for creating, sharing and monetizing deterministic oracles from data feeds — believes that while in the past, crypto may have been viewed by many as being some nerdy, obscure kind of video game money. With more celebrities now endorsing this asset class, it can help in forging a path of financial liberation for many investors, he added: “Game-changing ideas spread today through TikTok, memes and profile photo frames — not just through traditional media on cable TV.”Though many are hyped about the fact that celebrities and influencers are showcasing their support for the industry with each passing day, Rick Heffernan, head of business development at the Utopia Genesis Foundation — a blockchain-powered music data platform — believes that celebrities dipping their toes in this space should be viewed with a certain degree of caution:By and large, 2021 has been a pivotal year for crypto thanks in large part to all of the attention received by the NFT and decentralized finance markets. According to Heffernan, it now remains to be seen whether adoption will increase at a rapid rate in the near to mid-term, especially as many altcoins are continuing to garner an increasing amount of momentum, taking some of the spotlight away from Bitcoin."
183,"A city in North Dakota is joining the cryptocurrency adoption race in the United States by starting to accept crypto payments.Hercules Cummings, finance director for the City of Williston, announced Thursday that the city administration has partnered with crypto payment firm BitPay to start accepting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) as payment for utility bills.“We have partnered with BitPay, the largest virtual payment merchant whose partners include Microsoft and Facebook. We are the first municipality in the State of North Dakota, and the third in the nation, to offer this service,” the city executive stated.Utility bill payments will be the only bills eligible for crypto payment initially, Cummings said, adding that the city will conduct quality assessments to expand the new payment method for bills like licenses, landfill and permits. The new payment method is in line with the city’s commitment to explore more payment methods to keep pace with existing payment alternatives and enable contactless payments.“There are also a number of advantages to utilizing these online payment methods including security, convenience, and cost savings,” Cummings noted. According to the announcement, BitPay charges a 1% fee to pay utility bills online, versus a 3% commission for payments via services like Google Pay, Apple Pay and PayPal.Williston residents can visit the official city website and provide their account information to receive a BitPay invoice. Individuals can create a digital wallet for payments directly with BitPay or other services like crypto exchanges, the announcement notes.Several states in the U.S. are currently considering crypto-friendly legislation. Earlier this week, Nebraska lawmakers favored an initiative that would allow state banks to handle crypto. The mayor of Jackson, Tennessee initiated a campaign to pay public salaries in Bitcoin and mine the cryptocurrencies for the city's balance sheets, echoing similar proposals in Miami, Florida.According to data collected by Newsweek magazine, as many as 46 million Americans, or 17% of all U.S. adults, own Bitcoin as of May 2021. A survey by crypto exchange Gemini previously estimated that just 14% of the U.S. population, or about 21 million adults, owned crypto as of late 2020."
184,"Turkish customs enforcements brought down an illegal smuggling operation in what is said to be a record bust against illegal Bitcoin (BTC) mining equipment in the country. After receiving a tip, Turkey’s Customs Protection’s anti-smuggling and intelligence teams raided a warehouse earlier this week in Karabağlar, İzmir, where they found 501 ASIC Bitcoin mining rigs in closed cardboard boxes. Customs enforcement reported the estimated value of the seized equipment at 5 million Turkish liras, or $600,000. Four suspects were detained as part of the investigation. Reports claim that law enforcement is carrying out another active operation in İstanbul, the biggest city and a major customs checkpoint in Turkey.Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, or ASICs, are the most popular way to mine Bitcoin, but they are also known for their high electricity usage, a widely known issue that has caused Elon Musk to pull back on his decision to accept Bitcoin payments for Tesla cars.Once known as a crypto-friendly country, Turkey has recently stepped up its monitoring of crypto frauds and transactions. Last month, Turkish crypto exchange Thodex halted operations with over $150-million missing, rendering thousands of users unable to access their funds.Shortly after Turkish police detained 62 suspects in the Thodex investigation, another local exchange, Vebitcoin, shut down in the same manner.More recently, the Turkish Minister of Treasury and Finance Lütfi Elvan announced that the Financial Crimes Investigation Board, or MASAK, has full authority to audit and oversee crypto exchanges. As a countermeasure for fraud and illegal money trafficking, any crypto exchange with a presence in Turkey is now obliged to inform MASAK about crypto transactions over 10,000 Turkish liras ($1,200).Local blockchain and crypto experts agree that Turkey needs a clear regulatory framework to prevent fraud in the ecosystem."
185,"DBS Private Bank, one of the biggest wealth managers in Asia outside China, has launched a cryptocurrency trust solution amid growing demand for digital assets.After setting up its own crypto exchange in December 2020, the Singaporean banking giant is now expanding its crypto services via its wholly-owned trust company DBS Trustee, The Business Times reports Friday.The new crypto trust solution allows the company’s private banking clients to invest, custody and manage cryptocurrencies. The trust offering supports four cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP, and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which are the sole digital assets hosted on the DBS Digital Exchange.“Our trust structure allows clients to conveniently hold these assets, with a peace of mind that they will be safely managed and passed on to their intended beneficiaries,” DBS Private Bank group head Joseph Poon said. He said that more clients have expressed interest in investing in crypto or already invested in digital assets. “We expect this trend to accelerate as cryptocurrencies turn more mainstream,” Poon noted.DBS’ newly launched crypto trust solution comes shortly after the company recorded tenfold volume growth on its cryptocurrency exchange in the first quarter of 2021. As part of its further crypto-related plans, DBS is looking to host a security token offering in the second quarter of 2021. The bank is also working with investment bank JPMorgan and state investment firm Temasek to improve cross-border payments via a new blockchain venture.Amid growing demand for digital asset exposure, a number of major global banks have moved into the crypto industry this year. Last month, Morgan Stanley added Bitcoin exposure to 12 investment funds after announcing plans to offer crypto services to wealthy clients in March. Major investment bank Goldman Sachs also confirmed its plans to offer crypto-assets to investors starting in Q2 2021. "
186,"Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoin traders are more nervous than any time in over a year as a classic sentiment gauge signals “fear” is driving the market.According to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, cryptocurrency traders have not had such cold feet about the market climate since April 2020.Fear & Greed uses a basket of factors to determine overriding sentiment among market participants and, therefore, where the market itself is likely headed.Price volatility can produce considerable shifts in its readings — just four days ago, on Monday, the Index measured 72/100, corresponding to “greed” being at the heart of sentiment.Fast forward to Friday, and a completely different picture is apparent after Tesla rejected Bitcoin for alleged environmental damage and major exchange Binance sees attention from regulators. At the time of writing, Fear & Greed measured just 26/100 — firmly within the “fear” zone and bordering “extreme fear.”The last time that the Index was so low was just weeks after the cross-asset crash that sent BTC/USD to $3,600.As Cointelegraph reported, however, this time around, Bitcoin appears to have weathered the storm, performing “very well” against an onslaught of sellers and trader liquidations.“If the stock market can shrug off a global pandemic, I’m sure Bitcoin can survive a tweet,” popular trader Scott Melker summarized.Analysts have already highlighted signs of a rebound setting in for Bitcoin, while certain large-cap altcoins managed to avoid the dip altogether.“The Elon Dump now in recovery,” statistician Willy Woo declared to Twitter followers on Thursday.Woo highlighted inflows to exchanges turning to outflows as traders likely either bought the dip or bought back in after selling.At the same time, stablecoin balances across exchanges continue on their own uptrend, providing huge potential liquidity should a bullish phase reenter crypto markets.Rafael Schultze-Kraft, co-founder of on-chain analytics resource Glassnode, also noted that funding rates had reverted to their behavior from before the dip.“That was quick: funding rates flipped positive again. Longs are back to paying shorts,” he commented on an accompanying chart."
187,"The founder of one of the first physical cryptocurrency exchanges has slammed what he perceives as hypocrisy on the part of Elon Musk after the Tesla CEO announced the electric car firm would stop accepting Bitcoin (BTC) as a form of payment.The charges of hypocrisy leveled at Musk stem from the fact that around $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin remains on Tesla’s balance sheet.Musk criticized Bitcoin’s energy consumption in a recent tweet where he announced that Tesla had suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. The sudden reversal by Musk comes just six weeks after Tesla made big news by announcing it would accept Bitcoin payments from customers in the United State.But according to Nick Spanos, founder of Bitcoin Center in NYC and co-founder of Zap Protocol, the presence of over $1 billion worth of Bitcoin on Tesla’s balance sheet means Musk is still willing to reap the profits of what he deems a dirty environmental hazard. Spanos told Cointelegraph:“I challenge Elon that if Bitcoin is too dirty for him to accept as payment for his electric vehicles, then it should also be too dirty to ‘hodl’ for profits based on everyone else using it.”“At least Climate Czar John Kerry divested from his millions in the oil industry before taking his position of virtue,” Spanos added, referring to the U.S. politician’s sale of millions of dollars worth of oil stocks prior to becoming Joe Biden’s Special Presidential Envoy for Climate.One quandary posed by Spanos was the idea that if Elon Musk was truly concerned about the environment, he would allow the trade of “dirty” coins in return for clean cars. Spanos said:“Curiously, Elon wants to deny green-conscious consumers the ability to trade their supposedly dirty coin for a clean car. That seems counterproductive.”“A huge component of Bitcoin’s power consumption is sustainable due to the reactivation and construction of new hydroelectric sources,” reminded Spanos, hinting at the rise of renewable energy sources, which some studies estimate account for over 70% of crypto mining.Spanos referenced the attention brought on Musk by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission when he was deemed to have manipulated Tesla share prices with irresponsible and ill-considered tweets.Is Musk now subjecting Bitcoin and Dogecoin (DOGE) to the same slings and arrows of outrageous fortune that befall a cryptocurrency when a world-renowned billionaire decides to take an interest in it? Spanos asked:“Maybe, like with his DOGE-for-Tesla tease, this is all contrived to manipulate Bitcoin’s price. Didn’t he get into trouble for manipulation of Tesla share prices?”Dogecoin proved reactive to Musk’s tweets again on Friday after the Tesla CEO revealed he was working with developers to improve the transactional efficiency of the meme coin blockchain. DOGE’s price jumped 26% in the immediate aftermath of the tweet."
188,"Bitcoin (BTC) has performed “very well” as traders have been sending more coins to exchanges than at any time since the March 2020 crash.Data from on-chain monitoring resources CryptoQuant and Glassnode shows that BTC exchange inflows hit a one-year high on Thursday.Bitcoin saw intense pressure from sellers this week as multiple news triggers combined to turn many bearish.Tesla abandoning BTC payments followed by rumors of an investigation of major exchange Binance by United States regulators was enough to send BTC/USD to lows of $46,000 before stabilizing.As Cointelegraph reported, the dip could have been considerably worse, with longer-term price features providing support at crucial levels.Nonetheless, $50,000 remains out of reach at the time of writing, as hodlers lick their wounds and assess Bitcoin’s likely next move.Data tracking trader behavior reveals the scale of the sell-off and likewise suggests that Bitcoin, in fact, weathered the storm rather well.Inflows to exchanges hit 30,000 BTC ($1.47 billion) on Thursday, while liquidations totaled $200 million in just one 10-minute period during the height of the price volatility.“Yesterday was the largest day of exchange inflows since the March crash last year,” analyst William Clemente summarized on Friday.Inflows to exchanges reflect the desire to sell BTC at short notice. Some may not divest themselves of their holdings for cash but rather take a stablecoin position and then buy back in once prices stabilize. As such, outflows may soon begin to rise, as panicky investors join those “buying the dip.”Continuing the analysis, however, Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, highlighted whales still sending coins to exchanges more than usual as a potential sign that the bearish phase is not yet over for good.“If you’re a derivative trader, be careful in the short term. (Relatively speaking) whales are depositing $BTC to exchanges,” he told Twitter followers."
189,"This weekly roundup of news from Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong attempts to curate the industry’s most important news, including influential projects, changes in the regulatory landscape and enterprise blockchain integrations.Feed Every Gorilla (FEG) was a source of drama after memes were posted of Chinese President Xi Jinping. The token claims to use its revenue to take care of gorillas and had been gaining attention among animal-related tokens, amassing a market cap of over $1 billion. Some Chinese community members found the memes offensive and, after not finding support from the team, began to abandon the project. The incident went viral, and Chinese centralized exchanges, including OKEx and Gate.io, responded by delisting the token. FEG's price dropped around 75% before rebounding slightly on Thursday.The community became divided, with one side claiming Chinese censorship was being forced upon the cryptocurrency community. In all likelihood, the decision to delist the token was more out of caution than outrage, as cryptocurrency exchanges operating in a legal gray area often find it advantageous to avoid being associated with scandal and controversy.Algorand uploaded a webinar on China’s progress in the central bank digital currency (CBDC) space on Thursday. The event was hosted by China’s Blockchain-based Service Network and included Algorand Foundation CEO Sean Lee, Tezos’s David Shin and Charles d'Haussy from ConsenSys. All the panelists spoke positively about the approach China has taken with CBDCs, focusing on the marketing and incentivization that has lead to pilots being run with banks, businesses and tech companies all over the region.While discussing the challenges of rolling out a CBDC, the panelists also contrasted the public style of the digital yuan's development with that of the United States. Shin suggested that despite a lack of publicity, the administration of Joe Biden has been briefed on the progress of other nations in this space, and he hinted that the U.S. might not be as passive as it seems. The U.S. dollar holds a strong position over other national currencies, allowing the U.S. more flexibility and patience in how it deploys new technologies, as there is less pressure to make the first move. China, on the other hand, has a lot more to gain by increasing the utilization of the yuan in international scenarios.As Cointelegraph reported, Alipay is also allowing users to get involved with the CBDC tests. The financial services app has been playing an early role in testing, but this is one of the first indications that retail users might soon be able to get their hands on the digital yuan directly via the app. On Thursday, Cointelegraph also reported that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority gave the green light to continue testing the digital yuan for cross-border payments.Babel Finance, one of the largest crypto institutions in China, announced the completion of its $40 million Series A fundraising round. The company offers lending, trading and other financial services to institutions and high-net-worth individuals, making it an important part of the Chinese investment ecosystem. The round included contributions from Zoo Capital, Sequoia Capital China, Dragonfly Capital, BAI Capital and Tiger Global Management.Large commercial institution China Citic Bank announced that accounts at the bank could not be used to trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). It listed a number of reasons, including guarding against money laundering, defending the legal tender status of the yuan and protecting the social public property rights."
190,"Cryptocurrency price corrected sharply today, including Ether (ETH), but this is a short-term move which is not reflective of the more macro-level events which still paint a bullish picture for assets like Ether and Bitcoin.In the last 30 days, Ether price gained 96%, moving from $2,138 to $4,200 on May 11. Normally the assumption would be that every trader is consumed with euphoria and this would be seen in the funding rate reaching record highs on Ether futures contracts but at the moment this is not the case.The funding rate appears to have flatlined on April 18 and at the moment it seems that there's nothing that can be done to re-ignite buyers' leverage.Take notice of how the cost for longs (buyers) to carry open positions on Feb. 20 reached 0.20% per 8-hour, equivalent to 4.3% per week. A 74% price hike in 30 days fueled that situation as Ether tried to break the $2,000 resistance.More recently, a similar situation took place on April 3 after Ether rallied 43% to a $2,150 all-time high. Movements like these typically mark retail traders' excessive use of leverage. Meanwhile, whales and arbitrage desks open longs using the fixed-month future contracts to avoid the funding rate oscillations.The 19% negative price swing on April 17 caused $1 billion long futures contracts liquidations. That event crushed bulls' morale also impacted their confidence in building leveraged-long positions.Typically retail traders are more inclined to take a longer time to recover from unexpected losses, but this time around, pro traders also lack conviction despite the rally.The top traders' long-to-short net positioning is calculated by analyzing the consolidated positions on the spot, perpetual and futures contracts, providing a clearer view of whether professional traders are leaning bullish or bearish.With this in mind, there are occasional discrepancies in the methodologies between different exchanges, so viewers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.Despite the $4,380 all-time high on May 12, these top traders are nowhere near the highest long-to-short ratio. OKEx presents the most drastic change as the indicator reached 0.97 on April 18 and has since declined to 0.50, meaning top traders are 2:1 net short.Binance top traders long-to-short oscillated between 0.86 and 0.95 over the past thirty days, and the indicator currently stands at 0.89. That should be interpreted as a 'neutral' position, which seems odd considering the 96% rally during this period.Lastly, Huobi's top traders' leverage indicator peaked on May 4 at 1.00, indicating a balanced situation between longs and shorts. However, it currently stands at 0.95, therefore signaling a lack of excitement.It's no secret that Bitcoin (BTC) movements dictate traders' general feelings, even if it means cheering for its price to stabilize near $55,000.#BTC

191,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted on May 13 that the company will stop accepting Bitcoin (BTC) payments for its vehicle purchases, citing “rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal.”  Shortly after the announcement, Bitcoin price dropped by 17% to hit a new local low at $46,000.While Musk’s decision is a short-term blow to the sentiment of the market, it is unlikely to change the course of the crypto markets altogether because the institutional demand for cryptocurrencies remains high. Proof of this came yesterday as Cowen Inc., a 103-year-old bank, announced that it had partnered with Standard Custody and Trust Co. to enter the crypto custody business.Another indication of increasing institutional interest in crypto is the sharp rise in “crypto under the custody” of Gemini crypto exchange. The Winklevoss twins’ led exchange now has $30 billion worth of crypto under custody.The long-term picture for cryptocurrencies remains strong but the short-term price fluctuations may cause large drawdowns to portfolios. Hence, traders should watch the price action closely and follow their trading rules without getting sucked into trades driven by emotions.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the trends and the path of least resistance for the next move.Bitcoin has formed a bearish head and shoulders pattern, which will complete on a breakdown and close below the neckline of the setup. The sharp fall on May 12 and today had pulled the price down to the neckline but the bulls are attempting to defend the support.However, the 20-day exponential moving average ($54,958) has started to turn down and the relative strength index (RSI) has dipped into the negative zone, indicating the bears have the upper hand.If the price breaks below the neckline, the H&S setup will complete. This pattern has a target objective at $31,653.73. However, it may not be a straight dash lower as the bulls will try to stall the decline at $42,500 and then $40,000.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls sustain the price above $46,985, the BTC/USDT pair could rally to $52,323,21 where the bears are again likely to mount a stiff resistance.Ether (ETH) formed a bearish engulfing pattern on May 12 as the price reversed direction after hitting a new all-time high at $4,374.67. However, the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests the sentiment remains positive and bulls are buying the dips.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought zone, suggesting that bulls are in control. The buyers will now try to push the price above the all-time high. If they succeed, the ETH/USDT pair may rally to $5,000 and then $5,723.66.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($3,348), it will suggest that supply exceeds demand. That could pull the price down to $3,000 and then the 50-day simple moving average ($2,552).Binance Coin (BNB) is facing strong resistance near the $680 level. Repeated failures to rise and sustain above this level may have attracted profit-booking from short-term traders on May 12, which pulled the price below the 20-day EMA ($593).However, the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests strong buying at lower levels. If the bulls push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the BNB/USDT pair may retest the $680 resistance.A break and close above the resistance could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $771. Conversely, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may gradually drop to the 50-day SMA ($496) and then $440.After sustaining above the breakout level at $1.48 since May 6, Cardano (ADA) has broken out of the $1.83 overhead resistance. This suggests the bulls have overpowered the bears and the uptrend has resumed.The rising 20-day EMA ($1.52) and the RSI above 66 suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the bulls can sustain the price above $1.83, the ADA/USDT pair could rally to the next target objective at $2.25.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below $1.83, the pair may extend its range-bound action for a few more days. A break and close below $1.48 will suggest that the bears have overpowered the bulls and the pair may then drop to the 50-day SMA ($1.32).Dogecoin (DOGE) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($0.43) on May 11 but the higher levels met with selling pressure as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick. The selling resumed on May 12 and the bears pulled the price below the 20-day EMA.The buyers are attempting to defend the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.38 but they are facing stiff resistance at $0.45. If the price turns down and plummets below $0.35, the DOGE/USDT pair may drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.25).Alternatively, if the price rebounds off the current level and rises above $0.45, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The pair may then rise to $0.55 where the bulls are likely to encounter stiff resistance. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair may consolidate between $0.45 and $0.55 for a few days.The bulls failed to sustain XRP above the downtrend line for the past few days, indicating strong resistance by the bears. That may have resulted in short-term traders dumping their positions, pulling the price down to the 50-day SMA ($1.20).If the price rebounds off the 50-day SMA, the bulls will again try to push the XRP/USDT pair above the downtrend line and the overhead resistance at $1.66. If they manage to do that, the pair could retest the 52-week high at $1.96.However, the 20-day EMA ($1.41) has started to turn down and the RSI is trading in the negative zone, suggesting a minor advantage to the bears. If the sellers can sink and sustain the price below the 50-day SMA, the pair may decline to $1.01 and then $0.88.Polkadot (DOT) has repeatedly failed to break above the $42.28 overhead resistance, suggesting the bears are defending the level aggressively. However, the bulls continue to buy at lower levels as they have not allowed the price to sustain below $32.50.The flat moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint indicate the DOT/USDT pair could remain stuck between $32.50 and $42.28 for a few more days.A breakout and close above $42.28 could push the price to an all-time high at $48.36. This level may again act as stiff resistance but if the bulls drive the price above it, the pair may resume its uptrend toward the target objective at $58.06.Alternatively, if the bears sink the price below $32.50, the pair may drop to $26.50. A strong bounce off this level will suggest the pair may extend its stay inside the large $26.50 to $42.28 range for a few more days. A break below $26.50 could suggest the start of a new downtrend.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) rose to a new 52-week high at $1,638.08 on May 12 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. That resulted in aggressive profit-booking by traders, pulling the price down to the 20-day EMA ($1,213).The bearish engulfing candlestick pattern on May 12 suggests a possible trend reversal. If the bears can break and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USDT pair could drop to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,054.41 and then to the 50-day SMA ($867).Contrary to this assumption, if the price recovers and sustains above $1,213.51, the pair may enter a range-bound action for a few days. The flattening 20-day EMA and the RSI just above the midpoint also suggest a few days of consolidation.Litecoin’s (LTC) failure to sustain above the resistance line of the ascending broadening wedge formation on May 12 could have attracted strong selling by traders. That dragged the price down to the 20-day EMA ($313).If the bears sustain the price below $300, the LTC/USDT pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($260) and then to the support line of the wedge. A break below the wedge could signal the start of a new downtrend.On the contrary, if the bulls sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may attempt a recovery, which is likely to face stiff resistance near $340. A break above the resistance line of the wedge will suggest that the correction has ended.Uniswap (UNI) continues to trade inside an ascending channel. The bears pulled the price below the 20-day EMA ($38.35) on May 10 but they could not break the 50-day SMA ($34.50) support, which shows buying at lower levels.The bulls tried to resume the up-move on May 12 but they could not sustain the higher levels as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick. This indicates traders are selling their positions on rallies.Buying near the 50-day SMA and selling at higher levels suggests a range-bound action for a few days. The next trending move may start if the bulls push and sustain the price above $45. Conversely, a break below the support line of the channel could start a new downtrend.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

192,"MicroStrategy, a Virginia-based business intelligence firm, has added another 271 Bitcoin (BTC) to its strategic reserves, underscoring CEO Michael Saylor’s growing conviction in the digital asset. The purchases were made through May 13 for an average price of $55,387, Saylor disclosed on Thursday. MicroStrategy now has 91,850 BTC on its books for an average purchase price of $24,403.MicroStrategy has purchased an additional 271 bitcoins for $15.0 million in cash at an average price of ~$55,387 per #bitcoin.

Saylor indicated in February that he doesn’t intend to slow the rate of his company’s BTC purchasing as he snatched up another $1 billion worth of the digital asset.MicroStrategy sits atop the Bitcoin corporate treasuries list, accounting for 0.437% of the asset’s circulating supply.MicroStrategy is acquiring Bitcoin on the premise that the digital asset is a dependable store of value in the face of systemic dollar debasement. It has gone as far as issuing debt to expand its Bitcoin portfolio.The United States’ M2 money supply has exploded since the 2008 financial crisis and, more recently, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since February 2020, the money supply has expanded nearly 30% to $19.896 trillion, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. To put that in perspective, the year-over-year increase in the M2 money supply had never exceeded 15% until 2020."
193,"Within the last hour, Bitcoin's (BTC) price dropped by more than 3%, extending the decline that started on May 12 and saw the digital asset drop as low as $46,000 on some exchanges.Initially, it was Tesla’s May 12 announcement that it would stop accepting Bitcoin as payment over environmental concerns, along with technical weakness and a nearly complete head-and-shoulders technical pattern, that pushed BTC's price down to $46,000.May 13’s bearish catalyst appears to be a Bloomberg Tax report claiming that the United States Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service are investigating Binance Holdings Ltd. for alleged “illicit activity.”While the investigation is unconfirmed at this moment, as the news broke, Bitcoin's price quickly dropped by more than $3,000 and currently trades at $47,300.From the viewpoint of technical analysis, the bearish head-and-shoulders pattern is now confirmed, and barring a bounce off the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $42,600, traders may look for BTC's price to restest the $40,000 level as support. Below this, there is the 200-day moving average at $39,000, and in a worst-case scenario, $35,000 is the target of the head-and-shoulders pattern.Bitcoin's price may be revisiting multimonth lows, but a quick glance through Crypto Twitter shows that most traders view the current pullback as a ""buy the dip"" opportunity, including Micheal Saylor, who on May 13 tweeted that MicroStrategy bought another 271 BTC at an average price of $55,387.MicroStrategy has purchased an additional 271 bitcoins for $15.0 million in cash at an average price of ~$55,387 per #bitcoin.

194,"Billionaire investor Mark Cuban will not be following in Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s footsteps in withdrawing support for Bitcoin (BTC) payment.Tweeting in response to Musk on Wednesday, the Dallas Mavericks owner remarked that the Mavs will continue to accept Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE) as payment means for tickets and merchandise items.We at https://t.co/VUydpLFzGh will continue to accept BTC/Eth/Doge because we know that replacing Gold as a store of value will help the environment https://t.co/bs7NvnJY8A and https://t.co/ELhbuLOBRV shrinking big bank and coin usage will benefit society and the environment https://t.co/zu08F0STEQ“We know that replacing gold as a store of value will help the environment,” Cuban opined, adding: “Shrinking big bank and coin usage will benefit society and the environment.”On Wednesday, Musk released a statement announcing that Tesla will no longer accept Bitcoin payments on account of the carbon footprint associated with BTC mining. Musk’s announcement likely triggered a significant market correction, with Bitcoin dipping below $50,000 and the entire crypto market capitalization shedding over 10%.The Tesla CEO has also doubled down on his Bitcoin mining energy concerns with a follow-up tweet on Thursday morning alluding to energy usage trends, which Musk characterized as “insane.”Energy usage trend over past few months is insane https://t.co/E6o9s87trw pic.twitter.com/bmv9wotwKeBitcoin mining energy consumption continues to be a subject of debate as well as a popular narrative for BTC critics who often espouse the “ocean boiling narrative.” However, several Bitcoin backers dispute these arguments stating that miners are buyers of last resort for renewable energy producers.Musk abandoning Bitcoin payments for Tesla also coincides with the company’s carbon credit aspirations. According to a report by Reuters on Wednesday, the electronic vehicle manufacturing giant is among one of eight firms with pending applications at the United States Environmental Protection Agency.Back in April, U.S. President Joe Biden set a 2030 net-zero emission goal likely making the multi-billion-dollar U.S. carbon credit market all the more enticing for companies like Tesla. The global carbon credit market reportedly grew 20% in 2020 to reach $272 billion, according to data from financial analysis firm Refinitive."
195,"Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $50,000 again on Thursday as the fallout from Elon Musk’s criticism continued to resonate.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView confirmed BTC/USD failing to establish $50,000 as support after initially dipping to $45,650.Musk, speaking as CEO of Tesla, had claimed that environmental concerns meant that the company would no longer accept BTC payments. After a three-hour slow crash, BTC/USD then rebounded to near $52,000 before losing steam once more. At the time of writing, the pair traded at around $49,500 amid heavy volatility. As Cointelegraph reported earlier, however, Bitcoin price trends beyond the short term remained unchanged by Musk and traders’ responses to him. For popular trader Scott Melker, it was thus time to use an established method for determining when the price floor was likely to hit.For this, he used the relative stength index (RSI), a classic indicator of overbought or oversold areas.“I post this every time 4 hour RSI goes oversold and it works more times than not. An overbought bear div was the top,” he told Twitter followers.Thursday had already seen Bitcoin cancel its downtrend when it encountered the 21-week exponential moving average (21EMA). This line in the sand had held throughout the past year’s bull market and that of 2017 and is thought to provide reliable support for periods where bullish momentum sees a short-term retracement.The 21EMA was still rising steeply this month, demanding that BTC/USD thus returns to setting higher highs and higher lows on weekly timeframes in order to preserve its usefuless.Previously, a warning had given $40,000 as a potential low should $50,000 fail to hold.Meanwhile, as investors rushed to “buy the dip,” attention turned to where large clusters of bids from whale buyers might also help buoy the price.Bitcoin had paid no attention to whale positions north of $50,000 despite plenty of buying occurring as high as $58,000. For monitoring resource Whalemap, however, the number of coins being transacted at a loss suggested that “panic” was already visible on the market even before the Musk episode.“These moments have historically been good buying opportunities as they indicate panic on the market,” part of a tweet on Tuesday explained.A look at buy and sell order configurations on Binance additionally showed retail investors now protecting $45,000, with $55,000 and upward becoming strong resistance."
196,"Tesla’s tag game with Bitcoin (BTC) might have triggered a race in the corporate world to invest in crypto, however, SoftBank still prefers to take a more cautious approach. Answering questions at SoftBank’s earnings news conference, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son admitted that he doesn’t know whethe crypto is good or bad.“There’s a lot of discussion over if it’s a good thing or a bad thing, what’s the true value or is it in a bubble — honestly speaking, I don’t know,” Son said, according to Bloomberg.Son did not comment on the high-volume Bitcoin purchases made by major companies, such as Tesla and Square. Comparing cryptocurrencies to more traditional commodities, he said that cryptocurrency's popularity has made it a platform that ""can’t be ignored,"" similar to diamonds and bonds.He also added that SoftBank is always having internal discussions on cryptocurrencies, and there’s no need to reject them.Last year, Son mentioned that he was dedicating about five minutes a day to watch how the Bitcoin price fluctuates. But that has proved to be a distraction, preventing him from focusing on his own business, he said. Son also reportedly lost $130 million from his Bitcoin investment in 2019.Earlier this year, SoftBank Group’s telecommunications arm became a member of the Japanese Security Token Association, a group of advocacy and self-regulatory bodies that exist within the Japanese cryptocurrency and blockchain space.Known as an early adopter of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, Japan’s financial ecosystem seems to be focusing on the blockchain part of crypto lately. Three major banks in the country are collaborating with private sector participants on an experiment with a digital yen. This is a move to speed up the adoption of cashless payments in the country, where cash still accounts for about 80% of total transactions."
197,"Major auction house Sotheby’s has completed its cryptocurrency-enabled auction offering Banksy’s iconic protest artwork “Love is in the Air.”According to the auction results, Sotheby’s sold the physical artwork on Wednesday for $12.9 million, significantly up from the originally estimated $3 million to $5 million. The physical artwork was offered at a Contemporary Art Evening Auction that also featured “Versus Medici” by Jean-Michel Basquiat selling for nearly $51 million.Sotheby’s announced on Twitter that the auction involved a 14-minute bidding battle among four entities. The auction house emphasized that the sale marks the first time cryptocurrency was accepted as a payment option for a piece of physical artwork.According to the auction lot page, the bidders were able to pay using two major cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) — through Sotheby’s partnership with Coinbase Commerce.“The funds must be sent from an approved wallet or exchange, including: Coinbase, Coinbase Custody Trust, Fidelity Digital Assets Services, Gemini, or Paxos,” the auction house noted.Sotheby’s did not specify whether the winning bid or any participating bids in the auction have actually involved cryptocurrency. The company did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.As previously reported, Sotheby’s officially announced its plans to accept cryptocurrency as part of Banksy’s artwork auction last week in a move to further explore cryptocurrency payments after debuting nonfungible tokens earlier this year. On May 6, Sotheby’s announced another NFT auction called “Natively Digital: A Curated NFT Sale.” Scheduled to take place between June 3 and June 10, the sale will feature a digital object from iconic NFT collection CryptoPunks.This comes shortly after New York-based auction house Christie’s sold nine CryptoPunks tokens for nearly $17 million combined. The company previously auctioned Mike Winkelmann’s digital artwork “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” in March, netting almost $70 million for the piece."
198,"Bitcoin (BTC) dived 17% when Tesla CEO Elon Musk criticized its energy consumption — but it’s already bouncing back.On Thursday, fresh from its dip to $45,600, BTC/USD is trading above $51,000, having regained over half its lost ground. With the drama still spreading, Cointelegraph considers why, on a fundamental level, Bitcoin is ultimately resilient to the actions of a single user — no matter how influential they are.Bitcoin’s proof-of-work algorithm rewards both miners and investors over time because their years of work make the network stronger.The longer Bitcoin continues, the less likely it is to succumb to an attack or see its participants leave the network for a different cryptocurrency. This is precisely why Bitcoin continues to be the cryptocurrency of choice with competition — as many argue, no altcoin can “do Bitcoin” like Bitcoin. When it comes to Musk, however, proof-of-work is significant for another reason. Just because one prominent investor changes their mind on Bitcoin’s merits and the price drops, miners have no added incentive to quit the network or cash out.This aspect of “network effect” means that Musk ultimately provides Bitcoin with good rather than bad publicity — as even price shows, his words and actions do not change what Bitcoin is or what it is capable of.“Why is proof-of-work crucial for bitcoin? Because a valid hash (PoW) is how P2P nodes know that a block is valid, without needing a server or trusted third party,” PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow family of Bitcoin price models, commented on the phenomenon.Despite its abrupt dive after Musk’s words, Bitcoin’s recent price action speaks more to its resilience to criticism than its susceptibility. In the event, BTC/USD spent a mere two hours in decline before reversing and holding higher levels. Not just that, but the dip also fits with regular price behavior seen this year and did not even violate any longer-term price trends.A particularly important level that has characterized the 2020–2021 bull run has been the 21-week exponential moving average (EMA). Analysts have said that this level would dictate the price floor during dips — it even held during the previous bull run peak in 2017.This time, Musk likewise failed to topple the indicator, and the brief wick to $45,650 was extinguished when it met the 21 EMA on the way down.As ever with Bitcoin, it pays to zoom out.Once the dust settles on Musk’s individual energy criticism, the wider “debate” on how eco-friendly Bitcoin is will continue in his wake. Most of the common accusations, however, have been long debunked as short-sighted and lacking evidence.Just last week, Michael Saylor, CEO of major Bitcoin hodler MicroStrategy, gave a public interview, in which he reinforced the lack of merit inherent in claims that Bitcoin is “bad” for the environment.Responding to Musk, he called Tesla’s decision to stop accepting Bitcoin for payments “ironic.”“Ironic because no incremental energy is used in a bitcoin transaction,” he wrote on Twitter.Expanding one’s time horizon is thus essential to understanding why Bitcoin is worthwhile. As Saifedean Ammous, author of the popular book The Bitcoin Standard, often mentions, having a “low time preference” allows a BTC investor to understand that rejecting sound money for reasons such as the environment ends in more energy wasted on unsound alternatives.This time, Ammous did not mince his words.“Unless you’ve also switched your rockets and battery manufacturing to ‘more sustainable energy’ you’re going to look like a clueless big hypocrite here,” he tweeted, alluding to Musk’s other company, SpaceX."
199,"The Winklevoss twins’ Gemini exchange now has $30 billion worth of cryptocurrencies under custody as competition heats up among top U.S. exchanges.In a May 11 announcement, the exchange attributed much of the growth this year to strong demand from institutional clients:Gemini works with large asset managers including BlockFi, Blockchange, CoinList, CI Global Asset Management, DAiM, BTG Pactual, Caruso, Eaglebrook Advisors, and WealthSimple.The New York-based company was founded in 2014 by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. In the lead up to rival exchange Coinbase's April 14 direct listing on the Nasdaq, the pair told Bloomberg they were ""considering"" taking Gemini public too.If Gemini or another large exchange were to be listed publicly, it could significantly impact Coinbase's share price — which has fallen from $328.28 on its first day of trading to $288.46 currently.Veteran Wall Street analyst and New Constructs CEO, David Trainer, said in a note to clients on Tuesday that he expects Coinbase’s share price to decline to $100 or even lower due to increasing competition. Trainer suggested that Coinbase is currently overvalued, noting its current valuation implies it will exceed the combined annual revenue of Intercontinental Exchange and Nasdaq.Coinbase is expected to report first quarter earnings of $3.07 per share on revenue of $1.82 billion on Thursday. Trainer said that even if it exceeded expectations, this would only attract more competitors and drive down future revenues.""Coinbase will likely not be able to sustain blowout earnings going forward as competition enters the market,"" he said.In April, Trainer warned the mooted $100B valuation for Coinbase was far too high due to stiffening competition from Gemini, Bitstamp, Kraken and Binance.Figures released in March indicated Coinbase Custody had more than $90B assets under custody by the end of 2020."
200,"With Tesla’s suspension of Bitcoin payments causing chaos in crypto markets today, critics have targeted CEO Elon Musk’s cavalier attitude to the dramatic effects his words and actions can have on the sector.On May 13, Tesla and Musk announced that it had ceased accepting BTC as payment for vehicles due to concerns regarding the “rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal.”In response to the news, Bitcoin shed 15% in less than three hours, plummeting from nearly $55,000 to $46,600. Bitcoin’s “Fear & Greed Index” has also swung aggressively from yesterday’s greedy score of 68 to a fearful score of just 31 today.Tesla’s decision to accept BTC as payment for its vehicles in late-March was seen as an important factor in Bitcoin’s most recent rally into new-all time highs near $65,000 during mid-April. Many disappointed Bitcoiners are now accusing the car manufacturer and its CEO of having executed an elaborate “pump n dump.”That is effectively pure market manipulation.. let's see how the SEC respond to thisIn an “emergency press conference”, sometimes crypto trader and Barstool Sports founder, Dave Portnoy, asserted that Musk “just tried to tank Bitcoin,” stating:He asked: “How can you live with yourself?”Adrian Przelozny CEO of Independent Reserve told Cointelegraph that Tesla's move was “disappointing.”“However, we’ve seen Bitcoin receive all sorts of bad press throughout the years, such as governments banning its usage. And despite that, Bitcoin has always recovered and grown to new highs,” he said.However, others are inferring opportunity in the markets, with many high-profile crypto analysts taking Twitter to boast about buying the dip.William Clemente III tweeted to his 58,700 followers that the dip “will be looked at as one of the greatest bull market buy opportunities in BTC history.”Blockstream co-founder, Adam Back, stated: “Buying the Doge-tweeter dip. Thanks for all the sats.” Morgan Creek Digital founder, Anthony Pomplino, similarly announced: “I bought the dip. Thanks Elon,” adding:Bitcoin dipped to just above $47,100 in the wake of the news but has since recovered to $50,450 at the time of writing.Messari’s Mira Christanto expressed skepticism regarding the long term impact of Tesla’s decision, emphasizing that, “Tesla still holds BTC on its balance sheet” and challenging Tesla's assertions regarding the dirtiness of Bitcoin mining.Christanto shared a memo published by financial services firm Square last month titled “ Bitcoin is Key to an Abundant, Clean Energy Future” that argues the mining sector is driving demand for cheap renewable electricity."
201,"Bitcoin markets are pulling back after electric car manufacturer Tesla suspended its support for vehicle purchases using Bitcoin (BTC).In a May 13 tweet, Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk noted the company’s concerns regarding the ""rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal.""While Musk predicted that cryptocurrency ""has a promising future,” he concluded that the rise of digital assets “cannot come at a great cost to the environment.""However, the firm has not ruled out accepting BTC again in the future, with the post noting that it will resume using Bitcoin ""for transactions as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy."" Musk added:On social media, many within the crypto community have contradicted Musk and Tesla’s assertion regarding the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, with The Wolf of All Streets host Scott Melker noting that ""Miners primarily use renewable energy.""However, while the ""3rd Global Cryptoasset Benchmarking Study"" released by the University of Cambridge in October 2020 shows that up to 76% of cryptocurrency mining uses some renewable energy, it estimates that only 39% of the total power consumed by proof-of-work cryptocurrencies was green energy.As of the time of writing, BTC has crashed roughly 6% in the past hour, tumbling from $54,800 to roughly $51,600."
202,"The cryptocurrency market corrected sharply on May 12 after the hype surrounding dog-themed tokens was deflated when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin dumped vast amounts of the previously hot Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogelon Mars (ELON) and Akita Inu (AKITA) on the market and donated the proceeds to charity. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that as meme tokens sold off, Bitcoin (BTC) price continued its recent weakness and declined nearly 8% decline to $53,500 before recovering to $54,700.Ether (ETH) was less affected by the sell-off and actually managed to recover above $4,000 to reclaim its daily losses as users of the network applauded Buterin’s decision to donate his meme coins to various charities. Traders are also hopeful that the decreased trading activity in meme tokens will help push down gas fees on the Ethereum network.As the trading activity of meme tokens declines, traders may turn their attention back to Bitcoin but there is a certain degree of uncertainty regarding what might happen next.According to Chad Steinglass, the head of trading at crypto capital markets firm CrossTower, “BTC is actually doing a reasonable job of performing like a store of value” especially when compared to wider financial market developments, including the serious pressures facing growth equities which were “exacerbated by the May 12 CPI print which is being interpreted as a trigger for earlier Fed tightening.”Steinglass highlighted the fact that Bitcoin's struggle to escape the trading range it has been in for 3 months may be a symptom of its new role as a store of value and he hypothesized that traders who hold BTC in their investment portfolios may be “selling BTC and especially GBTC in order to raise cash liquidity as they lower their overall leverage.”Steinglass said:When it comes to Ether, Steinglass indicated that “ETH is in a new regime of price discovery” due to “upcoming changes in the protocol which will both remove inflation and also create incentive to hold tokens for proof of stake,” making it hard to know what a “good new fair value for ETH will be.”Regarding Ether, Steinglass said:Further insights into Ether's prospects were provided by David Lifchitz, managing partner and chief investment officer at ExoAlpha, who pointed to Ether's “torrid run” thus far in 2021 which has seen its price grow more than 455% year-to-date and a 100% rally in just the last three weeks perhaps serving as a “buy the rumor, sell the news setup"" ahead of the upcoming July EIP 1559 upgrade.Lifchitz said:And as far as Bitcoin is concerned, Lifchitz highlighted concerns regarding the range-bound trading BTC has been stuck in lately.Lifchitz said that Bitcoin is currently showing:Equities markets also experienced a sell-off due to fears of rising inflation which has been seen creeping higher across numerous sectors of the economy.Recent data from the consumer price index indicates that prices have been rising at their fastest pace since April 2007 and some economists cautioned that the metric shows no signs of slowing down for the foreseeable future.As a result of this pressure, the S&P 500, Dow and NASDAQ all saw significant declines on Wednesday and closed the trading day down 2.14%, 1.99% and 2.67% respectively.Despite the market downturn, altcoins like AAVE gained 30%, while Polygon (MATIC) and Kusama (KSM) both gained 18%.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $2.414 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 42.2%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

203,"Bitcoin's (BTC) recent price action has disappointed most investors, especially when one considers that the total altcoin market capitalization rallied 24% in nine days to reach a $1.35 trillion all-time high on May 9. Bitcoin's 62% accumulated gain in 2021 has BTC traders feeling somewhat frustrated with altcoins and meme coins pumping to new daily highs.On May 10, Fidelity, a $3.8 trillion global asset manager, filed for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) request with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin (BTC) partnered with the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and the SEC's first response window will close in 44 days.On May 11, Palantir (PLTR), a $30 billion data analytics company founded by billionaire Peter Thiel, announced that it had started to accept Bitcoin payments. The firm is likely to follow in Tesla (TSLA) and MicroStrategy's (MSTR) footsteps by adding BTC to its balance sheet, and the firm could have more than $2 billion in cash on hand for investments.In other news, the proposed Taproot upgrade aims to make complex transactions cheaper, faster and easier to deploy. More importantly, this upgrade would bring some privacy to multisig and time-lock functions.Taproot activation will only be given the green light if 90% of all mined blocks include an activation signal ahead of August 11.However, despite all this positive news, BTC's price action has not taken its usual bullish turn. The most significant immediate hurdle appears to be the lack of a regulatory framework. Joanna Wasick, a partner at law firm BakerHostetler, told Cointelegraph:""How many people using crypto for payments know exactly what the tax implications are of their payment transactions?""The first evidence that traders are in utter disbelief comes from the extremely modest perpetual funding rate. Futures contracts have an embedded rate that is usually charged every eight hours to ensure no exchange risk imbalances. Even though the buyers' and sellers' open interest is matched at all times, their leverage can vary.When longs are demanding more leverage, they will be the ones paying the fee. Therefore, the current situation can be interpreted as bullish. The opposite holds when shorts are using more leverage, thus causing a negative funding rate.Take notice of how the current 0.02% rate, equivalent to 1.8% per month, is much smaller than the recent peaks. While professional traders tend to prefer the fixed-month calendar futures, retail dominates perpetual ones, avoiding the expiries' hassle. Therefore, this data shows that there is a lack of appetite since April 17.To better understand how pro traders are positioning themselves, investors should look at the options markets. Call options allow the buyer to acquire Bitcoin at a fixed price on contract expiry. On the other hand, put options provide insurance for buyers and protect against price drops.Whenever market makers and pro traders are leaning bullish, they will demand a higher premium on call (buy) options, which will cause a negative 25% delta skew indicator.A skew indicator between -10 and +10 is deemed neutral, which has been the case since April 15. This data is evidence of a balanced risk assessment from whales and market makers between downside and upside risk.In line with today's price drop, there is little evidence that option traders are bullish. This data also aligns with the BTC perpetual futures markets.Bitcoin has managed to close above $50,000 in 65 out of the past 66 days, likely creating a 'comfort zone' for bulls. Therefore, as long as this support stands, there is still hope that Bitcoin will notch a new record-high.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

204,"Ether (ETH) set a second all-time high on May 12 as the largest altcoin continued on its way to what analysts say will be $5,000.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView tracked ETH/USD as the pair put in two all-time highs in a single day on Wednesday.Part of the now notorious ""alt season 2.0,"" Ether hit $4,350 earlier on the day, only to better its performance hours later and reach $4,380.Now under 15% away from $5,000, multiple commentators' forecasts of Ethereum’s native token hitting the landmark price level are in the spotlight. Among them is that of Cointelegraph contributor Marcel Pechman, who in an interview last week highlighted data which suggested that a $5,000 ETH was a matter of ""if,"" not ""when.""Pechman said that funding rates had yet to catch up with price gains, and thus retail investors were waiting on the sidelines at price levels around $3,500. Institutions, however, were more active.""It tells me that pro traders have been bullish for quite some time — for a couple of weeks — but the retail traders are still waiting for a buy opportunity,"" he summarizedSince then, funding rates have increased only modestly, indicating that the market trajectory has even more room to continue. As Pechman and Cointelegraph noted, exchange balances of ETH are likewise falling despite the opportunity to realize profits. Part of their resilience may lie in entering trades long ago. Those using Bitcoin (BTC) to buy ETH at any time since mid June 2018 remained in the red at the time of writing — the ETH/BTC pair still had far to go to match its all-time highs.These were set a year earlier in June 2017 at 0.144 BTC. Wednesday's USD high corresponded to 1 ETH being worth a comparatively modest 0.077 BTC. ETH is now ~0.08 BTC and might even pump to 2017 peak levels of 0.12 BTC. But beware that after a pump altcoins frequently return to their normal BTC denominated ranges (or lower). #Cointegration #PairsTrading pic.twitter.com/fk36Yq6EcEEthereum has nonetheless outperformed Bitcoin with its gains throughout the past year, leading to increasing attention from mainstream sources, several of which have begun to school readers on the differences between the two largest cryptocurrencies."
205,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, has issued an investor warning pointing out risks of mutual funds that have exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) futures.In an official statement on Tuesday, the SEC strongly encouraged investors to thoroughly consider risks disclosure of a mutual fund on the Bitcoin futures market, stressing that Bitcoin is a “highly speculative investment.” The authority emphasized that investors should take into account the volatility of both Bitcoin and the Bitcoin futures market, as well as the lack of regulation and potential fraud or manipulation in the underlying Bitcoin market.“As with any fund investment, investors should focus on the level of risk they are taking on, and the level of risk they are comfortable taking on, prior to making an investment,” the SEC wrote.The regulator noted that the Bitcoin futures market has significantly expanded after the first Bitcoin futures started trading in December 2017, with increased trading volumes and open-interest positions. The SEC further stated that it will closely monitor and assess Bitcoin futures-exposed mutual funds’ compliance with the Investment Company Act and federal securities laws. “Investor protection and assessing the ongoing compliance of these funds is a top priority for the staff,” the authority stated.Additionally, the SEC will also pay close attention to the impact of mutual funds’ investments in Bitcoin futures on investor protection, capital formation, and the fairness and efficiency of markets.As part of this, the SEC will also consider whether the Bitcoin futures market could accommodate an exchange traded fund, or ETF. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs “cannot prevent additional investor assets from coming into the ETF if the ETF becomes too large or dominant in the market, or if the liquidity in the market starts to wane,” the SEC said.The news comes weeks after the SEC delayed its decision on approving the VanEck Bitcoin ETF until June. As previously reported, some industry observers believe that the U.S. could finally see a Bitcoin ETF in 2021 thanks to the Senate’s confirmation of Gary Gensler as SEC chair.Despite the U.S. government still deciding on whether to approve a Bitcoin ETF, some countries around the world have already approved or launched Bitcoin ETF trading, with 3iQ and CoinShares’ Bitcoin ETF going live on Toronto Stock Exchange last month. Other fund managers like Purpose Investments and Evolve Funds Group previously launched Bitcoin ETFs as well, attracting nearly $1.3 billion and $100 million in assets under management as of mid-April, respectively.Previously, the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission approved two cryptocurrency ETFs in March, including a 100% Bitcoin ETF and the other composed of five cryptocurrencies."
206,"Crypto adoption among mainstream payment service companies continues to grow, with MoneyGram set to join the list.In a release issued on Wednesday, the global payment service announced a partnership with crypto exchange and Bitcoin (BTC) ATM operator Coinme Inc., to allow United States customers to withdraw their cryptocurrency holdings for cash across its point-of-sale outlets in the country.As part of the announcement, MoneyGram also revealed that customers will be able to buy BTC and crypto in an expansion of the existing crypto-to-cash model pioneered by the almost 20,000 cryptocurrency ATMs around the world.Commenting on the development, MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes remarked:For MoneyGram, the ability to buy Bitcoin across its brick-and-mortar retail outlets might be a significant development for would-be first-time crypto users daunted by interacting with online cryptocurrency exchanges.MoneyGram’s announcement also likely offers another indication of the potential for a unified money transmission licensing regime, especially for cryptocurrencies.Back in September 2020, 48 U.S. states agreed to establish a single regulatory framework for money transmitters — a move with significant implications for 78 fintech businesses like MoneyGram, with an annual turnover above $1 trillion.MoneyGram debuting physical Bitcoin-buying across its locations in the U.S. is also another example of fintech and payment service firms warming up to cryptocurrencies. From stables like PayPal to Visa and Mastercard, debuting some form of crypto-related feature is becoming a norm across the industry.Back in March, PayPal began allowing U.S. customers to pay with Bitcoin across millions of online merchants on the platform. In April, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said the company’s crypto commerce was on course to reach $200 million in volume within a few months."
207,"Ether (ETH), the second most-valued cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC), has hit a major milestone amid the ongoing price rally.On Wednesday, Ether’s price set another historic record, surging to as high as $4,346, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Ethers market capitalization briefly surpassed $500 billion, reaching nearly $505 billion on Wednesday.The new milestone marks Ether’s ongoing massive surge after it surpassed the $4,000 price mark for the first time in its history on Monday. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $4,317, up more than 6.4% over the past 24 hours and seeing massive gains of about 30% over the past seven days.Following the parabolic surge, Ether is now larger than payments giant Visa or major investment bank JPMorgan in terms of market capitalization. At publishing time, Visa’s market valuation amounts to $481 billion, while JPMorgan’s market cap stands at $488 billion, according to data from financial information website MarketWatch.Ether is the second cryptocurrency to hit a $500-billion market cap after Bitcoin. Ether took significantly less time to become a half-a-trillion-dollar asset. Launched in January 2009, Bitcoin took nearly 12 years to reach a $500-billion market capitalization in December 2020 at a price above $27,000. As the first version of an Ethereum cryptocurrency protocol was launched in July 2015, Ether is now five years and 10 months old.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin became a billionaire after Ether’s price rose above $3,000 on May 3. Megan Kaspar, a crypto analyst and co-founder of digital asset investment firm Magnetic, believes that Ether is now on track to hit a price target between $8,000 and $10,000 by late 2021. The analyst previously reportedly predicted that ETH would hit $3,400 when the cryptocurrency was trading about $1,200."
208,"Bitcoin (BTC) gained 4.3% on Wednesday as cryptocurrencies recovered losses despite increasing turmoil on global stock markets.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD erasing almost all the previous day’s losses on Wednesday to trade above $57,500 at the time of writing.The move came amid concerns over froth in tech stocks, fueled by problems in Taiwan that saw the country’s equities index post its biggest one-day loss in history. Bitcoin and altcoins had sold off with tech stocks more broadly earlier in the week, but the latest macro dip failed to worsen their performance.Conversely, as has become a hallmark trait of an increasingly asymmetrical market, most major cryptocurrencies bucked the trend and returned to growth.“BTC is bouncing here and Altcoins are recovering strongly,” popular Twitter commentator Rekt Capital summarized on Tuesday as the United States Federal Reserve buoyed the crypto cause by refusing to suggest that economic interventions could be lessened. Previously, concerns had surfaced that Bitcoin could ultimately fall through $50,000 under current conditions, opening up the path to as low as $40,000.In a continuation of “alt season 2.0,” meanwhile, Ether (ETH) led gains once again, touching new all-time highs while maintaining support at $4,000. Gas fees, however, remain a headache for traders and Ethereum network users.Other altcoins also challenged record highs, among them Cardano (ADA), which, at the time of writing, was just $0.04 away from all-time highs of $1.83.Amid continued controversy over meme coins, Dogecoin (DOGE) was flat, while “tribute” coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) lost 23% to fall out of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Weekly gains for the coin still stood at nearly 1,500%."
209,"The markets were mixed on May 11 as Bitcoin (BTC) recovered from Monday's drop to $53,000 by bouncing to $56,862 but the digital asset is still finding resistance at the $57,000 level.Ether (ETH) also worked its way back above $4,100 but according to Cointelegraph analyst Marcel Pechman, the bullish sentiment for Ether seen in recent weeks has begun to fade as traders question whether new all-time highs will be sustainable in the short term.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that Bitcoin bulls defended a late-night sell-off on May 10 that briefly dropped the price of BTC below $54,000 before dip buyers gobbled up sell orders and lifted the price back above $56,000.blue-chipWhile the blue chip cryptocurrencies have been stuck in a sideways market, canine-themed meme coins including Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogelon Mars (ELON) have followed Dogecoin’s (DOGE) lead and seen their prices explode for triple-digit gains.Bitcoin’s range-bound trading between $50,000 and $60,000 in recent weeks can partially be attributed to the rising price of Ether, which has caught the attention of institutional investors looking for exposure to more than just BTC. The growing demand for Ether can clearly be seen in the price action of the ETH/BTC pair.According to David Lifchitz, managing partner and chief investment officer at ExoAlpha, Ether's recent all-time high was in part due to a “continued rotation away from Bitcoin” which helped push the price of Ether “as high as $4,214 before suddenly puking down to $3,658 (-13% in an hour).”The downturn in the crypto market coincided with a selloff in the U.S. equity markets that hit the tech-heavy NASDAQ index especially hard. Lifchitz noted that Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies were eventually able to “bounce back half of the loss from the high.”While the sell-off “could be explained by some correlation trades leading to a quick profit-taking in cryptos”, Lifchitz also pointed to the possibility of a more organized selloff where some traders took advantage of frothy market conditions.Lifchitz said:Lifchitz highlighted that just:Further insight into the market moves over the past week was offered by Ben Lilly, co-founder and analyst at Jarvis Labs, who highlighted an increase in on-chain profit taking over the last week that had “lots of capital turning over throughout altcoins.”Lilly said:The overall altcoin market shook off the bearish moves seen in the larger-cap cryptocurrencies.

210,"Cryptocurrency traders awoke to an altcoin bonanza as a handful of meme tokens, along with some of the more established projects, staged double-digit rallies while Bitcoin (BTC) price slowly recovers to the $57,000 level. The biggest event generating conversations across the crypto sector and social media is the rise of dog-themed tokens inspired by the recent mega rally from Dogecoin (DOGE). The more than 20,000% rally from DOGE has shocked value investors across the world and many Bitcoin maximalist and equities traders are scratching their heads in confusion, given that DOGE was originally created as a simple joke.While DOGE has experienced a 40% pullback since reaching an all-time high at $0.74 on May 8, other canine-themed tokens have jumped out ahead of the pack to take the lead while Dogecoin takes a breather.Demand for Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been so intense that buyers overwhelmed the Binance system with deposits, causing the top exchange to run out of deposit addresses, while the Binance Smart Chain-based Australian Safe Shepherd (ASS) token has gained more than 400% in 24-hours. The Elon Musk-inspired Dogelon Mars (ELON) has al rallied 170%.While Ether (ETH) continues to hold the $4,000 level as bulls successfully defend against any significant move to the downside, EOS, the once touted ‘Ethereum Killer’, has seen its price spike more than 40% after Block.one announced that it had secured $10 billion in funding for the creation of an EOS-based cryptocurrency exchange called Bullish Global.Other notable altcoin gains include a 35% rally in the price of Yearn.finance (YFI) to establish a new record high at $77,041 and a 20% spike in the price of Reef (REEF) to an intraday high of $0.508.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $2.449 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 42.8%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

211,"Cryptocurrency investors in Hungary could be getting a major tax break very soon, as lawmakers seek to make the central European country more competitive in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.In a video that appeared on Facebook Tuesday, Finance Minister Mihály Varga outlined the government’s stimulus program through 2022. As part of the post-COVID-19 relief efforts, lawmakers are considering reducing taxes on cryptocurrency trading to 15% of income, down from the current rate of 30.5%. Such a move would make Hungary a far more competitive jurisdiction with respect to crypto-based capital gains taxes.Cryptocurrency regulations are underdeveloped in Hungary, though the buying and selling of digital assets is classified as “other income” from the perspective of taxation.After surging during the heights of the 2017 bull market, cryptocurrency trading in Hungary remains fairly modest compared with other countries. However, a clear uptick has been observed since the start of 2021.Hungary has been involved in preliminary discussions surrounding a central bank digital currency, or CBDC. In August 2020, a representative from the Hungarian National Bank joined a roundtable discussion with colleagues from the Swiss National Bank, the Bank of England and others in discussing the potential rollout of CBDCs in the future.Hungary, like other nations, was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. At one point, the central European nation had the worst COVID-19 death rate in the world. Nevertheless, the country has been slowly unwinding strict shelter-in-place orders since March as daily new cases continue to fall."
212,"Chia Network, which emerged onto the cryptocurrency scene with the promise of cleaning up the environmental mess left by Bitcoin (BTC) miners, may not be as green as it seems.Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum and others, Chia Network mines coins using an alternative to the energy-intensive proof-of-work. CHIA coins are produced using only hard drive storage and mining them doesn’t require specialized ASIC hardware or GPUs.But reports coming out of China suggest that saving the environment isn’t as easy as it sounds when it comes to crypto. According to local outlet Fast Technology, the shelf-life of a standard 512GB SSD would be worn out after just 40 days of continuous CHIA mining, based on a data write volume of 256 terabytes in that time period.A 1TB hard drive would last around 80 days, while a 2TB hard drive would be expected to last around 160 days. Under normal conditions, such pieces of hardware would be expected to last the average customer around a decade.Once a hard drive exceeds a certain data write volume, its consumer warranty protections become null and void. Hard drives typically ship with anywhere from three- to five-year warranties, yet CHIA mining could invalidate such warranties in just over a month.Fast Technology reported that hard drive manufacturers have begun rewriting the terms of their warranty agreements to reflect the reality of their components being used in CHIA mining. When CHIA commenced trading in early May, Chinese retailers suffered a shortage of hard drives, which eventually pushed the cost of high-capacity drives (16TB) up to 6,000 yuan ($933)."

It’s a competitive job market in the East-Asian nation, where high expenses enforce hierarchical social structures, and financial stability can seem like a pipe dream.On matters of technology and innovation, South Korea is incredibly progressive. There’s been a lot of buzz around cryptocurrencies since news of their existence became common knowledge in the country.Its open-minded attitude to technological progress could mean that the country will decide to regulate — instead of banning — blockchain-based tokens. However, with gambling considered illegal under South Korean law, and many projects leaning too heavily on the speculative side of things, some firms will probably face increased scrutiny.On the surface, South Korea has one of the world’s strongest economies — being the fourth-largest in Asia and 10th-largest globally — with an extraordinary human development index and only moderate levels of income inequality. However, beneath the surface, a financial revolution is seemingly brewing, and blockchain is at the heart of it.The South Korean stock market is dominated by four family-owned conglomerates or “chaebols,” which many believe are highly corrupt and politically influential. Recently, reported volumes on top Korean cryptocurrency exchanges surpassed the country’s stock market, which could be a sign that the people are making their intentions clear.As a country, South Korea is a prominent contributor to cryptocurrency volumes worldwide. Digital assets are part of the culture there, enabling many young citizens to get by despite Korea’s rising youth unemployment rates. Having long adopted the concept of micropayments through its obsession with video games, South Korea was ready for digital assets before cryptocurrencies even existed.The country also has the world’s fastest internet speeds, and its citizens are familiar with mobile payment systems due to the nation’s robust telecommunications industry. In 2019, the country introduced its own cryptocurrency through a government initiative, the S-coin.However, the government passed legislation later in March 2020 to clamp down on blockchain investments, and the citizens of South Korea, especially its youth, were not happy. Mark Lee, founder of South Korea affiliated blockchain marketing agency Eightfive, told Cointelegraph: “South Korea is quite conservative when it comes to speculative products. The high youth unemployment numbers are often seen as one reason many young people are drawn to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.”According to reports from local news outlets, the South Korean youth are leaving their jobs to explore day-trading cryptocurrencies. Most of the Korean nationals view digital assets as a means of wealth generation that’s far more rapid than their day jobs could ever provide. It’s come to the point where some companies have started threatening to block crypto exchanges on their networks, preventing their employees from checking in on price fluctuations during the day.“Different concerns exist in different jurisdictions,” said Ben Caselin, head of research and strategy at Asian crypto exchange AAX, adding: “In South Korea, perhaps more than anywhere else, there is a very real concern over capital flows, especially in relation to North Korea. We can, therefore, expect a continued tightening of regulations in South Korea.”In March, to ensure compliance with Anti-Money Laundering regulations, South Korea’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission, or FSC, ordered that cryptocurrency exchanges needed to have a “Virtual Asset Service Provider,” or VASP, license to operate.They also told exchanges that they had until September to comply, but during a policy committee meeting of the National Assembly on April 22, FSC chairman Eun Sung-soo said the FSC hadn’t yet received any VASP applications. Sung-soo also stated that if the current trend continues, over 200 exchanges will have shut down by the end of the year.Last month, South Korean exchange Daybit announced that it would be halting operations due to difficulties finding a banking partner amid the new regulations, but even bigger players are facing similar challenges. Earlier this year, OKEx closed its Korean platform, citing issues with the new Anti-Money Laundering rules, as well as Binance Korea shutting down services in December — just eight months after its launch.The “big four” exchanges in the country — Bithumb, Coinone, Upbit and Korbit — registered nearly 2.5 million new users in Q1 of 2021 alone, with 64% of them between the ages of 20 and 30. In fact, traders in their 30s out-spent every other demographic, producing over $398 million in trade volume over the quarter.“Surprisingly, Bitcoin is relatively not as popular in Korea,” said Min Kim, founder of the South Korean enterprise blockchain solutions platform Icon. “For example, BTC ranks #10 in trading volume on Upbit, Korea’s largest exchange,” he said, adding: “Koreans are investing heavily into altcoins today because they look at crypto as a lottery ticket.”The nation’s youth is heavily dependent on these exchanges, and shutting them down would deal a severe blow not just to the young investors of South Korea but to the global cryptocurrency market. There are also internal social class conflicts in the country, making crypto incredibly appealing to younger generations.“South Korea is quite conservative when it comes to speculative products. The high youth unemployment numbers are often seen as one reason many young people are drawn to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,” said Lee, continuing: “Political uncertainty is also a concern, and because Bitcoin is not attached to any state, it’s appealing to man.”The FSC chairman also recently ordered all FSC officials to have reported their cryptocurrency holdings by May 7, though penalties for violating these measures are supposedly not too harsh.According to reports, only the big four cryptocurrency exchanges are likely to sign up and receive VASP licenses by the deadline. While this won’t kill cryptocurrency trading in South Korea entirely, it could lead to a consolidation of crypto-related resources within the country. Caselin added:According to Kijun Seo, CEO of decentralized video game development studio Planetarium, “the government is still trying to figure out how to oversee investment and speculative activities, with new tax and registration laws being implemented this year.”In February, the nation’s finance ministry fast-tracked by introducing a new 20% tax on cryptocurrency profits exceeding $2,230, which is now expected to have passed into law by January 2022.Sung-soo also recently came under fire for his negative remarks about cryptocurrencies, spurring over 300,000 outraged citizens to sign a petition calling for his resignation. Conflict between the people and the government is unlikely to solve any problems, but without sound regulation, it doesn’t make sense for any government to open its arms to cryptocurrencies.Regulators have genuine concerns about its pseudonymous nature, but with how positive the country is about blockchain, ensuring a healthy cryptocurrency market in South Korea isn’t just a national problem — it’s a global one."
214,"Neilmaldrin Noor, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Directorate General of Taxes, said that the authority is considering a tax scheme for capital gains generated from cryptocurrency trades, Reuters reported on Tuesday.“It is important to know that if there is a profit or capital gain generated from a transaction, the profit is an object of income tax,” the official stated. Noor said that Indonesian taxpayers who receive capital gain from crypto trades would have to pay the tax and report it to the government. The official noted that the new crypto tax scheme for capital gains has not been implemented and is still under discussion. The latest news comes weeks after Indonesia’s Commodity Futures Trade Regulatory Agency, or Bappebti, was reported to be considering a tax on all cryptocurrency transactions. As part of the proposal, the authority reportedly planned to automatically deduct the tax from transactions by 13 crypto exchanges operating under Bappebti’s regulatory oversight. An executive at Bappebti stated that the actual tax rate had not been determined as of late April.Indonesia’s latest crypto tax proposals follow years of a blanket ban on payments made in cryptocurrencies. The country’s central bank issued a regulation banning the use of crypto in payment systems back in 2017, outpacing similar bans in other jurisdictions such as Russia and Turkey."
215,"The Chicago Board Options Exchange, or CBOE, has filed Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.CBOE filed a Form 19b-4 on Monday seeking to list  Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust Bitcoin ETF that was initially submitted to the SEC by the $4.9-trillion asset manager back in March.Monday’s Form 19b-4, which puts CBOE as the exchange partner for Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF filing, has triggered the SEC approval process.The SEC’s first response window will close in 45 days, upon which the SEC will elect to extend or reject the application altogether. In total, the SEC has 240 days to evaluate Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF application.Back in April, the SEC postponed its decision on the VanEck Bitcoin ETF application until June.CBOE’s filing also puts Fidelity’s application among a list of Bitcoin ETF hopefuls apart from VanEck that include WisdomTree and SkyBridge Capital.Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital has also submitted a Bitcoin ETF application with the SEC, with the NYSE Arca listed as the exchange partner.The company, via its subsidiary, also launched a BTC ETF product in Canada back in March. Indeed, Canada has become a Bitcoin ETF trading hub in North America amid a raft of approval by securities regulators in the country.Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETF hopefuls in the U.S. are keen to see the SEC under Gary Gensler’s charge approve an ETF product for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.However, recent comments by the SEC commissioner might indicate that such an outcome is not yet possible. Speaking earlier in May, Gensler called for greater investor protection in the crypto market.Under Jay Clayton — the previous SEC chair — the commission regularly identified volatility, price manipulation and investor protection concerns as reasons for not approving any Bitcoin ETF application."
216,"Kazakhstan’s government is forming a roadmap to stimulate the development of the cryptocurrency industry and blockchain technology in the country.State authorities have reviewed proposals to address the crypto industry’s development and reconsider the state’s approach to regulating crypto operations, according to a Tuesday announcement on the website of the prime minister of Kazakhstan.Officials have proposed to run crypto exchanges via a major national financial hub, the Astana International Financial Centre. The government also suggested establishing standards, by which crypto exchanges can interact with local banks and clients.The new initiative aims to provide transparency and organization for the local crypto industry. “To date, out of the whole variety of companies working in the crypto industry, [...] only mining companies are part of the market in Kazakhstan,” the announcement reads. The Republic of Kazakhstan is getting more serious about the crypto industry and digital assets. Last week, Kazakhstan’s central bank issued an official report on a possible central bank digital currency. The bank said that the digital tenge is not intended to replace either cash or cashless payments but would rather be an alternative option that would enable further development of the national payment system and reduce reliance on cash."
217,"It was one of the most-anticipated releases of a games console for years — the PlayStation 5.Sony’s latest hi-spec model also couldn’t have come at a better time. Making its long-awaited debut in November 2020, gamers had high hopes of keeping entertained during a harsh winter… and averting boredom during coronavirus lockdowns that kept us confined indoors, unable to go to restaurants, and away from our loved ones.Alas, many of us were left disappointed because of stock shortages. Around the world, PS5s would sell out instantly as soon as shops got a batch — and Sony admitted that a shortage of semiconductors was having a detrimental impact on its production processes. (The lack of chips has also been affecting the distribution of Bitcoin mining hardware.)Even now, frustrated gamers are having trouble getting their hands on this console, with the likes of Amazon sold out. Twitter trackers have been set up so people can find out when the PS5 is back in stock, and opportunistic scammers have been preying on those who are desperate to make a purchase. On some second-hand marketplaces such as eBay, buyers face hugely inflated prices, too.It doesn’t have to be this way, though. One of the best-kept secrets when it comes to PS5 stock lies in how a number of crypto-focused marketplaces have brand-new, shiny consoles that are ready to be shipped to your door. How do we know this? Because we got one.One website that has PS5s in stock is Exeno, a website that specializes in allowing people to purchase top gadgets such as iPhones, iPads, laptops and electric scooters using digital assets. Prices are presented in Bitcoin, Bitcoin Vault and Ether — alongside a dollar amount for comparison.Beyond that, the process is incredibly similar to any other fiat-focused eCommerce site that you may have encountered. In-depth information is provided about each product’s specifications, and users have the freedom to leave reviews.When an account is registered using Exeno, individual wallets for each of the three cryptocurrencies supported are automatically set up — meaning that you can top up your account through your wallet or chosen exchange.A common worry that some shoppers may have when using cryptocurrencies is that the rates may suddenly change or could be out of date. Exeno says it gets around this through a partnership with Kanga.Exchange. A seamless experience has been built that ensures the process of making a payment is completed in under a minute — and during this time, an item’s price is frozen to deliver certainty to the consumer.Of course, there’s also an argument that making a purchase using Bitcoin might not be a good idea anyway. Some horror stories have emerged over the years, such as the sorry tale of Laszlo Hanyecz, the man who paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas in 2010. (At the time of writing, this stash would be worth an eye-watering $580 million.)This isn’t a concern for Exeno’s CEO Tom Babiak, who told Cointelegraph: “Every currency fluctuates. In a situation when Bitcoin has been bought at a knockdown price, paying for goods with it when its value is rising, is an excellent solution.”Another argument might be that making a purchase using crypto directly can be more efficient — especially if you were only going to convert your Bitcoin into dollars to snap up an item anyway. Given how these transactions are taxable events, shoppers then need to go through the process of declaring any profits they made from holding on to their crypto, adding on another cost to paying in fiat.Registering an account and making a purchase feels very familiar through this website’s interface — and if anything, using cryptocurrencies is rather novel. A fixed fee of 1.8% is added on top of the purchase.We speedily received a notification telling us that our package was on its way, alongside an estimated delivery time and a link where we could track the shipment. Six days later, I was the envy of many gamers in London as I unboxed a brand-new PS5. One thing that immediately surprised me was the size of the package (which was lovingly secured with Exeno-branded tape.) This console was going to look intimidating next to my dainty Nintendo Switch.The PS5 was well packaged, something that’s crucial given the perils that can be associated with international shipments. Another nice touch from Exeno came in the form of a colorful card that says “thank you” in multiple languages.Seeing prices for everyday products quoted in crypto is certainly a surreal experience — a Samsung smartphone for 0.01899551 BTC here, a printer for 0.535773 ETH there. And it seems like this could become much more normal in the future — especially considering how major platforms such as PayPal, Visa and Mastercard are all beginning to embrace digital assets.Disclaimer.

218,"Bitcoin (BTC) could see a price drop to as low as $40,000 if higher support levels fail to hold, an industry CEO said.Speaking to Bloomberg on Tuesday, Pankaj Balani, CEO of digital asset derivatives exchange Delta Exchange, warned that there is a danger of fresh significant losses for BTC/USD.Bitcoin shed around 5% overnight on Monday, the latest in a familiar cycle of dips and rebounds below crucial resistance, which begins at around $59,500.At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency traded at just above $55,000.For Balani, $50,000 now forms a significant line in the sand for bulls, and a failure to hold it would open up a new lower trading corridor with a floor at $40,000.Cryptocurrencies in general, he added, “should move lower” under such a scenario.The perspective jars with the more optimistic projections from data-based analytics this week. As Cointelgraph reported, whale buying was previously tipped to keep BTC/USD at a minimum of $52,000.A major cluster of support from whales — 120,000 BTC at $58,000 — nonetheless failed to stop short-term losses, leaving a question mark over the ability of smaller clusters lower down to do likewise.Cointelegraph additionally noted that exchange order book support only begins at $50,000, with few bids between that boundary and all-time highs of $64,500.Reacting to the latest price action, however, popular commentators were as cool as ever, noting the overall volatility of the market was very much acting within defined contours.#Crypto prices plummet to levels not seen since last week!!!On altcoins, a sense of a reset being underway was apparent on the day, with Ether (ETH) taking a breather after hitting new all-time highs repeatedly in recent days.Do you want Tesla to accept Doge?Fresh Twitter action from Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, had the potential to release a new spate of growth for Dogecoin (DOGE), which had paired almost a week of gains to drop to around $0.50."
219,"Nebraska lawmakers are moving forward with an initiative that would allow state banks to offer cryptocurrency services.State Senators favored the measure through the first of three required votes in the legislature, with 39 lawmakers voting to advance the bill for enrollment and initial review on Sunday.Introduced by Republican Mike Flood in January, Legislature Bill 649 aims to adopt the Nebraska Financial Innovation Act and create digital asset depository institutions, as well as provide for charter, operation, supervision and regulation of such institutions.The initiative would reportedly make Nebraska the second state in the United States to set up a formal charter for cryptocurrency-powered banks, allowing them to facilitate crypto transactions. Wyoming was the first state to do so, chartering its first crypto bank in September 2020.Senator Flood said that he introduced the bill after talking with an entrepreneur friend who decided to move into the cryptocurrency industry in Wyoming. Flood said that Nebraska has an opportunity to become an early adopter of cryptocurrencies with the measure, which could help it benefit from technology and finance jobs. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity not only for my district but the state of Nebraska,” he said.Some lawmakers questioned whether it was right for the state to move into crypto, expressing skepticism about the consequences of the measure. “This bill is not anywhere close to being in a form where it could pass,” Senator Steve Erdman reportedly said.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Flood originally initiated two crypto-related bills, one of which outlines requirements for banks providing custodial services, providing classifications of digital assets and related technology, such as smart contracts and private keys. The regulatory initiative has not moved forward since a related hearing in February."
220,"The astronomical rally in Ether (ETH) is not showing any signs of slowing down. The bulls easily cleared the overhead hurdle at $4,000 today, which also pushed the biggest altcoin’s market dominance to over 19%. It is not only Ether that is witnessing sharp buying from traders. Litecoin (LTC) and Cardano (ADA) have also risen new all-time highs, suggesting a broad-based altcoin rally.However, Bitcoin (BTC) seems to have lost its momentum as it continues to struggle near the $60,000 mark. That has pulled its market dominance to below 44% for the first time since July 2018.However, the recent underperformance of Bitcoin has not shaken the long-term bulls. Morgan Creek Capital Management founder and CEO Mark Yusko recently said in an interview with CNBC that Bitcoin will rival the “monetary value” of gold.“If gold’s monetary value is $4 trillion, then digital gold should move up to that total,” Yusko added. That means Bitcoin will have to rise to $235,000 in the future to fulfill Yusko’s prediction.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot the critical support and resistance levels.Bitcoin has been sandwiched between the moving averages and the $58,966.53 resistance for the past two days. This tight range trading suggests a status of equilibrium between the bulls and the bears.If the uncertainty resolves to the downside, the BTC/USDT pair could drop to $52,323.21. The bulls will try to defend this support and if they succeed, the pair could extend its consolidation between $52,323.21 and $58,966.53 for a few more days.The gradually rising 20-day exponential moving average ($56,611) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.This balance may shift in favor of the bulls if the price sustains above $58,966.53. That could result in a march to the all-time high at 64,849.27. A break above this resistance may signal the resumption of the up-move.Conversely, a break below $52,323.21 may indicate the start of a deeper correction to $46,985. A break below this support could trigger panic selling.Ether’s rally has continued unabated. After forming a Doji candlestick pattern on May 9, the bulls have asserted their dominance today and pushed the price to a new all-time high. The sharp rally of the past few days has pushed the RSI above 83.A deeply overbought level on the RSI indicates a buying frenzy as traders fear missing out on the rally. Generally, such rallies top out after the last bull has purchased. The ETH/USDT pair could rise to $4,528.97 and then to the psychological level at $5,000.The first sign of the bullish momentum fading could be a correction that lasts for more than three days. A break below the 20-day EMA ($3,173) will signal the start of a deeper correction.Binance Coin (BNB) rose to a new all-time high at $691.77 today but the bulls are struggling to sustain the price above the breakout level at $680. The long wick on the day’s candlestick suggests a lack of demand at higher levels.The upsloping moving averages indicate that buyers are in control, but the negative divergence on the RSI suggests the bullish momentum may be weakening. A break and close below the 20-day EMA ($599) could be the first sign of a deeper correction.On the other hand, if the price rises from the current level or the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to push and sustain the BNB/USDT pair above $680. If they succeed, the pair could embark on a journey toward $760 and then $808.57.Dogecoin (DOGE) witnessed a sharp dump on May 9 but the bulls aggressively defended the 20-day EMA ($0.44) as seen from the long tail on the day’s candlestick. However, the buyers could not extend the recovery today and the price has resumed its journey toward the 20-day EMA.The 20-day EMA is gradually flattening out and the RSI has declined below 58, indicating the bullish momentum is weakening.If the DOGE/USDT pair again rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest strong buying at lower levels. Such a move could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days.This view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA. if that happens, the pair could drop to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.38.XRP has repeatedly broken above the downtrend line since May 6 but the bulls have not been able to sustain the breakout. This suggests that traders may be using the rallies to lighten their long positions.The buyers will have to push and sustain the price above $1.66 to enhance the prospects of a retest of the 52-week high at $1.96. The gradually upsloping 20-day EMA ($1.45) and the RSI above 56 indicate a minor advantage to the bulls.This positive view will nullify if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that supply exceeds demand. The XRP/USDT pair could then drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($1.16).Cardano made a large outside day candlestick pattern on May 9, indicating strong buying at the breakout level of $1.48. However, the bulls have not been able to sustain the momentum today and the altcoin has formed an inside-day candlestick pattern.If the bulls do not give up much ground from the current level, it will signal strength and that could enhance the prospects of the resumption of the uptrend.The rising 20-day EMA ($1.45) and the RSI in the overbought territory also indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside. A break above $1.83 may open the doors for a rally to $2 and then $2.25.Contrary to this assumption, if the ADA/USDT pair turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($1.45), it will indicate a bull trap. That could pull the price down to $1.28 and then to $1.Polkadot (DOT) is stuck between the moving averages and the $42.28 overhead resistance. This tight range trading near the stiff resistance is a positive sign as it shows that traders are in no hurry to dump their long positions.If the bulls can thrust and sustain the price above $42.28, it will suggest that demand exceeds supply. That could result in a rally to the all-time high at $48.36 where the bears are again likely to mount a stiff resistance.However, if the buyers push the price above $48.36, the DOT/USDT pair could start its journey to $58.06.Alternatively, if the price breaks below the moving averages, the pair could drop to $34.36 and then to $32.56. If that happens, the pair may extend its stay inside the $26.50 to $42.28 range for a few more days.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is facing stiff resistance near the 52-week high at $1,600.89 as seen from the long wick on today’s candlestick. If the price slips below $1,400, the altcoin could drop to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,263.10 and remain range-bound for a few days.The first sign of weakness will be a break below $1,263.10 and the advantage will shift in favor of the bears if the BCH/USDT pair slips below the 20-day EMA ($1,134).However, the upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.If the price rises from the current level or from $1,400 and breaks above $1,600.89, the pair could start the next leg of the uptrend, which has a target objective at $2,147.36.Litecoin surged above the resistance line of the ascending broadening wedge pattern on May 9, indicating a pick-up in momentum. The altcoin hit a new all-time high at $412.76 today but the long wick on the candlestick suggests profit-booking at higher levels.If the LTC/USDT pair rebounds off the breakout level, it will suggest that the bulls are buying every minor dip. That will increase the possibility of the resumption of the uptrend with the next target at $463.31 and then $500.On the contrary, if the price re-enters the wedge, it will suggest that the breakout on May 9 was a bull trap. That could pull the price down to the 20-day EMA ($309). A strong rebound off this level will suggest the sentiment remains positive while a break below the 20-day EMA will clear the path for a drop to the support line of the wedge.The bulls pushed Chainlink (LINK) above the resistance line of the ascending channel on May 5 but could not build up on the breakout. After hesitating for a few days, the bulls made a decisive up-move on May 9 and pushed the altcoin to $52.42.However, the bulls again failed to sustain the rally and the bears are trying to pull the price back into the ascending channel. If they succeed, the LINK/USDT pair may drop to the 20-day EMA ($43).If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls may make one more attempt to resume the uptrend. On the contrary, a break below the 20-day EMA will suggest the current breakout was a bull trap. The pair could then drop to the support line of the channel.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

221,"As Ether (ETH) passed $4,000 and multiple altcoins saw their own all-time highs on Monday, data shows that there is still more buying appetite to come.A trading frenzy is gripping altcoins, while Bitcoin (BTC) continues to consolidate, showing signs that it is ready to tackle $60,000 resistance.While some alts, notably Dogecoin (DOGE), have cooled since last week, traders are far from exhausted and are ready for more. This is aptly demonstrated, analyst Lex Moskovski said, by the number of stablecoins entering exchanges.Stablecoin inflows have been on an uptrend for months, and apart from brief “reset” periods where they leave exchanges, the overall direction is clear.This suggests that traders are ready and waiting to enter positions in various cryptocurrencies at short notice.Stablecoin reserves across exchanges hit a fresh all-time high of over $11.5 billion in recent days, still above $11 billion after a small reversal at the time of writing.“Stablecoins on exchanges keep staying in the ATH range,” Moskovski told Twitter followers.Earlier, Cointelegraph reported on the composition of exchange order books, notably that of Binance, which reveal a lack of bidding interest above $50,000.At the same time, however, data shows that Bitcoin whales — large-volume investors — have amassed significant positions between $54,000 and $58,000.Compiled by monitoring resource Whalemap, the figures show that curiously, the largest cluster of whale coins in the range is 120,000 BTC at $58,000.Cryptocurrency traders are still sending stablecoins to exchanges in a sign that the bull run for many cryptocurrencies won’t end “any time soon.”“Whale accumulation clusters, NVT, on-chain volume profile and other on-chain metrics are showing $52K should be the floor,” the Whalemap team told Cointelegraph."
222,"Ninepoint Partners LP, one of Canada’s Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund issuers, has announced plans to offset the carbon footprint of its BTC ETF product.According to a release issued on Monday, Ninepoint has inked a partnership with carbon offsetting service provider CarbonX. As part of the partnership, Ninepoint will dedicate an undisclosed portion of its management fees to purchase carbon credits to neutralize the environmental impact of the Bitcoin mining process of the BTC held in its fund.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Ninepoint announced plans to convert its Bitcoin trust to an ETF back in March, with the fund’s prospectus filed with regulators the following month.The partnership will also see the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute providing scientific estimates on Bitcoin mining energy consumption. The purchased carbon credits will reportedly be channeled toward conservation efforts in the Amazon forest.Commenting on the reasoning behind the move, Alex Tapscott, managing director of digital assets at Ninepoint, told Bloomberg:Indeed, the “ocean boiling narrative” continues to be associated with Bitcoin mining with detractors pointing to the high energy consumption of mining establishments around the world. Earlier in May, a bill was introduced to the New York State Senate seeking to ban BTC mining in the state for three years over energy concerns.From China to Iran, miners are facing increasingly stricter oversight from regulators over electricity consumption and environmental impact concerns. On the flip side of the argument, Bitcoin proponents say miners are becoming buyers of last resort for renewable energy producers."
223,"Global public interest in Dogecoin (DOGE), as measured by internet search statistics, has exceeded that of Bitcoin (BTC) for the first time. According to data from Google Trends, values assigned to each cryptocurrency for May 2–8 stand at 56/100 points for DOGE versus 48/100 for BTC. Per the chart below shows, search interest in DOGE over the past 12 months has often closely correlated with peaks and troughs in public interest in Bitcoin, although the interest in the two coins has previously diverged. This week, however, shows not only a strong non-correlation but a higher level of interest in DOGE in absolute terms.As previously reported, DOGE has had nothing if not a dramatic 2021. In mid-April, the coin gained 80% in value in just one day to cap 5,000% in year-to-date returns. As a quintessential meme cryptocurrency, much of the asset’s dizzying price hikes have been fueled by social media sentiment and, arguably, its frequent, if jocular, endorsement by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.   Yet as noted already in April, high levels of public interest in the asset aren’t necessarily indicative of its good fortune on the markets. Indeed, this week has been distinctly bearish for DOGE, coinciding with a fresh bout of publicity for the coin during Musk’s latest appearance on Saturday Night Live. Blockstream’s Adam Back has recently observed that its meme logic translates into a high-stakes, volatile “pump and dump casino rug-pull” grounded in the widespread perception that the asset lacks inherent value but can be rallied around and shorted for a potential profit.As data from Google Trends shows, this “casino market logic,” in Back’s words, remains at its strongest in the United States, followed by the U.S. Virgin Islands and Turkey. On the month, DOGE remains up by over 600% but has traded horizontally with a 0.6% decline in value on the week and a 1.6% gain on the day."
224,"Bitcoin (BTC) is off to yet another fighting start on Monday, hitting $59,500 — is this the week we see $60,000?After a promising but restrained weekend, BTC/USD is once again back to beating out resistance as major markets reopen.Given the strength of underlying technicals and buyer demand, bulls may have cause for celebration in the next few days. Resistance, however, has kept them in check for weeks.Cointelegraph presents five things that may help to shape Bitcoin price action.Stocks began on a familiar positive note in Asia as traders betted on existing highs continuing to hit.A fresh all-time high for the S&P 500 index last week ensured a buoyant mood, with the coronavirus pandemic doing nothing to sour what have been historic returns for various markets.Commodities were dictated by the ransomware attack in the United States, which pushed oil prices to three-year highs before the market calmed.“This interruption of the distribution of refined gasoline and jet fuel underscores the vulnerability of our national critical infrastructure in cyberspace and the need for effective cybersecurity defenses,” Bloomberg quoted a governmental statement as saying.The dollar suffered as the attack hit, with the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) suddenly tanking in a move that boosted Bitcoin beyond $58,000.On Monday, with the pipeline still closed, only a modest rebound was evident, allowing the potential for further DXY-based gains for BTC/USD.As Cointelegraph often reports, DXY and Bitcoin tend to be inversely correlated, but this relationship has become more unpredictable this year.It’s all systems go for Bitcoin — at least when it comes to network fundamentals.Following the sudden hash rate dip last month — tied to miners being flooded in China — network strength and associated price performance have firmly recovered.The process was already evident last week, with commentators noting that the negative impact of the event was practically behind Bitcoin already.Now, however, forecasts reflect unprecedented interest and competition among miners, along with a firm commitment to the network’s future.According to data from on-chain monitoring resource Blockchain.com, the hash rate is now at new all-time highs, with its seven-day average going from 131 exahashes per second on April 25 to 177 EH/s as of Monday.Difficulty, which automatically adjusted downward to take account of the reduction in miners, is now also due for a major hike of its own when it adjusts again in around two days’ time.At 13.5%, the projected difficulty increase is the largest since June last year.If the old adage “price follows hash rate” proves itself to be as true today as previously, Bitcoin hodlers could feel the knock-on price benefits in the coming weeks.On the topic of price benefits, traders this week are looking for a “springboard” effect in BTC spot price action, which could lead to a breakout.After climbing and reversing but broadly putting in higher highs and higher lows in recent days, Bitcoin is due to make a more committed statement.On Monday, popular trader Crypto Ed said that a leg down from current levels near $59,000 should end around $800 lower before a resurgence takes out the pivotal $60,000 resistance zone.“BTC plan for today: Smaller correction after 5 legs up. Looking for a bounce and continuation up towards 62k and 68k after that. Potential bounce area (green box) = 58100-58200,” he commented on Twitter alongside a projection chart.The battle for final resistance near all-time highs of $64,500 has been raging for several weeks, with each attempt to overcome sellers ending in a price dip of various strengths.A look at the order book structure on Binance, the biggest exchange globally by volume, showed that the $60,000 zone was still holding on Monday, backed up by incremented sell walls below the highs.Buyer support, conversely, was only in evidence at $50,000, providing a wide potential trading range should BTC/USD drop again.Bitcoin may have to wait for its ultimate push to take out the highs — altcoins are already running hot this week.Led by Ether (ETH), Monday saw a return to form for the majority of the large-cap cryptocurrencies after mixed performance over the weekend.ETH/USD, ever the surprise, shot past $4,000 on the day, showing no signs of slowing as it hit new all-time highs and confirmed traders’ forecasts of an attack on $5,000.The largest altcoin’s gains were plain to see beyond simple price action. According to data from analytics resource CoinMarketCap, Ether’s overall share of the cryptocurrency market cap now stands at 19.1%.That market cap passed $2.5 trillion on Monday, while Bitcoin’s share fell ever closer to 40%.Crypto market value hits $2.5tn as #Ether hits record high >$4k. #Bitcoin’s price is currently ~$59k w/its dominance reaching 44%, lowest since 2018, while Ethereum’s dominance is at a record 18%. pic.twitter.com/vhI2I8QPPwWith ETH/USD up 31% in a week, other altcoins began to copy its success. Cardano (ADA) matched its gains, while Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) both reached almost 50% weekly returns.High flyers from earlier were conversely much calmer, with Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) both flat after reaching all-time highs of their own last week.Escaping the short-term narrative just for a moment, meanwhile, produces a familiar sensation that all is well in Bitcoin.While altcoins boom on a trading frenzy, a slow but steady transfer of Bitcoin wealth from weak hands to strong ones is continuing, says popular statistician Willy Woo.Analyzing data late last week, Woo stressed that this year’s bull run is different to the rest — because speculative hands are not lasting long and seasoned hodlers are buying up the slack at higher prices than ever.“This cycle is different; the movement of coins to strong holders is unprecedented,” he summarized alongside the data from on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode.As Cointelegraph reported, the trend has characterized various phases of 2021 when it comes to BTC price."
225,"Morgan Creek Capital Management founder and CEO Mark Yusko believes Bitcoin’s next market cycle could see the asset rival gold by market capitalization and trade for more than $200,000.While appearing on CNBC’s Trading Nation on Sunday, Yusko compared the rapid adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) to the growth of FAANG companies — Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google.Yusko’s price prediction is based on his assumption that Bitcoin will rival gold by “monetary value” — a concept derived from the gold standard, where a country's currency or fiat has a value directly linked to gold. He stated: “If gold’s monetary value is $4 trillion, then digital gold should move up to that total.”With BTC changing hands for roughly $59,000 and Bitcoin’s market cap at roughly $1.1 trillion at the time of writing, Yusko’s prediction suggests Bitcoin could trade for at least $235,000 in the future.The investment manager predicted Bitcoin will become the base-layer protocol for the Internet of Value, likening Bitcoin to Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP — the standard protocol allowing computers to connect and share data across the internet.When asked about other protocols or crypto assets such as Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) — which have all reached all-time highs over the past couple of days — he stated there is room for more. However, not a fan of DOGE, Yusko added:At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading 1.7% higher on the day at $59,200, Ether was at an all-time high above $4,000, but DOGE had crashed after tagging new record highs, following a mention from Elon Musk on Saturday Night Live."
226,"During an interview with Bloomberg TV on May 3, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao suggested that Bitcoin (BTC) ""is probably less volatile"" than the stock prices of Apple and Tesla.Zhao argued that crypto's volatility was not unlike the stock market, adding that ""Volatility is everywhere"" and that ""It is not unique to crypto.""However, those involved in cryptocurrency trading probably know that cryptocurrency prices fluctuate a lot more than exchange-listed trillion-dollar companies. This begs one to question whether or not Zhao is detecting a trend that some may have missed.The first obvious reading from the chart above is that both Bitcoin and Tesla share different volatility levels when compared with trillion-dollar stocks like Apple and Amazon.Moreover, stocks seem to have experienced a 60-day volatility peak in November 2020, while Bitcoin was relatively calm.Another thing to consider is that Tesla's market capitalization is $633 billion, and it has yet to post a quarterly net income above $500 million. Meanwhile, every single top 20 global company is incredibly profitable. These include Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Saudi Aramco, Alibaba and TSM Semiconductor.The list above shows the top 12 and bottom 12 most volatile stocks to show how Tesla's price swings are far from the average of other companies with a $200 billion market cap. The volatility seen in cryptocurrencies has been the norm, given that there is a lack of earnings, a very early adoption-stage cycle and a lack of an established valuation model.One doesn't need to be an expert in statistics to ascertain that the performance of the S&P 500 index has been pretty much stable over the past year, apart from a couple of weeks back in September and October 2020.Zhao may be the founder of the leading crypto exchange, but he doesn't personally trade. On the contrary, he actually recommends hodling instead of trading in every instance possible.Lol, I don’t do leverage or loans. I don’t even trade. I just hodl #bnb.If you feel stressed out during every dip, you probably should not trade much, or at least change your trading strategy. Maybe just #HODL?

Not the best advice for our business (trading fees), but probably good advice for many new ""traders"".

Not financial advice.Exclusively analyzing volatility presents another big problem. The indicator leaves out the most important metric for investors: the return. Whether an asset is more or less volatile doesn't matter if, on average, one asset consistently posts higher gains than others.MicroStrategy has listed almost every currency, stock index and S&P 500 index component, and curious analysts can compare returns and Sharpe ratios side-by-side with Bitcoin.As explained in the footnotes:As the data clearly shows, Bitcoin is the winner in risk-return metrics against every major asset and index over the past 12 months. A similar outcome also takes place when using a five-year time frame.Therefore, Zhao may have simply incorrectly stated that Bitcoin's volatility is similar to the stock of trillion-dollar companies. However, when adjusting the metric based on returns, it is the incontestable winner.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

227,"Over the past week, several traders bought Dogecoin (DOGE) leading up to Elon Musk’s Saturday Night Live appearance as they expected a pump. However, the mention of Dogecoin during the monologue by Musk did not produce the rally traders were looking for and professional traders may have dumped their positions on novice traders who were expecting a breakout. Dogecoin dumped to an intraday low at $0.41 today, losing over 34% from the previous day’s close. Since then, the meme coin has been trying to stage a recovery and has risen to $0.54. The sharp fall in Dogecoin price shows that buying the hype, without any major fundamental reason, could result in stomach-churning volatility.On the other hand, Ether (ETH) extended its up-move further, faltering just below $4,000, while Bitcoin (BTC) again fell short of the $60,000 mark, indicating strong selling on every minor rally. A few days of range-bound action in Bitcoin is a positive sign as it may set the stage for the next leg of the uptrend.With Ether leading the altcoin charge, let’s look at the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the short term.Bitcoin broke above the downtrend line on May 8 but the bulls are finding it difficult to clear the hurdle at $58,966.53. The immediate support on the downside is at the moving averages. If the price rebounds off the 20-day exponential moving average ($56,387), the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above $58,966.53.If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could start its journey toward the resistance line of the ascending channel at $67,000. The price has turned down from the resistance line on two previous occasions, hence the bears will again try to defend this level. The momentum will pick up after the buyers push the price above the channel.However, the flattish moving averages and the relative strength index close to the midpoint show a lack of bullish momentum. If the bears pull the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair could drop to $52,323.21.A strong rebound off this level will suggest buying at lower levels and that could result in a range-bound action between $52,323.21 and $58,966.53 for a few days.On the other contrary, a break below $52,323.21 may open the doors for a fall to the support line of the ascending channel and then to $46,985 where buyers may step in to arrest the decline.The 4-hour chart shows the bears are defending the $58,966.53 overhead resistance. If they can sink the price below the 50-simple moving average, the pair could drop to $55,000 and then to $52,323.21.The flattish moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. However, if the price rebounds off the current level and rises above $58,966.53, the pair could pick up momentum and rally toward the target objective at $65,012.18.Binance Coin (BNB) is in a strong uptrend and the moving averages indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside. Although the negative divergence on the RSI is flashing a warning sign, the setup will not come into play until the price retreats and shows weakness.If the bulls thrust the price above $680, the BNB/USDT pair may start the next leg of the uptrend that could reach $808.57. This positive view will invalidate if the pair turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($592).If that happens, the short-term traders may dump their positions, resulting in a decline to the 50-day SMA ($466). This is an important support to watch out for because the price has not closed below the 50-day SMA since Dec. 13, 2020. A break below $428 may signal that a top is in place.The 4-hour chart shows the pair is stuck between $600 and $680. The 20-EMA has started to turn up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating the bulls have the upper hand. If the bulls can push and close the price above $680, the pair may rally to $760.Alternatively, if the price turns down from the current level and slips below the moving averages, the pair may correct to $600. A bounce off this level could extend the consolidation for a few more days.Cardano (ADA) had been stuck between the $1 to $1.48 range for the past many weeks, before breaking out on May 6. This suggests the equilibrium between the bulls and the bears resolved in favor of the buyers.That does not mean the bears have given up yet. They attempted to pull the price back below $1.48 on May 7 and today. However, the long tail on the day’s candlestick suggests the bulls have successfully flipped $1.48 into support.If the buyers sustain the price above $1.74, the ADA/USDT pair could rally to $2 and then $2.25. This bullish view will nullify if the price turns down and slips below the 20-day EMA ($1.42). Such a move could trap the aggressive bulls, resulting in a drop to $1. A rebound off this level could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days.The moving averages on the 4-hour chart are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating the bulls are in control. If the buyers sustain the price above $1.75, the momentum may pick up.Conversely, if the price turns down from the current level, the pair may drop to the 20-EMA and then to the $1.48 support. A bounce off this support could result in a tight range trading between $1.48 and $1.75. The short-term bullish sentiment may nullify if the bears sink the price below the 50-SMA.Litecoin (LTC) has been trading inside an ascending broadening wedge pattern. Although the bears have been defending the resistance line of the wedge for the past few days, the positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground.If the bulls can drive and sustain the price above $372.53, the LTC/USDT pair could start the next leg of the uptrend which could reach $400 and then $463.31. The rising moving averages and the RSI in the overbought territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above the resistance line, the short-term traders may dump their positions. That may result in a drop to the 20-day EMA ($298). A break below this support could open the gates for a decline to the 50-day SMA ($247).The 4-hour chart shows the pair is consolidating between $330.50 and $372.50. The bears have successfully defended the overhead resistance and are pulling the price toward the 20-EMA. If the price rebounds off this support, the bulls will make another attempt to resume the uptrend.Conversely, a break below the 20-EMA could pull the price down to $330.50. A rebound off this support may extend the stay of the pair inside the range for a few more days. On the other hand, a break and close below $330.50 could signal the start of a deeper correction. The first support is at the 50-SMA and then $290.Chainlink (LINK) is in an uptrend and it had hit a new all-time high at $51.96 on May 7. During a strong uptrend, corrections are shallow and the price tends to consolidate in a tight range before resuming the up-move.The long wick on the May 7 candlestick showed selling at higher levels and that was followed by an inside-day candlestick pattern on May 8, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. However, the upsloping 20-day EMA ($42) and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest that bulls have the upper hand.If the bulls can sustain the price above $51.96, the LINK/USDT pair could resume its uptrend. The next target objective on the upside is $66.74.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks the $46 support, the pair may drop to the 20-day EMA. A strong bounce off this support will suggest the sentiment remains positive. However, a break below the 20-day EMA will indicate the short-term momentum has weakened and a drop to the 50-day SMA ($35) is likely.The 4-hour chart shows the price has broken out of the $46 to $50 range. This suggests the start of the next leg of the uptrend, which has an immediate target at $54. The 20-EMA has started to turn up and the RSI is above 67, indicating the bulls are in control.However, if the price turns down and slips below $50, it will indicate the markets have rejected the higher levels. That may result in further selling that could pull the price down to the 50-SMA. A break below this level will suggest advantage to the bears.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

228,"Since 2013 the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Fund (GBTC) has offered its investors exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) through a publicly quoted private instrument. However, the trust's convertibility and liquidity vastly differ from an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF).Trusts are structured as companies, at least in regulatory form, and are 'closed-end funds' which can initially only be sold to accredited investors. This means the number of available shares is limited, and retail traders can only access them via secondary markets. Furthermore, a GBTC share cannot be redeemed for the underlying BTC position.Historically, GBTC used to trade above the equivalent BTC held by the fund, which was caused by the retail crowd's excess demand. The common practice for institutional clients was to buy shares directly from Grayscale at par and sell at a profit after the six-month lock-up period.During most of 2020, GBTC shares traded at a premium to its Net Asset Value (NAV), which varied from 5% to 40%. However, this situation drastically changed in March 2021. The approval of two Bitcoin ETFs in Canada heavily contributed to extinguishing the GBTC premium.ETF funds are less risky and cheaper compared to trusts. Moreover, there is no lock-up period, and retail investors can attain direct access to buy shares at par. Therefore, the emergence of a better Bitcoin investment vehicle seized much of allure that GBTC once possessed.In late February, the GBTC premium entered adverse terrain, and holders began desperately flipping their positions to avoid getting stuck in an expensive and non-redeemable instrument. The situation deteriorated up to an 18% discount despite BTC price reaching an all-time high in mid-March.On March 10, Digital Currency Group (DCG), Grayscale Investments' parent company, announced a plan to purchase up to $250 million of the outstanding GBTC shares. Although the conglomerate did not specify the reason behind the move, the excessive discount certainly would have pressured their reputation.As the situation deteriorated, Grayscale announced a roadmap for turning its trust funds into a U.S. ETF, although no specific guarantees or deadlines have been informed.On May 3, the firm announced that it had purchased $193.5 million worth of GBTC shares by April. Moreover, DCG increased its GBTC shares repurchase potential to $750 million.Considering the $36.3 billion in assets under management for the GBTC trust, there's reason to believe that buying $500 million worth of shares might not be enough to ease the price discount.Because of this, some important questions arise. For example, can DCG lose money by making such a trade? Who's desperately selling, and is a conversion to an ETF being analyzed?Apart from a few funds that regularly report their holdings, there's no way to know who has been selling GBTC below net asset value. The only investors with 5% or more holdings are BlockFi and Three Arrows Capital, but none have reported reducing their position.Therefore, it could be potentially multiple retail sellers exiting the product at any cost, but it is impossible to know right now.While buying GBTC at a 10% or larger discount might seem a bargain at first, investors must remember that as of now, there's no way of getting out of those shares apart from selling it at the market.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

229,"In an August 2020 paper “Is bitcoin money?” Peter Hazlett and William Luther wrote that there exists only “a small corner of the internet where transactions are routinely conducted with Bitcoin serving as the medium of exchange.” But that corner may be growing into a room, or even a house now. “Demand for Bitcoin has certainly grown over the last year,” co-author Luther, assistant professor of economics at Florida Atlantic University, told Cointelegraph in a recent conversation. “As new users find themselves with Bitcoin, and existing users find themselves with more Bitcoin, it’s only natural that more people will consider using it to make payments.”Others see a recent rise in crypto payment options. “Definitely,” Joanna Wasick, a partner at law firm BakerHostetler, told Cointelegraph, adding: “More people are owning cryptocurrencies, and more companies are accepting them — sometimes even at an incentive over fiat. There’s also an influx of exchanges and payment platforms facilitating these kinds of transactions. I don’t think that happens without a demand.”This past week, eBay was reported to be exploring crypto payment options, including NFT auctions, while PayPal was said to be discussing the development of its own stablecoin. Elsewhere, Switzerland’s Canton of Zug began recently accepting tax payments in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).“There have certainly been some major announcements from mainstream financial services companies in the past several months that point to the momentum of viewing crypto as a payment option,” Kristin Smith, executive director at the Blockchain Association, told Cointelegraph, citing Visa, PayPal — and from the crypto world — BlockFi.Not all believe that Bitcoin is viable as a medium of exchange, though. Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business, told Cointelegraph: “I don’t see it, and the reasons are simple: It is an incredibly inefficient currency, with transaction costs overwhelming the benefits.”These inefficiencies are likely to multiply, too, as BTC moves closer to its 21-million limit. “It is also far too volatile for people to trust it,” he added — though he doesn’t rule out other cryptocurrencies as potential payments options.St. Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard noted that in the 19th century –– before the American Civil War –– it was common for private United States banks to issue their own notes, a practice analogous to today’s cryptocurrencies, in his view. “They were all trading around [i.e., the banknotes], and they traded at different discounts to each other, and people did not like it at all.” People want a uniform currency like the U.S. dollar, said Bullard.Because Bitcoin has yet to find widespread use as a means of exchange, growing numbers have suggested that its proper role might really be as an alternate store of value, like gold. But Luther, for one, doesn’t think this makes much sense, telling Cointelegraph:To say that Bitcoin can be a store of value today, and possibly a medium of exchange one day — though maybe not — could be putting the cart before the horse. In Luther’s view: “Bitcoin is expected to function as a medium of exchange in the future — that its price fluctuates today as people expect it to be more or less useful as a medium of exchange in the future.” Moreover, he believes that “conditional on its usefulness as a medium of exchange in the future, it might serve as a store of value as well.”Meanwhile, Bitcoin remains the most used crypto payment platform, according to BitPay, which processes some $1 billion annually in crypto payments. In March, Bitcoin accounted for 72% of BitPay’s crypto payments (by number), far ahead of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) (14%) and ETH (10%), which ranked second and third, respectively.There are indeed valid reasons why crypto partisans continue to use BTC for transactions — even while other crypto platforms may be faster with lower fees. “I don’t like spending my Bitcoin, but I know that as soon as I say those words ‘just send me your Bitcoin address’ the transfer will get done quickly and cheaply,” said Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan in a recent newsletter, further adding:Bitcoin today occupies a somewhat unusual role as a “niche medium of exchange,” according to the Cato Institute’s Lawrence White in a blog post. “It is better than other media for making some payments that, even if for legitimate purposes, might be censored if routed through payment systems controlled by national governments and central banks.” A grassroots human rights organization in Belarus, for instance, has used the BTC network to transfer money to striking workers — in a way that the government cannot stop.Others expect that BTC will achieve mainstream acceptance as a payments option. Bill Zielke, chief marketing officer of BitPay, told Cointelegraph that “crypto is already a significant payment method, as more than a billion in volume occurs annually.” Firms such as Newegg and Apmex, both top 100 merchants, already “see a meaningful percentage of their sales in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.”However, more still needs to happen before Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies achieve widespread adoption as payments options. “Most importantly, cryptocurrency needs to become more stable and stop being a speculative vehicle,” said Wasick, adding: “If I think the value of my Bitcoin is going to go up, I’m not going to use it to buy a car. I’m going to sit on it so I can realize more gains.”Damodaran agreed, as individuals who think about using Bitcoin to purchase items worry that their BTC will be worth 30% more in a day or two. Sellers — e.g., merchants — “don’t want to receive it since they are worried about the exact opposite.” Damodaran added: “For a good crypto to make it, it has to get governments to buy in, some version of a trusted authority to reduce transaction costs and [become] less of a speculative game.”Related: Bitcoin’s upcoming Taproot upgrade and why it matters for the network“The two biggest obstacles, in my view, are the volatility of its purchasing power and the relatively small number of transactions it can handle,” Luther told Cointelegraph while going on to add: “Second-layer solutions have gone a long way toward eliminating the second problem — and will no doubt go further. Of course, that means most on-chain Bitcoin transactions would merely be for settlement.”“There are regulatory issues that we believe would encourage broader adoption, such as adopting a de minimis exemption for cryptocurrency transactions,” added Smith. For example, cryptocurrency transactions of less than $200 might be exempt from taxation.“The regulatory regime needs to change or at least become clearer to people,” said Wasick, in addition to raising a question: “How many people using crypto for payments know exactly what the tax implications are of their payment transactions?”But what about Bullard’s contention that people aren’t keen to deal with all these private forms of money. What they really want is a uniform currency, like the U.S. dollar.“Bullard has a point — people generally want a uniform currency,” answered Wasick, but Bullard overlooks some key aspects of cryptocurrencies, she added. They are “decentralized and deflationary — or, at least, non-inflationary — by design.” Fiat, by comparison, created and managed by governments, “is by design inflationary. [...] Dollars lose value over time.”Bullard, in Luther’s view, also glosses over some important historical details. Most pre-Civil War banknotes were not discounted, he said — “they typically traded at par.” Only when they circulated far away from the issuing bank were they discounted. Banknotes issued in Chicago, for example, might trade at a discount in New York — but only because it was costly to redeem them. Luther further explained:Banks would have liked to provide closer redemption options, but regulatory restrictions on branch banking didn’t allow it. According to Luther: “Far from demonstrating an uncompromising desire for a uniform redeemable currency, as Bullard claims, the historical evidence suggests that many redeemable currencies might prevail, even under a poor regulatory regime that makes them perform far worse than they otherwise would.”Still, the volatility problem with crypto persists, which is why some believe the solution for crypto as a payment mechanism starts with stablecoins. “We do see use of stablecoins growing,” answered Zielke, adding: “Accepting or paying with stablecoins opens up new possibilities for global businesses that require the stability of the dollar but the security, speed and efficiency of blockchain payments.”“I like the idea of stablecoins,” said Luther. But as is the case with traditional cryptocurrencies, they still need some improvements. “For one, they tend to be stable relative to the dollar, which by definition means they will never be managed better than the dollar.” A second concern is “they typically require one to trust the issuer to manage the supply appropriately — a risky proposition,” said Luther.Related: The way of the stablecoin: A journey toward stability, trust and decentralizationDamodaran was skeptical about the utility of stablecoins, which he described as “solutions in search of problems,” further adding: “Of all the problems in the world, not having a currency that works is not in the top 100 in much of the world.”But it is a problem in some locales, which is why Smith, for one, believes that crypto as a payment option may first catch on widely “in other, non-U.S. jurisdictions,” especially countries that “do not have the same access to payment systems that make internal transactions simple.”Meanwhile, White listed some other current BTC use cases, including “fundraising by activists in Nigeria, Hong Kong and Russia, savings expatriation by people fleeing Venezuela, remittances into Iran, and peer-to-peer transfers within China among people seeking to avoid state financial surveillance.” He concluded: “Such uses — together with forecasts of wider future use — are enough to sustain Bitcoin’s positive market value.”"
230,"When the famous Satoshi Nakamoto first designed his masterpiece, few could possibly have imagined the almost $63,500 peak that sent investors into a frenzy. Even these days, the first-ever cryptocurrency’s price feels hard to believe at times and investors might be pinching themselves every now and then. Taking a seat alongside Bitcoin (BTC) on the roller coaster, altcoins like Litecoin (LTC), Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) joined the ride — and, more recently, DeFi giants Polkadot and Cardano.But for the long haul, looking into the crystal ball, it’s difficult to see the future of a coin shrouded in uncertainty. Ray Dalio raised fair points in his critique of Bitcoin, arguing that uncertainties regarding how governments will react to digital assets supplanting fiat currency in utilization are causes for potential concern down the road. He further argued that the Bitcoin blockchain will soon be outdated, and without any central governance to adapt it to emerging blockchain technology, a superior coin could overtake it.Related: DeFi won’t last long without unlocking Bitcoin’s $250B treasure chestAnd that nails home the point: Bitcoin’s underlying blockchain protocols are very limiting in terms of enabling broader financial applications. It would be unfathomable to operate a massive DeFi ecosystem on top of the Bitcoin blockchain given Bitcoin’s proof-of-work transaction consensus algorithm.Despite its limitations, it’s difficult to predict whether innovative advances in competing coins’ blockchains will be enough to overtake Bitcoin’s success. It all hinges on the utility factor: Will crypto stay a store of value, or will it become a viable alternative for exchanging value?Related: Did Bitcoin prove itself to be a reliable store of value in 2020? Experts answerSince the dawn of Bitcoin just over a decade ago, the blockchain industry has given rise to hundreds of different projects, with each one aiming to forge a new coin into stardom. Many succeeded in the long term. Ether, the second closest coin in value to Bitcoin, continued hitting new all-time highs throughout April, validating not just the coin’s potential as a store of value asset but also Ethereum’s potential as a blockchain network.Related: Where does the future of DeFi belong: Ethereum or Bitcoin? Experts answerSimilar to Ethereum, a number of projects aimed to emulate the titan that Vitalik Buterin and his associates built, such as Cardano, EOS and, most recently, the hot and popular Polkadot. Each project tries to build off the limitations of the other to varying degrees of success. Hype has been the majority of what’s been delivered to users, as only time will reveal the true validity of these projects.Regardless of the blockchain projects and their creative names, they’ve spurred on an ecosystem of collaborative development. Together, they’ve created decentralized apps, or DApps, that can bring the unbanked out of the doldrums of impoverishment, opportunity to the financially excluded and new investment avenues to the already-savvy.Related: It’s time to put the dukes down and work together for blockchain’s futureThe flourishing of coins and DApps serves up plenty of optimism to many outsiders looking in, offering hope that there is real potential to foster a booming decentralized finance ecosystem — or at least a hybrid of it combined with centralized markets. But it’s all thanks to belief in Bitcoin’s value, which is the fixation point of many investors.Related: Was 2020 a ’DeFi year,’ and what is expected from the sector in 2021? Experts answerWhat drove the inquisitiveness of investors, developers and crypto enthusiasts alike was the appeal of Bitcoin as a store of value. Against fiat currencies, Bitcoin is deflationary; so, during periods like the COVID-19 pandemic, Bitcoin’s appeal turned white-hot.Related: How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the crypto space? Experts answerWhile discussions about Ethereum, Polkadot and other blockchain platforms caught the attention of the DeFi world, many outsiders remained numb to them and fixated on the coin prices. And that’s why Bitcoin’s appeal stays as a store of value, for the most part.Related: The butterfly effect: Why DeFi will force BTC to break its 21M supply ceilingMany ordinary retail investors and institutional investors don’t have a firm grasp on crypto’s inner workings. According to a Cardify survey, only 16.9% of crypto investors “fully understand” it, while just over 33% of them have limited or “zero knowledge.” Over 40% of crypto investors are newbies who are riding the hype wave. It’s arguable that the entry barriers to the DeFi world are quite high and literacy is rather hard to attain, but that’s a story for another time.Related: Institutional investors won’t take Bitcoin mainstream — You willMoreover, institutional investors remain wary of the volatility issues facing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, with ongoing predictions of an imminent bubble — another signal that underlying blockchain technologies are less of a priority. And this is precisely why other coins will not overtake Bitcoin. So long as the mainstream fixation remains pinned to coin value and not underlying blockchain value, Bitcoin will stand atop the cryptocurrency podium. Whether investors can become more literate in the inner workings of the DeFi world will determine how much value investors will find in the underlying technologies of new and emerging coins.For now, Bitcoin is the king of the hill and will likely stay that way for a long time as the price continues to climb and mainstream investors hop on board.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

231,"While the cryptocurrency industry is mostly centered around technology and data, the people who inhabit our sector are not without their creativity. This is seen not only in the various solutions and inventions they create, but also in their artistic (and often humorous) works.Over the years, folks of the crypto space have crafted songs based on distributed technology, as well as its jokes and humor. Some of these songs are parodies of mainstream hits, substituted with crypto lyrics, while others are originals that are unique to the digital asset industry. Here are several crypto-centric songs that are worth a listen.“Bitcoin pls go to moon”A classic in the crypto space, “Bitcoin pls go to moon” came after Bitcoin (BTC) had dropped significantly in price following its 2017 bull run. The YouTube channel 1thousandx posted this lyrical work on Nov. 6, 2018. The song urges Bitcoin to rise in price and “stop going sideways now.” At the time of the song, Bitcoin traded more than $10,000 lower than its then-all-time price high near $20,000, and had been consolidating in that range for a notable period of time, according to TradingView data. The song included sentiments from crypto industry personalities Michael Novogratz and Tone Vays.“Banksters Paradise (A Bitcoin Song)”A song posted by YouTube channel Renegade Investor, “Banksters Paradise (A Bitcoin Song)” is a parody of “Gangsta’s Paradise” by Coolio. The parody details the world as a playground for banksters amid an atmosphere of money printing and inflation, pointing toward Bitcoin as a solution.“BLOCKCHAINIAN RHAPSODY”Queen’s song “Bohemian Rhapsody” is one of the world’s more popular lyrical works. A YouTube channel known as Crypto Karaoke made a crypto-centered parody of the tune. “Bull markets come, bull markets go, HODL high, HODL low,” the song’s lyrics include — differing from the line from the original song: “Easy come, easy go, little high, little low.” The revamped line pays tribute to HODL, a popular term in the crypto space. Although the term has no set definition, it is usually used to mean holding on to assets regardless of market fluctuations.“Old Town Road (Bitcoin Version)”YouTuber Lil Bubble has carved out a niche for himself in doing crypto song parodies. The creator has made numerous song parodies based on the crypto industry. The music videos often include a person dancing in a space suit — a reference to the common industry imagery of assets going “to the moon.”The YouTuber’s most popular song in terms of views on the social media platform is his rendition of “Old Town Road” by Lil Nas X. The parody comedically touches on the struggles of investing and holding assets in the crypto space through the low periods.“HODL GANG”Musical artist Chris Record has put out a lot of different content on his YouTube channel, Chris Record TV, including some musical works. Although not directly focused on crypto, the channel has posted a few musical crypto creations. One such video turns Lil Pump’s song “Gucci Gang” into a Bitcoin rap remix titled “HODL GANG.” Published in December 2017, near the height of the previous crypto bull market, the song talks about various aspects of crypto investing, crypto’s history, and so forth.“BITCONNECT EDM REMIX”Now defunct, Bitconnect was a crypto scam prevalent during the 2017 crypto bull run. Bitconnect ran an event at which Carlos Matos, one of the project’s investors, gave a speech that started off with exuberant singing, yelling, and generally hilarious showmanship. The speech subsequently became meme-worthy content. Through his YouTube channel, musical artist Dylan Locke made an electronic dance music, or EDM, song based on Matos’ speech.These are just a few examples of the industry’s creative musical and comedic talent. As crypto continues to gain mainstream attention, we can only hope that dulcet tones continue to proliferate for years to come."
232,"Goldman Sachs has started offering its clients access to Bitcoin (BTC) trading through non-deliverable forwards, according to Bloomberg Law. Max Minton, Goldman's Asia-Pacific head of digital assets, said that “institutional demand continues to grow significantly in this space.”Even Citigroup plans to introduce crypto-related services due to the increasing demand from asset managers and hedge funds. Although inquiries about Bitcoin surged in August 2020, the investment bank has been slow to jump into the crypto market. Citigroup’s global head of foreign exchange, Itay Tuchman told the Financial Times that “crypto is here to stay and that we are just at the very beginning of the market.”Long-term investors view dips as an opportunity to build their portfolio at favorable prices. These investors seem to be using the current correction in Bitcoin to buy. Glassnode data shows that 12,354 Bitcoin were withdrawn from Coinbase, with the intention of possibly being held in cold wallets for the long term.While Bitcoin seems to be in accumulation mode, altcoins have continued their stellar run. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to ascertain whether the altcoins have room to run or is a correction around the corner.Bitcoin is facing stiff resistance near the downtrend line but a positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to sustain below the 20-day exponential moving average ($56,036). This indicates that traders are buying on every minor dip.If the bulls drive the price above the downtrend line and the $58,966.53 resistance, the BTC/USDT pair could pick up momentum and challenge the all-time high at $64,849.27. A breakout and close above this level will suggest the start of the next leg of the uptrend.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-day EMA, the pair could drop to $52,323.21. A bounce off of this support will imply that the pair may consolidate between $52,323.21 and $58,966.53 for a few days.The flat moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) just above the midpoint indicate the likelihood of a range-bound action in the short term. The possibility of a deeper correction will increase if the bears sink the price below $52,323.21.Ether (ETH) remains in a strong uptrend. The correction on May 4 was short-lived as the bulls pushed the price to a new all-time high on May 5 and followed it up with another up-move on May 6. This shows the momentum remains strong and traders are buying on every minor dip.If the buyers drive the price above $3,607.14, the ETH/USDT pair could continue its northward march toward the next target objective at $4,528.97.However, after the recent run-up, the price is trading way above the 50-day simple moving average ($2,289), implying that the pair is over-extended in the short term. A break below the $3,165.30 support will be the first sign of a correction to the 20-day EMA ($2,886).A strong rebound off this support will suggest the sentiment remains bullish and traders are buying on dips as they anticipate the rally to continue. Conversely, a break below the 20-day EMA will indicate exhaustion and result in a drop to the 50-day SMA.Binance Coin (BNB) remains in an uptrend but the negative divergence on the RSI signals that the momentum is weakening. The recovery on May 5 fizzled out at $656, suggesting that higher levels are attracting selling from traders.If the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA ($579), the short-term traders may rush to the exit. That could intensify the selling and pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($451).Contrary to this assumption, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will try to resume the uptrend. A break above $680 could clear the path for a rally to $808.57.Dogecoin (DOGE) is in a strong uptrend. The bears could not even drag the price down to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.49, implying that the bulls are not waiting for a deeper correction to buy.Buyers are trying to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above the $0.69 overhead resistance. If they succeed, the DOGE/USDT pair could start its journey toward the target objective at $1.05.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, it will suggest that traders are closing their positions on rallies. The bullish momentum may weaken if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.39).XRP broke above the downtrend line on May 6 and May 7 but the long wick on the candlesticks suggests traders are booking profits at higher levels. The bears are currently attempting to pull the price back below the downtrend line.If they succeed, the XRP/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($1.43). The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest the bulls have the upper hand.A strong rebound off this support will indicate the sentiment remains positive. If the buyers push and sustain the price above the downtrend line, the pair may rise to $1.96. A breakout of this level could start the next leg of the uptrend.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and slips below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that supply exceeds demand. That could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($1.09).Cardano (ADA) soared above the $1.48 resistance on May 6, which signaled the resumption of the uptrend. The bears tried to pull the price down today but the long tail on the candlestick suggests strong buying near the breakout level at $1.48.The 20-day EMA ($1.36) has started to turn up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, indicating the path of least resistance is to the upside. The first target on the upside is $2 and if that level is crossed, the uptrend may reach $2.25.This bullish view will invalidate if the ADA/USDT pair turns down from the current level and breaks below $1.48. Such a move could trap the aggressive bulls and result in a drop to the moving averages.Polkadot (DOT) reached the $42.28 overhead resistance on May 6 where the bears are trying to stall the up-move. The altcoin has formed an inside-day candlestick pattern today, which suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for DOT on May 5, prior to the recent price rise.The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for DOT flipped green on May 5 when the price was $36.18, well before the indication of any rally.Since then, the VORTECS™ Score has largely remained in the green and DOT rallied to $42.47 on May 6, a 17% gain in two days.A breakout and close above $42.28 will suggest the bulls have overcome the resistance from the bears. That could push the DOT/USDT pair to the all-time high at $48.36. A breakout of this resistance will suggest the start of the next leg of the up-move.Contrary to this assumption, if the price again turns down from $42.28, the pair may drop to the moving averages. A strong bounce off this support will indicate demand at lower levels and the bulls will make one more attempt to propel the pair to $48.36.The 20-day EMA ($37) has started to turn up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating a minor advantage to the buyers. This bullish view will nullify if the bears sink the pair below $34.36. Such a move could result in a drop to $26.50.After the strong surge on May 5 and 6, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently witnessing profit-booking. The first support on the downside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,263.10.If the BCH/USDT pair rebounds off this level, it will suggest the sentiment remains positive and traders are accumulating at lower levels. The bulls will then try to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $1,600.89. If they succeed, the pair could rally to $2,147.36.This positive view will invalidate if the pair plummets and sustains below the breakout level at $1,213.51. That could result in a drop to the 20-day EMA ($1,030) where buying is likely to resume.Litecoin (LTC) has been facing selling near the resistance line of the ascending broadening wedge pattern for the past two days. Although the bears tried to start a correction on May 6, the long tail on the candlestick shows strong buying at lower levels.If the buyers can thrust and sustain the price above the wedge, the LTC/USDT pair is likely to race ahead to $400 and then $463.31. However, the rally of the past few days has pushed the RSI above 74, indicating the possibility of a minor correction or consolidation.The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below $318.87. That could pull the price down to the 20-day EMA ($286). If this support also cracks, the decline may extend to the support line of the wedge.Uniswap (UNI) turned down from $44.90 on May 5, suggesting profit-booking at higher levels. The bears tried to pounce on the opportunity and sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($38.68) today.However, the long tail on the day’s candlestick indicates strong buying at the 20-day EMA. This suggests the sentiment remains positive and the bulls are buying on dips. The buyers will now try to push the price above $45.If they succeed, it will signal that correction is over and the pair is ready to climb to the resistance line of the channel at $51.50.Conversely, if the price again turns down from $45, the UNI/USDT pair may consolidate in a tight range for a few days. A break and close below the 20-day EMA will be the first sign of weakness and that could result in a drop to the support line of the channel.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

233,"While a vast majority of crypto enthusiasts around the globe seem to be gushing about Ether (ETH) at the moment and how its upcoming London hard fork stands to push the premier altcoin’s value even higher, reports have recently surfaced that suggest Bitcoin’s much-awaited Taproot upgrade will go live also sometime by the end of this year.In this regard, many Bitcoin (BTC) mining pools seem to already be signaling their support for the activation and as per data available on Taproot.watch, a website designed by core Bitcoin developer Hampus Sjöberg, Taproot signaling currently accounts for about 56% of BTC’s total hashing power.It should be mentioned that two of the largest Bitcoin mining pools by hash rate — AntPool and F2Pool — have been major proponents for this upgrade from the very beginning. Even other relatively large mining operators, such as Foundry USA and Slush Pool, have also expressed their support for the activation.In its most basic sense, Taproot can be thought of as the latest step in Bitcoin’s evolutionary path because the upgrade seeks not only to enhance the overall usability of the network by making transactions cheaper, faster and easier to deploy but also eventually allow for the deployment of smart contracts.Furthermore, Taproot also proposes significant privacy promises — i.e., it seeks to make all transactions look the same to everyone except the transacting parties. This potential camouflage-based framework seems as though it has been inspired by security-centric crypto offerings available in the market today, thus potentially moving Bitcoin closer to some privacy-focused coins, at least from a design standpoint.On the subject, Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner at crypto lending platform Nexo, told Cointelegraph that the proposed Taproot update is proof of Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and that the network is always looking to improve and grow. He also believes that the upgrade serves as a reminder to investors that, unlike gold, Bitcoin is a dynamic store of value in every sense, adding:Joel Edgerton, chief operating officer of cryptocurrency exchange bitFlyer USA, told Cointelegraph that even though most in the crypto community seem to be focused on Bitcoin’s price action at the moment, what they are overlooking is the fact that BTC’s underlying technology is what actually gives it its value, and Taproot is an important development, for several reasons:In Edgerton’s view, Taproot demonstrates the Bitcoin community’s maturity and how everyone seems to have learned valuable lessons from the Bitcoin upgrade wars of 2017 — i.e., it is of utmost importance to plan and implement upgrades via the use of a decentralized, community-based vote.Back in 2017, Bitcoin underwent a hard-fork, resulting in the creation of a new cryptocurrency called Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Although the process was quite straightforward, the period leading up to the hard fork was full of strife, with many core community members clashing with one another.On paper, Taproot is an elegant engineering solution that has been devised using proven cryptographic foundations that can help provide several evolutionary improvements to the Bitcoin protocol.Lior Yaffe, CEO of blockchain software company firm Jelurida, pointed out to Cointelegraph that by combining Schnorr signatures and Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees, or MAST, Taproot is able to convert the representation of complex Bitcoin transactions, such as multi-signature transactions and transactions used to set up a Lightning channel, to look just like a regular Bitcoin transaction when submitted on-chain.In cryptography, a Schnorr signature is easily “provably fair” and is functionally superior to conventional logarithmic signatures, which are routinely faced with intractability-related issues. Similarly, MAST are unique digital offerings that allow for the deployment of various user-selected conditions that must be fulfilled in order for an encumbered number of Bitcoins to be spent.Overall, this reduces storage and can indirectly lower fees for these transaction types. Also, in the long run, when its usage becomes widespread, Taproot may be able to significantly improve privacy for Lightning and multi-signature users. “From an ecosystem perspective, I view Taproot as an all-in attempt by the Bitcoin devs and community to finally make the Lighting network a mainstream payment platform,” Yaffe added.Another aspect of the proposed upgrade worth considering is whether or not Taproot will have any major effect on Bitcoin’s future price action. In this regard, Edgerton does not see the activation having any sort of short-term impact on Bitcoin’s value. He does believe, however, that the “under the hood” changes that will come as a result of this update will make the Bitcoin network way more functional and competitive.Yaffe believes that in the long term, improving Lightning network adoption — i.e., by reducing transaction fees and settlement times — will keep Bitcoin and its ecosystem as a relevant internet era payment method, adding further:Lastly, Siddharth Menon, co-founder and chief operating officer of cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, told Cointelegraph that since 2010, the latest Taproot upgrade has been highly anticipated and stands to have a positive impact on the currency. “Slowly but steadily, this network gets better every day,” he added.Per Bitcoin’s community consensus, the aforementioned Taproot activation will only be given the green light if 90% of all mined blocks include an activation signal within a difficulty adjustment window (2,016 blocks). More specifically, the consensus agreement needs to take place during one of the difficulty epochs between now and Aug. 11 so that the network upgrade can go ahead as planned in November.As of May 7, a total of 327 signaling blocks have emerged in the current window, while miners responsible for 610 blocks have chosen not to include a “signal bit.” The “no” votes issued by these miners currently account for 30% of the 2,016 blocks in the current difficulty window. Some pools that have so far voted against the activation include big names such as Poolin, Binance Pool, BTC.com, viaBTC and HuobiBTC."
234,"Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, has warned crypto investors of the dangers of participating in the market.Speaking during a conference on Thursday, Bailey balked at the notion of “cryptocurrencies,” stating that “crypto assets” was a more suitable nomenclature for describing digital currencies.The BoE governor espoused well-worn anti-crypto rhetoric, specifically the argument that cryptocurrencies lacked intrinsic value. “I would only emphasize what I’ve said quite a few times in recent years, [and] I’m afraid they have no intrinsic value,” Bailey added.Delivering his stark warning to crypto investors, Bailey said:The BoE governor’s remarks bear a close resemblance to statements issued by the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the FCA warned the British public of the risk of incurring huge losses from crypto investments back in January.At the time, the crypto market was in the throes of a significant correction as Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $33,000. Since then, the total crypto market capitalization has grown almost three-fold and is currently above $2.3 trillion.Bailey’s comments are coming amid a massive spike in crypto prices, especially for altcoins, with Ether (ETH) setting a new all-time high. Major altcoins such as Polkadot’s DOT, Chainlink’s LINK and XRP have also seen vertical price actions.The BoE governor touched on the current mania despite the apparent lack of intrinsic value, adding: “Now that doesn’t mean to say people don’t put value on them, because they can have extrinsic value.”Indeed, Dogecoin (DOGE), arguably the quintessential “meme coin,” is up more than 12,700% year-to-date.While the BoE governor might not think much of the value proposition of crypto, the country’s tax authority is not neglecting the possibility of valuable digital currencies being used to evade taxes.Back in April, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs announced plans to upscale its policing of would-be cryptocurrency tax evaders in a manner reminiscent of the United States Internal Revenue Service’s “crypto question.”"
235,"Another day, another spike in Bitcoin (BTC) leaving major exchange Coinbase as funds pour into the largest cryptocurrency.Data from on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode showed 12,354 BTC ($694 million) being withdrawn from the Coinbase order book in a single hour on Friday.As the largest exchange in the United States, Coinbase has frequently been the venue for major Bitcoin buy-ins this year.As Cointelegraph reported, sudden tranches in excess of 10,000 BTC heading to private wallets is far from unheard of but nonetheless demonstrates a desire to at least store Bitcoin for the long term instead of keeping it within easy reach of a point of sale.For analyst Lex Moskovski, the type of investor behind such transactions remains uncertain — it could be a private individual or small group, as well as an institutional investor or corporate client.“Institutions or not, that’s still a significant outflow,” he commented on the Glassnode data.The data comes hand in hand with on-chain indicators staying firmly bullish. This week, Glassnode co-founder Rafael Schultze-Kraft highlighted a surge in Bitcoin’s so-called realized cap (Rcap) likewise supporting the broad buying thesis.The realized cap is a measure of Bitcoin’s market capitalization based on the price at which each coin last moved. It provides a useful insight into the market composition and trader sentiment and produces a significantly different total to the traditional market cap.“Unprecedented capital inflows into Bitcoin as measured by realized capitalization,” Schultze-Kraft tweeted on Friday.He added that realized cap has increased by the same amount as the entire traditional market cap of Bitcoin as measured in December 2020.Relative to traditional cap, however, Rcap can still increase significantly before signalling the top of the bull market. MVRV, which measures the ratio of the two metrics, measured 4.4 this week, compared to 7.6 in February and over 10 at past market cycle tops. “We have yet to experience true fomo yet from institutions. It’s coming,” Timothy Kim responded to the Glassnode numbers."
236,"Crypto exchanges with a presence in Turkey must now inform the Financial Crimes Investigation Board, or MASAK, about any crypto transactions over 10,000 Turkish liras ($1,200). Turkish Minister of Treasury and Finance Lütfi Elvan announced the new policy on a CNN Turk live broadcast last night. Two weeks after a $150-million fraud involving a major crypto exchange in Turkey, Elvan shared updates on the government’s draft crypto regulation on live TV. Turkey’s central bank has defined crypto as a nonmonetary asset and banned the use of cryptocurrency as a form of payment. Elvan noted that the second step was to grant MASAK the authority to audit and oversee crypto exchanges.According to Elvan, MASAK has prepared a guideline for crypto exchanges that includes the rules and penalties for reporting transactions. “MASAK has full audit authority over crypto exchanges,” Elvan said. “Crypto trading platforms are now obliged to share the information of their active users with MASAK. They are liable for any suspicious activities on their platforms. They are also responsible for notifying MASAK about any transactions worth over 10,000 Turkish liras in 10 days after the trading.”Elvan announced that a legal draft has been prepared in cooperation with the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency, Capital Markets Board and Revenue Administration under the presidency of the deputy minister, as Cointelegraph reported last month. According to Elvan, opinions from local experts and crypto exchange representatives were also taken during the study. The final draft will be soon ready for approval by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, he added.In April, Cointelegraph reported that Turkish police detained 62 people following the Thodex crypto exchange fraud. According to the local experts, Turkey needs a clear regulation and fair taxing regarding crypto to avoid further victimization of local crypto users. "
237,"The price of EOS is in the double digits for the first time since mid-2018 after a parabolic advance that began back in March.According to data from CoinGecko, the 20th-ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently sitting above $11.50, delivering close to 100% gains over the last three days.First, the current EOS upward advance is occurring at the intersection of two unique price trends. On the one hand, the EOS/USDT trading pair is at the top of the range for 2021, while the token price against Bitcoin (BTC) fell to its lowest level in three years back in early March.As of the time of writing, the EOS/BTC price action chart has broken an almost three-year downtrend, signaling the possibility for significant upward movement.Secondly, with Bitcoin dominance continuing to slide amid massive altcoin gains, the market cycle appears to have large-cap tokens on the ascendency. Indeed, major alts like Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Chainlink's LINK and Polkadot's DOT have experienced rapid price surges.These altcoin gains have been further boosted by Ether (ETH) setting new all-time highs.EOS is following the pattern, gaining enough momentum to show significant price action strength against Bitcoin. As of the time of writing, the EOS/BTC trading pair is up 76% in the past 24-hour trading period.A third likely reason for the EOS breakout can be attributed to the recent staking rewards announcement. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the EOS community is considering a proposal to increase staking rewards.The recommendation for increasing the staking reward was based on a report commissioned by Block.one. The proposal could be the next major development on the EOS network after the PowerUp model that allows users to pay a one-time transaction fee for 24 hours."
238,"Citigroup is reportedly considering offering crypto-related services to its customers in response to rising demand, specifically from asset managers and hedge funds.The financial services firm’s global head of foreign exchange, Itay Tuchman, told the Financial Times on Friday that the investment bank was already exploring the possibility of providing crypto services to its clients.Trading, financing and custody services are being discussed, but Tuchman said the firm would not be rushed into launching something that could worry regulators.“We shouldn’t do anything that’s not safe and sound. We will jump in when we are confident that we can build something that benefits clients and that regulators can support,” he said.Tuchman said the bank witnessed an increase in the number of clients inquiring about Bitcoin (BTC), starting in August 2020. At the time, the coin price had just climbed 33% in the span of a month, from $9,000 to $12,000, and the global cryptocurrency market capitalization was around one-tenth of what it is now.But Citigroup is apparently in no hurry to jump on the bandwagon, even with Bitcoin currently perched at $55,000. Tuchman said the firm wouldn’t fall victim to its own fear of missing out and would instead play the long game with cryptocurrency, which the bank believes will still be around for quite a while.“I don’t have any FOMO [fear of missing out], because I believe that crypto is here to stay and that we are just at the very beginning of the market. This isn’t a space race. There is room for more than just one flag,” said Tuchman."
239,"The “original” yet ironically ""wrong"" Ethereum and Telcoin (TEL) are leading a fresh altcoin surge this week. Bitcoin (BTC) fans are already calling time on the fun.Ethereum Classic (ETC), the pet favorite of Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert, is up 300% in a week.In the latest incarnation of the 2021 “alt season,” altcoins are passing the torch between each other as investors chase optimal gains.This year has also seen a curious shift in market focus from a token’s use case to the culture around it. This was epitomized with Dogecoin (DOGE), the high flyer of 2021, which has gained over 7,000% since January.Memes and other social triggers likewise seem to be driving progress in this week’s round of breakouts, with ETC exploding in value without any noticeable changes. TEL has benefited from a successful layer-2 migration.“Casino market hypothesis,” Blockstream CEO Adam Back responded during a Twitter debate about why the altcoin market was delivering such results.As Cointelegraph reported, Back had also referred to luck of the draw as driving DOGE’s rise in fortunes.Others noted that investment in ETC, in particular, may not only be short-sighted but dangerous: in its four-year existence, its blockchain has suffered multiple 51% attacks, pointing to a lack of security and resilience which is absent from Bitcoin and the “newer” Ethereum (ETH).Price volatility was also recorded, with ETC trading at a giant 50% premium on Coinbase as prices took off on Wednesday.Nonetheless, fans were unperturbed and appeared not to be in a hurry to exit their positions.Last week, dad told me he bought $ETC at $30 and I told him he bought the wrong Ethereum and there's no usecase or adoption at all.
He sold it immediately after and it's now at $140.
Gonna disown myself first before he gets to do it.Silbert himself reminded Twitter followers of ETC’s price journey since inception in 2016 — from $0.50 to over $180, and a three-year high against Bitcoin.Asked if he was “happy” with what had happened, Silbert said that Thursday had been a “good day.”ETC is now the 13th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, having begun the year in 38th position. Spillover from increased interest in ETH is a constant topic when it comes to its legacy parent, with data from sentiment resource TheTIE showing that ETH tweet volumes surpassed those involving BTC for the first time.Meanwhile, Bitcoin is repeating moves of a different, less favorable kind as the week draws to a close. Having once again failed to tackle resistance at near $60,000, BTC/USD was back at $56,000 on Friday, having dropped to lows of $55,400.Despite the relative lack of upside, however, longtime market participants remain wholly signed up to the bull market mentality.“BTC, ETH and the whole market keep pumping and pumping, unreal,” Simon Dedic, managing partner at blockchain advisory and investment firm Moonrock Capital, summarized on Thursday.As Cointelegraph reported, many altcoins on the market longest of all have seen a return to form in recent weeks."
240,"Luxury Miami apartment Arte Surfside will now accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment for its remaining luxury residences — including the Villa Nove penthouse, currently listed for $38 million.The firm has partnered with trading platform SolidBlock, allowing potential buyers to pay in multiple cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ether.The region’s “most exclusive” condominium is already home to Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, as well as fashion blogger Arielle Charnas from Something Navy. It’s now attempting to appeal to crypto millionaires and billionaires attracted by Miami's Bitcoin-friendly reputation.According to the announcement, the cheapest condo available starts at $10.3 million, with spaces ranging from three to five bedrooms with access to a 75-foot indoor pool, meditation pond, rooftop tennis court and private temperature-controlled parking spaces. The highest sale to date was $33 million for the penthouse condo — the same one that has just been relisted at $38 million.Developers Sapir Corp noted that a number of top Silicon Valley companies and venture capital firms had moved to the city, and this played a role in the decision to accept cryptocurrencies.Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has already met with ""Dogecoin CEO"" Elon Musk, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Google CEO Eric Schmidt in an effort to convince them to move operations to the Sunshine State. Crypto finance firm XBTO Group has a new office there, Scott Minerd from global investment firm Guggenheim Partners and Peter Thiel associate Keith Rabois have bought property, and venture capitalist Delian Asparouhov joked on social media about moving Silicon Valley to Miami. How can I help? https://t.co/hIC1k8ka1iChairman of Sapir Corp Alex Sapir said the company supported Mayor Suarez’s vision to make Miami a cryptocurrency and technology hub.Over the last year, Suarez has made it clear that he wants to landmark Miami as the country’s crypto center, and he hailed Arte's announcement as the first of many.“The embrace of cryptocurrency and emerging technologies across all sectors of industry is precisely how Miami will become the city of the century,” said Mayor Suarez. “Arte is setting an important precedent, and I won't be surprised to hear similar stories in the near future.”A resolution for a new cryptocurrency task force passed on Thursday, looking at the feasibility of allowing Miami-Dade County to accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment for taxes, fees and services.Next month, Miami will host the world’s largest Bitcoin conference, Bitcoin 2021."
241,"U.S.-based financial services firm, Square Inc, reports that its quarterly earnings doubled analyst expectations amid booming demand for crypto assets.Global financial data provider Refinitiv had predicted Square would see earnings of 16 cents per share in Q1 2021, but the firm ended up earning 41 cents per share. Square saw $5.06 billion in revenue, dwarfing Refinitiv's prediction of $3.36 billion.Bitcoin alone drove $3.5 billion in revenue, an astonishing increase of 1,000% in just 12 months.Square’s quarterly gross profit also surged 79% year-over-year to tag $964 million. More than half of the firm's profits can be attributed to its crypto-friendly payment application, Cash App, which drove $495 million in gross profits — a 171% increase when compared to Q1 2020.While Bitcoin turnover was in the billions, the cryptocurrency represented 2% of the firm’s total gross profit with $75 million.“Bitcoin revenue and gross profit benefited from a year-over-year increase in the price of Bitcoin, Bitcoin activities, and growth in customer demand,” noted the firm.During an earnings call, Square CEO, Jack Dorsey, emphasized the firm’s mission of supporting BTC to become the native currency of the internet, stating:Despite predicting Cash App will continue to see triple-figure growth year-over-year in 2021, Square’s CFO, Amrita Ahuja, noted that government stimulus likely bolstered the recent performance of its payments application.“We believe our customers had greater spending power from government funds, which drove an uplift in inflows in March,” he said, adding: “We have since seen a normalization with inflows down 16% in April, compared to March.”Square became one of the first firms to invest a portion of its treasury into Bitcoin when the firm purchased 4,709 BTC for $50 million in October.While the company’s first BTC buy is now worth $263.7 million, the firm is down $20 million on a further 3,318 BTC it bought in February for $170 million. The firm currently holds $472 million worth of BTC in total."
242,"This weekly roundup of news from Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong attempts to curate the industry’s most important news, including influential projects, changes in the regulatory landscape, and enterprise blockchain integrations.Dogecoin has officially flipped Bitcoin in a few categories here in China, with DOGE trading volume on leading Chinese exchange Huobi surpassing that of leading assets ETH and BTC. On May 6th, according to CoinGecko, DOGE volume made up more than 15% of total exchange volume, whereas BTC and ETH were around 8% each. Searches for ‘Dogecoin’ on WeChat surpassed searches for Bitcoin, with 2.3 million versus 1.7 million on May 5th. Dogecoin has become increasingly appealing to the Chinese retail community since earlier this year as many are attracted to the virality and get-rich-quick potential of the colorful DOGE community.Centralized exchange Hotbit was the victim of a hacking attempt on April 30th. The good news was that assets appear to be safe on the platform. The bad news was that user data was compromised, leading to a corrupted database. Trading, deposits and withdrawals have all been paused while the exchange attempts to restore normality. The Chinese exchange has been communicating actively via Twitter, with the interrupted service lasting potentially another week. Hotbit is well known for listing a diverse range of assets, making it a popular spot among more risk averse investors.Hoo.com became yet another exchange to launch an Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM-based, smart chain, attempting to bridge their CeFi users into the DeFi space. The chain, currently in testnet, boasts low fees of just 0.001 USD per transaction and over 500+ transactions per second, as well as compatibility with Ethereum, BSC, and HECO. Since the start of the year, Hoo’s token has increased by over 350%. Other Chinese exchanges, including OKEx and Gate, have also launched smart chains. Smart chains are proving an attractive way to let users maximize yield while still letting the exchange capture value from the process.English-language and state-run business channel CGTN created a short expository video on blockchain’s growth post-COVID19. The video and article featured a close look at VeChain’s progress in developing business solutions, explaining how the technology could be applied to the food safety and infection control industry. The media company shot a short video inside the office and interviewed a few of the developers, indicating that the company has done well to comply with regulatory requirements in the tightly run country. It’s no secret that VeChain has a top position and close relationship with many government backed organizations, which is an enviable position for any enterprise Blockchain-as-a-Service provider.The Beijing Human Resources and Social Security Bureau recently released the 2021 Beijing Human Resources Market Salary Survey Report (First Quarterly)"". According to the report, new and hot jobs, which included the tech space, had a median average monthly salary mainly in the $3,000 to $4,600 range. Blockchain engineers comfortably eclipsed that with a wage of $6,700 per month, showing the growing demand for the skills. By contrast, the average annual salary of a blockchain developer in the U.S. often exceeds $12,500 per month, according to recruitment firm Hired.com, nearly double the going rate in Beijing.Mining appears to have resumed as normal following the outages after a deadly coal mine accident last month. The incident required rigorous inspections of mining facilities, forcing many ASIC miners to turn off their machines. Hashrates have currently recovered to near the rates they were prior to the incident in the middle of April. One interesting shift, however, is that the industry appears to be gradually shifting from China to North America. F2Pool founder Chun Wang noted that for the first time in 8 years, more than half the BTC hashing power was coming from outside of China. This may have been partially tied to the incident, but is a trend that many experts are following as mining regulations in China appear to be growing stricter."
243,"The cryptocurrency market provides investors with another day of 'altseason' as the majority of altcoins in the top 100 on CoinMarketCap rallied today.Several large-cap tokens reached multi-year highs and this all took place as Bitcoin (BTC) price struggles to hold any of the news-event-driven gains that it has accrued throughout the week. One of the most notable performances has been put on by Ethereum Classic (ETC), the “unaltered” Ethereum (ETH) fork that has been gaining traction over the past week as its dedication to a proof-of-work consensus mechanism attracts the attention of miners and retail 'Robinhood' investors.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that after hitting a low at $86.12 in the early trading hours on Thursday, the price of ETC jumped 81% to reach a new all-time high at $179.83 as the 24-hour trading volume spiked to a record $39.1 billion.Several large-cap cryptocurrencies have seen significant gains recently including, Litecoin (LTC) which hit a one-year high compared to BTC, and a 68% rally in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) which spiked above $1,500 for the first time since May of 2018.Ether also hit a new all-time high at $3,605 as excitement continues to build ahead of the London hard fork and the implementation of EIP-1559, which is expected to take place in July.Major #Ethereum gas fee overhaul #EIP-1559 scheduled for July, in the #London network upgrade https://t.co/mQrxvSt7aa via @cointelegraphCardano’s ADA token is another top 10 project that saw its price reach a new all-time high at $1.69 and Tezos (XTZ) rallied 23% after the start of the trading day to reach a new record high at $8.05.Several of the ‘Ethereum Killers’ that arose out of the 2017-2018 bull market saw double-digit gains including EOS, whose price rallied 50% intraday to a peak of $12.57, and Neo (NEO), which spiked to a high above $128 before a general market pullback led to a dip in the majority of prices.The steady strength shown from altcoins has led to a steady decline in Bitcoin dominance over the past month, which dropped to a low of 45.25% on May 6. According to analysts, this is yet another sign that an altcoin season is in full effect.While institutions appear to heavily favor Bitcoin and to a lesser degree Ether, retail traders have been drawn to lower-priced tokens that offer the possibility of larger gains, as evidenced by the recent price explosion in Dogecoin (DOGE).If this trend continues, it's likely that Bitcoin's dominance rate could continue to slide lower as new funds coming into the cryptocurrency ecosystem through stablecoins are more widely distributed.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $2.346 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 45.5%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

244,"IndiaTech.org, an industry association representing India’s consumer internet startups and investors, wants to provide clear definitions for the cryptocurrency industry.On Wednesday, the association released a white paper including a policy proposal with recommendations for a regulatory framework for crypto assets and crypto exchanges in India.The proposed framework suggests to define cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) as digital assets and not currencies. “Define cryptocurrencies as digital assets and not currencies and grant them recognition as digital assets like gold, stocks, or marketable securities,” the proposal reads.The framework further recommends introducing a registration system for India-based cryptocurrency exchanges as well as establishing necessary checks related to Anti-Money Laundering compliance, Know Your Customer verification and reporting. The proposal also points out the need for necessary provisions in India’s tax law, as there is no clear framework for taxing crypto in India.The white paper also stresses the need to establish a framework for token issuance in India and regulate crypto in the payments industry. IndiaTech also proposed to encourage self-regulation to define a code of conduct for the industry.IndiaTech CEO Rameesh Kailasam said that the crypto industry holds huge potential for Indian startups. “The foremost need today is for this sector to be granted the much-needed regulatory clarity that it has been seeking. We are hopeful that the Government will work with the industry to regulate the sector and that a progressive approach is adopted while doing so,” he said.Sumit Gupta, co-founder and CEO of major local crypto exchange CoinDCX, called on the government to define the true nature of crypto in India. “This effort by the IndiaTech team is truly commendable. It helps bring a fresh perspective to the regulatory discussions that are going on today. The recommendations if accepted will open immense potential for Indians to participate in this new global asset class,” Gupta stated.As previously reported, there is significant uncertainty regarding the legal status of crypto in India, with many anonymous sources spreading rumors of plans to ban crypto in the country. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman then said that regulators did not want a complete prohibition and were willing to allow “certain windows” for people to use digital assets like Bitcoin."
245,"Bitcoin (BTC) touched $58,000 on Thursday as the latest phase of its comeback seemed to come at the expense of altcoins.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD’s return to battle familiar resistance near old all-time highs on Thursday.The move builds on strength from earlier in the week. As Cointelegraph reported, Wednesday saw $57,000 and 5% daily gains.As analysts began to note, however, altcoins are facing increasing pressure from a newly invigorated Bitcoin, which just days before had been left in the shade by their performance.Thursday, thus, saw 4.4% growth on BTC/USD, while Binance Coin (BNB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), previously the week’s high flyers, were both flat.Other altcoins did manage to deliver impressive returns and beat Bitcoin on the day, notably Cardano (ADA) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which were up 16% and 22%, respectively, at the time of writing.“Good start of the day: both ETHUSD and BTC bouncing from the expected levels,” popular trader Crypto Ed summarized about the state of the market.The largest cryptocurrency thus again faced final resistance beginning at just under $60,000. Bitcoin had benefited from a major United States bank adoption announcement, which was followed by news that the largest e-commerce company in Latin America, MercadoLibre, had added $7.6 million of BTC to its balance sheet.“As part of our treasury strategy this quarter we purchased $7.8 million in bitcoin, a digital asset that we are disclosing within our indefinite-lived intangible assets,” a filing with U.S. regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission confirmed.There are now six companies with at least $11.4 million in Bitcoin on their balance sheets, corresponding to at least 8,027 BTC. MicroStrategy, which only entered the market last August, is still by far the largest player with over 91,000 BTC."
246,"Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is going completely remote and closing its head offices in San Francisco.Coinbase announced Wednesday that it will shut down its former headquarters in the Golden Gate City in 2022 as part of its commitment to “being remote first.”“We’ve committed to having no HQ, and it’s important to show our decentralized workforce that no one location is [more] important than the another,” Coinbase noted. According to the company, the upcoming closure will be an important step in ensuring that no office becomes an unofficial headquarters. “Instead, we will offer a network of smaller offices for our employees to work from if they choose to,” the firm stated.Coinbase CEO and co-founder Brian Armstrong officially announced the firm’s intention to become remote-first and decentralized in February 2021. At the time, 52% of Coinbase employees were those who joined the company in a post-office world, the firm said. Coinbase stressed that about 95% of its employees will still have the option to work at home.“We now have employees, many who originally worked in San Francisco, all over the country and world. Since January 2020, nearly 250 employees have relocated worldwide, and more than 150 have left San Francisco, representing about 21% of our global and 29% of our San Francisco workforce during that time,” Coinbase wrote.Coinbase’s move into being remote-first echoes a similar no-headquarters stance by competitor Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said back in 2019 that office and headquarters are “old concepts like SMS and MMS.”"
247,"Bitcoin Cash (BCH) burst back into the market capitalization top 10 rankings on Thursday after a 36% overnight surge compounded 68% growth for the week. The per coin valuation of BCH climbed from $1,068 to $1,462 in under 24 hours leading into Thursday, adding to a notable increase from its weekly low in the $800 range.The resurgence of what was once a mainstay of the top-10 lineup comes just over a week ahead of Bitcoin Cash’s scheduled bi-annual hard fork on May 15, which will introduce two small, but not insignificant, tweaks to the network.One sees the removal of Bitcoin Cash’s unconfirmed transaction chain limit, allowing for more micro-transactions to be broadcast without having to wait for a block confirmation.Blocks are mined every 10 minutes on Bitcoin Cash, and the old unconfirmed chain limit was capped at 50 transactions. This allowed for high-volume applications to make 50 near-instant transactions before requiring confirmation in a block. This cap will be removed entirely in the upcoming hard fork.The other major change scheduled for May 15 will see the introduction of multiple “OP_RETURN” outputs. Put simply, the Bitcoin Cash blockchain currently allows for the insertion of miscellaneous data into a transaction, such as text, images and other data types. At present, only one “OP_RETURN” output can be included in a transaction — i.e., one image, text, etc. The upcoming network upgrade will allow for multiple pieces of miscellaneous data to be included in a single transaction.Both changes feasibly open up Bitcoin Cash to higher volume usage and make it more amenable to current and popular applications such as nonfungible tokens. Businesses and app developers stated they specifically wanted to see the changes introduced to expand the blockchain’s capabilities with nonfungible tokens in particular, as noted in the upgrade’s documentation.Bitcoin Cash’s market price has been on the rise since the start of the year along with the rest of the cryptocurrency sphere. So too has its overall usage according to on-chain data from Bitinfocharts.The number of daily Bitcoin Cash transactions rose from 20,000 in December to over 150,000 at the time of publication — a 650% increase. Between February and April, Bitcoin Cash regularly processed more transactions on a daily basis than Bitcoin (BTC), peaking at 414,000 to Bitcoin’s 229,000 on March 21.However, the same data source shows less growth in the number of transactions coming from unique addresses, which only increased 25% from 40,000 to 50,000 — a figure one-fifth of that seen on Bitcoin."
248,"Bitcoin buyers from the early phases of the bull run are still hodling despite BTC’s meteoric surge into new all-time highs, according to data shared by Glassnode.The on-chain analytics provider shared its “Realized Cap HODL Waves” chart, noting that the number of coins that were last realized on-chain in the past six months has nearly doubled from roughly 40% to 80% since the third quarter of 2020 — showing that much of the BTC purchased during this period has not been touched since.HODL Waves are used to estimate the time since BTC coins last moved on-chain, while the realized price is derived from the price the coins were last moved at, rather than the current price. As such, the colored bands shown in the Realized Cap HODL Waves chart increase in thickness “as coins mature or are spent into different age bands.”The data evidences that a large number of BTC purchased during 2020’s later months have not since been traded, with the chart showing coins progressively maturing from the fourth-quarter 2020 onwards.#Bitcoin supply accumulated in the early phase of this bull market is beginning to mature.

Live Chart: https://t.co/ZmfWKNLn8o pic.twitter.com/Q6BeTJ4FbQAnalyzing the chart in its May 3 Weekly On-chain report, Glassnode stated: “These are coins accumulated in the early bull market that have remained dormant since.”However, the chart also shows that the share of Bitcoin’s supply represented by coins last active between six months and three years ago has plummeted since mid-2020, dropping from more than 55% in July 2020 to around 10% now. This means long-term investors have been capitalizing on Bitcoin’s all-time highs and realizing profits on multi-year positions.Short-term speculation also appears to have surged since November, peaking with roughly half of Bitcoin’s supply having been realized in the past three months. This suggests short term traders are driving the markets."
249,"Although the majority of Bitcoin (BTC) mining is still based in China, there are signs it is beginning to shift elsewhere.Chun Wang, the co-founder of one of Bitcoin’s largest mining pools, F2Pool, reported that China represented less than half of Bitcoin’s hash rate during April 2020. Wang noted it was the first time the pool had seen Chinese miners represent a minority of the hash rate in its eight years of operation. “The shifting is real,” he said.Here at @f2pool_official, in April 2021, the first month in our 8 years of operation, we have seen more $BTC hashrate coming from outside of China than from the inside. The shifting is real. https://t.co/nf2gBy62reWang reposted data published April 22 by Digital Currency Group’s Barry Silbert, which revealed that United States-based Bitcoin mining pool Foundry had climbed to rank among the top five pools globally during April, commanding a 7.6% share of the hash rate.“Bitcoin hashrate is quickly shifting from China to North America,” Silbert claimed. The leading pool remains AntPool, which is operated by Chinese mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain, with an 18.6% share of the total hash rate.The University of Cambridge calculated that China’s mining dominance was around 65% in April 2020.  Noting those figures in January 2021, BTC mining publication Miner Daily estimated China’s share had fallen to 55% of BTC hashing power by the start of this year, with the U.S. accounting for 11%.On April 30, Cointelegraph reported that China’s crypto mining operations may be set for stricter regulations in the future, which could further fuel the country’s hash rate exodus. China has also recently been examining miners’ power usage in light of its own carbon commitments.In late February, it was reported that authorities of the Chinese autonomous region of Inner Mongolia proposed closing down all local mining facilities to reduce energy consumption in the region. The region accounts for as much as 8% of the global hash rate.In an article on Wednesday, Bitcoin podcast host Marty Bent said that the F2Pool findings are a confirmation of a trend in the mining world of hash rate production becoming more geographically distributed.He added that this would help dissipate some of the “China controls mining” FUD surrounding the potential for the country’s central government to attack the network.The FUD surrounding Bitcoin’s energy consumption and environmental impact may also reduce as more mining operations switch to renewable energy, especially in the U.S., which has tighter regulations.According to a Nasdaq report on Tuesday, Texas has become a mecca for Bitcoin mining farms due to its low energy costs and the fact that the majority comes from renewables, such as wind and solar."
250,"During PayPal’s Quarter 1 2021 investor update call, president and CEO Dan Schulman said digital assets had performed strongly for the company and that he believes crypto and central bank digital currencies will be a driving force in forging “a more equitable financial system.”Following the success of PayPal’s move to embrace crypto assets, much of the call centered around the firm’s recent and future plans for digital assets.“We believe the current technological underpinnings of our financial system will be substantially upgraded over the coming years,” Schulman said, adding this would help efforts to recover from the pandemic:The CEO stated the payments provider has an extensive crypto roadmap planned, noting its digital asset innovations will be pursued “in partnership with governments and in compliance with local, national and global regulatory frameworks.” “We’ve got a tremendous amount of really great results going on tactically with our crypto efforts,” he added.The firm’s shares rose by more than 5% on Wednesday in response to the earnings update after PayPal revealed its per-share earnings had outperformed expectations by more than 20%, coming in at $1.22 each adjusted. PayPal’s $6.03 billion in revenue also exceeded predictions by 2%.Total payment volume was $20 billion more than expected, finishing the quarter at $285 billion. The firm also added 14.5 million new active accounts, bringing its user base to 392 million.Schulman asserted PayPal’s adoption of digital assets “has been widely embraced,” noting productive conversations with “central banks, regulators and government officials around the world.”The firm described its adoption of digital assets as bolstering the utility for cryptocurrency by enabling “millions of merchants around the globe” to accept crypto payments. However, transactions made in digital assets within PayPal’s merchant network are currently settled in fiat currency.PayPal’s Venmo app also introduced buy, hold and sell capabilities last month. PayPal noted that its “2020 Venmo Customer Behavior Study” found that 30% of customers had already begun purchasing crypto assets, 20% of whom began buying amid the coronavirus pandemic.Schulman also noted the firm closed its acquisition of crypto asset custodian, Curv, last month, stating: “Curv’s talented team will bolster our existing technology resources and accelerate our efforts to shape a new financial infrastructure that is efficient, low cost and inclusive.”"
251,"Mercado Libre, the largest e-commerce platform in Latin America, has announced to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it acquired $7.8 million in Bitcoin in the first quarter of 2021. It stated in the report:The purchase makes the Argentinean company the first large Latin American company to acquire Bitcoin for its treasury and sees it join an exclusive club of companies such as MicroStrategy and Tesla, which have previously announced to the authorities the holding of BTC within their assets.Just last week major Japanese game developer Nexon announced it had purchased 1,717 BTC for it's balance sheet at a cost of roughly $100 million. Mercado Libre's announcement makes it the 36th publicly listed company to hold Bitcoin according to Bitcoin Treasuries. Mercado Libre trades on Nasdaq as MELI.Beyond the formal announcement, the relationship of the popular eCommerce portal with Bitcoin is not new. As previously reported by Cointelegraph en Español, at the end of April it enabled the use of Bitcoin for their real estate verticals in the Argentine market.In addition, Marcos Galperín, founder and former CEO of Mercado Libre, has already announced publicly on several occasions that he has owned Bitcoin in his personal portfolio since 2013, and has also expressed a variety of bullish opinions regarding the cryptocurrency ecosystem in Latin America, even stating that he saw Bitcoin as a better store of value than gold."
252,"Bitcoin (BTC) entirely recovered from its recent drop that saw the price fall to the $53,000 support level. This move back to $57,500 relieved bulls from the negative pressure of the May 7, 3,500 BTC options contract, which represents $200 million in open interest along with a $1.1 billion options expiry.Today's swift recovery could have been partially driven by the news that New Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) partnered with Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) to create a framework for U.S. banks to offer crypto trading services.Patrick Sells, the bank solutions chief at NYDIG, told CNBC that several banks have already signed up for the program.Moreover, a Mastercard survey found that 40% of the 15,500 interview participants intend to use crypto for payments over the next 12 months. Additionally, it reported that 77% of millennials are interested in learning more about cryptocurrency.Whatever the reason behind Bitcoin's recent price recovery, bulls are now in a much better position for the May 7 options expiry.Options contract buyers pay the premium upfront and thus face no forceful liquidation risk. On the other hand, the call (buy) option provides its buyer with upside price protection, and the put (sell) does the opposite.This means traders aiming for neutral-to-bearish strategies will typically rely on put options. On the other hand, call options are more commonly used for bullish positions.Analysts could easily dismiss Friday's Bitcoin expiry as the put-to-call ratio is flat. This means the neutral-to-bullish and neutral-to-bearish options open interest is balanced. However, these options will expire in less than 38 hours, causing the $65,000 and higher calls to become worthless.The put options, a right of selling Bitcoin at $48,000 on Friday, are also worthless today. To correctly interpret the potential impact of the May 7 expiry, analysts must exclude the strikes that are too far out from the current price.The call (buy) options up to $60,000 total 4,950 contracts ($285 million), and if the price of Bitcoin happens to reach $64,000 on May 7, another 1,620 contracts will boost the call options open interest by $93 million.Alternatively, the neutral-to-bearish put options add up to 3,150 contracts down to the $54,000 strike. These currently present a $181 million open interest and would be increased by 2,800 contracts down to $50,000. This level would boost put options' open interest by $161 million.Although bulls have a $104 million advantage leading to Friday's expiry, this number would be greatly reduced at any level below $60,000. As the chart indicates, most call options (1,680 contracts) have been placed at this level.Therefore, bears have incentives to suppress the price below $60,000. At least until 8:00 AM UTC on May 7.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

253,"Dogecoin (DOGE) skyrocketed above $0.69 today and flipped XRP to become the fourth largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of over $88 billion at its highest point. Galaxy Digital recently released a report titled “Dogecoin: The Most Honest Sh*tcoin,” and the document highlighted the fact that no updates have been logged in Dogecoin’s GitHub repository since 2017. Even the blockchain’s network security is suboptimal with only 26% of the overall node count running fully synced notes, the report added.There seems to be a massive mismatch between Dogecoin’s fundamentals and its valuation. The meme coin’s rally is an indication that traders are driven by greed and such phases of frenzy never end well. When the bubble bursts, several investors will be left nursing massive losses.Moving away from the Dogecoin frenzy, the latest CoinShares report shows weekly institutional inflows of $489 million for various crypto products. Bitcoin (BTC) accounted for the lion’s share of the investments at $411.7 million.This shows that institutional investors are viewing the current weakness in Bitcoin as a buying opportunity. The total crypto assets under management is at $64.7 billion, having risen about $7 billion in the past six weeks.Will Ether (ETH) continue to pull altcoins higher or will Bitcoin make a comeback? Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin plunged below the moving averages on May 4 but the bears could not capitalize on this weakness. This suggests the bulls have not yet given up and they continue to buy on every dip.The bulls have pushed the price above the moving averages today and they will now try to challenge the downtrend line and the overhead resistance at $58,966.53. A breakout of this resistance zone will clear the path for a possible retest of the all-time high at $64,849.27.However, the flattish moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. This could keep the BTC/USDT pair stuck between $52,323.21 and $58,966.51 for a few days.The bears may gain the upper hand if the price turns down and plummets below $52,323.21. Such a move will suggest weakness and that could result in a decline to the critical support at $46,985.Ether is in a momentum-driven uptrend. Generally, in such phases of melt-up, the asset may remain overbought for an extended duration and corrections can be sharp but are usually short-lived. After a one-day pullback on May 4, the bulls are trying to resume the up-move today.If buyers propel the price above $3,527.19, the ETH/USDT pair could rally to $4,528.97. However, the farther the price moves away from the moving averages, the greater the risk of a massive correction. Therefore, traders should exercise caution.If the price reverses direction from $3,500, it will indicate profit-booking at higher levels. The bears will then try to pull the price below $3,165.30, which could result in a decline to the 20-day exponential moving average ($2,731).A strong rebound off this level will suggest the uptrend remains intact. The bulls then try to resume the up-move. Conversely, a break below the 20-day EMA will suggest the pair has formed a short-term top.Binance Coin’s (BNB) sharp correction on May 4 attracted buyers near the $600 mark. This suggests the sentiment remains bullish and traders are accumulating at lower levels.The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the buyers push the price above $680, the uptrend could resume with the next target objective at $808.57.This positive view will nullify if the price turns down from the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($567). Such a move will suggest that supply exceeds demand and the BNB/USDT pair could then drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($436).Dogecoin is in a strong melt-up. The bulls pushed the price above the $0.45 resistance on May 4, which resulted in a pick-up in momentum. The long wick on May 4 suggested profit-booking by traders near $0.61 but the bears could not maintain the selling pressure.According to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro, market conditions for DOGE have been favorable for some time.The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for DOGE flipped green on May 2 when the price was $0.38, well before the indication of any rally.Since then, the VORTECS™ Score has largely remained in the green and DOGE rallied to $0.69 today, an 86% gain in about four days.The buying resumed today and the DOGE/USDT pair hit a new all-time high at $0.69. However, the long wick on the day’s candlestick suggests profit-booking at higher levels. The pair could now drop to the breakout level at $0.45. A break below this level could pull the price to the 20-EMA ($0.33).Alternatively, if the bulls flip this level into support, the pair may again try to rise above $0.69. If that happens, the rally may extend to $0.84 and then $1.Frenzied buying in an asset can result in strong rallies. However, traders should be careful and protect their capital with a trailing stop-loss because vertical rallies can quickly reverse direction, resulting in sharp losses.XRP dropped below the 20-day EMA ($1.39) on May 4 but the bears could not sustain the lower levels. This shows the bulls are defending the 20-day EMA. The price has reached the downtrend line where the bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance.If the price turns down from the downtrend line, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the BNB/USDT pair below the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the pair could slide to the 50-day SMA ($1.05).On the contrary, if the bulls thrust the price above the downtrend line, the up-move may resume and the bulls may try to push the price to $1.96. A breakout of this resistance will suggest the start of the next leg of the uptrend.Cardano (ADA) broke below the 20-day EMA ($1.29) on May 4 but the bulls defended the 50-day SMA ($1.24). The buyers are currently trying to push the price toward the resistance of the range at $1.48.The ADA/USDT pair is likely to face stiff resistance near the $1.48 to $1.55 zone. If the price turns down from this zone, the pair could again drop to the moving averages and extend the stay inside the range for a few more days.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA, the pair may gradually drop to $1.03. A strong bounce off this support will suggest that traders continue to buy on dips to the support of the range.Until the bulls push the price above $1.55 or the bears sink the pair below $0.98, the range-bound action is likely to continue.Polkadot (DOT) plummeted below the 20-day EMA ($36) on May 4 but the bulls did not panic and dump their positions. Rather, they bought the dip and have pushed the price back above the moving averages today.If the bulls sustain the price above $38.30, the DOT/USDT pair may rally to $42.28 and then to $48.36. However, the flat moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.This indicates the pair is likely to hit a wall at $42.28. If the price turns down from this resistance, the range-bound action is likely to continue. The next trending move could start if the price breaks above $50 or plunges below $26.50.Litecoin (LTC) broke above the $335.03 overhead resistance today, indicating the resumption of the uptrend. The 20-day EMA ($271) has turned up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, suggesting the bulls are in command.If the buyers push the price above the resistance line of the ascending broadening wedge pattern, the LTC/USDT pair could pick up momentum and rally to $400 and then $463.31.However, the bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to stall the up-move at the resistance line. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair could drop to $308 and then to the 20-day EMA.A strong rebound off the 20-day EMA will suggest the sentiment remains positive. The bulls will then make one more attempt to resume the uptrend. This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down and plummets below the support line of the wedge.After days of hesitation near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,012.29, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) soared above the $1,213.51 resistance today, indicating the resumption of the uptrend.If the bulls manage to sustain the price above $1,213.51, the BCH/USDT pair could rally to $1,410.42 and then $1,710.39.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above $1,213.51, the pair could drop to $1,050. If the pair rebounds off this level, the bulls will make one more attempt to start the next leg of the uptrend.However, a break below $1,050 will suggest that supply exceeds demand and that could pull the price down to the 20-day EMA ($926).Uniswap (UNI) rebounded off the $39.60 support on May 5, which shows the bulls are defending this level aggressively. If the buyers propel the price above $45, the next leg of the uptrend could begin. The target objective on the upside is a rally to the resistance line of the ascending channel at $50.The rising 20-day EMA ($38.35) suggests the buyers have the advantage but the negative divergence on the RSI indicates the bullish momentum may be weakening.A break below the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the bears are making a comeback. The UNI/USDT pair could then drop to the support line of the channel where buyers may emerge.A strong bounce off this support will suggest buying at lower levels and the uptrend may remain intact. Conversely, a break below the channel will signal a possible change in trend.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

254,"Bitcoin (BTC) miners collected $60 million on a thirty-day average time frame as of May 5, showing the first signs of recovery after last month's severe revenue drop that followed mass miner outages in China's energy-rich provinces.In April, coal mining accidents and subsequent inspections in Xinjiang lacerated energy supply to the regional cryptocurrency mining industry. That forced miners to turn off their ASIC hardware, which exclusively generates computing power to secure and put the ""work"" into Bitcoin's proof-of-work.According to data from Blockchain.com, Bitcoin mining revenue fell from its 30-day average peak of $60 million — recorded on April 16 — to as low as $57.08 million on May 2. The resource collects miners' data from block rewards and transaction fees paid to miners.The drop in profits coincided with a decline in the Bitcoin network's hash rate, signifying that many ASIC miners went offline after losing their chief energy source. The total hash rate per second (seven-day average) plunged from a record high of 172 exahashes per second on April 16 to 131 EH/s on April 23, a drop of roughly 30%.It since recovered to 168 EH/s on May 5, indicating that miners are resuming their Bitcoin operations following a considerable mining difficulty drop four days ago.Bitcoin prices suffered significant declines following China's outages.The benchmark cryptocurrency was already correcting lower after establishing a historic peak near $65,000 on April 14. The China FUD — fear, uncertainty and doubt — apprehensively accelerated the sell-off, causing the BTC/USD exchange rate to plunge to as low as $50,591 on April 25.Bitcoin's price and hash rate drop occurred almost simultaneously, providing further evidence for a higher positive correlation between the two metrics.Simply put, the hash rate represents the computational power of the Bitcoin network. This means that the higher the hash rate, the higher the theoretical cost of ""attacking"" Bitcoin, making this metric synonymous with the network's security.Bitcoin's price has recovered to a little over $55,000 as of May 5, much in line with the hash rate, signifying that the network reset is helping to maintain the cryptocurrency's prevailing bullish bias.More upside tailwinds come from Bitcoin mining difficulty projections. For example, data from BTC.com shows it should rise by a modest 1% in the subsequent bi-monthly (or 2,016-block period) adjustment on May 13.The network difficulty, which shows how difficult it is for nodes on the Bitcoin network to solve the equations necessary for mining operations, had dropped 12.6% on May 2. That tends to increase margins for both inefficient and efficient miners, promising lower risks of a Bitcoin sell-off at the producers' end.Meanwhile, with an upside adjustment looking more likely and mining activity rising on the Bitcoin network, the long-term projections for the cryptocurrency remain bullish.An earlier report from Cointelegraph compared the correlation between Bitcoin's price, hash rate and mining difficulty, ruling out that the first has a lagging correlation with the latter two, despite the popular mantra that ""Price follows hash rate.""The BTC/USD exchange rate closed 2020 at $28,990 after Bitcoin's network difficulty plunged to 17.438 terahashes per second from 19.679 TH/s in the November–December 2020 session. The period also saw a significant drop in the hash rate but left Bitcoin's overall upside bias untouched."
255,"Bitcoin (BTC) staged a characteristic comeback on May 5 as a day of losses turned around in a flash.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD passing $57,000 again during May 5 trading, with daily gains knocking on 5%.The move marks Bitcoin's second such ""comeback"" in a week. While the bearish trend reset, analysts were keen to see how much fuel Bitcoin had accumulated after dipping to near $53,000 overnight.For Philip Swift, co-founder of trading suite Decentrader, fundamental indicators still point to a continuation of the longer-term bull market.""I continue to think that Bitcoin will not crash and is more likely to range before breaking out to the upside,"" part of a series of tweets read.Swift specifically noted that one tool, the Pi Cycle Top Indicator, had ""nailed"" Bitcoin's most recent all-time high of $64,500 in April. As Cointelegraph reported, the indicator has become increasingly popular for those tracking BTC price trends over successive years.At the time of writing, BTC/USD circled $57,200, ruminating after reaching local highs of $57,400.Hodlers thus received a welcome response from the largest cryptocurrency, which had spent much of the week being humiliated at the hands of a surging altcoin market.Among the astonishing movers were tokens such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum Classic (ETC), the latter having laid dormant for much of the past three years since the end of the previous broad ""alt season.""Words of caution, veiled or not, were nonetheless not in short supply as Bitcoin proponents warned about the fickle nature of such parabolic altcoin moves.Bitcoin dragging all markets down as people flee to superior assets such as Dogecoin.Acting in Bitcoin's favor, meanwhile, was news that it would be supported by ""hundreds"" of banks in the United States in 2021, along with investment giant Grayscale becoming a sponsor of NFL team the New York Giants. ""What we’re doing is making it simple for everyday Americans and corporations to be able to buy bitcoin through their existing bank relationship,"" said Patrick Sells, head of bank solutions at crypto custody firm NYDIG — which is behind the scheme — revealing the scale of the rollout to CNBC."
256,"JP Richardson’s favorite phrase is “easy to use.”Well, maybe not, but the Exodus CEO certainly used it enough during a live ask-me-anything session that the cryptocurrency wallet maker held on Cointelegraph’s YouTube page.While the focus of the livestream was the $75 million public offering of stock that Exodus Movement has hosted — and nearly completed — inside its own Exodus Wallet, Richardson reinforced this idea regularly throughout the broadcast.“I think what a lot of people, first of all, really love about Exodus is the ease of use and how beautiful it is,” Richardson said when asked what makes his software wallet — which is available as an integrated desktop and mobile app, as well as on the popular Trezor hardware wallet — unique.He returned to the subject when discussing Exodus Wallet users’ ability to trade any of the 133 cryptocurrencies it supports directly for any other with a flat 2% fee, without having to go through an exchange.Giving the example of a DOGE for LINK swap, Richardson points out that on many exchanges, users would have to swap their Dogecoins for Bitcoin or a stablecoin, and then use that to buy the LINK tokens — with the attendant fees and delays — and then move it back to their wallet.“Exodus provides convenience. That’s the big key here, this ease of use and convenience.”In that vein, Richardson also replied to a question asking whether Exodus would support decentralized finance (DeFi) staking pools in the wallet. The answer was that the company started doing just that in early 2020, even connecting with Compound Finance to integrate its DAI stablecoin.MORE INSIGHTS FROM EXODUS HERE“The vision was just one click,” he said. And, they began looking into something similar with sports betting on the SportX platform. Then Ethereum gas prices blew up.“We really have got to make an experience where, not only is it easy, but it's affordable for the mainstream to come in and start using these things. So, we will sometime, but that's the key. We've got to do those two things.”Now 98% complete, the $75 million public offering was registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under Regulation A+, which allows stock sales for up to that amount to retail buyers — rather than just the wealthy “accredited” buyers most crypto industry stock sales have been limited to — as long as the stock is not listed on a national exchange like the Nasdaq.In Exodus’ case, the stock was listed for $27.42 per share on… the Exodus Wallet. And, it was only sold for Bitcoin, Ether, or USDC stablecoins. It was available only in the U.S., excluding Arizona, Florida, and Texas.“The point of our offering is more or less for a proof of concept to show the world that this is possible,” Richardson said. “We build in all the components from the actual offering itself, to the issuance of the stock, to the actual secondary trading. Once we have all of that bundled up into one package — and we make it easy — then we will go to other companies and say, come on in. You can do a stock public offering right inside the Exodus platform.”The stock, Richardson adds, will be tokenized on a blockchain.“We see that as an inevitable future is that all traditional assets, whether it's stocks, bonds, mortgages, currencies… now will make their way to the blockchain. And so we thought, why don't we be the trailblazers, the ones to go out there and make this a reality ourselves? People are going to be able to trade their stock inside of Exodus, as simply as people can trade Bitcoin or Ether or other crypto assets.”Learn more about ExodusDisclaimer.

257,"The era of American banks regarding cryptocurrencies as evil might be coming to an end.According to a report by CNBC on Wednesday, New Digital Investment Group has inked a partnership with fintech staple Fidelity National Information Services, better known as FIS, to provide a framework for United States banks to offer crypto trading services to their customers.Patrick Sells, bank solutions chief at NYDIG, told CNBC that several banks have already signed up for the program, with the majority being smaller financial institutions. However, Sells also added that the company is in talks with major U.S. banks to participate in the program.According to the NYDIG executive, major names such as Bank of America and JPMorgan may be incentivized to come on board once smaller banks begin to reap the rewards of retail crypto trading adoption. BoA is among one of the staunchest anti-crypto banks in the U.S., regularly disputing the value proposition of Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies.As part of the collaboration between NYDIG and FIS, participating banks will be able to offer direct crypto trading for their customers straight from their existing accounts.Banks greenlighting crypto trading could see U.S. lenders competing with platforms like Robinhood, Coinbase and Square, among others. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, about 9.5 million customers traded crypto on Robinhood’s platform in the first quarter of 2021.Indeed, NYDIG president Yan Zhao said that the massive revenue being reported by the likes of Robinhood and Coinbase was the kicker for U.S. banks to set their sights on retail crypto trading:U.S. lenders offering retail crypto trading will also constitute a 180-degree reversal on the consensus among financial institutions in the country regarding cryptocurrencies.The likes of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley recently announced plans to offer Bitcoin funds to institutional clients."
258,"It was Doge day afternoon all over again on Wednesday as Dogecoin (DOGE) continued its assault on the cryptocurrency market capitalization rankings. The meme coin overtook XRP to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by implied market capitalization after climbing to a per-coin valuation of $0.69 — a target that was specifically set by traders on social media.But cryptocurrency’s latest media darling may not be as wholesome as it seems. For all the hype surrounding Dogecoin (and its de facto master, Elon Musk), publicly available data suggests relatively few people are actually using the blockchain, and those who do use it account for an incredibly large portion of its overall activity.Consider that the dollar value of coins sent across the Dogecoin blockchain on Tuesday exceeded $58 billion. That figure was 70% higher than the amount transferred on Bitcoin ($34 billion) and 260% higher than on Ethereum ($16 billion).Digging into on-chain data further, we see that despite Dogecoin moving a higher value of coins than the two largest cryptocurrencies in the world, it achieved this with a mere fraction of their transactions.Over 1.4 million transactions were counted on the Ethereum blockchain yesterday, according to data from Bitinfocharts, while close to 300,000 were counted on Bitcoin. Compare this to just 76,000 recorded on the Dogecoin blockchain, and an apparent wealth gap begins to emerge.Indeed, when looking at Dogecoin’s average transaction value on the day in question, it stood at almost double that recorded on Bitcoin (BTC). The average DOGE transaction value stood at $800,000, compared to $420,000 on BTC. Its statistics relative to Ethereum paint an even more dire picture — Dogecoin’s average transaction value exceeded Ethereum’s by 8,000%, despite processing only 5% of the number of transactions.Combined with the long-standing reality that one single address holds 28% of all coins in existence, while just 12 account for 67%, it becomes clear that Dogecoin isn’t exactly the people’s champion that interested parties would have the public believe.A recently published report by Galaxy Digital piled on the misery regarding Dogecoin’s general lack of authenticity as a true cryptocurrency project. Titled “Dogecoin: The Most Honest Sh*tcoin,” the report highlighted the fact that Dogecoin’s GitHub repository (where updates to the blockchain’s code are logged by developers) hasn’t been touched since 2017. What’s more, the number of fully synced nodes (computers running copies of the Dogecoin blockchain) is just 26% of the overall node count, suggesting few people are willing to make the effort to maintain the blockchain’s network security.But even if the Dogehouse seems like a ghost town, the glaring reality remains that Dogecoin is the best performing digital asset in the cryptocurrency space. The coin has recorded 14,000% growth since Jan. 1, when it was priced at a fraction of a cent.Both credit and blame for Doge’s seemingly irrational ascent have been placed on the “Dogefather” himself, Elon Musk, who has taken great pleasure in posting Doge memes to his 52 million followers on Twitter throughout much of 2021.However, it should also be noted that the coin’s recent peak of $0.69 is the same price target set by Reddit traders intent on artificially pumping DOGE’s valuation. The price point was originally intended to be reached on April 20 — a joke on top of a joke on 4/20 day. Dogecoin only reached a price of $0.420 at the time (boom), but now, a little over two weeks later, it has finally achieved its jocular goals. The ultimate price point being pursued by traders is $1.If more evidence is needed that markets are not always rational, look no further than this year’s GameStop pump, where the share price of a near-dead brand increased by over 9,000%.“Dogecoin has always been a joke, and the joke keeps getting funnier,” stated the Galaxy Digital report. Author of the report and head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital Alex Thorn did praise Dogecoin for its lack of pretense, noting that the coin’s fortunes weren’t tied to foundation announcements or developer promises and that its only goal was to elicit a reaction.“Dogecoin’s longevity is ensured so long as one truism remains: people love a good joke,” Thorn ended."
259,"Betterment, a major financial advisory company providing robo-advising and cash management services, has not yet decided whether it will introduce cryptocurrencies to its platform.Betterment is still researching a potential expansion of its services to include digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), CEO Sarah Levy said.“We’re believers that if we can provide the right kind of context and advice, that it’s OK to participate in some of these newer asset classes,” Levy said in a Tuesday interview at Bloomberg’s Wealth Summit. “I’d like us to find a way to responsibly offer crypto, but I can’t say that we’re there yet. I think we’re still in kind of a watch-and-learn mode,” she added.Founded back in 2008, Betterment is a popular platform in the United States, helping clients to invest in a globally diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds, allocated to an “appropriate level of risk” for a given timeline. In April, the company announced record-breaking growth in the first quarter of 2021, adding $10 billion to its AUM and reporting a 116% increase in new clients year-over-year. Previously, Betterment acquired the U.S. book of rival Canadian robo-advisor WealthSimple, a company that launched Canada’s first regulated crypto exchange in September 2020.While Betterment continues its research on a potential move into crypto, major Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have already taken steps to allow wealthy clients to invest in cryptocurrencies. Global payments giant PayPal said that the demand for its crypto services exceeded the company’s expectations after the firm launched its first crypto offerings in late 2020."
260,"In the latest sign that crypto continues to filter through into the mainstream, CNBC host Jim Cramer has spent the week discussing the large quantity of Ether (ETH) he holds.On CNBC’s Squawk Box on Tuesday, Cramer said he owns “a lot of Ether,” explaining that he first bought it when he was trying to “buy some nonfungible token on Time Magazine. So, they made you buy Ether first. I didn’t get it so I just kept the Ether.” Cramer was referring to Time’s recent auction of magazine covers in the form of nonfungible tokens when each cover eventually sold for between $100,000 and $250,000.Keeping the Ether, however, now “seems like a better deal,” his interviewer quipped, in light of Ether’s current rally to trade above $3,300 — up 130% just this week. “I’ll buy a house with Ether,” Cramer half-joked in response.Cramer’s point about paying for real estate with his crypto profits is more than an off-the-cuff remark. The television host said last month that he had recently paid off a mortgage using proceeds from his Bitcoin (BTC) investments. Speaking in more detail about using Bitcoin for the down payment on his property in another interview earlier this week, Cramer presented himself neither as a purist hodler nor as someone who carelessly sells it off:In what he presented as an approach to crypto that goes against certain “all-or-nothing” trading orthodoxies, Cramer added: “I don’t get enjoyment from living in Bitcoin, but I did get great enjoyment from buying this place, stocking the pond, fishing, enjoying my family together.”"
261,"Safello, a Stockholm-based cryptocurrency brokerage, is seeing massive demand from investors for its upcoming initial public offering on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market.The company said Wednesday that its planned IPO was oversubscribed by 502 million Swedish krona ($59.3 million), up 1,240% from the planned 40.5 million krona ($4.8 million), Reuters reports.Safello CEO Frank Schuil said that the company expects its listing on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market in Stockholm on May 12. The executive told Cointelegraph that the allocation rules were set in the prospectus, and Safelo followed those rules. “Our approach has been to create the widest distribution after pre-subscription in the spirit of decentralized ownership,” Schuil said.“Safello will continue to follow its roadmap. The listing on Nasdaq First North opens new venues for growth that we will pursue. Specifically M&A, product expansion and geographical expansion,” he said.Founded in 2013 in Sweden, Safello is an online crypto brokerage offering to buy and sell cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). The company is regulated as a financial institution with the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority and is backed by major players in the crypto industry including Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group. Safello initially announced its IPO plans in December 2020.Many in the crypto space predicted that 2021 would be the year crypto companies started going public. Coinbase, the United States’ largest crypto exchange, listed on Nasdaq Global Select Market in mid-April. Major European crypto asset manager CoinShares debuted on the Nasdaq First North in March."
262,"The cryptocurrency market awoke to the sight of Dogecoin (DOGE) price surging to as high as $0.69 in the past two days, leading many to wonder if the recent performance of the world's most popular meme token is now the leading indicator for the arrival of alt season. Long-time crypto fans mark the fourth of May as a special day for the Bitcoin community as a whole for being the birthday of one of the earliest known supporters of the Bitcoin network Hal Finney, who would have celebrated turning 65.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and Tradingview shows that while the world's attention was focused on Dogecoin, Bitcoin (BTC) faced selling pressures, which began the night before and dropped the price of BTC back below the $55,000 support level by mid-day on Tuesday.While BTC continues to trade in the $50,000 to $60,000, or what some traders see as the ""twilight zone,"" the price of Ether (ETH) again climbed to a new all-time high at $3,519 as institutional managers now hold a record $13.9 billion worth of the top altcoin and smart contract platform.The global financial markets faced headwinds on Tuesday along with a majority of cryptocurrencies following remarks from U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen who indicated that the Federal Reserve may need to raise interest rates to “prevent overheating.”According to Ben Lilly, analyst and cofounder of Jarvis Labs, “US Fed Rates tend to be a barometer for global markets,” so BTC’s status as a macro asset was “surely impacted by Yellen’s comments even though she is not the current Fed Chair.”Looking deeper into the recent activity on the Bitcoin network, Lilly indicated that “on-chain transactions have been lackluster since the major options expiry last week” which hasn’t helped provide a buffer against negative news like the comments from Yellen.Lilly said,These sentiments were echoed by David Lifchitz, chief investment officer at ExoAlpha, who pointed to a breakdown in Bitcoin’s previous pattern of higher highs as a sign that BTC will have a difficult time breaking out above $60,000 without a significant catalyst.When it comes to Ethereum however, Lifchitz stated that “ETH has been in its own bull world” as evidenced by establishing “new highs every day over the past eight days.”According to Lifchitz, while the exact cause of the ETH run is hard to determine, one plausible explanation could be that “some investors looked at ETH as an underpriced crypto compared to BTC since it's recent run and decided that ETH was a cheap alternative to BTC.”Other catalysts identified by Lifchitz include the increased usage of ETH in decentralized finance as well as a possible “buy the rumor, sell the news” scenario developing ahead of the upcoming Ethereum Network upgrade EIP 1559 that will take place in July.Lifchitz highlighted the tendency of cryptos to make bigger moves on momentum plays than they do on a fundamental basis, “essentially due to investors chasing short-term performance no matter what the fundamentals are.”Lifchitz said,Conversations in the wider cryptocurrency community were dominated by the performance of Dogecoin, which surged by 54% overnight to reach a new all-time high of around $0.68 on some exchanges.Other notable performances include a 30% increase in the price of iExec RLC (RLC) to a new all-time high at $4.45 and a 50% surge in the price of Ethereum Classic (ETC) to $79.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $2.25 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 45.2%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

263,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been struggling to sustain the $55,000 support level for the past 16 days, or basically since the April 17 record-high $5-billion long contracts liquidation. The rejection that took place after the $64,900 all-time high had a devastating impact on the sentiment of retail traders, as measured by the significant drop in the perpetual futures funding rate.However, despite Bitcoin's recent underperformance and May 4's 6.5% drop, pro traders have been buying the dip for the past 24 hours. These whales and arbitrage desk movements are reflected in the OKEx futures long-to-short ratio, as well as Bitfinex's margin lending markets. As this buying occurs, retail traders are mainly quiet, which is reflected in the neutral perpetual funding rate.As depicted above, the perpetual futures (inverse swaps) 8-hour funding rate has been below 0.05% for the past couple of weeks. For the end-of-month contracts, prices vastly differ from regular spot exchanges, reflecting the imbalance from longs and shorts leverage.This discrepancy is why retail traders tend to prefer perpetual futures, albeit with the varying carry cost caused by the funding rate changes.The current eight-hour fee is equivalent to a 1% weekly rate, signaling a slight imbalance on longs. However, this level is well below the 0.10% and higher rates seen in early April. This data is clear evidence that retail traders aren't comfortable adding Bitcoin long positions despite the 9% correction in two days.On the other hand, the top traders' long-to-short indicator reached its highest level in 30 days, signaling buying activity from whales and arbitrage desks. This indicator is calculated by analyzing the client's consolidated position on the spot, perpetual and futures contracts. As a result, it gives a clearer view of whether professional traders are leaning bullish or bearish.As shown above, the current OKEx futures long-to-short ratio currently favors longs by 94%. This buying activity was initiated in the early hours of May 4 as Bitcoin broke below $55,000. More importantly, it signals even more confidence than April 14 when BTC hiked to its $64,900 all-time high.However, to confirm whether this movement is widespread, one should also evaluate margin markets. For example, the leading exchange (Bitfinex) holds over $1.8 billion worth of leveraged Bitcoin positions.Bitfinex shows spectacular growth in the BTC margin markets, with longs over 50 times the amount borrowed by shorts. These levels are unprecedented in the exchange's history and confirm the data from OKEx's futures markets.There's no doubt that professional traders are ultra-bullish despite May 4's Bitcoin dip. As for the lack of appetite from retail traders, their focus seems to be currently on altcoins.Currently, 18 of the top 50 altcoins have rallied 45% or higher in the past 30 days.The question is, can the altcoin rally continue if BTC fails to produce a new all-time high over the next couple of weeks?The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

264,"Sotheby’s, one of the world’s oldest and biggest auction houses, has announced that it will be accepting major cryptocurrencies as a new payment method at an upcoming auction.Sotheby’s CEO Charles Stewart said that the company will debut Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) payments as part of its upcoming auction of Banksy’s ""Love is in the Air."" The new payment method will be facilitated in partnership with United States’ largest cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, noted Stewart in a Tuesday interview with CNBC's Squawk Box.“It’s something we have been thinking about for quite some time,” the CEO said, elaborating that Sotheby’s latest move brings the next step to exploring crypto payments for physical art after the firm debuted nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, earlier this year.""Love is in the Air"" is an iconic protest-themed artwork by pseudonymous England-based street artist Banksy. The work will be offered in Sotheby’s Contemporary Art Evening Auction on May 12 in New York, Esquire reported. Bidding for the work, which is estimated to be worth between $3 million and $5 million, will be conducted in the U.S. dollar, featuring an opportunity to pay the amount with crypto.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, global auction houses have been moving into the crypto industry more aggressively in recent months. In February, British auction house Christie’s announced an NFT auction of Mike Winkelmann’s digital artwork “Everydays: The First 5000 Days.” The auction eventually resulted in a record-setting NFT sale, netting nearly $70 million. In October 2020, Christie’s also sold a Bitcoin-themed art piece and NFT for over $130,000.Sotheby’s announcement comes amid a major altcoin rally, with Ether setting a new all-time high above $3,500 on Tuesday."
265,"JPMorgan Chase’s constant love-hate relationship with cryptocurrency has been a fascinating one to observe over the years, especially since the digital asset sector started exploding at the start of 2021. To put things into perspective, between February and April, the total market capitalization of the space doubled from $1 trillion to $2 trillion.As a result of this meteoric ascent, the individual market cap of premier cryptocurrencies such as Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) has gone on to become higher than those of established multinationals, with Bitcoin surpassing Tesla, Tencent, Visa, Berkshire Hathaway, Alibaba, Facebook and Samsung, among others.Back in 2017, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon referred to BTC as a “fraud,” even going as far as saying that he would fire employees if they dealt with Bitcoin. However, fast-forward four years, and Dimon has dialed back on his “fraud” label.Not only that, but more recently, he seems to have relaxed his anti-crypto stance, claiming that crypto is here to stay and that it is now only a matter of time before governments across the globe start to regulate their local digital asset markets with an iron fist. Yet he maintained during an event that took place in late 2020 that Bitcoin was still not his “cup of tea.”Despite Dimon’s somewhat negative outlook toward Bitcoin and the crypto industry, recent reports suggest that JPMorgan is currently preparing to offer some of its clients an actively managed Bitcoin fund, potentially becoming one of the largest — and most unlikely — banking institutions to embrace crypto.In fact, there are speculations that the fund could be rolled at as soon as this summer, with insiders claiming that fintech firm NYDIG will provide its custody services to the banking behemoth.Additionally, it has also been reported that JPMorgan’s Bitcoin fund will be “actively managed,” which comes in stark contrast to the passive fare currently offered by many crypto players such as Pantera Capital and Galaxy Digital.Cointelegraph reached out to Sam Tabar — chief strategy officer of Bit Digital, a Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin mining firm, and former head of capital strategy for the Asia-Pacific region at Bank of America Merrill Lynch — who stated:In this regard, it bears mentioning that the company’s “Onyx” division launched a stablecoin, JPM Coin, in late 2020. Not only that, but the contrast between Dimon’s past remarks and JPMorgan’s current direction, in Tabar’s opinion, is an exemplary illustration of the process of institutionalization. He believes that there will always be pushback from traditional frameworks and leaders, making JPMorgan’s change of heart a clear win for blockchain innovation.He added: “Much of Dimon's statements stemmed from a failure to grasp certain use cases for cryptocurrencies, such as tokenization and smart contracts.” However, it is also true that information on BTC was more scarce at the time, according to Tabar.There is no denying that the popularity of the crypto market has risen in recent months, with investors now having access to the industry via a variety of traditional financial instruments, including exchange-traded funds, exchange-traded products and even stocks in the form of companies like Coinbase. In the wake of all this, most legacy banking institutions have continued to shy away from the space even though it presents a tremendous amount of monetary and technological potential.Felix Simon — head of business development at Dsent AG, a platform for digital assets and complex tokenizations, and former market head of sales for structured derivatives investments at Credit Suisse — believes that banks tend to shy away from investment offerings whose underlyings fundamentals are not well proven, adding:In its most basic sense, the Sharpe ratio can be thought of as a metric that measures the performance of an investment compared with a risk-free asset, after adjusting for its risk. In other words, it can be used to gauge the total amount of return that an investor receives per unit of increase in risk.Mattia Rattaggi, managing partner of Meti Advisory AG and former managing director and head of regulatory affairs and governance reporting for UBS, believes that the vast majority of banks have long neglected Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general out of the fear of associating themselves with a source of potentially negative headlines, as well as the fear of industries, like decentralized finance, that can have a direct impact on their centralized business model. He added:Expounding his views on the subject of whether more traditional financial entities will continue to enter the space, Simon noted that banks that are just starting to make their crypto foray are still “early movers,” implying that there is still room for many more such players to make their way into this rapidly evolving space.Similarly, Tabar believes that while JPMorgan’s arrival to the blockchain scene will surely prompt some eye rolls within the cryptocurrency community, its lateness won’t affect its standing with the general public. He added:All of these above-stated developments can, in some shape or form, be viewed by the cryptocurrency community as being major milestones for Bitcoin as well as for the institutionalization of blockchain technology."
266,"Ether (ETH) hit $3,500 on May 4 as the star of this week's altcoin rally battled Dogecoin (DOGE) for returns supremacy.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView followed ETH/USD as the pair broke through its latest historic boundary and continued climbing.At the time of writing, the largest altcoin by market capitalization was in pure price discovery mode as it sought resistance above $3,500.The week had already seen new highs for Ether's price on a daily basis, with seven-day gains standing at 36%.Among analysts and traders alike, the sense of excitement on the day was palpable. ""I have been calling for $3600 $ETH for well over a month, but think it can go much higher,"" Scott Melker told Twitter followers.  Short-term price targets have called for $5,000, and while zooming out, $10,000 and even $20,000 are not unheard of targets, as Ether has outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) in U.S. dollar gains throughout the past year.On May 4, however, ETH was not alone. After somersaulting off its own all-time highs last month, Dogecoin returned with a vengeance, abruptly crushing its personal best to pass $0.50 for the first time. Discovery of a new price ceiling was likewise still in progress at the time of writing, with DOGE/USD taking out $0.55 on the back of 38% daily gains.The move came as major exchange Gemini announced that it had integrated support for Dogecoin, a day after trading platform eToro announced the same.""Dogecoin is the people’s money. It’s organic, irreverent, and fun,"" co-founder Tyler Winklevoss commented.Bitcoin predictably felt the heat from the altcoin advance, shedding both market dominance and price strength to near $55,000 for the second time in 24 hours."
267,"The road to the Taproot upgrade finally coming in 2021 is already underway, with major Bitcoin (BTC) mining pools already signaling support.According to data from Taproot.watch, a webpage created by Bitcoin developer Hampus Sjöberg, Taproot signaling now accounts for about 44% of the total Bitcoin hashing power as of the time of writing.AntPool and F2Pool — the two largest Bitcoin mining pools by hash rate — are among the earliest supporters of the Taproot activation in the mining arena. Other pools in support are Foundry USA and Slush Pool, with the latter responsible for mining the first signaling block.Based on Bitcoin’s consensus, Taproot activation will only go forward if 90% of all mined blocks include an activation signal within a difficulty adjustment window (2,016 blocks).This consensus agreement must happen in one of the difficulty epochs between now and Aug. 11 to be locked in as a network upgrade for November. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the current difficulty period began on May 1 after a 12% downward adjustment.As of publishing time, only 97 signaling blocks have emerged in the current window. Meanwhile, miners responsible for 382 blocks have elected to not include a “signal bit.”The “no votes” by these miners, which account for 19% of the 2,016 blocks in the current difficulty window, means that the Taproot activation cannot be locked in until at least the next difficulty epoch.However, given the reported support by miners for Taproot, the activation — touted to be the most significant for Bitcoin in over four years — is expected to proceed without as much controversy as the Segregated Witness saga of 2016 and 2017.Taproot as an upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol will reportedly enable users to mask additional spending conditions, which could have significant implications for Bitcoin’s smart contract capabilities.The ability to hide additional spending conditions beyond the ones triggered by the transacting parties could also improve Bitcoin’s privacy."
268,"DBS Bank, Singapore’s largest retail and commercial bank, has announced its first-quarter financial results following the launch of its institutional cryptocurrency exchange in December 2020.DBS chief financial officer Chng Sok Hui said that the bank saw record performance as quarterly net profit surpassed $2 billion for the first time in history, doubling from the previous quarter.DBS’ newly launched crypto platform, DBS Digital Exchange, apparently played a significant role in the bank’s latest milestone, as the platform saw a tenfold increase in daily trading volumes, reaching $30 million to $40 million, DBS CEO Piyush Gupta said. The CEO announced further plans for the newly launched crypto exchange, including the company’s first security token offering scheduled for the second quarter of 2021.Gupta also mentioned the company’s collaboration with United States investment bank JPMorgan Chase and Singapore state investment firm Temasek to create a new blockchain venture focused on global interbank transactions. “Blockchain can change the paradigm. Money can be converted into digitized form that has been cleared, which can be sent across for settlement as quickly as the written message,” the CEO stated.Gupta said that DBS and JPMorgan’s blockchain-powered cross-border payments will involve tests featuring the Singapore dollar and the U.S. dollar. “We are actively bringing in other banks so that the euro, sterling, renminbi etc become part of the system. And if we can do that, we will be an important part of a game-changing infrastructure for payments,” he stated."
269,"Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) will co-exist “for a while” with more restrictive digital currencies like China’s digital yuan, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said in a Bloomberg interview on Monday.According to Zhao, some of the key features of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) — freedom of use and limited supply — won’t be offered by central bank digital currencies. “At the end of the day, those are core properties that users care about,” he stated.Zhao said that the differences between the two types of digital assets could make central bank-issued currencies unattractive to people in the crypto industry. “Most central bank digital currencies are going to have a lot of control attached to them,” he noted.Unlike a fiat currency like the United States dollar, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has a limited supply, meaning that there won’t ever be more than 21 million Bitcoins in the world. Many crypto proponents have been pointing out money printing-fueled inflation, suggesting that Bitcoin could emerge as a potential hedge against fiat catastrophe. Zhao’s remarks on CBDCs come as the U.S. moves forward with its CBDC plans, with the nonprofit Digital Dollar Project announcing five pilot digital dollar programs on Monday. In order to proceed with the tests over the next 12 months, the organization teamed up with accounting giant Accenture, a company that has been involved with Sweden’s central bank in developing a CBDC since 2019.Despite new digital dollar efforts, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last week reiterated that it is “far more important” to get a digital dollar right than it is to be first. Powell previously outlined major CBDC-related concerns such as user privacy and security. "
270,"Bitcoin (BTC) is back testing lower levels after failing to conquer $60,000 resistance — and indicators suggest the downturn is not over.BTC/USD bounced off $55,000 overnight on Monday, hours after hitting local highs of nearly $59,000 in bullish early trading.With sellers still in place closer to all-time highs of $64,500, the largest cryptocurrency has a lot of work to do to exit its current broad trading range.One metric that may soon be causing problems for bulls is the overall BTC balance on cryptocurrency exchanges.While seeing a general steep downtrend throughout the past year, local spikes in supply — when traders send coins back to their exchange accounts for potential quick sale — tend to reflect a more selling-driven mentality entering.This is not the case for every exchange this week. According to data from monitoring resource Bybt, 16,222 BTC has entered global leader Binance in the past seven days. By contrast, institutional platform Coinbase Pro has actually lost 11,947 BTC, conforming to the overall trend.Yet Binance is not alone — OKEx, Huobi, Bitfinex and Kraken have all seen their BTC balances tick up in the last 24 hours.As Cointelegraph reported, a familiar face from sentiment changes past is back this week — greed.Tracked by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures trader sentiment using a basket of weighted factors, appetite for a sell-off is rising, even as price action is no longer positive.On Tuesday, the Index gave an overall crypto market score of 68/100, corresponding to “greed” being the overall mood driver.This is still below its mid-90s peak seen earlier in the year — a level that almost guarantees a sell-off — but volatility ensures that the ndex does not stay in the same zone for long. “Greed” can turn to “extreme greed” or “extreme fear” within days or even faster.On April 27, for instance, the Index measured just 27/100.Last but not least is perhaps the most conspicuous factor at play when it comes to problems for Bitcoin this week: altcoins.At first, it was Ether (ETH), which led the pack and outshined Bitcoin with its trip above $3,000 to all-time highs on Monday.Now, however, Dogecoin (DOGE) is leaving the rest in its dust, back above $0.47 after getting integrated on popular trading platform eToro.DOGE/USD was up 72% in a week compared with Bitcoin’s 3% at the time of writing.While altcoin surges come in bouts, the mood among analysts is increasingly one of a longer-term trend taking center stage before Bitcoin can claw back lost time — and market dominance.As Cointelegraph reported, one indicator even suggests that the combined altcoin market cap could explode by more than 27,000% by the start of 2022.“The next 2-3 months are going to be epic for alt coins,” the popular Twitter trader known as Johnny summarized to followers, also forecasting a near-term price target of $5,000 for Ether.Bitcoin’s market share is currently 46.3%, falling ever lower thanks to altcoin inflows."
271,"On April 30, a virtual benefit co-hosted by American TV star Jimmy Kimmel and NASA engineer-turned-YouTuber Mark Rober raised over $3 million in donations to support NEXT for AUTISM, a charity dedicated to addressing the needs of people with autism and their families across the United States. The interactive livestream featured a wide range of well-known entertainers, comedians, musicians, and athletes, among them Jon Stewart, Conan O’Brien, Chris Rock, Adam Sandler and Charlize Theron.The virtual benefit was also brought a step forward into the digital currency era, with crypto lender Nexo and The Giving Block offering a payment channel for viewers to donate to the charity using a wide range of crypto assets. Alongside Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), donations in Dai (DAI), The Graph (GRT), Litecoin (LTC) , Storj (STORJ), Zcash (ZEC), 0x (ZRX) and other altcoins were supported.Now that the livestream has ended, Nexo has left open its crypto donations portal for viewers to catch up and contribute their funds to the charity.  The company told Cointelegraph that it was still gathering data from ongoing contributions from crypto contributors and would release its final tally soon. A representative from The Giving Block meanwhile provided the organization's own figures for crypto raised by Color The Spectrum:While the event was successful in engaging high-profile stars and raising funds, a large section of the autism community has voiced criticism of multiple aspects of the Color The Spectrum initiative. In one open letter signed by a group of autism activists, they pointed to their concerns about the recipient charity, NEXT for AUTISM, highlighting its failure to communicate directly with autistic-led organizations. There has also been a high level of dissent regarding NEXT's controversial contribution of funds to the Center for Autism and the Developing Brain. The latter is an organization that researches the causes of and ""cures"" for autism, an approach that the autistic community has condemned as eugenicist and unacceptable.Mark Rober has engaged with the aforementioned open letter and its criticisms, leading to a dialogue that the authors have characterized as being in good faith. Other members of the community have emphasized that they feel their concerns have not been adequately responded to by many of the participants in the event.  In parallel, autism activitsts have also circulated their own hashtag #FinanceTheSpectrum, which aims to highlight NEXT's failure to address the persistent under- and unemployment that autistic people continue to struggle with.The Giving Block is a major crypto donations platform that has partnered with various crypto industry actors in the past. Last month, the organization launched an initiative called the “Crypto Giving Pledge,” which encourages crypto investors to pledge at least 1% of their holdings to charities each year.In The Giving Block's estimation, if every participant in the crypto market donated 1% of their holdings to charities, they could collectively raise $20 billion, based on the market capitalization of digital assets in late April, the time of the initiative's launch."
272,"S&P Dow Jones Indices, a major global resource for index-based data and research, has introduced its first cryptocurrency indexes amid a renewed surge on crypto markets.The company announced on Monday that it had launched three crypto indexes tied to the performance of the two largest cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).The newly introduced indexes include Bitcoin-based S&P Bitcoin Index (SPBTC), Ether-based S&P Ethereum Index (SPETH), and S&P Cryptocurrency MegaCap Index (SPCMC), which is designed to track the performance of BTC and ETH weighted by market capitalization. All three indexes are immediately available on the S&P’s website.The company stressed that the new crypto indexes are designed to measure the performance of crypto assets listed on recognized, open exchanges that meet minimum liquidity and market capitalization requirements. “The indices aim to bring transparency to the emerging cryptocurrency market,” the S&P Dow Jones Indices noted.According to the announcement, S&P crypto pricing and reference data is provided by crypto accounting and data company Lukka. The firm is backed by S&P DJI’s parent company S&P Global as well as billionaire investor George Soros and accounting advisor CPA.com.S&P DJI initially announced its plan to launch cryptocurrency indexes in late 2021, reportedly targeting coverage of up to 550 digital assets.S&P DJI’s latest move into the crypto market marks an important milestone for cryptocurrency adoption by traditional finance. The move comes amid a renewed rally on crypto markets, with Ether — the second-largest crypto by market cap — hitting a new all-time high above $3,400 on Monday."
273,"The circulating supply of the four-largest stablecoins has spiked to new all-time highs, suggesting buyers could soon spark another leg up for the Bitcoin and crypto markets.The combined capitalization of Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), Binance USD (BUSD), and Dai (DAI) has surged almost 190% from $27 billion to almost $78 billion since the beginning of this year.In its May 3 Week on Chain report, on-chain analytics provider, Glassnode, noted that Tether is firmly positioned as the stable token sector’s leader, representing two-thirds of the top four stablecoins’ combined capitalization. USDT’s total minted supply hit an all-time high of $51.78 billion at the end of last week after increasing by $1.48 billion or 3% in just seven days.USDC supply has also increased by roughly $1 billion over the past week, with its capitalization currently sitting at $14.5 billion, according to CoinGecko. It briefly tapped a peak of $15 billion on April 30.BUSD’s circulating supply tagged a record of $7.8 billion on May 3, while DAI’s supply is at an all-time high of $3.9 billion as of this writing.With the surging supply, Glassnode highlights that Bitcoin’s Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR), which measures the Bitcoin supply divided by the stablecoin supply, is sitting at a year-to-date low of 13.4, and is approaching its all-time-low of 9.6.The chart shows that SSR has been persistently low during 2020 and 2021 as stablecoin supplies have largely grown in proportion to Bitcoin’s price appreciation.According to Glassnode, a decreasing SSR value is a bullish signal that the global stablecoin supply becoming larger relative to the Bitcoin market cap:“As the total supply of stablecoins increase, it suggests an increased 'buying power' of crypto-native capital that can be quickly exchanged and traded into BTC and other crypto-assets.”Aave’s liquidity mining incentives launched on April 27 would have also given a boost to stablecoin demand as the majority of the rewards were targeted towards staking USDT, USDC, and DAI. DeFi investors have observed that Aave’s yield farming had an immediate impact on stablecoin borrowing volumes which have over doubled since late April."
274,"Ether (ETH) took charge as a new month begins and the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rallied to a new all-time high at $3,338. This has many analysts shouting out that a new 'altcoin season' has commenced. Meanwhile, Bitcoin  (BTC) price is continuing to meet resistance around the $56,000 to $58,000 level. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that since dropping to a low of $2,160 on April 25, the price of Ether has rallied 54% to a new record high at $3,324 on May 3 as Monday’s 12% spike lifted the top altcoin above the $3,300 level for the first time in history.While a majority of crypto traders are celebrating Ether’s price breakout, which has helped elevate project co-founder Vitalik Buterin to the crypto billionaire club, bearish traders are en route to heavy losses as nearly every one of the 76,000 put option contracts that are set to expire on April 7 will become worthless if Ether price manages to stay above $3,100.And it's not just Ether that has been performing well as of late. In the past 2 months, the altcoin market as a whole has seen its value increase 119% and flipped the 2017 peak into a new support level.According to Glassnode, an on-chain analytics firm,  the amount of Ether being held long term has been on the rise since late 2020 and this could be a contributing factor propelling the multi-month rally.The chart above showing “Ethereum HODL waves” indicates that ""coins appear to be maturing from 1-week to over 6-months old since late 2020 (blue arrows),” with the “proportion of coins aged 1-month to 6-months progressively increasing in thickness suggesting HODLing coins accumulated in the early bull market remains a favored strategy.”Glassnode also pointed out that a large volume of Ether has been removed from exchange wallets in 2021, with 10 instances of withdrawals in excess of 200k Ether per day taking place in just 4 months as institutional demand and decentralized finance (DeFi) use grows.As seen on the chart above, the amount of Ether held on exchanges has been on the decline since September 2020 which coincided with a noticeable increase in the amount of Ether held in decentralized finance smart contracts.Currently, the amount of Ether locked in smart contracts is outpacing the amount held in centralized exchange reserves.With Bitcoin still struggling to secure a daily close above $58,000, altcoins continue to make the case for an emerging altseason.Waves (WAVES) was the breakout star of the day with its token price surging 41% to a record high at $36.41. Ethereum Classic (ETC) also rallied 15% to a new all-time high at $50.90.After rallying 17.84% to $5,777 in the past 24-hrs, Maker (MKR) is now the top-ranked decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol with a total value locked of $10.92 trillion.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $2.29 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 46.6%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

275,"The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or CME, has officially launched its newest Bitcoin (BTC) derivatives product, setting the stage for wider mainstream adoption of digital assets. TIm McCourt, CME Group’s global head of equity index and alternative investment products, said the new product will provide “an efficient, cost-effective way for a broad array of market participants — from institutions to sophisticated, active traders — to fine-tune their bitcoin exposure and enhance their trading strategies.”The Micro Bitcoin futures contract is worth 0.1 BTC, which provides traders with an additional tool to hedge their digital currency price risk.J. B. Mackenzie, managing director of TD Ameritrade Futures and Forex, said Micro Bitcoin futures address the two biggest issues with cryptocurrency investing — “namely, the high cost and the desire to engage within a regulated environment.”Citing growing demand for smaller-sized contracts, CME Group first announced its intent to launch a micro BTC derivatives product on March 30. At the time, 1 Bitcoin was worth roughly $58,000, which is not unlike current prices. The leading digital currency skyrocketed above $64,000 in April before experiencing a broad pullback.The use of cryptocurrency derivatives has grown exponentially since CME launched the first-ever Bitcoin futures contract in December 2017. Although the Chicago Board Options Exchange quickly followed suit, the crosstown rival would eventually abandon the product offering altogether.Crypto derivatives trades accounted for 55% of the overall market in December 2020. That figure is likely to grow as derivatives exchanges like Bybt, FTX and BitMEX remain the go-to for traders seeking oversized exposure to digital assets."
276,"Ether (ETH) has been the star performer among major cryptocurrencies in the past few days as its rally has continued unabated. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization crossed the $3,300 today sending projects market cap to $381.6 billion. Ether has now become the 24th largest asset in the world, vaulting the project above blue-chip names like Mastercard, NVIDIA, Walt Disney, Bank of America and Home Depot, according to data from Infinite Market Cap. This strong performance in Ether has also brought back murmurs of Ethereum flippening Bitcoin (BTC).However, Ether has a lot of catching up to do if it wants to flip Bitcoin because its market dominance at 16.4% is much below Bitcoin’s 47%. Still, the rise of Ether is positive for the crypto sector because it is likely to attract the attention of institutional investors.Fund managers will find it difficult to ignore the top two cryptocurrencies as their market caps surpass popular Wall Street names. This could continue to attract fresh money into the crypto sector and boost prices higher.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine their trend and the possible target objectives.Bitcoin has bounced off the 20-day exponential moving average ($55,915) today, suggesting that bulls are accumulating on dips. The buyers will now try to push the price to the $61,825.84 to $64,849.27 overhead resistance zone.However, the wick on today’s candlestick shows that the bulls are struggling to sustain the price above $58,000. If the buyers fail to do that, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the price below the 20-day EMA.If they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could start a correction to $52,323.21 and then to $50,460. A bounce off this level could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days.Alternatively, if the bulls defend the 20-day EMA, it will signal strength. If the buyers can sustain the price above $58,000, the pair could start a gradual climb to the overhead zone. The next leg of the uptrend may start after the pair rises above $64,849.27.Ether had been trading inside an ascending channel for the past few days. The bulls pushed the price above the resistance line of the channel on May 1, resulting in a pick-up in momentum. Ether could now rally to $3,513.Both moving averages are sloping up suggesting that bulls have the upper hand. However, the RSI above 80 suggests the rally is overbought in the short-term and the ETH/USDT pair may soon enter a minor correction or consolidation.If the bulls do not allow the price to re-enter the channel, it will suggest that traders are buying on dips as they expect the rally to continue. Conversely, if the bears sink and sustain the price below $2,850, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($2,586).After forming a Doji candlestick pattern on May 1 and 2, Binance Coin (BNB) has resumed its uptrend today. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, suggesting the bulls have overpowered the bears.If the bulls can sustain the price above $639, the BNB/USDT pair could start its journey toward the pattern target at $808.57.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above $639, the bears will try to pull the price down to the 20-day EMA ($552). A bounce off this support will keep the uptrend intact.However, if the price drops below the 20-day EMA, the pair could decline to the support line of the triangle and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($421).XRP turned down from $1.66 and formed an inside-day candlestick pattern on May 2. That was followed by a Doji candlestick pattern today, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears.If the uncertainty resolves to the downside, the XRP/USDT pair could correct to the 20-day EMA ($1.36), which is likely to act as a strong support.A strong rebound off the 20-day EMA will suggest that traders are buying on dips. If the bulls thrust the price above $1.66, the pair could rise to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement at $1.73 and then retest the 52-week high at $1.96.The marginally rising 20-day EMA and the RSI near 61 indicate the bulls have the upper hand. This positive view will invalidate if the pair breaks the 20-day EMA support. Such a move will suggest that traders are dumping their positions and that could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($1.01).The uncertainty following the inside-day candlestick pattern on April 29 resolved to the upside on April 30 and the bulls propelled Dogecoin (DOGE) above the $0.34 resistance on May 1.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for DOGE on April 29, prior to the recent price rise.The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for DOGE flipped green on April 29 when the price was $0.30.Since then, the VORTECS™ Score has largely remained in the green, barring a short-term dip below the 60 level. DOGE has rallied above $0.41 today, resulting in a 36% rally in roughly five days.The rising 20-day EMA ($0.28) and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest the bulls are in control. The DOGE/USDT pair could now retest the all-time high at $0.45.If the bulls propel the price above this resistance, the uptrend could resume with the next target objective at $0.65.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks the 20-day EMA support,Cardano (ADA) has been sustaining above the 20-day EMA ($1.27) for the past few days, suggesting the bulls are in no hurry to book profits. The altcoin remains on track to resume the up-move and reach the $1.48 to $1.55 resistance zone.The ADA/USDT pair may hit a wall at the overhead resistance zone as the bears will once again try to reverse the direction and keep the price stuck inside the $1.03 to $1.48 range for a few more days.The marginally rising 20-day EMA and the RSI above 56 suggest the bulls have the upper hand. If they can drive the price above the zone, the pair could start its journey to $2.On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the moving averages, the pair may drop to the support of the range at $1.03.After hesitating near the 50-day SMA ($36.94) on May 1 and 2, the bulls pushed Polkadot (DOT) above it today. However, the long wick on today’s candlestick shows the bears have not given up yet and are selling on every rise.Both moving averages are flat and the RSI is just above the midpoint, suggesting a balance between supply and demand. This balance will tilt in favor of the bulls if they can push and sustain the price above the 50-day SMA. That could open the gates for a move to $42.28.On the contrary, if the price turns down and slips below the 20-day EMA, the DOT/USDT pair may drop to $32.50. The bulls are likely to defend this level aggressively but if the bears overpower them, the pair could drop to support of the range at $26.50.Uniswap (UNI) witnessed profit-booking at $44 on April 29 and entered a minor correction. However, the bulls succeeded in flipping the previous resistance at $39.60 into support, which is a positive sign.The uptrend has resumed today and the UNI/USDT pair has risen to a new all-time high at $45. Although the RSI is still warning of a negative divergence, the upsloping 20-day EMA ($37.41) suggests the bulls are in control.If the bulls sustain the price above $44, the pair could rise to the resistance line of the ascending channel at $50. This bullish view will nullify if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA. The pair could then drop to the support line of the channel.After a one-day correction on May 2, Litecoin (LTC) has started its northward journey today. This suggests the sentiment remains bullish and every minor dip is being purchased. The bulls will now try to push the price above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $286.02.If they succeed, the LTC/USDT pair could rise to the 78.6% retracement level at $307.58 and then to $335.03. The gradually upsloping 20-day EMA ($257) and the RSI above 61 suggest that demand exceeds supply.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from $286.02 and slumps below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that traders are closing their positions on relief rallies. That could result in a drop to the 50-day SMA ($230).Bitcoin Cash (BCH) turned down from the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,012.29 on May 1 but the correction was short-lived as the bulls purchased the dip on May 2. This suggests strong demand at lower levels.However, the long wick on today’s candlestick shows bears are selling on rallies above $1,012.29. If the price turns down from the current level and breaks below $950.46, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($879).A break below this level will suggest the bullish momentum has weakened and that will open the doors for a possible drop to the 50-day SMA ($703).Conversely, if the bulls succeed in sustaining the price above $1,012.29, the BCH/USDT pair could rise to $1,100.78 and then retest the 52-week high at $1,213.51. The rising moving averages and the RSI above 62, indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

277,"In the past, there were plenty of reasons for financial advisers to dismiss Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies as a worthy investment, but all of that is starting to change as more institutions become attuned to the digital asset class. A face-melting rally for Bitcoin between September 2020 and April 2021 amplified the need to push beyond the narrative that digital assets are simply too volatile to include in client portfolios. In a keynote address at this year’s virtual Crypto Finance Conference St. Moritz in January, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein outlined six major themes that could shape the cryptocurrency market in the near future. One of those themes was the potential for greater adoption among financial advisers.In a follow-up interview with Cointelegraph, Sonnenshein explained that “Curiosity and demand from clients are driving financial adviser interest in crypto.” His conclusion stems from a preliminary survey commissioned by Grayscale showing that “More than half of advisers are receiving questions from their clients about cryptocurrencies.”While this may not drive immediate action, cryptocurrencies have certainly become a consideration for advisers, he explained. “Ultimately, financial advisers are responding to client demand,” he said, adding:Sonnenshein also noted that financial advisers are among those who invest in Grayscale's family of funds, whose combined assets now exceed $46 billion. “Bitcoin remains the most popular digital currency, though we also see growing interest in Ethereum and other digital assets as well,” he said.Edouard Hindi, co-founder and chief investment officer of Tyr Capital Arbitrage — a United Kingdom-based cryptocurrency hedge fund manager — said financial advisers have increased their allocation of digital assets, especially Bitcoin, over the last six months. The shift has also been observed at private banks, which have gone from seeking education on cryptocurrency to investing directly with Tyr Capital Arbitrage.He explained that “The bulk of the interest we are seeing remains concentrated on the directionless high risk/reward attributes of funds like Tyr Capital Arbitrage and directional exposure to Bitcoin.”Bitcoin’s newfound legitimacy within the institutional ranks has eliminated much of the so-called “career risk” involved with investing in the digital asset market. As Hindi noted, finance professionals, one year ago, were thought to be taking a “career-ending risk” for investing in crypto.Now, it’s considered career-ending not to have any exposure to digital assets. The final domino to fall, Hindi believes, could be fiduciary standards:Jeffrey Wang, head of Americas for Amber Group — a crypto-finance startup founded by former Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Bloomberg professionals — believes independent advisers have a lot more freedom to diversify into crypto than the major banks.“I think there will be a large bottleneck for the advisers who work at the firms owned by big banks to offer crypto that isn't in the form of a listed ETF [or] security,” Wang said. “These banks aren’t nimble enough to expand their wealth management offerings, especially for non-listed crypto assets.” He continued:While institutional adoption of digital assets remains nascent, several major investors and corporations have made a big splash by acquiring Bitcoin. Legendary investors Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller own BTC. On the corporate side, MicroStrategy and Tesla have acquired billions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin to hedge against currency debasement. MassMutual, a Massachusetts-based insurance firm, purchased $100 million worth of BTC in December 2020. It’s estimated that businesses currently hold nearly 6.8% of the circulating Bitcoin supply.Meanwhile, major institutions, including BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Citibank and JPMorgan Chase have adopted a more positive outlook on cryptocurrencies. BlackRock’s leadership has gone as far as comparing Bitcoin to gold, with chief investment officer Rick Rieder claiming that BTC will eat away at the precious metal’s market cap in the long run.Wang believes institutional adoption will be “very prevalent” in the next 12 to 18 months, going as far as saying that “The majority of firms will embrace blockchain in some way.”So far, the latest corporate earnings season on Wall Street hasn’t revealed any new crypto investors, but that could soon change as the bull market continues to grow. Tesla, meanwhile, announced that it sold a portion of its Bitcoin for a significant profit, a move that CEO Elon Musk said demonstrates the asset's liquidity. Musk later confirmed that he has not sold any of his Bitcoin.There's also strong evidence that the venture capital world is backing cryptocurrency projects with ever-growing conviction. In addition to the dozens of VC-led investment rounds covered by Cointelegraph in recent months, Andreessen Horowitz is reportedly eyeing a new crypto-focused investment fund worth up to $1 billion. That would align with the venture capital firm's recent crypto-focused investments into Aleo and OpenSea, among others. "
278,"Digital Currency Group, the parent company of digital asset manager Grayscale Investments, is now authorized to purchase up to $750 million worth of shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.The company announced Monday that DCG increased its prior authorization to buy up to $250 million worth of GBTC shares by an extra $500 million.The share purchase authorization does not obligate DCG to acquire any certain amount of shares in any period, and it may be expanded, modified or discontinued at any time, DCG noted. Actual purchases will depend on many factors like the levels of available cash as well as price and market conditions, the firm said.DCG mentioned that the firm had purchased a total of $193.5 million worth of GBTC shares as of Friday. DCG plans to use cash to fund the purchases and will make the purchases at management’s discretion in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act, the company noted.The news comes shortly after DCG originally announced in March its plan to purchase up to $250 million of GBTC shares. The move came amid volatile conditions for GBTC and plans to hire talent in the exchange-traded fund industry, which signaled a potential diversification by the firm.Launched back in 2013 as the Bitcoin Investment Trust, GBTC is the world’s largest Bitcoin (BTC) fund, offering investors the opportunity to gain exposure to Bitcoin through a publicly quoted private trust. As of Friday, the assets under management in GBTC amounted to more than $36 billion, with Grayscale’s total AUM standing at $46.7 billion. In mid-April — when Bitcoin touched it’s all-time highs above $64,000 — Grayscale’s total AUM topped $50 billion."
279,"Altcoins have delivered huge gains this year, but if they repeat their 2017 moves, hodlers may be looking at an insane 27,000% moonshot.According to popular trader Rekt Capital, those are the potential combined returns for altcoin investors if history repeats itself this year. In a tweet on May 3, Rekt Capital noted that at the start of 2017, the market capitalization of altcoins flipped its previous cycle high to support. That high had come in late 2013, and as a new floor level, it launched the market cap to a peak no less than 27,623% above it.All it took was a single year, and Rekt Capital suggested that although almost unimaginable, the same thing could happen by the end of 2021. In the past two months alone, the altcoin market cap is up 119% after flipping that same 2017 peak to support.How much would an altcoin market be worth were it to reach 27,623% of its 2017 height? A princely $152.6 trillion.""This is just the beginning,"" he commented.The figures come as the largest altcoin, Ether (ETH), became a talking point in its own right on May 3, having passed $3,000 to go on to see dizzying new all-time highs.As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin (BTC) is comparatively lackluster, managing roughly 11% gains over the past week compared with Ether's 28%.Many of the other major cap altcoins have also outperformed Bitcoin in terms of weekly gains, with analysts predicting new all-time highs to appear elsewhere. Arguing in defence of BTC, however, fellow analyst Scott Melker looked to higher time frames for signs of a predictable uptick incoming.""There have been quite a few 'bad' weekly candles on the Bitcoin chart in the past year,"" he noted."
280,"American rapper and cryptocurrency investor Nasir Jones, better known by his stage name Nas, has invited fans to join the cryptocurrency industry in a newly released track.Released last week, “Sorry Not Sorry” is a collaboration between DJ Khaled, Nas, Jay-Z and James Fauntleroy, with Nas rapping about Coinbase, the United States’ largest crypto exchange that went public on Nasdaq on April 14.“Winner in life, fuck a coin toss / I’m coin-based, basically cryptocurrency Scarface / Join us, there’s gotta be more of us,” Nas raps in the new collab. Released on YouTube last Friday, the official music video for “Sorry Not Sorry” has 7.8 million views at the time of writing.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Nas is an early Coinbase believer, investing in the company through his venture capital firm QueensBridge Venture Partners. The rapper reportedly joined Coinbase’s $25 million Series B round in 2013, buying between 99,000 and 496,000 shares at a price of $1.00676 per share.Coinbase COIN shares opened at $381 on Nasdaq in mid-April, marking strong institutional demand, as the stock’s pre-listing reference price was just $250. The stock closed Friday trades at $297, at a market capitalization of nearly $60 billion. Nas, who could have netted at least $40 million from his early Coinbase investment, took to Twitter on the listing day, stating: “Long crypto forever.... in sickness and in health.”As previously reported, Nas’ QueensBridge Venture Partners has invested in many other crypto companies, including Bitfury Group and BlockCypher as well as crypto-friendly stock trading app Robinhood.Nas’ song collaborators have been involved in the crypto industry as well. Jay-Z set up a Bitcoin development fund worth 500 Bitcoin (BTC) in cooperation with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in February.DJ Khaled, however, has not been lucky with regard to cryptocurrencies. The record producer paid six-figure settlements to U.S. regulators in 2019 for promoting Centra Tech’s fraudulent initial coin offering on social media. "
281,"Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has commented on the volatility of Bitcoin (BTC), stating that the largest crypto by market capitalization is probably less volatile than the stock prices of similarly-sized companies by market capitalization such as Apple and Tesla.Data from Woobull shows Bitcoin’s 60-day volatility steadily declining since the start of 2021. However, figures from the investment research portal AlphaQuery show that Tesla and Apple stock prices still have significantly lower 60-day volatilities over the same period.Speaking during an interview with Bloomberg TV on Monday, the Binance chief argued that crypto’s volatility was not unlike the situation in the stock market, adding: “Volatility is everywhere […] It is not unique to crypto.”""There's always a large number of people having the herd mentality than the guys who actually do serious research.""@cz_binance, founder of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, discusses volatility of #cryptocurrency markets on @BloombergTV pic.twitter.com/UAT4Kpy1tuFor Zhao, yield chasers who are often not as committed to crypto projects as the actual true believers are often to blame for choppy price actions due to their large numbers.“There’s always a large number of people having the herd mentality than the guys who actually do serious research.”“Whenever there is some negative news, they [herd followers] run away, whenever there’s positive news, they try to rush in and so they do cause more volatility,” Zhao stated.The executive’s characterization of crypto believers as being more “die-hard fans who understand and really love the project” is consistent with his previous remarks about his personal disposition to the industry as a whole.Back in April, Zhao revealed that he holds nearly 100% of his net worth in cryptocurrencies.The crypto market is enjoying a Monday of significant gains, with the total market capitalization up more than 4.5% in the last 24 hours.Ether’s (ETH) climb to breach the $3,000 mark for the first time ever has been the highlight of the day especially among the top-10 ranked tokens according to market capitalization.Bitcoin appears set to test the $60,000 mark for the first time since mid-April, which preceded a minor correction below $50,000 on April 24."
282,"Bitcoin (BTC) is challenging familiar but significant all-time highs as a new week gets underway, rallying to $58,000 on Monday.After a surprise rally on Friday, the largest cryptocurrency saw a slow comedown through much of the weekend. This turned on its head overnight on Sunday, however, and now BTC/USD is back fighting resistance near $60,000.Cointelegraph takes a look at what the coming days might have in store for Bitcoin price action with five factors that could help shape it.With various major markets closed for May holidays, there are fewer cues than usual coming from commodities and equities.Asian stocks tracked losses, fuelled by various issues including India’s ongoing COVID-19 debacle. At the same time, in the United States, S&P 500 futures are already recovering lost ground from Friday.Unlike Bitcoin, markets did not react well to rumors that fiscal support measures over the virus may be reduced by some banks — these were a key element behind the S&P’s record performance over the past year.In tandem with the move was a shift in the strength of the dollar, however, with the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) seeing impressive gains after a month of descent.As Cointelegraph reported, DXY and Bitcoin tend to be inversely correlated, but last Friday proved to be another notable exception. BTC/USD climbed conspicuously as if out of nowhere on the day, passing $58,300 before reversing.A key topic remains inflation — senior U.S. officials believe that trillions of dollars in virus stimulus will have little impact on it, while others disagree.Another day, another blistering comeback for Bitcoin.Just a week after recovering from its dip to near $46,000, BTC price action is now making good on its further gains late last week.While the weekend was mostly lackluster in tone, Monday is seeing the kind of “buying frenzy” that arch-nemesis Warren Buffett has been eyeing on traditional markets.At the time of writing, BTC/USD has passed $58,300 — the site of an all-time high from February — and is now continuing higher, calming near $59,000.A look at buy and sell demand from the orderbook of major exchange Binance shows resistance is still strong at $60,000 and above, and bulls will need to knock down several walls of sell orders to break out beyond the current all-time high of $64,500. Another significant barrier is now $68,000.On the support side, the picture is less sturdy — $52,000 is the first solid level among traders, followed by $50,000 and $48,000.Nonetheless, appetite for Bitcoin could well be seeing a new bullish phase as stablecoin balances on exchanges fill up. Against huge “printing” of these assets, such a trend raises the prospects of significant buyer demand materialising, helping to boost spot price action.“Stable coins are flowing back into exchanges. You know what that means,” analyst Jan Wuestenfeld summarized.Friday’s gains were notably driven by “genuine” buying among spot traders, while leveraged trades actually declined.Another theory focuses on Bitcoin simply playing catch-up with a red-hot altcoin scene, led by Ether (ETH).The performance has defied expectations; ETH/USD is now above $3,000, having gained 28% over the past week compared to Bitcoin’s 11%.That predictably shaved even more clout off Bitcoin’s market cap dominance, which is now at 47.7% — its lowest since July 2018.“I wouldn’t be surprised if we see $3500 $ETH this week,” popular Twitter trader Crypto Chase forecast, along with further upside against Bitcoin.On-chain monitoring resource Glassnode, meanwhile, saw strength in the decreasing network value to transaction ratio (NVT) on Ethereum, this corresponding to organic trade volume fuelling price gains.“As $ETH price reaches over $3,000 setting a new ATH, the NVT Ratio is driven back down towards this cycles lows,” the firm commented on an accompanying chart.Back to Bitcoin and its network fundamentals, which are still playing catch-up after seeing something of a “reset” over the past few weeks.This first came in the form of a brief hash-rate plunge due to flooding in China. Bitcoin’s network difficulty then began signaling a drop to accommodate the loss of participants.As difficulty adjusts every two weeks, it took until Saturday to kick in in real terms. The resulting 12% drop has been the biggest since last November.With that out of the way, however, the door is open for returning mining hash rate to up competition and return difficulty to positive, not negative, adjustments. It’s still early — current estimates still call for another drop, this time of around -7%.Hash rate, meanwhile, has all but recovered from its prior shock, standing at around 161 exahashes per second. Its peak, monitoring resource MiningPoolStats says, was 168 EH/s.With new gains comes a familiar shift in sentiment, and market participants are getting greedy.That’s according to the ever-popular Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which on Monday is back in “greed” territory after more than doubling since late last week.The Index uses a basket of factors to create a normalized score between 0 and 100 for how greedy or fearful crypto markets broadly are on a given day.Its score tends to highlight when a price floor is in, or conversely, when a sell-off is due. At 61/100, however, the Index still has room to grow before sounding a local top — “extreme greed” is not here yet."
283,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price closed the month down 1.98%, which, according to data from Bybit, was its first negative close in April since 2015.In the same month, Ether’s (ETH) price soared over 44% to hit a new all-time high close to $3,000. This wide divergence between the top two cryptocurrencies shows that the markets have matured and Bitcoin’s underperformance is not affecting altcoins as much as it did in the past.Ether’s bullish trend has attracted strong buying from traders. Data from Bybit suggests that Ether futures open interest climbed to $8.5 billion on Thursday, rising 52% over the previous month. This increase has been supported by professional traders who seem to have taken a more bullish view on Ether than retail investors, as highlighted by Cointelegraph contributor Marcel Pechman.The strong performance from the crypto sector continues to attract a wide array of investors. According to the Financial Times, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz plans to tap into this growing demand by raising between $800 million to $1 billion for another fund. The flow of money into various crypto projects shows that investors are bullish for the long term.T. Rowe Price CEO William Stromberg said in an interview with the Baltimore Business Journal that the crypto space is still in its infancy and it could “take years to really unfold.”With Ether leading the altcoin charge, let’s look at the top five cryptocurrencies that may remain bullish in the short term.Bitcoin soared above its moving averages on Friday, but the bulls have not been able to build on this strength. The Doji candlestick pattern on Saturday and the drop below the 50-day simple moving average ($56,833) on Sunday suggest the bears are selling at higher levels and have not given up.If sellers pull the price back below the 20-day exponential moving average ($55,723), the BTC/USDT pair could drop to $52,323.21 and then to $50,460. The flat moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. This could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days.This view will invalidate if the pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA and rises above $58,469.09. Such a move will suggest the bulls are buying on every minor dip. The pair could then rally to $61,825.85, where the bulls are again likely to face stiff resistance from the bears.Although it is too early to confirm, the pair seems to be making the right shoulder of a possible head and shoulders topping formation. This setup will complete on a break below the neckline. Until then, traders can be watchful but should not jump the gun in anticipation of a breakdown.The four-hour chart shows the bulls pushed the price above the $57,500 resistance but could not sustain it. The bears pulled the price back below the level and are trying to break the 20-EMA support. If that happens, the pair may drop to the 50-SMA.A strong rebound off this support could encourage the bulls to make one more attempt to clear the hurdle at $57,500. If they succeed, the pair could start its journey to $61,825.84. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the 50-SMA, the possibility of a drop to $50,460 increases.Solana (SOL) broke above the $48.64 resistance on Saturday and hit a new all-time high at $49.99 on Sunday. However, the $50 psychological level is acting as a resistance, and the bears have pulled the price back below $48.64 today.If the bears sustain the price below $48.64 for two days, the SOL/USDT pair could drop to the support at $40.51. A strong rebound off this support will suggest the bulls are accumulating on dips. The bulls will then make one more attempt to clear the $50 resistance.If they succeed, the pair may start the next leg of the uptrend that could reach $56.77 and then $68.05. The rising moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside.This positive view will invalidate if the price breaks below the 20-day EMA ($38). If that happens, the pair could correct to the 50-day SMA ($26).The four-hour chart shows the bulls are trying to defend the 20-EMA. If they can push the price above the $48.64–$49.99 overhead resistance zone, the momentum is likely to pick up. The gradually rising 20-EMA and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the bulls have a minor advantage.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance once again, it will increase the prospects of a break below the moving averages. The bears may then pull the price down to $40.51. A strong bounce off this support could keep the pair range-bound for a few days.Huobi Token (HT) surged above the resistance at $26.89 on Saturday and hit a new all-time high at $29.54 on Sunday. However, the bears are trying to pull the price back below the breakout level and trap the aggressive bulls.If the price dips and sustains below $26.89 for three days, the HT/USDT pair could gradually drop to $22. A strong rebound off this support could keep the pair range-bound for a few days.Conversely, if the bulls defend the $26.89 support or do not give up much ground below $25, it will suggest strong buying on every minor dip. A break above $29.54 could resume the uptrend with the next target objective at $36.54.The 20-day EMA ($20.54) has turned up, and the RSI is in the overbought zone, indicating that the bulls are in control.The bulls and the bears are battling it out for supremacy near the $26.89 level. Although the bears had pulled the price back to $26.10, they could not sustain the lower levels. This suggests that bulls are buying on dips.The rising moving averages and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest the bulls have the upper hand. However, the bulls are finding it difficult to push the price to $29.54. This could result in high volatility in the short term.A break below $26 could pull the price down to the 20-EMA. If the price rebounds off this level strongly, the bulls will make one more attempt to resume the uptrend. Alternatively, a break below the 20-EMA could signal the start of a deeper correction.The bears are trying to stall Ethereum Classic’s (ETC) up-move in the $38–$41.61 overhead resistance zone. However, the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests that traders are buying at lower levels.The upsloping 20-day EMA ($28.74) and the RSI in the overbought zone indicate advantage to the bulls. If buyers propel the price above the overhead zone, the ETC/USDT pair could resume the uptrend and rally to $53.21.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead zone, the bears will try to sink the pair to the 20-day EMA. A break below this support will indicate the bullish momentum has weakened, and the pair could then drop to $22.20.The 20-EMA is rising, and the RSI is in the overbought zone, suggesting the bulls are in control. However, the bears will not throw in the towel easily. They will try to stall the up-move in the overhead zone.A break below the 20-EMA will be the first sign that the bullish momentum may be weakening. That could pull the price down to the 50-SMA. Such a move could keep the pair stuck inside the range for a few days.The bulls pushed Aave above the $489 resistance today. However, they have not been able to sustain the buying at higher levels, and the bears have pulled the price back into the $480–$280 range on Sunday. This suggests the bears are attempting to trap the aggressive bulls who may have purchased the breakout from the range.If the price dips below the 20-day EMA ($415), it will suggest that bulls are not buying on dips. That could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($383) and extend the stay of the AAVE/USDT pair inside the range for a few more days.On the contrary, if the pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will indicate accumulation at lower levels. The bulls will then make one more attempt to push the price to $581.67. A breakout of this level could start the northward journey to $698.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro shows the bullish trend in Aave has continued from April 25, barring a couple of momentary dips to 63.The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for Aave has consistently remained in the green since April 25, when the price was at $351.40.The strong VORTECS™ Score could have held back traders from booking profits early and leaving profits on the table. Aave has rallied to $509.83 on Sunday, recording a gain of 45% in just over a week.The four-hour chart shows the bulls purchased the dip to the 20-EMA and are again trying to drive the price above the $489–$512 resistance zone. The rising moving averages and the RSI above 63 suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.This bullish view will weaken if the bears pull the price below the 20-EMA. That could suggest that supply exceeds demand. The pair may then drop to the 50-SMA. If this support holds, the pair may consolidate between $420 and $489 for a few days before starting the next trending move.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

284,"This is Part Two of a multipart series on blockchain and crypto in China. Read Part One about the digital yuan here. When Satoshi Nakamoto introduced the Bitcoin (BTC) white paper over a decade ago, it was hard to imagine what role the cryptocurrency sector would play in global finance. Some argue that the invention of blockchain technology is comparable to the revolution brought on by the invention of the internet back in the 1980s. Starting as a niche space for tech enthusiasts, in just 12 years Bitcoin has become a serious player in the financial field, with its market capitalization closing in on Google, one of the world’s largest tech giants.Related: Did Bitcoin prove itself to be a reliable store of value in 2020? Experts answerOne of the reasons for the increasing popularity of, and people’s increasing interest in, crypto lies in the fact that the technology that forms the backbone of cryptocurrency promises more financial inclusion compared with legacy finance. It is especially important for developing countries and emerging markets with fast-growing economic potential — the regions with the most promising potential for mass crypto adoption. And while blockchain cannot solve all of society’s problems, it’s the community behind this industry that should address the factors causing financial exclusion. Being decentralized in its origins and driven by the community, the crypto industry indeed greatly prioritizes diversity and inclusion, including valuing the contributions of women and the LBGTQ+ community.Related: Women, decentralization and the world’s economic drive: Experts answerThe general public discourse on the crypto space still suffers from the notorious reputation of the Silk Road saga and the ICO craze back in 2017 — 80% of initial coin offerings ended up being scams. Meanwhile, by appealing to the younger generations — who will soon enough be the major drivers of the world’s economy — crypto is certainly gaining its momentum. Just last year, PayPal, the world’s largest payments processor, announced it would allow its customers to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies, and the demand for that service has been greater than the company expected.Related: Will PayPal’s crypto integration bring crypto to the masses? Experts answerAlso last year, the world witnessed the rise of the decentralized finance industry, and some even argue that DeFi will complete what Bitcoin started, proving “to be the guarantee of a better, more liberated future.” DeFi has become a symptom of the real shift from centralized to decentralized services, fueling massive innovation and growth in Web 3.0 protocols and the demand for the decentralized internet. Since the old financial system has rotted and degenerated, we have witnessed an unprecedented amount of money-printing by governments all over the world amid the COVID-19 pandemic. DeFi brings forward the prospect of a paradigm shift, promising not just the democratization of money but the democratization of finance, representing a seismic shift in the way people will bank in the future.Related: How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the crypto space? Experts answerDue to its decentralized nature, the crypto industry is not and will never be a local trend — the changes that it causes to the financial landscape are global. With central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, being researched by governments all over the world and more institutional players — such as MicroStrategy, Mastercard, Bank of New York Mellon, Tesla and many others — entering the space, it seems inevitable that the global economy will have to accept that crypto, and the technology behind it, is here to stay. These examples also clearly represent signs that the industry is maturing.Related: Tesla, Bitcoin and the crypto space: The show Musk go on? Experts answerMeanwhile, not all countries treat crypto equally: India has had a difficult relationship with the crypto space for some time already; China is leading CBDC development; the European Commission has proposed its Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, which has raised concerns within the crypto industry; and in the United States, while the crypto space is hopeful about new appointments in the administration of President Joe Biden, regulators are tightening the belts for crypto users. Cointelegraph decided to reach out to experts from China in the blockchain and crypto space for their opinions on the following question: What role will emerging technologies — such as blockchain, crypto and DeFi — play in shaping the future of finance in the world in general and in China specifically?“I think the way that blockchain and crypto have changed finance globally is by essentially introducing a brand-new asset class. Traditionally, the world only had gold and silver. After that, we had the invention of paper money, which became currency, and that was a new asset class. And then after a few more hundreds of years, the invention of stocks. Equity stocks in a company became the notion of ownership in the company, so stocks became an asset class. And of course, we've had loans and bonds. So, whether it's government or corporate bonds, that's another asset class.And what we're seeing with crypto for 12 years now is that we have Bitcoin and now a new asset class called digital currency. Now, it's called digital currency, but it really doesn't have to be used like currency. It should be just treated like a new asset class. But why do we need that new asset class?The issue with paper currency is that people in power always want to change rules to sort of strengthen their power over and hold on the economy, and thus over the people. So, they introduce the notion of unlimited printing. And this was only introduced in 1971. We're now at the 50-year anniversary of this new kind of asset class, which has a new feature: unlimited printing. Pretty much, before 50 years ago, the U.S. dollar did not have unlimited printing because it was backed by gold. So, you couldn’t have unlimited printing, but now you can have a little bit of printing because you've uncoupled from gold. Fiat currency has changed.And now because of its change, the world’s locomotive has introduced a new asset class called Bitcoin, which is meant to counterbalance the change in fiat currency — to give people and give the world a choice. Do you want to continue to use an asset class that keeps on printing with no limit? Or would you prefer to put your savings at value into an asset class that has a strict upper limit of 21 million units? That's what crypto is bringing to the world.Important questions are: Who wins? Who's right? Who's wrong? I think crypto will win because of its limited issuance, strictly limited in nature. My thoughts on Bitcoin as an asset class can be read in my book The Promise of Bitcoin: The Future of Money and How It Can Work for You. Cryptocurrency is bringing to the world the notion of a new asset class. And it's also bringing balance back to the world because before Bitcoin, the most relevant form of money was currency issued by governments, what we call fiat currency, and crypto has changed the very nature of it.”“First of all, the digital yuan mentioned in the first article, which integrates the cutting-edge blockchain technology and cryptography technology, has started to carry out the application in several first-tier cities in China. One could say that DCEP is already serving the national economy and the people’s livelihood. The prototype of China’s future financial network is gradually emerging. Therefore, in terms of digital finance, China is in a leading position over the world.For the world, blockchain technology has a major mission in the future, including promoting currency internationalization, trade globalization and a better structure for the world’s top-level financial system to avoid the recurrence of a financial crisis.At present, we can perceive that Bitcoin created by blockchain technology is becoming the preferred hedging asset of mainstream finance and has reached a market value of 1 trillion U.S. dollars within a short decade.In the long process of financial evolution, Bitcoin and other high-quality cryptocurrencies will bring a new logical switch and asset portfolio to the world from the nature of currency and finance.”“The ongoing DeFi boom has proven that blockchain technology is here to stay. From my perspective, dissatisfaction with traditional financial institutions is mounting while DeFi has boomed due to its ability to offer people — ordinary people with varying levels of blockchain experience — unparalleled returns, efficiency and transparency.In China and around the world, I believe blockchain technologies will play a key role in paving the way for the smart economy of the future as increasingly more people — and institutions — invest in it.Moving forward, I believe flexible governance is key for driving blockchain’s sustainable development by delivering a means for platforms and communities to flexibly and quickly adapt to the digital economy market needs and regulations of various countries.”“China has its own vision for using the technology: It wants to use blockchain to improve data sharing, optimize business processes, reduce operating costs, and establish better credit systems to solve common problems in small and medium-sized enterprise finance — bank risk control, legal supervision, etc.Globally, crypto and DeFi will make financial services more equitable, specifically for people — such as the unbanked — who traditional financial institutions have overlooked. We’ll also see blockchain technology continue to grow and eventually become as ubiquitous as the internet — adopted by every industry for many different purposes.”“Recently, everyone has been paying close attention to the movement of retail investors against Wall Street financial institutions on the subreddit r/wallstreetbets. As a representative of securities platforms, Robin Hood could restrict retail trading and even force users to sell. Once again, this makes us realize the importance of decentralized finance. In less-developed areas and developed ones, there are more and more people who need decentralized finance.In the past year, with the rapid development of new blockchain technology — represented by DeFi — financial decentralization became more than just a dream. It can provide financial services for people in less-developed areas and enable people all over the world to experience more transparent and fair financial products and services. People can choose financial service providers according to their demand for financial products and fully enjoy a variety of truly decentralized and rich financial ecology.The impact of blockchain technology on traditional finance will be greater than the impact of current financial technology on the banking industry. It will also force the reform of the entire financial industry and is expected to redistribute the pattern of the sector.”“Crypto is beginning to replace obsolete aspects of traditional finance, but it’s also bringing completely new functionality to the sector. We’re already seeing crypto replace aging pieces of the traditional financial system, from crypto remittances between the U.S. and Mexico that significantly reduce costs to lending protocols on Ethereum that don’t require a counterparty.But beyond that, we’re seeing entirely new financial tools that didn’t previously exist emerging with the rise of crypto and blockchain. One example is social tokens, which allow influencers to monetize their brand and bring their communities along for the ride. Improving the economics between creators and fans can be the key to unlocking a household-supporting income for millions of creators around the world.All of these developments are particularly important in regions like China and greater Asia. If crypto companies can navigate the regulatory constraints in these regions, it could be life-changing for millions of people.”“Blockchain is a technological change without borders. Every country in the world should embrace the advent of new technologies. Both the West and China should actively absorb new technologies and apply them to our society.Blockchain has played an innovative role in certain fields, such as state governance, social credit investigation, product traceability and information notarization. In these areas, we believe that the West and China are very important.At the same time, we are also exploring the development of blockchain in the financial field. Of course, compared with other industries, finance has a higher level of importance in the system. Therefore, whether it is in the West or China, the application of blockchain in the financial field should be most cautious.”“DeFi will shape finance in incredibly fundamental ways. Perhaps the biggest way (including in China) is in financial education. By this, I mean a common knowledge and understanding of finance that has traditionally been confined to an elite economic class.We and many others in the decentralized movement are building a future where our kids will be financially savvy by the time they start college, with their own investment portfolios and a strong basis of financial awareness. Maybe these kids will even be in a position to pay for their own education, thanks to the knowledge they gain by participating in the decentralized ecosystem.Imagine a world where financial inclusion is not just about having a bank account, but about being able to easily and effectively participate in various capital opportunities, take advantage of things like staking, yield farming or exchange rates, or simply being able to invest in a project you like.Financial knowledge is one of the few things that have not broadly improved with the rise of Web 1.0 and 2.0. The rise of blockchain is changing that.”Several interviewees were featured in Cointelegraph China’s Top 100 Notable People in Blockchain of 2020.

285,"Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies have opened the doors to a whole new world of finance. In their most basic form, cryptocurrencies allow people to transact in a fully trustless, transparent and efficient manner, cutting out the centralized intermediaries and counterparty risk previously associated with digital money transfers. Thanks to blockchain technology, value can now be transferred on a worldwide scale within seconds/minutes and with relatively low fees — and that’s not all. However, Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) are still too volatile to be used as currency, a factor that has hindered their mass adoption.Although Bitcoin and blockchain technology are still in their infancy, volatility is still predominant in the industry, which has led to the creation of something that takes the best of both worlds: stablecoins. Popular examples include Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).While cryptocurrencies themselves are volatile, their underlying technology can be leveraged to create assets pegged to and backed by more stable assets, such as fiat currencies, precious metals and others. These stablecoins are mostly used for common payments and exchange settlements. Certain stablecoins have become extremely popular because they are pegged to the U.S. dollar, with a market capitalization of over $51 billion for USDT and around $14 billion for Coinbase-backed USDC.Stablecoins have become a new asset class of their own, seeing popularity grow among both retail and institutional demographics alike for their unique properties. Now, decentralized finance and nonfungible tokens are the new game changers of the industry and, together with stablecoins, provide new and exciting possibilities for financial inclusion.The concept of coins like USDT is simple. In theory, companies backing these stable cryptocurrencies keep a reserve of the underlying asset — in this case, the U.S. dollar — and issue the corresponding amount of blockchain-based tokens.However, stablecoins have issues of their own. The most prevalent is the fear that stablecoin issuers can manipulate their reserves and audits to issue unbacked tokens. While iFinex — the parent company of crypto exchange Bitfinex and USDT-issuer Tether — is adamant that USDT is always 100% backed by reserves, some in the industry remain skeptical as seen by the recently settled court case between the Office of the New York Attorney General and Tether.The aforementioned issues have prompted developers and entrepreneurs in the space to create decentralized stablecoin systems, the most popular of which is MakerDAO and its U.S. dollar-pegged token, Dai. MakerDAO uses Ether (ETH) to create a decentralized, verifiable reserve for stablecoin issuance.Other options are also available. Kava has leveraged a similar system to create crypto-backed stablecoins that are pegged to the dollar, allowing users to provide liquidity with multiple assets such as Bitcoin and XRP in order to issue dollar-pegged stablecoins. John Wu, president of Ava Labs — the team supporting the development of Avalanche — told Cointelegraph:While it is a novel concept, it can also be dangerous for those providing liquidity to the system. Given that Dai is backed by Ether, a high collateralization ratio must be provided by participants who are also exposed to the risk of being fully liquidated should the price of Ether drop drastically.When speaking about the launch of new concepts like the hybrid stablecoin, Wu mentioned a recently launched FRAX stablecoin that combines collateral and algorithmic supply controls, adding: “The innovations provided by the likes of MakerDAO and Kava come, however, at a high risk, which is intensified by the high congestion rates of the Ethereum blockchain.”Decentralized stablecoins are an alternative to simple stablecoins like USDT, but the volatility of cryptocurrencies also makes them dangerous for liquidity providers, holders and users of the stablecoin. Now several companies are attempting to find a solution that allows decentralized and centralized stablecoins to “meet in the middle.”For example, Five5Five has created and will soon launch a new stablecoin model where a stablecoin can be pegged to the dollar while removing the danger associated with volatile cryptocurrency reserves. The USD Reserve (USDR) is a gold-backed cryptocurrency that can maintain a one-to-one ratio with the dollar.This solution protects against the potential liquidation and price fluctuations associated with decentralized stablecoins. At the same time, such a coin can be backed with a high collateralization rate that will allow it to balance volatility or a sudden change in market situations. In this example, the company has chosen to issue the stablecoin on the Bitcoin Ultimatum blockchain — a decentralized ecosystem with smart contracts, leased-proof-of-stake mining algorithm in conjunction with proof-of-authority, private transactions, and leasing and staking solutions. Eric Ma, CEO of Bitcoin Ultimatum, told Cointelegraph:While other projects have also tried to tackle the issue of protecting users against the volatility of the underlying asset by using “baskets” of fiat currencies instead of one single currency to issue a stablecoin that is pegged to various assets, most have so far failed to achieve this feat — most notably, the Libra project by Facebook, which has been stopped on its heels by regulators, much like Sogur (SGR).USDR will allow holders to hedge against the inflation of a single fiat currency — the dollar — given that the coin is backed by gold and not fiat or a volatile cryptocurrency. Jeremy Harbour, CEO and founder of Five5Five, told Cointelegraph: “The internet needs a reserve currency. The sheer demand for stablecoins demonstrates that the challenge is always what sits behind these stablecoins.” He added that the gold reserves were obtained by the company “in partnership with artisanal gold miners and so brings much-needed capital into some of the poorest places in the world to provide much needed direct investment into their communities.”While USDR aims to create a stablecoin for the dollar that protects users against inflation and downward price swings, and MakerDAO and Kava have tried to use cryptocurrencies to provide a trustless solution, other projects have gone for a simpler approach.Projects like DigixDAO and Paxos issue stablecoins pegged and backed by precious metals such as gold. However, they still rely on centralized reserves, raising the same issues that plague USDT, USDC and, to a degree, even USDR.In a bid to solve this issue and provide users with a semi-decentralized solution for precious metal-backed stablecoins, Aurus has issued precious metal-based coins for gold, silver and platinum that are backed and pegged to these assets.However, instead of using centralized reserves, Aurus works with multiple metal producers and foundries to create precious metal-backed tokens that have distributed reserves, ensuring that users are always protected against single points of failure. Guido van Stijn, CEO of Aurus, told Cointelegraph:While none of the solutions mentioned above are 100% perfect, the thought process behind the continued development of stablecoins is a quite noticeable one. So much so that governments are also working on their own version of stablecoins, known as central bank digital currencies, and countries such as China have already begun testing these systems.Related: Rolling up the sleeves: China’s tech giants drive digital yuan adoptionHowever, many worry that CBDCs will be nothing more than virtual versions of fiat currencies that will leverage centralized blockchains, offering no real innovation. As such, it will be interesting to see how the cryptocurrency community will continue to invent and develop new solutions for stablecoins while Bitcoin continues on its path to fulfilling its ultimate goal of replacing fiat currencies completely — something that may or may not happen."
286,"One of the original allures of cryptocurrency is the narrative that using them provides the sender or recipient anonymously, but this is a common misconception within the sector. In reality, Bitcoin (BTC) and many other cryptocurrencies are easily traceable.Proof of this came earlier this week when on April 27, U.S. authorities arrested the mastermind of Bitcoin Fog, a darknet-based BTC mixing service. Authorities were able to capture the operator after analyzing ten years of blockchain data.One doesn't need to be a forensic analyst to know that every single transaction is tied up to addresses on the blockchain and that they will stay there forever. While government agencies cannot determine the IP address or personal data from the address, these coins usually end up being used for products or service payments. This is the trail that leads back to the sender and recipient.In the case of Bitcoin Fog, law enforcement was able to identify server hosting expenses paid using digital currency. Bitcoin mixing services such as Bitcoin Fog allow users to mix their coins with other users, making it almost impossible to detect the destination addresses. This obfuscates the ties between the inputs and output addresses, providing a better level of privacy.Mixing services are offered in a wide range of methods, including fully centralized solutions where trust is required, to Coinjoin mixers, which depend on a large group of users to self cooperate and act simultaneously. There's even the possibility of trading on decentralized exchanges (DEX) to virtually eliminate any possible tracing.Centralized mixers offer the obvious single point of failure problem. Even if one trusts that the entity is using multisig addresses, if the service is willing to share its data or has been breached, their users will lose their privacy.CoinJoin solved this problem by combining the inputs of multiple users into a single transaction. The service will then take those coins, craft them into a transaction, and have each participant sign before broadcasting it to the network. These transactions are then merged into one, and each user gets the original quantity in return. However, no one can see the origin of those coins, not even the entity that merges the transaction.Even though CoinJoin isn't exactly untraceable, it provides plausible deniability, as no one can point out which entity owns each output. The larger the number of participants, the higher the degree of deniability.Some cryptocurrency users also require anonymity for sending tokens to their wallets, and Wasabi Wallet has long been used for its embedded CoinJoin functionalities.While its infrastructure is technically centralized, its design assures that the operators cannot deanonymize users or steal any funds. At the moment, the Wasabi wallet is only available for desktop solutions, so as is the case with anything in cryptocurrency, beware of clones!A similar service is provided by Samourai wallet, which also offers a Chaumian CoinJoin mixing service, called Whirlpool. To achieve a full-privacy solution, users have to connect the Samourai wallet to their own full Bitcoin node. However, it does offer desktop and mobile versions.Even though these mixing services aren't illegal in most jurisdictions, some exchanges and services might refuse users linked to addresses associated with coin mixing activities.As more people realize the importance of achieving a certain degree of privacy for self-protection, the fewer incentives companies will have to deny their clients to use mixers.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

287,"The global landscape of crypto-asset regulations is diverse and, even though it is getting more complex, many regulators are still choosing to wait and see how this space develops and what others will do. Right now, all eyes are on the European Union and its bespoke approach to regulating crypto assets.As part of an expansive digital finance package announced in September 2020, the European Commission, or EC, issued a regulatory proposal titled Markets in Crypto-Assets, or MiCA. The proposal is now making its way through the legislative process and is subject to intense debates. This important regulatory step has been accelerated by concerns over the increasingly fragmented national regulatory landscape for crypto assets within the EU.The other important trigger for regulatory scrutiny has been the rise of stablecoins. Stablecoins have been around for a few years — with the first stablecoin, Tether (USDT), dating back to 2014 — but they received little regulatory attention until June 2019, when Facebook’s project Libra (which was later rebranded as Diem) was announced. It was a wake-up call for many authorities, as they came to realize that global stablecoins could quickly reach a large scale due to strong network effects, and that this could have systemic implications for the financial sector.Related: New name, old problems? Libra’s rebrand to Diem still faces challengesThe EC stepped in to capture and regulate all crypto assets not covered by existing EU financial services and proposed a bespoke, comprehensive, mandatory regime for crypto assets under MiCA. The regulation will apply directly across the EU, without the need to transpose it into national laws, and will replace all national frameworks. It aims to provide legal certainty for the industry and market participants, and facilitate legal harmonization.Related: Chasing the hottest trends in crypto, the EU works to rein in stablecoins and DeFiMiCA establishes a set of uniform guiding principles for crypto assets that are already applicable more generally in the financial markets, including transparency and disclosure, authorization and supervision, set of the operation, organization and governance measures, consumer protection, and prevention of market abuse.MiCA provides much-needed definitions and classifications of crypto assets. This is a welcome development that can help to consolidate divergent definitions and taxonomies used across different European jurisdictions and by different market participants. To capture the entire universe of crypto assets (except for crypto assets already covered by financial regulations), a crypto asset is defined very broadly under MiCA as a digital representation of value or rights, which may be transferred and stored electronically using distributed ledger technology or similar technology. This means that any asset put on a blockchain could potentially fall within MiCA regulatory requirements regardless of its nature and economic function. We have to wait for the final version of the regulation to see if any exceptions to this broad scope of application will be introduced in the negotiation process.Related: The US has already lost the 2020 crypto regulation race to EuropeMiCA identifies three regulatory categories of crypto assets:MiCA provides a set of comprehensive regulatory requirements for issuers, including different licensing and operational requirements depending on the type of crypto assets involved. The issuers of asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens will have to be authorized and established in the EU.This is certainly good news for those issuers already established and operating within the EU but creates an additional compliance burden for issuers outside the EU. Issuers of asset-referenced tokens will be subject to certain capital, governance and business conduct requirements, and issuers of e-money tokens will also have to be licensed as a credit or electronic money institution and will have to additionally comply with the operational requirements of the e-money legal regime. E-money tokens will have to be issued and redeemed at par value, and the holders will have to be provided with a direct claim against the issuer.The issuers will be required to produce a white paper setting out important information about the project, including its main features, rights and obligations. Only certain projects and small value offerings will have the benefit of being exempt from this potentially expensive requirement. To address risks of larger projects (like global stablecoins), MiCA provides an additional, more stringent set of rules for “significant” asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens. For such “significant” tokens, which are classified as such by the European Banking Authority, or EBA, on the basis of the criteria listed in MiCA, there will be stronger capital, investor and EBA supervisory requirements that cover governance, conflicts of interest, reserve assets, custody and the white paper obligations.MiCA also sets out a legal framework for the authorization and operating conditions of crypto-asset service providers, or CASPs. Any CASP will need to be a legal person registered in the EU and will have to be authorized in order to operate. Compliance requirements are similar to those under financial regulations and include prudential safeguards, organizational requirements and specific rules on the safekeeping of clients’ funds.The list of regulated crypto-asset services also mirrors financial regulations and includes the custody and administration of crypto assets, operation of a trading platform, exchange of crypto assets for fiat currency and for other crypto assets, reception, transmission and execution of orders, placing of crypto assets and, finally, providing advice on crypto assets.As with any regulatory proposal, MiCA is going through all the cogs of the EU legislative machine. This process will hopefully help to fine-tune MiCA provisions, remove frictions, address any issues and arrive at the most optimal regulation that meets the needs and expectations of all the stakeholders. After MiCA comes into force, there is still an 18-month delay in application of the regulation, except with regard to e-money tokens and asset-referenced tokens, to which the regulation will apply immediately.MiCA will serve as a precedent for other countries to learn from and either to follow or to set themselves apart for a competitive advantage. It is an ambitious regulatory project. Calibrating such a comprehensive regulatory framework to govern rapidly developing innovation requires a meticulous approach — sufficiently prescriptive to provide legal certainty but flexible enough to allow for future developments.It also requires careful balancing between four main objectives around which MiCA has been designed: legal certainty, support of innovation, consumer and investor protection, and market integrity. Mistakes will have EU-wide implications and will be complicated to reverse, but getting it right will be an EU-wide success and a huge opportunity for the region.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal advice.The opinions expressed are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of the University or its affiliates."
288,"Bitcoin (BTC) and the overall cryptocurrency market sprang to life on April 30 as an uneventful close to this month's $4.2 billion options expiry occurred without any signs of controversy. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that after a brief dip below the $53,000 support level on April 29, the price of Bitcoin staged a 10% rally back above $57,400 by midday.The revelation from MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor that the company saw a 52% surge in revenue compared to the same quarter last year will likely strengthen the argument that organizations should hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet as a way to combat inflation as well as attract new investors.Central bank digital currencies (CBDC) are also gaining traction as the Bank of England revealed that it is moving ahead with plans to launch a digital pound and the central bank of France made headlines on April 29 after settled a $100 million Euro bond using a CBDC that was hosted on the Ethereum (ETH) network.While much of the mainstream news and focus from analysts revolves around Bitcoin and Ethereum, a handful of altcoins caught the attention of traders on Friday as their prices saw double-digit gainsOne of the strongest performers of the day was IoTeX which surged 75% to a new all-time high at $0.085. The blockchain project is focused on solving the issues of scalability, privacy and high operating costs which are limiting the mass adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for IOTX on April 27, prior to the recent price rise.The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score began to climb on April 26 and reached a high of 76 on April 27 before spiking to 73 again on April 29. It's worth noting that the VORTECS™ Score hit 73  roughly 10 hours before the price spiked 75% to a new all-time high at $0.0857.A second coin that has been performing well over the past couple of days and is now registering a VORTECS™ Score of 95 is PARSIQ (PRQ), an analytics platform that offers cutting-edge tools for the analysis of blockchain technology across a variety of industries.Bullishness for PRQ was first detected on April 28 when the VORTECS™ Score reached the green zone. The score stayed near that level (67) over the next day and then rapidly climbed to a high of 95 on April 30 as the price of PRQ rallied higher.A score of 95 is one of the highest scores ever registered on the VORTECS™ system, and previous instances of scores in the mid to high 90’s have been shown to precede further price appreciation, as was recently demonstrated by Polygon (MATIC) this week.Generally, altcoins rallied across the board, boosting the total market capitalization to $2.177 trillion while Bitcoin's dominance rate slipped to 48.8%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

289,"As blockchain technology and the public's awareness of cryptocurrency continues to grow, a range of new use cases a coming to market and enhancing the efficacy of legacy financial systems.Despite its many applications, the original use case for Bitcoin (BTC) as a medium of exchange remains one of the most fundamental applications of blockchain technology and while BTC might not be the best asset to use for payments, there are service providers who have eased the process of settling transactions in other cryptocurrencies.For now, the most widely accepted way to use cryptocurrencies for direct payments in everyday life is through the use of crypto debit cards which allow users to convert their crypto holdings into U.S. dollars. They essentially work in the same way that a prepaid debit does.With institutions showing an increased interest in the growing cryptocurrency sector and mainstream awareness of blockchain technology at its highest level ever, crypto debits cards are increasing in prevalence as new players enter the field to try and capture a share in this growing market.Three of the debit cards with a track record of success and attractive rewards are BitPay, Crypto.com and the Nexo Card.The BitPay prepaid Mastercard has emerged as a top choice for many cryptocurrency holders thanks to its ease of use and low fees. It originally launched in 2016 as a US-only debit card and mainly functioned as a Bitcoin payments processor.BitPay now supports eight different fiat currency options alongside support for Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), Gemini Dollar (GUSD), USD Coin (USDC), Paxos (PAX) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).Have you added your BitPay Card to @Apple Pay® yet? Easily make online and in-store purchases with crypto. #apple #applepay #bitpay #bitcoin #bitpaywallet #bitpaycard #crypto pic.twitter.com/hRp7nm6vDuUsers who wish to obtain the card must first pay a $9.95 activation fee and provide their social security and driver’s license number to gain access. Once approved, the user can load cryptocurrencies onto their BitPay wallet and then convert them to dollars to make them available on the card.There are no transaction fees for users in the U.S., and the card has a daily spending limit of $10,000 with a maximum account balance of $25,000.For the ardent cryptocurrency fan, the Crypto.com debit card is one of the top choices due to the fact that it has a built-in native token called Crypto.com Coin (CRO) which functions as the primary currency and reward token for the blockchain.Benefits of using the card include 100% cashback on popular streaming services like Netflix and Spotify as well as up to 8% cashback on regular purchases.Crypto.com users can choose from a list of more than 100 of the top cryptocurrencies to fund their card by depositing them into their account and converting them into a stablecoin which is then loaded onto their debit card.We’re excited to share news of a historic moment:https://t.co/vCNztABJoG & @Visa successfully conducted the first settlement of transactions using USDC!

A huge milestone for the industry as crypto and fiat networks begin to converge.https://t.co/v70qC8n4YyThe Crypto.com ecosystem offers five different Visa debit cards that have a tiered reward structure that increases depending on the amount of CRO that a user has staked in their account.Tiers range from requiring a stake of $400 USD for the Ruby Steel card, all the way up to needing $400,000 USD staked to obtain the Obsidian card, which offers 8% cashback on all purchases. There is also a basic version of the card that doesn’t require any staking and offers 1% cashback on all purchases.A third choice that offers a different structure than most crypto debit cards is the Nexo Card and its native NEXO cryptocurrency which currently trades at $3.63.Instead of requiring users to convert the cryptocurrency held into their accounts into U.S. dollars before use, Nexo issues an instantaneous loan based on the value of the cryptocurrency held in a users account and settles the transaction in fiat currency.Want to #hodl your #crypto & spend at the same time?

290,"The recent weakness in Bitcoin (BTC) price did not see any panic selling by investors, suggesting the sentiment in the crypto sector remains bullish. After Ether’s (ETH) strong run in the past few days, Bitcoin played catch up today as it reclaimed the $55,000 level. This suggests investors continue to accumulate on dips.Gaming-focused venture capital fund Bitkraft Ventures, with more than $400 million in assets under management, has tied up with crypto research firm Delphi Digital to invest in crypto-assets and related projects.The demand from institutions also seems to be picking up in Asia. To cater to this demand, Huobi Asset Management has launched four cryptocurrency-related tracker funds.To provide institutional clients with digital assets data and analytics, Fidelity has announced the launch of Sherlock, a product similar to Bloomberg’s Terminal, that will offer both fundamental and technical analysis research for the fund managers.Along with new entrants, the existing investors are also looking to add to their crypto holdings. MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor said in a press release on April 30 that the company “will continue to acquire and hold additional bitcoin as we seek to create additional value for shareholders.”The resilience of Bitcoin and other major altcoins shows the markets have matured. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the direction of the next possible trending move.After hesitating near the 20-day exponential moving average ($55,324) for the past two days, Bitcoin has soared to the 50-day simple moving average ($56,897) today. If the bulls propel the price above the 50-day SMA, an up-move to the $61,825.84 to $64,849.27 resistance zone is possible.The flat moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) above 53 suggest the selling pressure has subsided. However, the bulls may face stiff resistance at the current level and again at the overhead resistance zone.If the price turns down from the current level and breaks the $52,500 support, it will suggest that bears are aggressively selling near the 50-day SMA. That could result in a retest of the $50,460 level and then $46,985.02.The next trending move is likely to start on a break above $64,849.27 or a slide below $46,985.02. Until then, volatile range-bound action is likely to continue.Ether formed a Doji candlestick pattern on April 29 and has made an inside-day candlestick pattern today, indicating hesitation near the resistance line of the ascending channel. However, if the bulls do not give up much ground, the uptrend is likely to resume.A breakout of the channel will suggest the momentum remains strong and that could result in a sharp rally to $3,000. The rising moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory indicate advantage to the bulls.However, if the bulls fail to push the price above the channel within the next couple of days, the ETH/USDT pair may witness profit-booking. That could pull the price down to the 20-day EMA ($2,417). A break below the support line of the channel will signal a possible trend reversal.Binance Coin (BNB) broke above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle on April 29. This suggests the resumption of the uptrend. The pattern target of the breakout from the triangle is $808.57.The rising moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory indicate the bulls are in control. The buyers may face resistance at $638.57 but if the price does not dip back below the triangle, the BNB/USDT pair remains on target to start the next leg of the uptrend.This bullish view will invalidate in the short term if the price slips and re-enters the triangle. Such a move could keep the price in a consolidation for a few more days. The pair will signal a trend reversal if the price breaks and sustains below the triangle.XRP formed an inside-day candlestick pattern on April 29, which has resolved to the upside today. The bulls have pushed the price above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.55, signaling strength.If the bulls sustain the price above $1.55, the XRP/USDT pair could rally to $1.73 and then retest the 52-week high at $1.96. The rising 20-day EMA ($1.29) and the RSI near 64 suggest the bulls have the upper hand.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears pull the price back below $1.55, it will suggest profit-booking at higher levels. A break below the 20-day EMA will indicate the bullish momentum has weakened and that could keep the pair range-bound for a few days.Cardano (ADA) witnessed profit-booking on April 29 at $1.41 but the bulls did not allow the price to dip below the 20-day EMA ($1.25). This is a positive sign and it keeps the altcoin on track to reach the overhead resistance at $1.48.If the price turns down from the $1.48 resistance, the ADA/USDT pair could extend its stay inside the range. The flattish moving averages and the RSI above 58 also point to a consolidation in the near term.This neutral view will invalidate if the bulls push the price above the $1.48 to $1.55 overhead resistance zone. Such a move will suggest that the bulls have overpowered the bears and a new uptrend is likely. The next target objective on the upside is $2.The bears could smell an opportunity if the price breaks and sustains below the moving averages. A break below $1.03 will signal a possible change in trend.Dogecoin (DOGE) turned down from $0.34 on April 29 but the bulls are not giving up much ground, which is a positive sign. The inside-day candlestick pattern on April 29 and today suggests uncertainty among the bulls and the bears.However, the upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.24) and the RSI above 62, indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the bulls propel the price above $0.34, the DOGE/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum and rally to $0.42.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below $0.29, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA. A bounce off this support could keep the pair range-bound for a few days. The trend may turn in favor of the bears if the pair breaks and closes below the 20-day EMA.Polkadot (DOT) has formed a Doji candlestick pattern today, suggesting hesitation by the bulls to continue buying near the 50-day SMA ($36.91). However, if the bears fail to sink the price below $32.50 in the next few days, the buying is likely to resume.A break above the 50-day SMA will clear the path for a possible move to $42.28. This level may again act as stiff resistance and if the price turns down from it, the DOT/USDT pair could remain stuck in the $26.50 to $42.28 range for a few more days.Alternatively, if the price slips below $32.50, sellers may take charge and sink the pair to $26.50 where buying could emerge. The flat moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.Uniswap (UNI) pierced the resistance line of the ascending channel on April 28 but the bulls could not sustain the momentum. The price turned down and re-entered the channel on April 29, indicating a lack of demand at higher levels.The negative divergence on the RSI remains intact, which warns that the bullish momentum may be waning. If the price dips below $37.50, the UNI/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($35.67), which is an important support to watch out for.A break below this support could result in a decline to the support line of the channel. Conversely, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it will indicate buying on dips, increasing the possibility of a break above the channel. If that happens, the pair could rise to $50.Litecoin (LTC) witnessed a minor correction on April 28 and 29 but the bulls did not allow the price to drop below the 20-day EMA ($251), This is a positive sign as it suggests that traders are not waiting for a deeper correction to buy.If the bulls can sustain the price above $266.68, the LTC/USDT pair is likely to reach the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $286.02.This level may act as a major hurdle but if the LTC/USDT pair can climb above it, then a rally to $335.03 is possible.The 20-day EMA has started to turn up and the RSI is gradually moving up, suggesting the buyers are trying to gain control. This positive view will be negated if the price turns down and plummets below $246.96. Such a move could open the gates for a decline to the 50-day SMA ($226).Bitcoin Cash (BCH) formed an inside-day candlestick pattern on April 29, which has resolved to the upside today. The bulls will now try to push the price above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,012.29If they succeed, the BCH/USDT pair could retest $1,213.51. The gradually rising 20-day EMA ($839) and the RSI above 63 suggest the bulls have a minor advantage.However, if the price turns down from the current level, it will indicate that bears are selling on rallies. They will then try to sink the price below the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the pair could drop to $686.75.On the contrary, a rebound off the 20-day EMA will suggest the sentiment remains positive. The bulls may then make one more attempt to drive the price above $1,012.29.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

291,"In the latest Cointelegraph Crypto Duel, founder of Digiconomist Alex de Vries and CEO and founder of Blockchain for Climate Joseph Pallant debated the intensity of Bitcoin’s footprint and possible paths forward to reduce it. As pointed out by de Vries, Bitcoin’s energy consumption has been increasing together with its network.  The analyst predicts its carbon footprint could increase tremendously as Bitcoin gets closer to mass adoption.“I fear that this will quickly get completely out of control if adoption increases a lot more”, he said.According to de Vries, as long as Bitcoin functions with a proof-of-work system, bringing down emissions will be difficult. De Vries doesn’t see the incentive for miners to embrace renewables, given the intermittency of this type of energy sources.“There's no incentive for miners to just enrol themselves into a scheme where they can only get power for an hour of day”, he pointed out.Thus, according to the analyst, Bitcoin miners will continue relying on fossil fuels in the forseeable future. Pallant disagrees. He believes that cheap renewables will be playing an important role in reducing the environmental footprint of Bitcoin.""We do know that in a lot of places solar and wind power is the lowest cost"", he said. Pallant also believes that blockchain tech could be used to establish a record of those Bitcoins that are mined with renewables, thus stimulating demand for those ""green coins"" among institutional investors. ""We can get to net-zero emissions of these blockchains through reducing emissions where we can and offsetting the rest"", Pallant pointed out.

292,"Bitcoin (BTC) retook $57,000 on April 30 as a surprise bullish end to month took traders by surprise.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and Tradingview showed BTC/USD climbing 5% in hours on Friday to come within inches of a green monthly close for April.At press time, $57,000 still formed a focus, with the pair needing to clinch $58,800 to avoid April's monthly candle turning red.On social media, traders pointed to this month's $4.2 billion options expiry being out of the way and thus allowing Bitcoin room to move. As Cointelegraph often reports, expiry events tend to pressure price beforehand, but post factum relief rallies differ considerably in strength, sometimes not appearing at all.For Lex Moskovski, CIO as Moskovski Capital, the composition of the market on the day was a cause for optimism. ""This Bitcoin price surge is driven by spot. Funding even decreased a bit,"" he noted. Moskovski referred to funding rates on exchanges, with a decrease implying that short positions are ""paying"" longs in a classic sign that upward momentum would continue. Spot buyer demand likewise signals that BTC is being bought without leverage, which translates to a more organic shifting of ""real"" coins to private wallets.Just days ago, Bitcoin was on its way to sealing its biggest April losses since 2015 in a stark contrast to the general trend of the past twelve years."
293,"More USD Coin (USDC) was printed on April 30 than at any time in the dollar-backed stablecoin’s existence, as just over $3 billion was minted in one fell swoop.New USD Coins are minted whenever a customer exchanges their U.S dollars for the stablecoin, and Friday’s influx amounted to over 26% of its market cap at the time.The sudden arrival of $3 billion worth of USDC into the cryptocurrency market coincides with a surging altcoin market, evidenced by Bitcoin’s (BTC) descent to its lowest market cap dominance in two and a half years.Bitcoin’s dominance of 47.79% on Friday was the lowest since August 2018, as Ethereum (ETH), Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Cardano (ADA) and others saw their own market cap presence swell massively since the turn of the year. In early January, Bitcoin’s dominance was perched at over 70%, and has been on a steady decline since.The value of USD Coin in circulation jumped from $11 billion to almost $14.4 billion on Friday, meaning USD Coin now has a market cap worth 28% of the most utilized stablecoin, Tether (USDT), of which over 50 billion are in circulation. In August 2020, USD Coin held a market cap worth just one tenth that of Tether, suggesting traders have found a definite use for USDC, perhaps at the expense of USDT.Circle, which founded USD Coin in combination with well-known cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, recently announced that it had tapped New York based Signature Bank to ensure the backing of USD Coin with appropriate reserves. USD Coin is reportedly backed by a mix of cash and short-term U.S treasury bonds."
294,"MicroStrategy, the company which owns over 91,000 Bitcoin (BTC), saw an astounding surge in revenues in Q1, its latest figures confirm.In a press release on April 30, CEO Michael Saylor revealed that the company's success had gone far beyond its Bitcoin profits.MicroStrategy has continued to hit the headlines for its flatly bullish position on Bitcoin and its future, adding to its reserves regardless of sentiment or price. Its advocacy has seemed to endear it to a new sector of clientele — nine months after beginning to convert its cash reserves to BTC, sales of its products and services have also boomed.""Product licenses and subscription services revenues for the first quarter of 2021 were $31.3 million, a 52.3% increase, or a 49.8% increase on a non-GAAP constant currency basis, compared to the first quarter of 2020,"" the press release states.Total revenues for Q1 were just over $122 million, representing a 10.3% increase over the same period in 2020.""MicroStrategy’s first quarter results were a clear example that our two-pronged corporate strategy to grow our enterprise analytics software business and acquire and hold bitcoin is generating substantial shareholder value,"" Saylor commented.He said that the company was ""still happy"" with its approach to BTC acquisition, adding that it would be adding to its already substantial reserves.""We will continue to acquire and hold additional bitcoin as we seek to create additional value for shareholders,"" he concluded.As Cointelegraph reported, the company's stock price has experienced volatility this year, something which has echoed Bitcoin's own price discovery.The numbers are a familiar boon for Bitcoin bulls, who have been left hanging this week as rumors of major corporate buy-ins from the likes of Facebook went unsubstantiated.This combined with equally familiar ranging price action has hit enthusiasm in some quarters, while analysts argue that there is nothing to be bearish about.""So far, so good for Bitcoin. Still nothing to worry (about),"" popular trader Michaël van de Poppe summarized to Twitter followers on Thursday.An accompanying chart highlighted resistance beginning at $55,000 for the largest cryptocurrency to overcome as altcoins began to accelerate their own gains.At the time of writing, BTC/USD traded at around $54,700, having come full circle over the past 24 hours which included a drop below $53,000."
295,"There are often multiple causes for an asset’s sharp decline, but Bitcoin’s (BTC) 10% “nosedive,” which took place on April 22, may be blamed on the Biden Administration’s reported plan to tax capital gains at double the current rate on America’s wealthiest. Bitcoin is habitually volatile, so one probably shouldn’t read too much into a double-digit swoon in any given week, but this might be as good a place as any to reflect upon the possible impact of the United States capital gains taxes, and taxes in general, upon the future growth of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.Could it hinder long-term adoption? If so, in what ways? Will the Biden plan even reach fruition, given the vagaries of U.S. politics? How, too, does one explain the mini-market eruption in the face of the mere possibility of more taxes in a single nation? What sorts of misperceptions might we be harboring with regard to crypto taxation generally?“The price drop can probably be attributed to a number of factors and rumors — chiefly, the month-end expiration of future positions, which resulted in a liquidation of positions that triggered a slide,” Markus Veith, a partner in the audit practice at Grant Thornton LLP and leader of the firm’s digital assets practice, told Cointelegraph.There were also reports, generally thought to be false, that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was spearheading an effort to impose an 80% capital gains tax rate on cryptocurrencies, “as well as rumors that the U.S. Treasury was investigating financial institutions for illicit use of cryptocurrencies, which the DoJ would do, not the Treasury,” added Veith, continuing: “Then, there were also comments about a drop in Chinese mining capacity.”David Trainer, CEO of investment research firm New Constructs, downplayed the BTC price gyrations, stating: “10% volatility is nothing new for BTC and crypto in general.” Meanwhile, Tyler Menzer, a CPA and doctoral student in accounting at the University of Iowa, noted: “While the tax news does coincide with the drop, it may only be one of many contributing factors.”But taxes do matter. “The [Biden] proposal would put the effective tax rate at above 50% in certain states and would be detrimental to job creation,” Carlos Betancourt, co-founder of BKCoin Capital in Miami, told Newsweek, adding, “and would continue to accelerate the move from states like California and New York to more tax-friendly states like Florida and Texas that have no state income tax.”This is still an early stage in a new administration, of course, and there is some question whether a doubling of the capital gains on the wealthiest to 39.6% — as proposed — will even make it through Congress intact, or if that rate will eventually be reduced.“Someone needs to pay for all the stimulus, deficits, and national debt, so very likely you would see a tax increase in the near future — whether on capital gains or something else is still to be decided,” Mazhar Wani, a PricewaterhouseCoopers tax partner in San Francisco, told Cointelegraph.However, Omri Marian, professor of law at the University of California, Irvine School of Law, said that the proposal will unlikely be accepted in its current form. “The Democratic majority in Congress is just too narrow for this,” Marian informed Cointelegraph. Chris Weston, head of research at the Pepperstone Group — a forex broker — said: “The numbers being proposed at this juncture will unlikely pass the Senate in its current form, and centrist Democrats will not back the touted numbers.”But casting rumors aside, if a doubling of the capital gains tax does pass through Congress intact, would it necessarily mean stormy weather for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology?Maybe not. Nathan Goldman, assistant professor of accounting at North Carolina State University, told Cointelegraph — after consulting with his co-author on BTC taxation matters, Christina Lewellen — that the new capital gains taxes are geared to the wealthiest — those with more than $1 million in annual income — and they would be paid only upon the sale of the digital asset:Still, “taxes likely do have an effect on Bitcoin prices,” said Menzer, continuing, “as we have a lot of prior research on a wide variety of outcomes and aspects of life that are affected by tax rates, especially in the financial sector.”Moreover, they could push crypto and blockchain technology in some interesting directions. Wani, for example, would expect to see more “short-term volatility due to certain investors cashing out at the lower rates, but long term, you may see more demand for DeFi applications and other collateralized use cases to create liquidity and avoid triggering gains.”What about murmurs surrounding Yellen’s so-called 80% capital gains tax — which would be “punitive and unprecedented”? Goldman told Cointelegraph, “I do not believe there is strong merit to the rumors of an 80% capital gains tax on cryptocurrency” — a position echoed elsewhere. But some still believe that Yellen hasn’t really warmed to crypto.“My own view is Yellen fundamentally doesn’t get Bitcoin,” Weston said, continuing, “and to go after digital assets to protect against criminal activity in an asset that leaves a record is odd” particularly because cash is usually favored in such transactions, given its untraceability. Meanwhile, Trainer added:With regard to the capital gains issue in general, Menzner commented: “To the extent that higher taxes make it more expensive to use cryptocurrency or adopt it for new uses, it will be a setback.” However, he added: “It could also accelerate the use of stablecoins for certain cryptocurrency projects, as they are designed to minimize price fluctuations and thus minimize any gain or loss from a tax perspective.”“We don’t often see tax as the controlling decision of whether to exit a position, but it may drive when an exit occurs; for example, if any corresponding losses should be harvested, when long-term/short-term holding periods are met, etc.,” Paul Beecy, tax services partner at Grant Thornton LLP, told Cointelegraph.To what extent, though, is this all just a U.S. issue? Does it really even matter in Singapore or France what happens in the U.S. with regard to tax policy — especially for a globally purchased and held asset like Bitcoin?“Competitive advantage is key here,” according to Wani, who added: “It matters if other countries follow similar policies for taxation.” Also, he believes other countries may try to become more competitive by offering “more incentives — i.e., less taxation — to attract more talent and businesses from this growing industry to their jurisdictions.”“The only thing I can definitively say on how much U.S. tax policy affects crypto is that we don’t know,” added Menzer, but “U.S. policy can cause real changes in crypto-exchange economics.” Many global exchanges do not allow U.S. residents and citizens to trade, for example, thanks to U.S. policy, “thus effectively separating non-U.S. traders from U.S. traders, which slightly breaks down the idea that Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are uniformly global.”It matters, said Marian, because “if you are a U.S. taxpayer, you owe U.S. taxes on your crypto trades no matter how you make them. It may be more difficult for the IRS to enforce if you hold your assets with a foreign custodian. But if you cheat on purpose, you wouldn’t care very much about a change in tax rates.”What does seem clear is the lack of clarity with regard to taxes and cryptocurrencies, starting with the common misperception that you do not need to pay taxes on crypto. According to Goldman:More problematic still, there is no standard tax treatment for all cryptocurrency uses. As Beecy told Cointelegraph: “When digital currency is held [in the U.S.] by individual retail investors as a capital asset, the tax rules on buying and selling it are reasonably understood, and the capital gains tax that applies ought to impact digital currency transactions in a manner very similar to other financial capital assets.”But when, by contrast, digital currency is structured as part of more complex transactions “and mimics other and more esoteric financial instruments — like derivatives, NFTs [nonfungible tokens], and certain security tokens — then the tax rules on those digital currency transactions are not really clear,” said Beecy.All in all, last week’s BTC’s price gyrations might have been an over-reaction to some preliminary tax plans, but this response was probably predictable, given that “regulation is obviously a major grey cloud” that begets anxiety, as Weston noted, “but as we’ve seen many times of late, the market sells first, thinks about it, and calmer heads generally prevail.”Taxation, of course, is a serious business, and even if doubling of the capital gains tax only directly impacts the wealthiest, history teaches that taxes can have a leveraged impact on long-term growth — so, one needs to pay attention.Taxation is a form of regulation, and the mere fact that discussions like this are taking place in crypto’s only 12th year of existence may provide some confidence, arguably, that the U.S. is not going to ban or attempt to “shut down” cryptocurrencies. Indeed, the net effect could be an “increase [in] adoption as people feel more confident,” submitted Menzer."
296,"Turkish authorities are progressing with an investigation into local cryptocurrency exchange Thodex, which abruptly halted trading last week.On Thursday, a Turkish court jailed six suspects pending trial, including siblings of the missing CEO and senior company employees, Reuters reported.As part of the probe, Interpol reportedly issued a red notice for Thodex CEO and founder Faruk Fatih Özer, who had reportedly flown to Albania. “When he is caught with the red notice, we have extradition agreements with a large part of these countries. God willing he will be caught and he will be returned,” interior minister Süleyman Soylu said.Local authorities detained over 83 individuals suspected to be involved in the case amid growing concerns that Thodex was a scam after the platform halted money withdrawals.Some suspects indicated that Özer’s siblings — Güven Özer and Serap Özer — could have been serving major roles in Thodex’s operations, noting that both had significant crypto holdings, local news agency Anadolu Agency reports.Güven Özer reportedly holds nearly 22 million Turkish liras ($2.7 million) on two major local crypto exchanges including BtcTurk and Paribu. Güven reportedly served as an active executive at Thodex despite not having an official role at the company.Serap Özer, the missing CEO’s sister, reportedly had over 120 million liras ($14.6 million) worth of crypto transactions on her Binance account between 2018 and 2021. She claimed that the account was not hers. Serap allegedly oversaw financial activities at Thodex.As previously reported, the missing Thodex CEO is reported to have run off with as much as $2 billion worth of crypto, but according to the latest reports, interior minister Soylu said that the company’s portfolio totaled $108 million.The news comes as the Turkish government hardens its stance on crypto, with the country’s central bank officially banning crypto payments effective on Friday. Another Turskish crypto exchange, Vebitcoin, also announced last week that it would be ceasing operations amid employee arrests and allegations of fraud.Additional reporting by Erhan Kahraman."
297,"A major governmental agency in Uzbekistan seems to be rethinking its stance on cryptocurrencies.The National Agency for Project Management under the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, or NAPM, issued an official document proposing several amendments to licensing procedures for crypto trading.The NAPM proposed to officially allow local residents to conduct “all types of crypto exchange trades involving crypto assets and tokens in exchange for the national currency and the foreign currency.” The authority stressed that crypto investors would trade and invest at their own risk.The proposal also aims to establish processes for the registration, issuance and circulation of digital assets, authorizing licensed crypto companies in Uzbekistan to issue their own tokens. According to official records, the proposed amendments are open to discussion until May 14, 2021.The latest news shows an apparent change of heart toward cryptocurrencies at the NAPM. In late 2019, the agency banned the country’s residents from purchasing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). Despite barring crypto purchases, the authority reportedly still allows locals to sell their crypto holdings.In January 2020, Uzbekistan debuted its first regulated cryptocurrency exchange, Uznex, which is only open to non-residents. The platform was launched by Kobea Group, a technology company from South Korea.Disclaimer: This article was updated to specify that Kobea Group has never acted as a tech adviser to the government of Uzbekistan, as per comments by the NAPM."
298,"Intercontinental Exchange, the operator of the New York Stock Exchange and the owner of Bakkt digital asset platform, has sold its 1.4% stake in the newly Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency firm Coinbase.Announcing the news Thursday on a financial-results call for the first quarter of 2021, ICE chief financial officer Scott Hill said that the company sold its Coinbase stake for $1.2 billion. The executive noted that the sale generated approximately $900 million net after taxes.Hill said that the proceeds were used to reduce ICE’s debt at the end of the first quarter. He noted that the company’s pro forma leverage, or total indebtedness rate, would have been closer to 3.6x compared to 4.2x when ICE acquired mortgage-focused software company Ellie Mae in September 2020.“We are definitely a bit ahead of schedule, been paying down debt faster than we sort of expected when we started the deal. I mean I would say we were doing that, though, before the Coinbase sale,” ICE incoming chief financial officer Warren Gardiner added. He stressed that the Coinbase proceeds gave the company “some additional flexibility” as ICE moves into the rest of the year. “We are down to about 3.6 leverage, the target is about 3.25, where we can start to think about buying back stock,” he noted.ICE’s decision to sell Coinbase shares comes amid the company posting record revenues in Q1 2021 totaling $1.8 billion and up 4% year-over-year. “First quarter revenues, operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share were all the best in the history of our company,” Gardiner said. He stated that, while ICE’s total transaction revenues slightly declined versus last year, the amount of total recurring revenues increased by 9%.As previously reported, ICE’s digital asset trading platform, Bakkt, is set to go public on NYSE in Q2 2021 through a merger with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings.The biggest crypto exchange in the United States, Coinbase went public on Nasdaq on April 14 with a direct listing of its COIN shares. The shares opened at $381, marking heightened institutional demand as the stock’s pre-listing reference price was just $250. The Coinbase stock closed Thursday trades at $294, following a gradual decline after the listing, according to data from TradingView.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, multiple COIN investors, including Coinbase executives, sold $5 billion in COIN stocks shortly after listing. Notable sales included those of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, selling nearly 750,000 shares netting at a total of around $292 million. "
299,"U.S.-based financial institution BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custodian bank and asset servicing company, states that the recent performance of one of its exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, was significantly impacted by its lack of exposure to companies investing in Bitcoin.The BNY Mellon Opportunistic Small Cap Fund (DSCVX) gained 35% from September 1, 2020, through February 28, 2021, underperforming its benchmark, the Russell 2000 Index — which produced roughly 41.7% over the same period.Filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicate the firm laments not purchasing shares in leading business intelligence firm MicroStrategy (MSTR) — which invested billions into Bitcoin last year, holdings that have since grown to more than $4.8 billion. The filings state:The document also notes that the fund’s position in gold mining company, Alamos Gold, “hampered performance as shares were hurt by weak gold prices.”According to ETF.com, 88 ETFs are currently exposed to MicroStrategy, including the sixth-strongest performing fund of 2021 so far, the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) — which is heavily exposed to crypto firms and is the single-largest holder of MSTR by percentage allocation with 5.20% of its portfolio invested in Microstrategy.On average, U.S.-based ETFs have allocated 0.57% of their capital to MicroStrategy.Since announcing its first Bitcoin investment in August 2020, MicroStrategy has accumulated $2.2 billion worth of BTC — with the firm’s crypto stash having appreciated in value by 120%.Over the same period, the price of MSTR has skyrocketed by 385% from $135 to $655 at the time of writing. In early February, MSTR was trading at record highs above $1,270.BNY’s small-cap ETF typically invests a minimum of 80% of its assets into the stocks of companies with a low market capitalization from the Russell 2000 Index. Some of the fund’s largest allocations include North American airline SkyWest, enterprise cloud provider Cloudera, and healthcare provider Acadia. Roughly 23% of its investments are in the industrial sector, 17.5% are in healthcare, 15.9% are in technology, and 14.2% are in financial servicesAfter opening 2020 trading at roughly 27.5%, DSCVX crashed as low as $16 during March as the economic impacts of the coronavirus became apparent globally. Since then, the fund has more than doubled in price to trade for more than $37.Despite regretting the lack of MSTR exposure of its Opportunistic Small Cap Fund, BNY Mellon is making significant investments in the crypto sector, leading the $133 million Series C funding round of institutional crypto custodian Fireblocks last month.In February, BNY Mellon also announced plans to offer Bitcoin custody services."
300,"This weekly roundup of news from Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong attempts to curate the industry’s most important news, including influential projects, changes in the regulatory landscape, and enterprise blockchain integrations.Huobi Asset Management is looking to be the Grayscale of Asia with the launch of four cryptocurrency-related tracker funds. The funds include a Bitcoin Fund, an Ethereum fund, a multi-asset basket of digital currencies, and a private equity fund for mining businesses. The aim is clearly to entice major institutional investors into the space with a product that feels familiar. The fund and asset management company is set up in Hong Kong, even though Huobi maintains several offices within the mainland. Huobi is China’s most established exchange and ranks second on the global liquidity rankings behind Binance.High volumes and volatility continued on the world’s most popular memecoin. On Wednesday, searches on WeChat for the Chinese version of ‘Dog-coin’ were up over 65% from the previous day. Shiba, another dog-themed memecoin, was also popular with Chinese exchanges MXC, Gate, Hotbit, LBank and Hoo. These five claimed the top spots for centralized exchanges by volume on Thursday. This suggests that Chinese investors are less attracted to fundamentals and continuing to invest in a more trend-based manner.The winery founded by retired Chinese basketball star Yao Ming released an exclusive wine paired with a nonfungible token. Yao Family Wines released 200 limited edition bottles in a series named The Chop. This is a reference to historic stone seals, known as chops, that were used on official Chinese documents or pieces of art. The NFTs are now being traded on OpenSea for between 0.2 and 0.5 Ether (ETH). Yao is currently an executive in the Chinese Basketball Association and is well known for his humanitarian work off the court.After five proposed class-action lawsuits against crypto companies were dismissed in New York federal courts, a number of blockchain projects, including Tron, will be sleeping a little easier. The five dismissed cases were initially filed by plaintiffs upset about misleading investors engaging in market manipulation and the sale of digital assets that were allegedly unlicensed securities. Cases against Binance, KuCoin and Tron have yet to be dismissed, but considering the similarities, it seems they have a good shot at dismissal, too. Tron has a mixed perception in China, where Chinese co-founder Justin Sun has raised more than a few eyebrows with his heavy-handed approach to marketing.On April 25 and 26, many of China’s largest corporations and organizations came together to discuss the topic of digitalization. E-commerce giant JD.com announced it had been paying some of its staff salaries with DCEP, China’s central bank digital currency. The firm also announced it uses the technology for select business-to-business payments. JD.com, which is similar to Amazon, is no stranger to blockchain and digital currencies. It maintains a blockchain division that is responsible for a number of projects related to supply chain management and food safety.At the summit, Ant Finance revealed that a number of private companies had been supporting the government-led project. Ant Group and Tencent, the companies that own the two largest private payments processors in the country, are included in the project. Also named was smartphone and 5G technology provider Huawei. This won’t be a major surprise, as private companies will be eager to act in solidarity with the national policies. However, it does potentially lay a clear path to market for the digital yuan if it can be integrated into the country’s most popular apps and products."
301,"Bitcoin and the overall cryptocurrency market saw minor losses on April 29 as the market heads into the expiry of $4.2 billion worth of (BTC) options contracts. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that since reaching a high above $56,400 on April 28, the price of Bitcoin has dropped more than 6% back down near the $53,000 support level while Ethereum (ETH) continues to trade above $2,700.Despite the lull in market activity, signs of mainstream cryptocurrency integration continue to emerge on a near-daily basis. Earlier today Coinbase announced that users can now purchase up to $25,000 worth of cryptocurrency per day using their PayPal account.And it's not just financial institutions that are integrating blockchain technology to help achieve financial objectives. The government of Ethiopia revealed a partnership with Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), the research and development arm behind Cardano (ADA). The goal of the new partnership is to us blockchain technology to overhaul its education system.While Bitcoin continues to struggle below the $55,000 resistance level, the ETH/BTC pairing has started climbing higher in a move that was predicted by multiple analysts, including Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal. The bullish movement in the ETH/BTC pair has also reignited conversations about Ether price evetually flipping BTC.According to Élie Le Rest, partner at digital asset management firm ExoAlpha, Ether has been getting stronger against Bitcoin since the end of March with the upcoming upgrade which includes EIP 1559 being “seen as a strong catalyst of the recent ETH bull-run.”This increased momentum is a signal for Le Rest that the market may be in a “buy the rumor, sell the news configuration that may drive the price up until EIP 1559 is released in July this year.”Le Rest said: The slumping price of Bitcoin weighed down the wider cryptocurrency market on Thursday with a majority of altcoins experiencing minor losses.Some notable exceptions to the pullback include Syscoin (SYS), which at one point spiked 45% to $0.50 and the Binance Smart Chain-based Venus lending platform, whose XVS token rallied 30% to $97.90, just a dollar short of its all-time high.Waves (WAVES), a multi-purpose blockchain platform, also experienced a 20% surge that lifted the token to a new record high at $23.43.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $2.035 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 48.8%."
302,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been struggling to sustain above the $53,000 support for the past three days, while Ether (ETH) soared to a new all-time high at $2,800. In the current scenario, some traders would rather wait for Friday's CME futures expiry before entering long BTC positions, as historically, its price tends to correct ahead of the event.On the other hand, Ether's price has been positively impacted by the European Investment Bank launching a ""digital bond"" sale using the Ethereum network. The EIB is issuing a two-year 100-million-euro ($120.8 million) digital bond, with the deal to be led by Goldman Sachs, Santander, and Societe Generale.Furthermore, in the past week, JP Morgan published a research note stating that Ether should continue to outperform Bitcoin due to liquidity improvements and increased activity on the network.According to fixed-income analyst Joshua Younger:""Bitcoin is more of a crypto commodity than currency and competes with gold as a store of value, whereas Ether is the backbone of the crypto-native economy and therefore functions more as a medium of exchange. To the extent owning a share of this potential activity is more valuable.""When analyzing the ratio between users' net long-to-short ratio at OKEx, surprising data emerges. The indicator is calculated using clients' consolidated positions, including perpetual and futures contracts. The proportion of Ether longs versus the shorts reached the lowest level in 2021, becoming significantly lower than Bitcoin's.Ether longs vastly dominated throughout 2021, peaking at 130% larger than shorts, while Bitcoin traders have been usually more modest. However, the April 29 market trend reversal comes as the ratio for BTC longs stands 45% higher than shorts.Meanwhile, Ether traders are only 6% net long, signaling a lack of confidence in the recent rally.One should not interpret the stance of OKEx traders' positioning in Ether as bearish, considering that the long-to-short ratio is relatively flat. However, April's monthly trend leaves no doubt that Bitcoin traders are becoming more optimistic.Traders should not dismiss Friday's BTC and Ether options expiry. The $3.9 billion Bitcoin expiry presents a danger to bulls if the price happens to move below $50,000, considering the neutral-to-bearish put options would then have a $700 million advantage.Currently, bulls dominate Ether's more modest $930 million options expiry, and the $115 million difference in call options open interest seems guaranteed even if Ether's price drops to $2,600.However, both cryptocurrencies could experience volatility after Friday's 8:00 AM UTC options expiry and the following CME futures and options expiry at 3:00 PM UTC.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

303,"On April 28, MercadoLibre (MELI), the largest Latin American online marketplace, launched a real estate section dedicated to cryptocurrencies. Although the company does not settle property transactions directly, it legitimizes the category as a payment system. The $81 billion retailer is the second largest company in South America and is present in 18 countries, including its three largest markets, Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico.The group also owns Mercado Pago, a digital payments system for online and offline transactions, along with Mercado Envios, a logistics platform that provides fulfillment, warehousing, and shipping services.The current offers include houses, condos, vacant lots, land and commercial real estate located in Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Cordoba.Although this might seem like a niche market, over 300 real estate agents took part in Mercado Libre's webinar explaining the basic mechanics of cryptocurrencies and their potential impact on the sector. The news might have had a reduced impact as less than 90 offers have been placed in the section, and the prices continue to be displayed in U.S. dollars.As is already the case with properties paid in U.S. dollars, Argentine pesos, or Brazilian reais, the transaction is handled outside the Mercado Libre platform and combined between the parties. Thus, after choosing the property of preference, the buyer contacts the real estate agent and requests to carry out the transaction in cryptocurrency at the deal closing exchange rate.However, what analysts might have failed to foresee is the potential of Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Tether (USDT) to effectively serve as a means of exchange in Argentina.As stated by Juan Manuel Carretero, the commercial manager for vehicles and real estate at Mercado Libre:According to Statista, Mercado Libre's gross merchandise volume accounts for 25.4% of all e-commerce sales in Latin America. Its sales are expected to reach $25 billion in 2021. Therefore, capturing 5% of the $1.25 billion in volume generated each year.Argentina might end up being the poster-child for cryptocurrency adoption as the country's gross domestic product declined by 10% in 2020, and its cumulative inflation hit 42.6% over the last 12 months.Considering that people have been limited to purchasing $200 of foreign banknotes per month by the central bank, cryptocurrencies have been effectively functioning as a store of wealth for its citizens.It may be just a question of time regarding how long it will be before cryptocurrencies gain center-stage as one of the leading digital payment options and marketplaces in Latin America. Meanwhile, the real estate dedicated section should be interpreted as a test drive for consumer demand.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

304,"What’s interesting about this particular options expiry is that the current max pain price for the expiry is $54,000, which is very close to the current trading price. The max pain price is the price at which most options are rendered worthless, thus leading to the loss of the option premium for the options holders. Although, in this situation, options writers stand to gain.On April 29, over $4.2 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) options contracts will expire. This expiry comes after Bitcoin has seen a recovery from $48,000 to currently trade in the $54,000 range. The total open interest of Bitcoin options currently stands at $13.54 billion, with over 88% being on Deribit, the largest crypto derivatives exchange by both volume and market capitalization.Cointelegraph discussed this with Robbie Liu, market analyst at OKEx Insights — the research team at cryptocurrency exchange OKEx. He stated that “A huge expiry alone does not indicate that the market is bullish or bearish, but it did restrain the price upswing when the previous quarterly options expired at the end of March. And after the delivery, the downward pressure was reduced.”In fact, when looking at the max pain curve, it’s evident that it’s reasonably flat at the bottom. This means that the overall economic impact of an expiry at $48,000 is relatively comparable to that of an expiry at $62,000. Shaun Fernando, head of risk and product strategy at Deribit, told Cointelegraph: “On expiry, with the removal of the max pain point, this could lead to an easier deviation from the 54k level.”According to data from CoinOptionsTrack, the put-call ratio for the expiry is 0.69. The put-call ratio describes the trading volumes of put options in relation to those of call options. A put option buyer has the right to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on a specified date, while a call option holder has the right to buy an asset at a predetermined price on a specified date. The put-call ratio is often used as an indicator of the sentiment that prevails in the market. If the value is above 1, it is looked at as an indicator to sell, while a value below 1 is seen as an opportunity to buy. Regarding the implications of the max pain theory in this expiry, Liu further elaborated:While monthly options expiry dates are often significant events for their underlying assets due to the large size of the expiries, an expiry in and of itself is not a rare occurrence. There are multiple options with different expiry dates offered by various exchanges. For instance, the expiry on April 23 caused 27,000 BTC in options to expire. At the current price, this expiry was worth $1.45 billion. A large portion of this was about 2,500 put options at a strike price of $50,000, while the max pain price was at $58,000.Liu explained that the impact of the April 23 expiry was seen directly in the price of Bitcoin: “Bitcoin experienced a lot of selling pressure last Friday and the price managed to get pushed below $50,000 at the time of option settlement, at 4pm HKT [8:00 am UTC]. Then it saw a rebound after that. We can’t know yet if the same scenario is going to repeat itself.”While this impact is often evident in the short term, some investors believe it might be an overrated angle for analysis. Scott Melker, a crypto trader and analyst, told Cointelegraph:Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, told Cointelegraph: “Bitcoin’s options market is still relatively small for the expiry to have a sizable impact on the spot price.”As the debate continues over the impact of the Bitcoin options market on the price of BTC in the long term, analyzing the price trends of the underlying asset shows an interesting aspect.Even though Bitcoin hit its all-time high of $64,900 on April 21, it saw a 27% drop almost immediately as its price fell as low as the $46,000 range. The flagship cryptocurrency has been recovering from this slump ever since. Considering only the trend in April, there has been a 5% loss in BTC’s price — which was not expected, considering its April returns over the past four years. Barring any dramatic price movements on April 30, this will be the first time in six years that BTC ends the month of April in the red.Lui opined on this, saying: “Bitcoin has averaged a 30% return in April over the past four years. But the market leader returned much more in the first quarter of this year than in previous years. It’s not bad for Bitcoin to take a pause in April after the previous parabolic run.” Fernando further elaborated, referring to BTC’s gains during quarter one:However, the one-year gains for BTC currently stand at 604%, which is unprecedented, thus showing that 2021 has to date been an outstanding year for the asset. This mostly due to the rising attention given to Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies by both retail investors and institutional investors.April has been no different in terms of continued institutional adoption of the asset. On April 21, Japanese gaming giant Nexus became the latest large corporation to invest in Bitcoin. It announced that it made a purchase of 1,717 BTC at a price of $58,226, which equates to a roughly $100 million investment.The quarter-one earnings release for Tesla revealed that it booked a $101 million profit from the sale of BTC. While most perceived this as a positive development that showed the potential profits and liquidity of Bitcoin, some skeptics saw this as a sell-off and a broader call to sell Bitcoin. Tesla CEO Elon Musk was quick to point out that “Tesla sold 10% of its holdings essentially to prove liquidity of Bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on balance sheet” and that he has personally not sold any of his Bitcoin.One way to gauge institutional moves is through outflows from crypto exchange Coinbase Pro. The exchange normally integrates its custody wallets with its over-the-counter desks, which institutions usually trade through to minimize the impact on the spot markets. The outflows are seen as a representation of institutional activity in the BTC market.According to CryptoQuant’s “BTC: Coinbase Pro Outflow” tracker, there were four significant outflows from Coinbase in April. It’s possible that this BTC went to Coinbase custody wallets for OTC deals.Ju further elaborated: “Institutions like Tesla use Coinbase Prime brokerage to buy or sell BTC. It would be bulk orders that can affect BTC price. Coinbase premium has been negative/neutral for the past 7 weeks, but it turned positive lately, hitting an all-time high a week ago.”The Coinbase premium gap measures the difference in the price of BTC on Coinbase Pro and Binance. The larger the gap — and the higher the premium — the stronger the spot buying pressure on Coinbase.As Bitcoin continues to recover from its April mid-month slump, it’s evident that institutional interest in the asset is still on the rise despite the price volatility it has seen recently. While the upcoming $4.2 billion options expiry might not lead to much of an economic impact for options holders, it is highly likely that after the options expiry, the downward pressure on BTC will move away from the current max pain price of $54,000."
305,"Paxos, a major cryptocurrency company and PayPal’s crypto collaborator, has completed a massive fundraising round shortly after receiving preliminary approval to form a national trust bank.On Thursday, the firm announced a new $300-million Series D funding round bringing Paxos’ valuation to $2.4 billion. The new funding round included previous Paxos investors — PayPal Ventures, Declaration Partners, Mithril Capital, Senator Investment Group, Liberty City Ventures, WestCap and others.The newly raised funds will help Paxos continue investing in the development of enterprise-grade infrastructure and further grow its commitment to regulation, security and compliance, as well as expand operations, the firm said.Following preliminary approval granted by the United States Office of the Comptroller of the Currency last week, Paxos also plans to establish the Paxos National Trust Bank in the near future. The company also applied for a clearing agency registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission and is pursuing a Major Payment Institution license in Singapore.Paxos co-founder and CEO Charles Cascarilla said that demand for the company’s enterprise solutions has accelerated much faster than the firm had anticipated. Founded back in 2012, Paxos emerged as a major industry player allowing users to tokenize, custody, trade and settle digital assets. Paxos has issued stablecoins like U.S. dollar-pegged Paxos Standard and gold-backed PAX Gold.Last year, PayPal announced a partnership with Paxos to allow users to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC). Paxos also assisted PayPal-owned payments firm Venmo in launching cryptocurrency trading last week."
306,"Bitcoin (BTC) may not be worrying analysts with its latest price dip, but it will likely close its first negative month of April in six years this week despite hitting a new all-time high two weeks ago.Data from monitoring resource Bybt shows that at -8.3%, April 2021 is Bitcoin’s worst April on record and the first since 2015 to make a loss.The performance contrasts that of March, traditionally a “bad month” for Bitcoin but which this year conversely saw gains of nearly 30%.With Q1 likewise seeing three straight months of upside — something that has not happened since 2013 — 2021 continues to buck multiple BTC price trends.At the time of writing, with less than two days to go until May, BTC/USD traded at around $54,600, having briefly spiked to $56,200 on rumors that Facebook had purchased Bitcoin in Q1. Those rumors, despite making it to mainstream media, turned out to be baseless.As ever, Bitcoin’s best-known names were entirely unfazed by the lack of adoption miracle coming from Facebook’s Q1 earnings report.“If you sold Bitcoin because Facebook didn’t buy any in Q1 and you also think you’re GMI, I have some unfortunate news for you,” Travis Kling, CEO of crypto asset manager Ikigai, told Twitter followers.BREAKING: Facebook has purchased 0 bitcoin for an aggregate price of $0 in a strategic corporate move to have fun staying poor.As Cointelegraph reported, meanwhile, the consensus among traders is building for Bitcoin to continue cooling off after six months of epic upside.During this time, which should last until the autumn, altcoins will be the focus, these already retaking the lion’s share of the cryptocurrency market capitalization.Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin, which hit fresh all-time highs this week, is showing itself to be particularly uncorrelated to Bitcoin under current conditions.“Not only are they not correlated, which would be a 0, they have entered the realm of inversely correlated,” popular trader Scott Melker noted, summarizing findings from his latest Wolf Den newsletter.Toward Q4, however, Bitcoin should then awaken to continue its journey higher."
307,"A county in the state of New Jersey has announced the liquidation of cryptocurrency assets seized in 2018.On Monday, the prosecutor’s office in Monmouth County announced that the confiscated crypto —initially valued at $57,000 at the time it was seized — was liquidated on Coinbase for $198,237 at a quote “profit” of $141,000.Authorities captured the cryptocurrency during a 2018 drug bust in Long Branch. The assets were frozen on a United States-based crypto exchange once officials determined them as profits secured from illegal drug sales.Monmouth County Prosecutor Christopher Gramiccioni said that the county is the first state-level agency to complete the forfeiture and liquidation of cryptocurrency assets. “This will serve as an effective template for the state law enforcement agencies in the cryptocurrency market — a place where we can expect proceeds from crimes to continue to be concealed,” he noted.The prosecutor’s office did not specify exactly which cryptocurrencies were seized. Major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) have recorded whopping gains since 2018, with Bitcoin surging to nearly $65,000 in 2021 from a low of $3,200 in December 2018. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, surged above $2,700 for the first time in history on Wednesday. In late 2018, the altcoin was trading below $100.Monmouth prosecutors noted another crypto seizure from 2017. The authority seized around $200,000 in crypto assets during a fraud case that resulted in the arrest of 16 individuals. “The value of that cryptocurrency is now estimated to be more than $1.25 million,” the office stated.As previously reported, cryptocurrency firms have been regularly assisting government agencies in managing seized crypto assets. Last week, major crypto company BitGo announced that it will manage and provide custody to seized cryptocurrencies for the United States Marshals Service. In late 2020, major crypto intelligence firm Chainalysis launched a service designed to help authorities track, custody and sell crypto associated with a crime after its capture."
308,"Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, the tax authority of the United Kingdom, will ramp up its efforts to snare cryptocurrency tax evaders in an attempt to uncover what it regards as hidden wealth, says U.K. accountancy group UHY Hacker Young.According to the group, the “statement of assets” form that is used in tax evasion investigations will now include a section focused specifically on cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and others.Along with explicit demands for information on crypto holdings, the form will also reportedly include sections dedicated to other systems of exchange, including the black market peso used by Mexican and Colombian cartels, along with similar unsanctioned currencies used in Africa, India and China.“HMRC suspects that an increasing amount of hidden wealth is slipping through its fingers thanks to the rise of cryptocurrencies and other unsanctioned money transfer systems. This demand for information is an important step in HMRC’s fightback against that,” explained UHY Hacker Young director David Jones.“A defence of ignorance of the law in this booming sector will no longer wash with the taxman,” Jones added.The HMRC’s demand for information on cryptocurrency holdings may not necessarily be met, said Jones. However, should someone fail to declare cryptocurrency holdings during an investigation and authorities later uncover a crypto wallet belonging to them, they could now face additional criminal charges.“While criminals can still choose to not declare these assets, doing so gives HMRC another opportunity to bring criminal charges against them if their forensic work finds a hidden Bitcoin wallet,” Jones explained."
309,"Beijing authorities are reportedly conducting inspections of crypto mining data centers to better understand their impact on energy consumption, Reuters reported on Thursday.The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Economy and Information Technology on Tuesday sent an emergency notice to the city’s data center operators asking them to report whether they are involved in mining Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies. The notice required data centers to report the amount of power consumed by crypto mining, the report notes.A bureau official said that notice recipients include China’s top-three telecom operators. He noted that he was unaware of the reason behind the initiative or whether it is part of a nationwide campaign.The news comes amid a recovering Bitcoin hash rate, which experienced a major drop in mid-April due to massive power outages in the Chinese mining hub of Xinjiang. After tumbling to as low as 106 million terahashes per second on April 17, Bitcoin’s hash rate rebounded to around 166 million TH/s on Wednesday.Cryptocurrency mining’s energy consumption has been getting more attention from regulators in recent months. On Wednesday, a former government official argued that crypto mining was a major driver of the energy crisis in Kyrgyzstan. In late February, authorities of the Chinese autonomous region of Inner Mongolia proposed to shut down all crypto mining facilities by the end of April to reduce energy consumption."
310,"U.S. authorities have arrested the alleged mastermind behind a multi-million darknet-based BTC mixing service, Bitcoin Fog, after analyzing 10 years of blockchain data.Authorities have issued a chilling warning to other users of illegal blockchain services: Anything you do today may come back to haunt you as “this activity is on this ledger forever” and ever-more sophisticated analytics technology can track down crimes committed years earlier.For approximately a decade, Bitcoin Fog has enabled users to conceal the origin and destination of its users’ crypto assets. However, the Internal Revenue Service is charging Russian-Swedish citizen, Roman Sterlingov, with laundering more than 1.2 million Bitcoin worth $336 million while serving as the website’s administrator.Sterlingov was arrested on April 27 in Los Angeles, with the IRS estimating he received commissions of between 2% and 2.5% for mixing services at the time of each transaction — worth roughly $8 million then but exponentially more today.Authorities estimate at least 23% of the Bitcoin that flowed through the mixing service was transferred to darknet-based narcotics marketplaces such as Silk Road.Sterlingov’s arrest was the product of authorities fastidiously unpicking the web of BTC transactions associated with the mixer service dating back to 2011, using the Bitcoin blockchain to identify the site’s operator.Sterlingov founded the website in late 2011 under a Japanese pseudonym meaning “Happy New Year, '' spruiking Bitcoin Fog as eliminating any chance of authorities “finding your payments and making it impossible to prove any connection between a deposit and a withdraw inside our service.""In 2019, undercover IRS agents engaged Sterlingov through the platform, claiming they wished to launder the profits from ecstasy sales. The transactions were processed without a reply.Law enforcement was able to identify that Sterlingov had paid for Bitcoin Fog’s server hosting expenses using the now-defunct digital currency Liberty Reserve, allowing them to trace when he bought the Liberty Reserve using Bitcoin transferred from the collapsed pioneer crypto exchange, Mt Gox.From there, the IRS was able to identify the home address and phone number that Sterlingov had registered to his account, and eventually a Google Drive account containing instructions outlining the steps he took to purchase his Liberty Reserve coins.“This is yet another example of how investigators with the right tools can leverage the transparency of cryptocurrency to follow the flow of illicit funds,” said Jonathan Levin, co-founder of blockchain forensics firm, Chainalysis.Computer scientist, Sarah Meiklejohn, stated:Despite Sterlingov’s detention Bitcoin Fog remains online, although it is unclear who is operating the site."
311,"Bitcoin's (BTC) 2021 performance has been impressive, but traders waiting for a record-breaking monthly candle are likely to be disappointed this week. After peaking at $64,900 on April 14, a jaw-breaking 27% correction followed, causing BTC price to drop to the $46,000 level.This downside move obliterated more than $9 billion long BTC futures contracts in a swift action that was previously unthinkable to most investors.Even though the Bitcoin price recovered $5,800 over the past 48-hours, in the options markets, the bulls were not able to take the bears by surprise as both sides are virtually balanced for April 30 expiry.The total Bitcoin futures open interest just three months earlier was $11 billion, although this record-high took place on April 13 at $27.7 billion. Nevertheless, this shows how meaningful the recent price correction impact was.Meanwhile, options markets operate on a different basis as the contract buyer pays the premium upfront. Therefore, there is no forceful liquidation risk for the holder. While the call (buy) option provides its buyer upside price protection, the put option does the opposite.Therefore, those seeking neutral-to-bearish strategies will rely primarily on put options. On the other hand, call options are more commonly used for bullish traders.Although some exchanges offer weekly options contracts, the monthly ones usually draw larger volumes. April will be no different, with 72,000 BTC option contracts worth $3.9 billion at the current $54,500 price are set to expire.Take notice of how dominant April's options are as opposed to May or September. While the neutral-to-bullish call options dominate with 41% larger open interest for April 30, a more detailed analysis is needed to interpret this data.It is worth noting that not every option will trade at expiry, as some of those strikes now sound unreasonable, especially considering there are less than two days left.To understand how these competing forces are balanced, one should compare the calls and put options size at each expiry price (strike).Although these $80,000 to $120,000 call (buy) options might seem outrageous, they are typically used for 'calendar spread' strategies. As previously explained by Cointelegraph, the buyer might profit even if BTC trades well below those strikes.The ultra-bullish options are now effectively worthless because there is no benefit from gaining the right to acquire BTC for $80,000 on the April 30 expiry. The same could be said for the neutral-to-bearish put options at $48,000 and lower.Therefore, it is better to assess traders' positioning by excluding these unrealistic strikes.The neutral-to-bullish call options up to $58,000 amount to 9,950 BTC contracts. These are equivalent to $540 million in open interest at the current Bitcoin price. Another 3,100 would enter the scene at $60,000 and higher, generating a $780 million option expiry.On the other hand, the more bearish put options down to $51,000 total 12,000 BTC contracts, currently worth $650 million in open interest.If the Bitcoin price manages to plunge below $50,000, another 3,850 put options would also be exercised. This figure represents a potential $700 million open interest for the more bearish options.At the moment, both calls and puts appear virtually balanced. Considering that a $100 million to $150 million difference is likely not enough to incentivize either side to pressure the price, thus this monthly expiry may be 'uneventful.'The futures and options expiry at Deribit, OKEx, and Bit.com takes place on April 30 at 8:00 AM UTC. The CME futures and options happen at 3:00 PM UTC.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

312,"Bitcoin (BTC) has slowed down after its sharp relief rally over the past 48 hours, but Ether (ETH) is in no mood to rest as it continues to chase new all-time highs.The biggest altcoin by market capitalization seems to have received a boost from the news of the launch of a 100-million-euro ($120.8 million) digital bond sale on its network by the European Investment Bank.Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s institutional adoption has continued to expand. Japanese game developer Nexon disclosed the purchase of 1,717 Bitcoin at an average price of $58,226, for a total consideration of about $100 million. Nexon president and CEO Owen Mahoney said the investment was done to protect shareholder value and maintain the purchasing power of cash assets.It is not only the Bitcoin purchases by companies that is catching investor’s attention. Goldman Sachs said that crypto-related stocks have risen 43% this year, outperforming the S&P 500 by a wide margin, which is up over 13% year-to-date. This shows that legacy investors are piling into stocks closely related to cryptocurrencies.Even Time magazine has acknowledged the rise of crypto companies, naming Coinbase and Digital Currency Group in its Top 100 Most Influential Companies list for 2021. While DCG was listed in the ""disrupter"" category, Coinbase made the grade under the ""titan"" category.Will the strengthening fundamentals result in price appreciation across the crypto market? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin’s (BTC) relief rally reached the 20-day exponential moving average ($55,260) on April 27, where it has encountered stiff resistance from the bears. The bears are trying to defend the 20-day EMA and will now attempt to sink the price toward $50,460.However, if the bulls do not give up much ground from the current levels, it will suggest that demand remains strong. That could result in a possible break above the 50-day simple moving average ($56,947). If that happens, the BTC/USDT pair could rally to $61,825 and then to the all-time high at $64,849.27.Even if the price drops to the $50,460 support but rebounds off it strongly, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. That will lead the bulls to make one more attempt to clear the hurdle at the moving averages.This positive view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the $46,985.02–$50,460 support zone. That could result in a decline to the critical support at $43,006.77.Ether’s (ETH) rebound off the 20-day EMA ($2,336) picked up momentum on April 26, and the bulls pushed the price to a new all-time high on April 27. That was followed by another up-move on April 28, but the Doji candlestick pattern suggests the rally may be tiring in the short term.The first support on the downside will be $2,500, and if that breaks, the decline could reach the 20-day EMA. A strong bounce off of this support will suggest that traders are aggressively buying on dips.The rising moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the bulls pierce the resistance line of the ascending channel, the ETH/USDT pair could reach $3,000.Conversely, a break below the 20-day EMA could pull the price down to the support line of the channel. A break below this support could challenge the 50-day SMA ($2,041).Binance Coin (BNB) is gradually moving toward the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle. The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.A breakout and close above the triangle will indicate that demand exceeds supply, and that could result in the start of the next leg of the uptrend, which could reach $808.57.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the resistance line, it will suggest that bears are active at higher levels. That could keep the BNB/USDT pair stuck inside the triangle for a few more days. A breakdown and close below the triangle will signal a possible trend reversal.XRP surged above the 20-day EMA ($1.24) on April 26, suggesting that selling has exhausted in the short term. However, the altcoin is facing resistance at $1.46, just above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.42.If the XRP/USDT pair declines below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bears are selling on rallies. That could open the doors for a drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.89).Conversely, if the bulls defend the 20-day EMA and push the price above $1.46, the pair may rally to $1.55. A breakout of this resistance will suggest that bulls are back in the driver’s seat. The pair could then retest the 52-week high at $1.96.Cardano's ADA surged above the moving averages on April 26, and the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests traders bought the dip to the 20-day EMA ($1.23). This is a positive sign, as it shows that buyers are accumulating on dips.The ADA/USDT pair could now attempt a rally to $1.48 where the bears are likely to mount stiff resistance. If the price turns down from this level, the pair is likely to drop to the moving averages and remain range-bound for a few more days.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls drive the price above the $1.48–$1.55 overhead resistance zone, the pair could start the next leg of the uptrend, which has a target objective of $2.For Dogecoin (DOGE), the inside day candlestick pattern on April 26 and a Doji candlestick pattern on April 27 showed indecision among the bulls and the bears. That uncertainty resolved to the upside on April 28, and the bulls pushed DOGE to the overhead resistance at $0.34.If bulls can clear the hurdle at $0.34, the DOGE/USDT pair could start its journey toward $0.42 and then to the all-time high of $0.45. The rising 20-day EMA ($0.23) and the RSI in the positive zone suggest the bulls are in control.However, the bears are likely to pose a stiff challenge at the $0.34 resistance. A dip below $0.29 may weaken the bullish momentum. The bears will then smell an opportunity and try to pull the price down to the 20-day EMA. A break below this support could result in a decline to $0.15.Polkadot’s DOT relief rally is facing resistance near the 20-day EMA ($35.54), which suggests that sentiment has turned negative and traders are selling on rallies. The bears will now try to sink the price back toward the critical support at $26.50.The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI turning down from the downtrend line suggest that bears are at an advantage. A break below the $26.50 support will complete a large head-and-shoulders pattern, which could signal the start of a deeper correction.Conversely, if the bulls do not give up much ground from the current level, it will indicate buying on every minor dip. That will enhance the prospects of a breakout of the moving averages, resulting in a rally to $42.28 and then a retest at $48.36.Uniswap's UNI broke above the $39.60 overhead resistance and made a new all-time high on April 27. The up-move continued on April 28, and the bulls pushed the price above the resistance line of the ascending channel.If the UNI/USDT pair sustains above the channel, it will suggest strong momentum. The pair could then rally to $44.88 and then $50. The rising 20-day EMA ($34.50) and the RSI trying to break above the downtrend line suggest the bulls have the upper hand.Alternatively, if the price fails to sustain above the channel, a drop to $38 is possible. If the bulls flip this level to support, the possibility of a break above the channel increases. This positive view will invalidate if the pair turns down and slips below $35.20.Litecoin’s (LTC) relief rally rose above the 20-day EMA ($247) on April 28, suggesting the near-term selling pressure has eased. However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily.The LTC/USDT pair is facing resistance near the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $270.89. If the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($224). This is an important level to watch out for because if it cracks, the correction may deepen to $168.On the contrary, if the bulls successfully defend the 20-day EMA, it will indicate demand at lower levels. The buyers will then try to push the price above $270.89 and reach the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $286.02.This level may again act as stiff resistance, but if the bulls drive the price above it, the pair could be on track to retest $335.03.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) broke above the downtrend line on April 26, suggesting the start of a relief rally. The pullback is showing the first signs of resistance near the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $950.13.The bears will now try to sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($815). If they succeed, the BCH/USDT pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($661). Such a move will suggest that the sentiment has turned negative and traders are selling on rallies.Conversely, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA and breaks above $950.13, it will indicate that traders are buying on dips. That could push the price toward the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,012.29. A break above this level would tilt the advantage in favor of the bulls.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

313,"Japanese financial giant SBI Group more than doubled the total profit of its cryptocurrency business during the fiscal year that ended in March.On Wednesday, SBI released a report on the company’s financial results, disclosing that its pre-tax crypto-powered profits during the past fiscal year amounted to 18.9 billion yen ($174 million). The amount is 10 billion yen ($92 million) higher than the total pre-tax total profit recorded over the previous fiscal year, SBI said.SBI’s crypto division features several companies, including crypto trading platform SBI VC Trade, mining arm SBI Crypto, and newly acquired crypto trading platforms like TaoTao and B2C2. SBI purchased a 90% stake in B2C2, making it a subsidiary in December 2020, shortly after acquiring  the TaoTao crypto exchange in October.In the report, SBI notes its continued support of XRP dividends as part of the company’s XRP shareholder benefits program.The firm also reiterated its commitment to establishing a Singapore-based digital asset exchange in collaboration with Switzerland-based SIX Digital Exchange. “We aim to further expand the liquidity of digital assets and services for institutional investors through collaboration with the SIX Group, which has a high level of expertise in dealing with institutional investors,” the firm stated.SBI also mentioned its plans to set up a digital stock exchange in collaboration with Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group. Dubbed Osaka Digital Exchange, the platform is expected to start trading digital securities in 2023.SBI previously highlighted the positive impact of crypto on its business, reporting that SBI Securities’ trading revenue surge in 2019 came thanks to its crypto investment wing."
314,"Dogecoin (DOGE), the meme-based cryptocurrency that is a pet favorite of Elon Musk, has a new date for its price diary — Musk’s appearance on Saturday Night Live.In a tweet on Wednesday, Musk described himself as “The Dogefather” as he prepares to host the popular American television show on May 8.The Dogefather
SNL May 8Musk is well known for his PR stunts when it comes to Dogecoin, with social media posts often sparking price gains — something which has also benefited Bitcoin (BTC).A familiar scenario for Dogecoin fans, Musk’s latest round of publicity immediately fuelled a rebound in DOGE/USD, which was up 20% in hours at the time of writing.Bitcoin’s previous price dip had cost the altcoin sector dearly, with DOGE bottoming far below its recent record high of $0.47.That peak had also been caused in part by Musk, who had promised to “put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon” via the latest rocket launch of one of his companies, SpaceX.Last week saw an improvised “holiday,” dubbed “Dogecoin Day,” attempt to run up the DOGE price to a stratospheric $4.20 in time for the launch, a move which ultimately fell far short of expectations.The latest tweet nonetheless instantly placed DOGE in the top three daily movers with 20% gains to $0.32, beating Ether (ETH), which had itself just posted new all-time highs.Bitcoin continued to range, meanwhile, failing to cement $55,000 support in a boon for those expecting a continuation of “alt season 2.0.”“This recent recovery in Altcoin Market Cap is much sharper than the post-retrace recovery in February,” popular Twitter account Rekt Capital commented on Tuesday, comparing different retracements in 2021.Unsubstantiated rumors that Facebook would announce a BTC allocation in its quarterly earnings due later on the day provided some bullish counterpoint to the mood.

315,"Amid growing concerns over the energy sector in Kyrgyzstan, a former government official has argued that cryptocurrency mining is a major factor driving the energy crisis.Daniyar Akmatov, former director of the state investment protection organization, the Investment Promotion and Protection Agency, addressed the challenges in Kyrgyzstan’s energy sector at a roundtable in Bishkek, local news agency Tazabek reported on Wednesday.The former official said that crypto mining is causing issues for the country’s energy sector, alongside other factors like the devaluation of the Kyrgyz som and poor promotion of energy investment.“Consumption of electricity due to cryptocurrency mining has increased and this has led to an energy crisis,” Akmatov said, adding: “The som is depreciating because of the rise in the dollar exchange rate, and Kyrgyzstan is an import-dependent country and tariffs also depend on it.”Kyrgyzstan President Sadyr Japarov recently proposed raising household tariffs for electricity as a way to address the ongoing energy shortage. Japarov said that local power companies are 129 billion soms ($1.5 billion) in debt, and he claimed that the country’s core power infrastructure has been outdated for years due to corruption among top state officials. Kyrgyzstan has sought to regulate crypto mining activities in the country but is yet to adopt any concrete regulations.Other countries have also blamed Bitcoin (BTC) mining for the energy shortages. Abkhazia has experienced an electricity crunch reportedly due to the 625 crypto mining farms that call the small autonomous region home."
316,"Crypto data aggregator CoinMetrics has compiled a list of 100 insights into the recent performance of the digital asset markets — and the figures add up to a very bullish picture for the ecosystem. Released to celebrate the 100th issue of its “State of the Network” report, the list notes that a $100 investment made into Dogecoin (DOGE) 100 days ago would be worth $2,742 today — outperforming the same $100 investment in Bitcoin (BTC) (which would be valued at $135 today), Ether (ETH) ($186), and Uniswap (UNI) ($401).The report states that Bitcoin has seen $14.5 billion worth of “trusted trading volume” in 100 days, alongside $6.1 billion worth Ether, $2.4 billion worth of XRP, $2.3 billion worth of DOGE, and $1.3 billion worth of Cardano (ADA) over the same period. When looking at recently active addresses, veteran networks appear to still be the most popular — with nearly 611,000 active daily Ethereum addresses over the past 100 days and 1.12 million active Bitcoin wallets. Bitcoin set a new record for daily activity on April 14 with 1.36 million wallets engaging with the network.Over the past 100 days, a total of 1.4 million addresses have engaged with the top DeFi protocols — Uniswap, Aave, Compound, MakerDAO and Synthetix — while the Litecoin network has hosted 24.4 million active wallets.Users are paying to access the Ethereum mainnet at an accelerated pace, with $2.3 billion of the $3.17 billion in total fees that have ever been generated by Ethereum, having been recorded since the start of 2021. By contrast, Bitcoin has generated roughly $2 billion in fees over the network’s lifetime.The average Bitcoin transaction fee was $20.68 over the past 100 days, while Ethereum transactions averaged $16.68 over the same period. Bitcoin’s average transaction size of $30,000 has been almost double Ethereum’s $15,660 since the start of 2021.Despite Ethereum’s impending transition to proof-of-stake, Ethereum’s hash rate has grown at 4.5 times the rate of Bitcoin since the start of the year, with Ethereum up 89%, while Bitcoin’s hashing power has increased by 20%.The report also notes the surging popularity of stablecoins, with Tether’s (USDT) supply on Ethereum increasing from 13.5 billion to 24.4 billion this year. However, that was outshone by the amount of USDT on Tron, which grew from 6.8 billion to 26 billion. USD Coin (USDC) expanded 234%, from 4.1 billion to 13.7 billion, and circulating Dai was up 192%, from 1.2 billion to 3.5 billion, since the start of the year.“It took about 2.5 years for stablecoin supply to grow from 1B to 10B. It took less than a year to grow from 10B to over 75B,” CoinMetrics wrote, adding:"
317,"The much-hyped NFT sale by popular talk show host Ellen DeGeneres has fallen flat, with the comedian selling just five out of 10 available Gold editions of her “Woman With Stick Cat” nonfungible token for $2,500 on the Bitski platform. Another 64 people paid $100 each for an open Silver edition of the same NFT.The drawing appears to have been created with minimal effort in a bid to satirize the notion that any old celebrity-peddled junk will sell as an NFT.A Platinum video monologue about NFTs by DeGeneres fetched the highest price — $14,555. In total, the sale has raised just $33,455 for the World Central Kitchen food relief charity — even after being promoted on her nationwide talk show and to her 79 million followers on Twitter. But perhaps it was just the wrong audience.While there was a backlash in some quarters of the crypto community against the sale, any mainstream publicity for NFTs is good publicity, right?How about we all just agree nobody bids on this ?

Not even 0.001 ETH https://t.co/4YjNAwnub7Lending further weight to the idea that NFT investors are getting a little more choosy, the “world’s first founding charity NFT,” Covid:aid, remains without a bid one week after opening the bidding.Covid:aid aims to support those affected by the pandemic, and whoever buys the NFT — an image of the new charity’s logo — will also receive the coveted title of “Covid:aid Founding Crypto Philanthropist.” Originally listed at a reserve price of 1 Ether (ETH) on April 21, the reserve was dropped to 0.1 ETH the following day, but is yet to attract a bid.The Golden State Warriors have become the first professional sports team to release its own NFT collection on OpenSea. Up for auction this week, the Legacy Collection includes tokenized championship rings and ticket stubs from iconic games dating back to 1947, as well as NFTs including some IRL experiences. The team’s interest in the space was reportedly sparked by the success of NBA Top Shot, which has made half a billion dollars in sales since launching.Rare sneaker platform Rares.io snapped up Kanye West’s 2008 Nike Air Yeezy 1 sneakers at a Sotheby’s auction on Monday for a cool $1.8 million, making them the most expensive sneakers in history. Rares.io announced plans to fractionalize them and sell the shares to the “the sneaker community.”However, it does not appear as if the sneakers will be tokenized as NFTs — Rares’ terms and conditions do not mention digital assets, and the company’s Crunchbase profile talks about selling shares in sneakers through an app via an initial public offering. Various non-crypto fractionalized asset sites have sprung up in recent years, showing the concept is not unique to NFTs.The artist behind a surprisingly controversial Oscars NFT dedicated to the late Chadwick Boseman has apologized and vowed to make changes. Andre Oshea was commissioned by the Academy to create the artwork, which many viewers apparently took as a sure sign Boseman was going to win Best Actor… but, of course, he was beaten by Anthony Hopkins.The NFT was criticized for its environmental impact, the fact only 50% of the proceeds were going to charity, and for “trying to capitalize both on the tragedy of Boseman’s death and the current speculative interest in NFTs,” according to Gizmodo Australia. Some took the artist to task for listing the NFT for $1.2 million since Oshea had only spent $50 to purchase the 3D model of Boseman’s head, which the NFT was based on. The artist released a statement on Tuesday apologizing for “any upset caused”:This past week has been a huge learning experience for me, and I appreciate all of the feedback on my work, especially from my friends and family.

318,"Major Japanese game developer Nexon has become the latest publicly listed firm to make a significant investment into Bitcoin (BTC).On Wednesday, Nexon announced it had purchased 1,717 BTC for roughly $100 million at an average price of $58,226 each after fees. The firm noted the investment represents less than 2% of its “total cash and cash equivalents on hand.” Owen Mahoney, president and CEO of Nexon, stated:Mahoney added that Bitcoin is a “form of cash likely to retain its value, even if it is not yet widely recognized as such.”Nexon’s investment follows a wave of large Bitcoin allocations from globally leading firms, with MicroStrategy kicking off the trend in August 2020 when it purchased 21,000 BTC for $250 million, followed by Square with a $50-million buy in October, and Tesla with a $1.5-billion investment at the end of 2020.According to Bitcoin Treasuries, 35 publicly traded companies currently hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets.Founded in 1994, Nexon describes itself as producing, developing and operating online games and virtual worlds. The firm went public on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in December 2011 and currently operates more than 50 online games that can be played in more than 190 countries.Nexon is not the first major Japanese firm to embrace crypto, with the country passing laws recognizing digital assets as legal currency in 2016.Later that same year, top financial services firm SBI announced plans to launch a bank-backed digital currency exchange, following investments in Ripple and local trading platform bitFlyer. Japan’s GMO Internet Group also announced a $3-million investment into Bitcoin mining in 2017."
319,"The overall cryptocurrency market saw a second day of gains on Tuesday after the weekend sell-off proved to be a good buying opportunity for retail and institutional investors.Lower gas fees following the Ethereum network’s Berlin upgrade along with an increase in institutional buying and decentralized finance activity lifted the price of Ether to a new all-time high at $2,680.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that Bitcoin (BTC) climbed above $54,000 in the early trading hours on Tuesday, and bulls are now aiming to break through the $55,000 resistance level for a possible rally to $58,000.With Ether and altcoins showing signs of strength and BTC remains range-bound, there is increasing chatter on Crypto Twitter as traders speculate on whether an altcoin season is on the verge of starting.As highlighted in a recent report from Ben Lilly, co-founder and analyst at Jarvis Labs, the strong 11.5% rally on Monday is similar to previous recoveries in the price of BTC following a bottom.The purple lines on the chart above represent the “lows in Bitcoin futures annualized one month rolling basis,” which Lilly points out to highlight a possible signal that a price breakout could be ahead.Lilly said:Several altcoins saw their prices reach new record highs alongside Ether on Tuesday.Polygon (MATIC) continued its strong rally, moving as high as $0.75 before taking what appears to be a short breather. Uniswap (UNI) also saw its token price reach a record high at $40.50 following a 17% rally from the lows on Monday.The overall cryptocurrency market capitalization now stands at $2.08 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 49.5%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

320,"Bitcoin (BTC) extended its relief rally on Tuesday and reclaimed a market capitalization above $1 trillion.While many traders panicked during Bitcoin’s recent fall below $47,000, fund manager Dan Tapiero said that he spotted a rare TD sequential buy signal during the low. The last time this signal was seen was in March 2020 when Bitcoin price traded near $3,600. Tapiero believes Bitcoin remains on target to reach $100,000 this year.However, even after the recent rise above $55,000, Bitcoin’s market dominance continues to lag at 49.5%, according to CoinMarketCap data. This shows that crypto investors are focusing on altcoins, with several hitting new all-time highs.The altcoin season is not entirely driven by retail investors. A recent report by crypto investment advisory firm Two Prime Digital Assets highlights that the eightyfold growth in Ether (ETH) options open interest, from $50 million to $4 billion in a year, points toward hedging by institutional money managers to protect their ""net long portfolios against outsized volatility events.” Even the Ether futures market has increased by 20, cementing the involvement of institutional investors.Keeping the focus on altcoins, let’s study the fundamentals and technicals of three tokens that have done well in the past few days.Many crypto enthusiasts are interested in investing in digital assets, but they do not have the required trading experience. Therefore, they miss several opportunities or end up leaving money on the table. Others work full time and, therefore, cannot devote time to trading. For such investors, a well-devised algorithmic trading product could be suitable, but it comes with its own risk.Waves launched a new algorithmic trading investment product called ""Lambo Investments"" on April 15. The protocol's exchange platform announced it would give away a Lamborghini Huracan to a random investor in the product, which could have lured traders.Along with decentralized finance (DeFi) and algorithmic trading, Waves has also made a splash in the nonfungible tokens (NFTs) sector. While the overall NFT craze has subsided, select investors continue to focus on them. The first Waves Duck NFT, called ""Perfection,"" was sold for 1 million Neutrino USD (USDN) — an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar and collateralized by the native Waves token, WAVES — on Sign Art on April 12.To further boost growth, Waves founder and CEO Sasha Ivanov recently laid out ambitious plans to reach $10 billion in total value locked by October and average 10 million daily transactions by February 2022. Traders are likely to keep a close watch on the developments, which could decide the level of investors' interest in the project.WAVES rallied from an intraday low of $11.09 on April 23 to an all-time high of $21.09 on April 27, a 90% gain in five days. However, the long wick on April 27’s candlestick suggests profit-booking at higher levels.The WAVES/USDT pair could give back some of its gains and drop to the $16–$17 zone. If the bulls can flip this zone into support, it will suggest that sentiment remains positive and traders are accumulating on dips.The 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) of $14.64 has started to rise, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive zone, indicating the path of least resistance is to the upside.A strong bounce off the support zone could result in a retest of $21.09. If buyers can drive the price above this resistance, the pair could resume its uptrend and reach $25.This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the price down to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $12.65.Injective Protocol recently announced that it secured $10 million in funding from several investors, including Pantera Capital and billionaire Mark Cuban, for its DeFi protocol, which is alleged to have the best of both centralized and decentralized exchanges. Injective’s aim is to build a decentralized competitor to Robinhood.On the development front, the protocol announced on April 15 that it had achieved “Trezor support for the EIP-712 signature standard,” which will allow Trezor users to access Ethereum-based applications.Injective has been partnering with several blockchains to improve the experience for its users. Thus far in April, it has announced collaborations with API3, Harmony, Staked, Litentry, Persistence, Big Data Protocol and Klaytn.Additionally, periodic token drops in Equinox Staking may have been an added attraction to the investors.Injective's native token, INJ, rose from $10.91 on April 20 to an all-time high at $21.55 on April 22, recording a 97% increase in three days. The bulls could not sustain even higher levels on April 20, as seen from the long wick on the candlestick.This encouraged the bears, who tried to trap the bulls and start a correction. However, the buyers purchased the dip to the 50-day SMA ($13.40) on April 23 and defended the 20-day EMA ($15.26) on April 23. This suggests that the sentiment remains positive and the bulls are accumulating on dips.The buying momentum picked up on April 26, and the bulls cleared the first hurdle at $18.15. If the bulls can sustain the price above $18.15, the INJ/USDT pair could rise to $21.55. A break above this resistance could start the next leg of an up-move that may reach $26.44.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears pull the price below $18.15, a drop to the 20-day EMA is likely. A break below this support would signal that the momentum has weakened, and the pair may drop to the 50-day SMA.CELO was previously featured on Cointelegraph on Jan. 26 when its price was $3.24. From there, the token rallied to an all-time high of $7.23 on April 21, a 123% rally in just under three months.Celo announced on April 20 that Deutsche Telekom made a “significant purchase” of CELO tokens through its strategic investment fund, Telekom Innovation Pool. Although the size of the investment was not disclosed, it is likely to be a major sentiment booster for the token.A new gas-efficient bridging standard dubbed ""Optics,"" connecting Celo to Ethereum, was announced on April 21. This is the first step toward building an open, connected blockchain ecosystem, which eventually will include Cosmos, Polkadot and others.The payments platform announced the launch of the stablecoin Celo Euro (cEUR) on the mainnet on April 22. This is the second stablecoin, after Celo Dollar (cUSD) — which was launched on Celo in June 2020. This increases the user base for Celo users who want to send or receive money from relatives and friends.CELO has been consolidating between $3.50 and $5.76 for the past few days. The bears pushed the price below the support of the range on March 25, but the bulls reclaimed the level on March 26, indicating buying at lower levels.The sharp rally on April 20 and 21 propelled the price above the overhead resistance of the range, but the bulls have not been able to consolidate their advantage. The bears pulled the price back into the range on April 22.Although the CELO/USDT pair broke below the 20-day EMA ($5.01) on April 23, the bulls purchased the dip to the 50-day SMA ($4.39). The buying momentum picked up again, and the bulls cleared the $5.76 hurdle on April 25 but could not sustain the breakout.The Doji candlestick pattern on April 26 and the inside day candlestick pattern on April 27 suggest uncertainty among the bulls and the bears. If the bulls sustain the price above $5.76, a retest of $7.23 may be in the cards. A breakout of this resistance could result in a rally to $8.02.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the pair could remain range-bound for a few more days.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

321,"Bitcoin (BTC) is riding high on the back of a “very low and healthy” indicator, according to one market analyst, which could propel it to a key resistance level at $58,000.In a tweet on Tuesday, analyst Lex Moskovski noted that futures funding rates are suggesting this week’s BTC price run has been completely organic. Funding rates are a popular metric for measuring the health of BTC price movements. They essentially show which traders are on the right side of the bet (long or short) — a high funding rate on a platform means longs are “paying” shorts, while low funding rates imply the opposite.Negative rates are what analysts look for when determining if any upside is likely to endure or is due in the short term.Currently, conditions are right — the move up to $55,000 was likely not fueled by speculative trading action, said Moskovski.“Funding is very low and healthy,” he wrote.How high BTC/USD could go and still remain sustainable is Tuesday’s topic of debate among technical observers. For Sven Henrich, creator of analysis firm NorthmanTrader, key Fibonacci levels, in particular, are worth eyeing.Specifically, the 0.618 Fibonacci level, as ever a source of support and resistance aims, now sits at just above $58,000 — also the site of a Bitcoin all-time high from February, which held for multiple weeks.Henrich and popular Twitter account Rekt Capital, meanwhile, highlighted moving averages and a 76-day technical uptrend as key to determining support. These have contained BTC/USD throughout recent price dips, with the 100-day and 21-week figures regarded as a line in the sand for bulls.“Price pulled back towards it on the retrace but in the end didn’t actually touch it. It didn’t have to,” Rekt Capital commented about the 76-day trend.Both perspectives indicate that beyond the short term, Bitcoin has not crossed any red lines, which could spell the end of its bull run.

322,"No fewer than 47 companies have cited the term “inflation” in their earnings calls for Q1 2021.According to a report by financial market data provider FactSet on Monday, the figure represents the highest number of companies to do so in the last decade.Earlier in April, the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics released its “Producer Price Index” report showing a 4.2% year-on-year increase in PPI, the highest since September 2011.While Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell continues to argue that current inflation and consumer price index numbers are only temporary, there is a counter-argument that businesses will move to transfer the burden of greater production costs to their consumers.Meanwhile, companies may also be seeking ways to protect their cash reserves from U.S. dollar debasement following the nearly $6 trillion in stimulus money poured into the U.S. economy over the course of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.Back in August 2020, business intelligence outfit MicroStrategy made headlines when it announced its first Bitcoin (BTC) purchase. Michael Saylor’s firm now holds over 90,000 BTC valued at more than $5 billion, with the asset up almost five-fold since August 2020.On Monday, Tesla announced the sale of $272 million worth of Bitcoin — about 10% of its BTC holdings — in the company’s Q1 financial report. According to Tesla’s Q1 2021 earnings call, the electronic vehicle maker netted $101 million in net profit from the sale.Tesla first revealed its BTC ownership back in February, announcing that it has purchased about $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin.With inflation expected to continue in its upward trajectory at least in the short term, more U.S. companies might convert some of their cash reserves to Bitcoin. This likelihood is despite arguments to the contrary made by treasury experts back in February.Back in March, Dawn Fitzpatrick, chief investment officer of Soros Fund Management, said that BTC was no longer a fringe asset on account of U.S. dollar debasement."
323,"New York cryptocurrency exchange Gemini announced on Tuesday the pending release of the Gemini Credit Card, which will allow cardholders to receive cashback rewards in the form of Bitcoin (BTC) or any other cryptocurrency available on the Gemini platform.The credit card will be released in conjunction with Mastercard and will be issued by online banking institution WebBank. It is expected to be released this coming summer and has reportedly received over 140,000 sign-ups from waiting customers already, according to the company’s press release.Gemini joins major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Coinbase in launching a crypto credit card. The Gemini card will reportedly offer users 3% cashback on dining purchases, 2% on groceries and 1% on other purchases. The rewards will reportedly be paid back to the user in real-time, at the very moment the transaction takes place.The president of Mastercard’s North American operations, Linda Kirkpatrick, said the financial services firm was happy to provide more choices for customers by enabling cryptocurrency payments and rewards.“Our work with Gemini builds upon this position, connecting consumer needs with next-generation assets and delivering a ground-breaking experience that redefines the future of card rewards and benefits,” she said.Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss said crypto credit cards were a good way to give users a point of entry to the cryptocurrency space without them having to alter their existing spending habits.“As more consumers look to enter the crypto ecosystem, the Gemini Credit Card gives them an easy point of entry and an effortless way to earn crypto as a reward without changing their daily spending habits,” said Winklevoss.“Mastercard continues to evolve and meet both industry and consumer demands and commit to the crypto space. We’re excited to partner with them on our first real-time crypto rewards card, further helping to bring crypto mainstream,” he added."
324,"Iran is continuing to explore the potential use of cryptocurrency as a tool for mitigating the devastating impact of economic sanctions imposed by the United States. According to a report from the English-language Iranian economic news source Financial Tribune, the Central Bank of Iran, or CBI, is authorizing banks and licensed forex shops to use cryptocurrency as payments for imports.Under its regulatory framework, the cryptocurrency must derive from licensed crypto miners only. These mining operations are officially permitted by the Iranian state as an industrial activity and require operators to secure a license from the Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade. As Financial Tribune reports, the Iranian government ratified regulations that would enable crypto to be used legally for imports in October 2020, provided that miners sell their coins directly to the CBI. Indeed, the strategy appears to have been several years in the making, with a 2018 report from Iranian think tank Majlis Research Center stating:In January of this year, Shahab Javanmardi, a member of the Iran Chamber of Commerce Industries Mining and Agriculture, advocated for the government to use cryptocurrency to help counter trade difficulties in a tough geopolitical climate. Venezuela, another country hit by U.S. sanctions, provides an example of a prior attempt to use cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) as payment for imports from Iran and Turkey. Javanmardi reportedly said:Javanmardi proposed creating a central market, similar to the secondary forex market, through which officially mined cryptocurrency could be sold to Iranian firms seeking to import materials, machinery and other goods. Sajed Nikpour, a member of the ICCIMA commission for promoting non-oil exports, is cited as saying that the private sector believes cryptocurrency’s usefulness for the Iranian economy applies to the trade sector and could facilitate a boost to domestic production by enabling imports of raw materials. Nikpour has stressed the need to keep such measures transparent. As reported back in September 2020, private sector representatives have also been appealing to CBI to approve the use of Bitcoin to pay for car imports on Kish Island.Despite being encouraged by the authorities, Iran’s crypto mining industry has nonetheless had a turbulent couple of years. Illegal farms have been shut down en masse, and local authorities rushed to blame the mining sector for disruptive power outages in January of this year, which experts critiqued at the time as an ill-judged strategy of deflection and scapegoating."
325,"Indonesia’s Commodity Futures Trade Regulatory Agency, also known as Bappebti, is considering levying a tax on all cryptocurrency transactions taking place on regulated exchanges within the country.Currently, 13 cryptocurrency exchanges fall under Bappebti’s regulatory oversight, and the tax would be automatically applied by these platforms should it be approved, according to a report by The Phnom Penh Post.“It is currently [undergoing] internal review at Bappebti, then we will coordinate with the BKF,” said Sidharta Utama, head of Bappebti, adding that the actual tax rate had not yet been decided. The BKF refers to Indonesia’s Fiscal Policy Agency.Regulatory activity in Indonesia surged during the past six months as Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider cryptocurrency market soared to new all-time highs. In December 2020, Bappebti issued regulation recognizing an initial 229 cryptocurrencies as legally tradable commodities, while leaving the door open for traders to suggest adding new coins to the list. In February, the agency identified 13 trading platforms that it recognized as licensed entities.Indonesia originally warned against the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment in 2014 and, by 2017, had introduced legislation that demanded fintech companies register with the Bank of Indonesia to ensure they weren’t using cryptocurrencies in payment systems.Chairman of the Indonesian Crypto Asset Traders Association, Teguh Kurniawan said the group he represents proposed a tax rate of 0.05%, adding that a high tax rate could push people toward illegal channels when purchasing cryptocurrencies.“To date, there has been no feedback on the type of tax. We hope the tax rate will not be too high, [or] we fear that investors may turn to investing in crypto [assets] through illegal channels, which would be harmful,” said Kurniawan."
326,"Amid the growing opposition to the new cryptocurrency tax regime in South Korea, finance minister Hong Nam-ki confirmed that the government will begin taxing capital gains from crypto trading starting next year.“It’s inevitable, we will need to impose taxes on gains from trading of virtual assets,” the minister said when asked whether the tax should be delayed until the state has proper industry oversight in place, Reuters reported Tuesday.Hong emphasized that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) will be taxed as “intangible assets,” noting that it was a “misunderstanding” to view them as currencies. The minister also warned that crypto trading is vulnerable to new forms of illegal fundraising and fraud, calling on investors to stay vigilant when making investment choices.As previously reported, South Korean lawmakers initially discussed a 20% capital gains on crypto trading in July 2020, proposing that any annual gains of more than 2.5 million won ($2,200) would be subject to the tax starting October 2020. In late 2020, the South Korean government officially postponed a new tax regime on crypto gains until 2022, facing major criticism and pushback over the proposed crypto tax from local crypto lobbyists.Indeed, South Korean prime minister nominee Kim Boo-kyum recently promised to look into the crypto tax regime to make sure traders get fair treatment under the law."
327,"Bitcoin (BTC) is still on course to hit $100,000 this year, and its recent dip is “unchanged price action.”That was the conclusion of one of the industry’s best-known investors as BTC/USD recovered from its trip to near $46,000.In a tweet on Tuesday, fund manager Dan Tapiero revealed that he had been “inundated” with concerned clients over Bitcoin’s recent price dip. There was, however, no need to panic.Highlighting a technical (TD sequential) buy signal not seen since the March 2020 crash to $3,600, Tapiero gave hope to those wondering what became of the myriad sky-high BTC price predictions for 2021.“A very rare td buy signal in Bitcoin. Last one came right at the March '20 low. Still see 100k this yr,” he wrote.The comments came in tandem with a curious exchange between Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and popular trader Dave Portnoy, the latter a famous Bitcoin skeptic who nonetheless caved in to pressure to add it to his portfolio earlier this year.When it became known that Tesla had sold a portion of its holdings, Portnoy took this as proof of the company’s lack of belief in its long-term viability. Musk denied this and claimed that it was in fact a test of its utility.“I have not sold any of my Bitcoin,” part of a Twitter response read.No, you do not. I have not sold any of my Bitcoin. Tesla sold 10% of its holdings essentially to prove liquidity of Bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on balance sheet.Musk is a classic source for short-term Bitcoin price movements, and any admission that he had permanently divested himself of his allocation could have easily skewed sentiment to the downside.In the event, BTC/USD returned to levels near $55,000, making gains of almost 10% since the start of the weekend in what could be another classic “Elon candle” move.“Bitcoin hodl confirmed,” Blockstream CEO Adam Back commented on the Twitter exchange.Tesla itself reported record profits this week.As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin’s underlying fundamentals very much suggest “business as usual” for the largest cryptocurrency despite the recent upheaval.Changes in circumstances for miners, one of the likely triggers for the price dip, were already being accounted for on Monday, and weak-handed traders betting on more downside were getting liquidated."
328,"Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has taken to Twitter to assure the crypto community that he has not sold any of his personal BTC stash despite his company Tesla realizing profits from its recent Bitcoin (BTC) buys.Musk’s comments came in response to accusations from comedian Dave Portnoy that the Tesla CEO had profited from a Bitcoin pump-and-dump engineered through his public statements supporting the cryptocurrency.Rejecting Portnoy’s assertion, Musk stated that “Tesla sold 10% of its holdings essentially to prove liquidity of Bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on balance sheet,” adding:No, you do not. I have not sold any of my Bitcoin. Tesla sold 10% of its holdings essentially to prove liquidity of Bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on balance sheet.As reported by Cointelegraph, Tesla sold a portion of its Bitcoin holdings in the first quarter of 2021, generating net proceeds of $272 million.In February this year, the company catalyzed the crypto market bull run after disclosing a strategic acquisition of $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin — worth 7.7% of its gross cash position at the time.During the same month, Tesla also announced it would begin accepting BTC payments for its cars, emphasizing that it will store the funds in Bitcoin rather than convert them into cash.Musk has typically shied away from disclosing how much Bitcoin he holds personally, but his latest tweet suggests he is reluctant to sell it.At the time of writing, BTC has gained 3% over the past 24 hours to trade at $53,600, according to CoinGecko."
329,"Cryptocurrency investors breathed a sigh of relief on April 26 as the sharp reversal in the price of Bitcoin (BTC) was accompanied by a marketwide recovery that has a majority of altcoins seeing green. It's likely that the breakout was aided by bullish assessments from JPMorgan Chase analysts and PayPal's announcement that demand for purchasing cryptocurrencies had surpassed expectations. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that after bouncing off a low near $47,000, Bitcoin roared back above the $50,000 support level and climbed above $53,500, while Ether (ETH) reclaimed $2,500.Last week’s market pullback did little to slow the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, as stories like NFL draft prospect Trevor Lawrence signing an endorsement deal with crypto portfolio-tracking platform Blockfolio and hotels in Nigeria announcing plans to accept Bitcoin as payment emerge on a daily basis.Data from Glassnode shows that on-chain transfer volume and the average transaction fees for the Bitcoin network hit new all-time highs in the previous week as the network continues to recover from mempool congestion due to the drop in hash rate that occurred as the result of a power outage in China.Analysis of the spent output age bands, which detail how long BTC has been sitting in a wallet, indicates that newer tokenholders were shaken out by the recent dip, while wallets that have been holding longer than one month saw a decline in transaction activity.The data also shows that wallets that have been holding for longer than six months have not seen a notable increase in spending since the market pullback in February.Further bullishness can be found when looking at miner accumulation, which is at its highest level since mid-2018, according to Glassnode.Overall, analysis shows that it was the newer hands in the market that were shaken out by last week's correction, while the more experienced crypto traders were happy to accumulate BTC from those worried about a further price drop.Bitcoin’s struggles over the past week have allowed altcoins to step forward and gain market share, with a number of coins breaking out to new all-time highs and trading volume on decentralized exchanges on the uptrend.The Ethereum-based decentralized finance lending platform Compound's COMP token spiked 17% overnight to reach a new record high at $671 while the layer-two solution Polygon's MATIC token surged 68% to a new all-time high at $0.576.The Solana-based decentralized exchange Serum saw its native SRM token price break out to a new high at $11.47 thanks to increased activity on the Solana blockchain network.Solana price gained over 120% in the past week and reached a new high of $48.46 on April 25 as its ecosystem continues to expand and new projects launch on this layer-one Ethereum competitor.The overall cryptocurrency market capitalization now stands at $2.004 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 50.3%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and you should conduct your own research when making a decision."
330,"Following major sell-offs in cryptocurrency markets amid reports of United States President Joe Biden's capital gains tax rise proposal last week, the Biden administration defended nearly doubling tax levies for only the “very, very richest.”A senior Biden administration official claimed that only 0.3% of taxpayers in the U.S. would be affected by higher levies on their investments under the new capital tax plan.“There’s increasing evidence that over recent years in fact many, many of the returns at the very top are what they call above-market rates of return, rents and so on. Taxing the people who are doing extremely well in the economy is one way of asking somewhat more from that,” the Biden administration official said in a Monday interview with the Financial Times.Under Biden’s plan, the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals will rise to 39.6% from the current base rate of 20%. For those earning $1 million or more, the new top rate will be accompanied by an existing surtax, bringing the U.S. capital gains and dividends tax rate to 43.4%.The Biden administration official noted that the new plan is consistent with Biden’s campaign stance, “which was that we needed to fundamentally reform parts of the code that affect the very, very richest or very highest income Americans.”Both crypto markets and U.S. stocks experienced major sell-offs following Biden’s proposal amid growing speculation and FUD — feat, uncertainty and doubt — that investors would sell shares before the higher tax rate is adopted. Bitcoin (BTC) faced heavy selling pressure, leading to its price dropping below the $50,000 support level on Friday, touching a low of $47,500. The U.S. stock market also saw major losses Thursday before quickly bouncing back.Some investors, including billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper, criticized the new tax plan. A prominent crypto advocate, Draper argued that a 43.4% capital gains tax “might kill the golden goose that is America,” with California taxes potentially landing at 56.4%, which “spells death to job creation.” According to the investor, Bitcoin could potentially become a haven for concerned investors. “The antidote for oppressive government and runaway taxes is....Bitcoin,” Draper wrote in a tweet Thursday.Graham Newhall, the communications advisor at the Blockchain Association, told Cointelegraph that the organization supports the perspective that a rate of 28% would be the revenue-maximizing level, as per the Congressional Budget Office. “Any higher than that and it may force investors to hold their assets longer than they might have planned,” he noted, stating:Brett Cotler, an attorney in taxation and blockchain practices at law firm Seward & Kissel, suggested that certain types of crypto-related income might not be affected by the proposed capital gains rise at all. “Many crypto traders trade with such high frequency or turnover that a predominant portion of their trading gains are short-term capital gains, taxed at the higher ordinary income tax rates. Any change in capital gains taxation should not affect these activities,” he noted.However, crypto investors that hold for over one year and who would be subject to the higher capital gains tax rates could be affected, Cotler said. The attorney suggested that there are many ways that taxpayers can mitigate their capital gains tax including crypto investment through tax advantaged accounts like retirement accounts, health savings accounts and others. Founders of startups could also benefit by structuring their businesses as “qualified small business corporations”, Cotler stated."
331,"Bitcoin (BTC) might have recovered from the $47,000 low seen on April 25, but the subsequent 15% bounce was not enough to bring optimism to the BTC options markets. Even at the present $54,000 level, the price remains 17% below the $64,900 all-time high reached on April 14.The popular Crypto Fear & Greed Index reached its lowest level in 12 months, signaling thatinvestors are closer to ""extreme fear,"" which is a complete reversal from the ""extreme greed"" level seen on April 18. This indicator gathers data from price volatility, volume change, social media activity, Bitcoin dominance and recent search trends.As Bitcoin's price dropped and then recovered, the more experienced whales and arbitrage desks behind options trading were far from panicking, but their main risk gauge has recently hit a 12-month peak. However, despite these ""worsening"" conditions, these pro traders are neutral both in skew metrics (options pricing) and the put-to-call ratio (risk exposure).Call options give the buyer the right to acquire BTC at a future date for a fixed price, while the seller is obliged to honor this privilege. For this right, the buyer pays an upfront fee (premium) to the counterparty. Call options are deemed neutral-to-bullish, as they give its buyer the possibility of high leverage with a little upfront investment.On the other hand, put options provide their buyer a hedge, or protection, from negative price swings. As a result, these are widely used in neutral-to-bearish strategies.As the above chart indicates, both call and put options are balanced, except for Friday's expiry. Although this could reflect short-term optimism, a more granular view shows that some ultra-bullish call options dominate the scene. Therefore, by adjusting it to a more realistic price range for the next four days, calls and puts are way more balanced.Take notice of how the $72,000–$120,000 call options dominate the April 30 expiry. Therefore, considering the $44,000–$68,000 range exclusively, calls represent 48% of the outstanding open interest.To correctly interpret how professional traders are balancing the risks of unexpected market moves, the 25% delta skew provides a reliable, instant ""fear and greed"" analysis.This indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options side by side and will turn negative when the neutral-to-bearish put options premium is higher than similar-risk call options. This situation is usually considered a ""fear"" scenario.On the other hand, a negative skew translates to a higher cost of upside protection, which is generally interpreted as a ""greed"" measurement.For the first time in 2021, the 25% delta skew has flattened after spending most of the time on the ""greed"" side. A similar situation emerged on March 25 after BTC corrected 18% from the $61,800 peak 10 days prior.Overall, the options markets indicators are neutral, indicating a mild lack of trust in the recent $47,000 bounce. On the other hand, the same metrics could be interpreted as positive, considering pro traders did not flip bearish despite the 28% drop in the past 11 days.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
332,"Eric Weinstein, managing director of Thiel Capital and host of the popular podcast The Portal, urged his followers over the weekend not to get caught up in Bitcoin’s (BTC) daily fluctuations. He seemed to feel that it was wiser to focus on the cryptocurrency’s ability to hedge against currency debasement at the hands of central banks.Bitcoin and other “hard-money” assets like gold and silver could be sound alternatives to the “disguised actions” of central banks, Weinstein tweeted to his nearly 485,000 followers. “Figuring out how we hedge against central bankers printing and devaluing fiat currency remains our upcoming rendezvous with the market,” he said, adding:He continued:We will need to go short the talent, ethics and skill of macro economists, central bankers, investment bankers and financiers.

Gold isn’t perfect. Neither is BTC.

But we must beware the printing press and calls for relief, easing and stimulus are cries for transfer & dilution.When Weinstein tweeted the message, Bitcoin was trading at $48,662.20. It would eventually bottom around $47,000 before rebounding sharply to a price of $54,200 on Monday.Bitcoin’s role as a deflationary hedge is disputed within mainstream investment circles, although there appears to be an acknowledgment that the digital asset is encroaching on gold’s market share. Bitcoin’s value has not only appreciated in dollar terms but also when priced in bullion. As Cointelegraph reported last month, BTC's price against gold increased nearly sevenfold between October 2020 and March 2021.Weinstein previously described himself as “not a Bitcoiner,” adding that he has “contributed nothing to the vision of distributed computing.” However, he’s urged Bitcoiners to stop measuring their wealth in dollar terms and to instead focus on a higher goal. His views about the crumbling nature of fiat add credence to that view. "
333,"Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto left the cryptocurrency community with a parting message exactly one decade ago today: “I’ve moved on to other things.” In the years since, Bitcoin (BTC) has evolved from an obscure, esoteric project to a trillion-dollar financial asset drawing attention from governments, financial institutions, corporations and investors. Despite dozens of plausible theories, Nakamoto’s identity remains elusive, and their estimated stash of 1 million BTC remains unmoved.With a current BTC price of around $54,000, Nakamoto’s projected fortune is roughly $54 billion. As Cointelegraph recently speculated, a BTC price of $182,000 — considered probable by many crypto enthusiasts — would make Nakamoto the world’s richest person. Bitcoin's price peaked above $64,000 earlier this month before correcting lower.The mystery surrounding Nakamoto was the subject of a March Cointelegraph Brasil interview with Dustin D. Trammell, one of the first cypherpunks to mine the digital currency. In that interview, Trammell speculated that it was unlikely Nakamoto worked on an e-cash protocol before Bitcoin, given their “lack of bias” in implementing new technology.He explained:Although Bitcoin has yet to live up to all the tenants of Nakamoto’s original 2008 white paper, its proven monetary policy has made it an attractive store of value. For now, the narrative surrounding Bitcoin being an immutable “digital gold” is resonating with mainstream investors.It’s not entirely clear whether Nakamoto will ever resurface — or whether they’re still alive, for that matter — but the cryptocurrency community has come to terms with the founder’s anonymity. Nakamoto’s work spawned the widespread adoption of blockchain technology under a new ethos of decentralization. That ethos was recently on display in the Cointelegraph Top 100, with crypto's most influential person being ""all of us"" who are contributing to a more decentralized world:"
334,"Bitcoin price started the week off with a strong move that propelled the price above $50,000 and at the time of writing, bulls are in pursuit of the $55,000 level. On April 21, JPMorgan analysts wrote that the liquidity in the cryptocurrency markets is likely to recover sharply after the recent sell-off in Bitcoin (BTC). According to the analysts, “the worst of the liquidations” could be over “suggesting little overhang to work through.”Another bullish sign was shown by the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which quickly dipped from greed in the last week to fear on April 25, indicating that exuberant high leverage traders had likely been washed out. This reset also gave an opportunity for larger-size investors to buy at lower levels.Today's breakout seems to have caught the aggressive bears napping, which resulted in the liquidation of $150 million in shorts, according to Moskovski Capital chief investment officer Lex Moskovski.Data from Bybt shows that the funding rate for Bitcoin is less than 0.01%, which is below the neutral rate. This suggests that there are still shorts in the system which may be squeezed out if the uptrend resumes.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to identify the critical resistance and support levels that will determine the next trend.Bitcoin dipped to a swing low at $46,985.02 on April 25 but the bears could not sustain the lower levels. This suggests that the bulls continue to accumulate on dips. The strong buying has pushed the price back above $50,460 today.The downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($55,385) and the relative strength index (RSI) at 45 suggest the bears still have the upper hand. The sellers are likely to defend the 20-day EMA aggressively.If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the sentiment remains bearish and traders are selling on rallies. The bears will then try to sink the BTC/USDT pair below $46,985.02 and extend the correction to $43,006.77.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls do not give up much ground from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that traders continue to buy at higher levels. A breakout of the 50-day simple moving average ($56,903) may open the doors for a rally to $61,825.84.Ether (ETH) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($2,259) on April 25 indicating accumulation at lower levels. The bulls will now try to thrust the price above the $2,545.84 to $2,645 resistance zone.If they succeed, the ETH/USDT pair could resume the uptrend, which could reach $3,000. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 63 suggest the bulls have the upper hand.However, if the price turns down from the overhead zone, the bears may again pull the price down to the 20-day EMA. If this support cracks, the pair could drop to $2,040.77. A bounce off this support could keep the pair range-bound between $2,040.77 and $2,645 for a few days.Binance Coin (BNB) is forming a symmetrical triangle, which usually acts as a continuation pattern. The bulls will now try to push the price to the resistance line of the triangle.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for BNB on April 24, even before the rally had started.The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.The 7-day chart above shows the VORTECS™ Score for BNB flipped green on April 24 when the price was $500.86.Although the price dipped to a low of $483.68 on April 26, the VORTECS™ Score continued to remain in the green, avoiding a whipsaw to the traders. The bullish view on the VORTECS™ Score proved correct as BNB rallied to a high of $545.94 on April 26.If the bulls can thrust the price above the triangle, the uptrend is likely to resume. The target objective of this setup is $808.57. The gradually upsloping 20-day EMA ($489) and the RSI above 59 suggest the bulls have a slight advantage.However, if the price turns down and plummets below the support line of the triangle, the BNB/USDT pair could drop to $348.70. Such a move will suggest that the symmetrical triangle acted as a reversal pattern.XRP has taken support near the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.86. The bulls are attempting to start a relief rally today and have pushed the price above the 20-day EMA ($1.20).If the bulls sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair could gradually rise to $1.46. The bears will try to stall the relief rally at this level. If the price turns down from this level, it will suggest that traders are closing their positions on rallies.The pair could then drop to the 20-day EMA. A break below this support could result in a drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.86). Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls push the price above $1.46, the pair could move up to $1.74 and then $1.96.Cardano (ADA) plunged below the $1.03 support on April 23 but the bears could not capitalize on this breakdown. The long tail on the day’s candlestick showed the bulls aggressively bought at lower levels.The bears again tried to break the $1.03 support on April 25 but failed. The successful defense of the $1.03 support could have attracted strong buying from the bulls who are attempting to push the price above the moving averages.If they succeed, the ADA/USDT pair could gradually climb toward the $1.48 resistance. On the contrary, if the price again turns down from the moving averages, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the price below $1.03 and start a new downtrend.The bears attempted to sink Dogecoin (DOGE) below the 20-day EMA ($0.22) on April 25 but failed, which suggests that the bulls are trying to defend this support. The meme coin has formed an inside day candlestick pattern today, suggesting indecision among the bulls and the bears.If the buyers propel the price above $0.29, the DOGE/USDT pair could rally to $0.35 where the bears may mount a stiff resistance. If the price turns down from this resistance, the bears will try to pull the price down to the 20-day EMA.The extent of the fall from $0.35 will determine the next possible move. If the bulls do not give up much ground from $0.35, the possibility of a rise to $0.42 increases. However, if the price drops to the 20-day EMA, then the pair could remain range-bound for a few days.The selling may intensify if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA. That could open the doors for a drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.11).In a range-bound asset, traders buy near the support and sell at the resistance of the range. Polkadot (DOT) also witnessed buying near the $26.50 support on April 25 and the bulls have extended the relief rally today.The up-move may face selling at the 20-day EMA ($35.79), which is sloping down. If the price reverses direction from the 20-day EMA, the bears will try to sink the DOT/USDT pair below $26.50.If they succeed, the pair could start a new downtrend. Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls drive the price above the moving averages, the pair could move up to $42.28. This level may again act as a stiff resistance but if the bulls clear the hurdle, the pair could rise to $48.36.Uniswap (UNI) slipped below the 50-day SMA ($31.41) on April 24 but the bears could not hold on to their advantage. The altcoin rebounded sharply on April 25 and rose above both moving averages.The bulls have continued their buying today and have pushed the UNI/USDT pair above $35.20. However, the buyers are likely to counter stiff resistance from the bears in the $38.45 to $39.60 zone.If the price turns down from this zone but rebounds off the 20-day EMA ($32.83), it will indicate the sentiment is positive and traders are accumulating on dips. That will enhance the prospects of a break above the all-time high at $39.60.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level of the overhead resistance and breaks below $29.80.The bears failed to break and sustain the price below the 50-day SMA ($221) for the past three days. That could have attracted buying from the bulls who are attempting to push Litecoin (LTC) back above the 20-day EMA ($245) today.If they succeed, the LTC/USDT pair could start its journey to $289.62 where the bears may try to stall the relief rally. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair could again drop to the 20-day EMA and then to the 50-day SMA.A break below the 50-day SMA could witness panic selling that may pull the price down to $168. On the other hand, if the bulls drive the price above $289.62, the pair could rally to the 52-week high at $335.03.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) dipped and closed below the 20-day EMA ($797) on April 24 but the bears could not leverage this advantage and sink the price to the 50-day SMA ($647). This showed that buyers were accumulating below $750.The bulls have pushed the price above the 20-day EMA and the downtrend line today. If the buyers can sustain the breakout, the BCH/USDT pair could start its journey toward $1,000 where the bears are again likely to pose a stiff challenge.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls fail to sustain the breakout, it will show that traders are closing their positions on rallies. That could increase the possibility of a drop to the 50-day SMA.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

335,"The cryptocurrency space just became a little bit more interconnected after developers created a cross-chain bridge between the Ethereum and Tezos blockchains. Following the launch of the Wrap Protocol, created by Bender Labs, Ethereum-based ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens can be made Tezos-compatible, allowing Ether (ETH) holders to interact with the Tezos ecosystem.Token wrapping has become a common way of connecting the users of disparate blockchain platforms and is perhaps best exemplified by Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), which is an ERC-20 version of Bitcoin (BTC) running on Ethereum.The Wrap Protocol wraps Ethereum-based tokens in the Tezos FA2 token standard, meaning they can be used as one-to-one representations without technical difficulties or price differences.Like Ethereum, Tezos has its own decentralized finance ecosystem. Unlike Ethereum, which will have to wait around a year before it shifts to a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, staking on Tezos is already widely available, offering ETH holders a feasible early chance at earning some passive income.Users of the Wrap Protocol participate in its governance through the use of the WRAP token, which is compatible with both Tezos and Ethereum, operating on both the FA2 and ERC-20 infrastructure.The success of Wrapped Bitcoin can be seen in its $8 billion market capitalization, representing the value of BTC hosted on Ethereum. It is currently the fifth-largest Ethereum token — behind Tether (USDT), Uniswap's UNI, Chainlink's LINK and USD Coin (USDC) — and the 19th-largest cryptocurrency project overall. Just under $200 million worth of WBTC is on Ethereum’s most popular DeFi protocol, Uniswap, at present time.Temporarily converting tokens onto other blockchains is also a way to avoid high fees if the original chain is subject to excessive transaction costs. This may have been the case for WBTC at one point, when Ethereum fees were a mere fraction of those on Bitcoin. This is no longer the case due to Ethereum’s increasing user base and subsequent congestion, which resulted in extravagant transaction costs as average fees rose to over thirty dollars.Recent Tezos blockchain stats show transactions worth over $1 million being sent for between $0.01 and $0.15, suggesting a possible immediate use-case for the Wrap Protocol. However, it faces competition from layer-two protocols already fulfilling this use case for Ethereum users.Bender Labs CEO Hugo Renaudin said code-based blockchain infrastructure was more favorable to legacy financial systems due to its transparency and immutability, adding that he saw Bender Labs’ work as creating an autonomous bank.“We’re building Bender: a self-driving bank for an open financial system because we believe that financial markets should be open, transparent, unstoppable and rely mostly on lines of codes rather than intermediaries,” said Renaudin."
336,"Trevor Lawrence, the presumptive number-one pick in the upcoming National Football League draft, has signed an endorsement deal with crypto portfolio-tracking platform Blockfolio.According to a report on Monday by the New York Times, the quarterback prodigy has already received a signing bonus from the Blockfolio endorsement deal in crypto.Commenting on the deal, Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of Blockfolio parent company FTX, said that Lawrence “was excited about crypto.”According to Bankman-Fried, Lawrence’s positive disposition toward cryptocurrencies is what drew the company to the NFL prodigy, adding that FTX was looking to promote its business to mainstream audiences.Indeed, FTX recently secured a 19-year naming rights deal for the home arena of the National Basketball Association franchise team theMiami Heat. The $135 million deal will see the American Airlines Arena renamed the FTX Arena until 2040.While the details of Lawrence’s multiyear endorsement deal with Blockfolio have not been declared publicly, the NYT quoted a company spokesperson who revealed that the initial signing bonus has already appreciated in value in a little over three days.Elsewhere in the NFL, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Sean Culkin is reportedly the first NFL player to receive full salary payments in crypto.According to a report by Newsweek, Culkin will receive his full $920,000 base pay in biweekly installments from the Chiefs via the Visa-backed Bitcoin Lightning wallet platform Zap.NFL star Russell Okung also utilizes Zap’s Strike platform to convert half of his $13 million salary to Bitcoin.Like Okung, Culkin has also espoused Bitcoin’s suitability as a better investment vehicle than gold or real estate.Speaking to Newsweek, Culkin who is set to star in his fifth NFL season, says his Bitcoin (BTC) investment is for the “long-term.”"
337,"The demand for cryptocurrency exceeded PayPal’s initial expectations after the firm launched crypto trading in late 2020, according to the company’s CEO.“Demand on the crypto side has been multiple-fold to what we initially expected. There’s a lot of excitement,” PayPal president and CEO Dan Schulman said in a Sunday interview with Time magazine.Schulman said that existing financial infrastructure needs modernization because it’s “inefficient today” due to overly expensive, slow international transactions. The CEO predicted that the financial system is poised to see more changes in the next five to 10 years than it has experienced over the past two decades.“Ten years from now, you will see a tremendous decline in the use of cash. All form factors of payment will collapse into the mobile phone. Credit cards as a form factor will go away, and you will use your phone because a phone can add much more value than just tapping your credit card,” he said.Schulman said that central banks will have to rethink their monetary policies as people stop using paper money. The executive said that central bank digital currencies could benefit from emerging technologies like distributed ledger technology. “But they’re basically digitizing a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar,” Schulman noted.PayPal announced its plans to introduce the ability to buy, hold and sell a number of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) in October 2020. By the time the new feature went live in the United States in mid-November 2020, Bitcoin was trading at around $16,000. The world’s largest cryptocurrency subsequently saw a massive rally, driving its price to a new historic record above $64,000 in April.Amid growing prices and demand for crypto, PayPal has continued to expand its crypto services to clients, launching its crypto check-out service in late March to allow crypto payments for merchants. Last week, PayPal-owned payments platform Venmo introduced crypto trading for four major coins including BTC, ETH, Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH)."
338,"When the European Union’s Sixth Anti-Money Laundering Directive comes fully into force on June 3, every company that provides financial services to cryptocurrency customers and businesses will have to comply with much tougher regulations about when and how they identify customers.Strictly speaking, the 6AMLD has been in force since December 2020, but crypto service providers outside the EU have another two months to come into full compliance.This means all e-wallet providers and digital asset exchanges — among others — that have any European customers will need to be registered with EU authorities and perform stricter Know Your Transaction, or KYT, monitoring for illegal activities involving fraud, cybercrime, and money laundering and terrorism financing.It’s worth noting that 6AMLD is the first Anti-Money Laundering directive to specifically target cybercrimes. In addition, it requires EU member states to work together to investigate and prosecute offenses, and closes a significant number of loopholes.From a corporate point of view, the potential consequences are both broader and harsher: Unlike the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, 6AMLD holds companies and other legal entities, not just individual employees, directly liable for violations. In practice, this means that companies will no longer be able to simply blame rogue employees. And penalties are stiffer — including heavy fines and even closing down businesses altogether.This means that it is even more important than ever for cryptocurrency service providers, banks, and financial institutions to ensure that they have compliance strategies in place and staff trained to identify potential criminal behaviors such as money laundering and the financing of both terrorism and nuclear proliferation.Developed by the Bitfury Group, Crystal Blockchain provides three basic services to banks and financial institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges and businesses, government agencies, and virtual asset service providers: KYT monitoring software, compliance training, and expert analysis.Crystal Blockchain’s KYT monitoring software provides compliance tools that analyze and visualize crypto transaction flows, identify entities behind transactions, and provide risk scores based on blockchain interaction that can be used with Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer procedures.MORE INSIGHTS FROM CRYSTAL BLOCKCHAIN HEREBeyond the software tools, Crystal Blockchain provides customized training for compliance teams on best practices for compliance workflows, including onboarding, monitoring, case management and reporting. Additionally, it can help clients integrate the software into existing AML/KYC monitoring systems.The company also produces regular analysis, with insight reports and interactive maps drawn from proprietary data from its explorer tools. A recent report focused on stolen crypto withdrawal and transfer patterns, with the team noting that criminals are moving stolen crypto assets more quickly and using fewer “hops” to mask the final destination. Crystal Blockchain also offers interactive maps, updated quarterly, focused on things like a comprehensive, 10-year analysis of security breaches and fraud involving crypto.With more than 150 clients, thousands of addresses checked daily, 70 countries covered and 900-plus exchanges explored, Crystal Blockchain offers broad coverage. It currently supports Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Ethereum — including ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens — Ethereum Classic, Tether, Litecoin and XRP.The company focuses its services on three customer types: Banks and financial institutions that need AML and Counter-Terrorist Financing compliance tools; blockchain payment services that need due diligence tools; and government agencies that need blockchain analytics tools.Along with 5AMLD and 6AMLD regulations, Crystal Blockchain supports other regional regulatory regimes, as well as international requirements such as Financial Action Task Force rules. It promises a fast response time to regulatory changes.Learn more about Crystal BlockchainDisclaimer: Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

339,"Roughly $150 million worth of shorts were liquidated within a span of hours as the price of Bitcoin (BTC) rose from around $47,000 to over $53,000 on Monday.The cryptocurrency market as a whole saw a strong short squeeze, as Ether (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB) and other major cryptocurrencies also rose by around 15% in the same period.Following Bitcoin’s 12% recovery within a single day, the futures market has completely reset, with funding rates hovering at neutral levels.A short squeeze in trading refers to when short-sell orders in the futures market are liquidated in a short period.When shorts are liquidated, short-sellers are forced to buy back their positions, ironically causing the buyer demand in the market to increase.Thus, the number of shorts rapidly declines, and long contracts or buy orders begin to dominate the market.When the number of longs increases substantially, the funding rate of Bitcoin spikes. This happens because the funding rate increases when there are more long orders in the market.If the funding rate is above 0%, buyers have to pay short-sellers a portion of their position every eight hours to sellers and vice versa.In the case of Bitcoin in the last 24 hours, despite BTC’s strong rally, the funding rate has remained relatively low.In fact, according to Bybt.com, the funding rate across major exchanges for Bitcoin is below 0.01%, which is below the neutral rateIt means that there are still more shorts than longs in the Bitcoin futures market, which could catalyze more upside.This trend is bullish for Bitcoin because it comes after a mass liquidation of short contracts. Lex Moskovski, chief investment officer of Moskovski Capital, said:In the near term, traders say that the $55,500 price level is an important one to reclaim for a chance at new all-time highs.Johnny, a cryptocurrency derivatives trader, said:Adnan Van Dal, a former institutional trader, emphasized that if Bitcoin does not drop until the U.S. market opens, then the likelihood of a bigger rally increases.Dal wrote:As long as Bitcoin remains above $51,000 heading into the U.S. market open and aims for a recovery above $55,000, the chance for an all-time high in the foreseeable future would remain strong."
340,"Bitcoin (BTC) is keeping bulls and bears guessing as it opens a new weekly candle in the green, heading away from $50,000.After an uneventful but uninspiring weekend, BTC/USD has begun Monday by reclaiming $53,000 for the first time since Thursday. What could lie in store?Cointelegraph takes a look at five factors that could shape BTC price action in the coming days.Stocks are once again cool this week as the macro picture presents a familiar mixture of hope and misery driven by the coronavirus.While Asian markets had an uneventful day on the whole, India’s virus problems and Turkey’s financial woes were cause for concern.Separately, with the United States set to send tourists to the European Union this summer, fresh economic incentives for traders are beginning to take shape.With no overall direction, however, the impetus for Bitcoin to track a macro narrative is barely existent — and the day’s price movements are already proving it.“What does the future hodl?” Tesla and SpaceX “Technoking” Elon Musk summarized on Saturday in a tweet that will be poignant for many a market participant. Tesla, one of the big-name BTC investors, is due to report on earnings after the Wall Street close.When it comes to the dollar, the opportunity for Bitcoin is more skewed to the upside — the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) is continuing its decline after closing below 91 on Friday. As Cointelegraph often reports, the index, particularly over the past year, tends to be negatively correlated with BTC/USD.Bitcoin spot price action is already offering surprises, and unlike last week, it’s the bears who are being caught unaware.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView reveals BTC/USD rising to hit $53,000 for the first time since losing the same level on its way down last week.The level itself is significant, equalling a Bitcoin market cap of $1 trillion and thus previously forming a line in the sand that analysts thought would hold.In the event, it was $46,000 that provided the floor, but as yet, there is no firm belief that the latest price dip is over. This is evidenced in trading positions, as the move up to $53,000 liquidated shorts to the tune of $150 million in an hour.“Looks like this interim sell-off might be reaching its conclusion,” podcast host Preston Pysh suspected late on Sunday.The scope of the dip was a shock to some investors, coming despite hordes of new buyers entering the network. On-chain metrics as a whole have remained in the green, lending further weight to the theory that current circumstances are a temporary blip in an otherwise enduring bull market.“Market is very emotional over 2%+/- Swings on closes,” Filbfilb, co-founder of trading suite DecenTrader, told Telegram subscribers last week.In fundamentals, miners continue to recover from a Chinese power outage that truncated the network’s hash rate overnight earlier in April.As a result of flooding, as before in Bitcoin’s life, large segments of China’s mining power disappeared from the network, leading to a drop in hash rate, which at one point neared 25% of all-time highs.Since then, miners have begun adapting, while a drop in mining difficulty will allow smaller operators to mine more profitably and provide an incentive for maintaining network security.This drop, set to occur in around five days’ time, will be the largest negative move since Nov. 3, when BTC/USD was still at $13,000.Difficulty adjustments form an essential, if not the most essential, part of Bitcoin’s ability to maintain itself regardless of external factors influencing its modus operandi.Recent months have been characterized by upticks in difficulty, which together with the hash rate has seen consistent new all-time highs. Should history continue to repeat itself, price action should also revert to gains in line with their recovery.Commenting on recent events, Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, cautioned observers on their choice of statistics resource and argued that the drop had not in fact been as large as some suggested.“Bitcoin hashrate back at 157 EH about 5% below 168 EH peak. Mostly recovered from 25% down at 125 EH,” he tweeted on Sunday.Along with shorts and overleveraged longs alike, it seems that irrational sentiment in crypto has finally been shaken out.That’s the conclusion of the popular Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which uses a basket of factors to determine trader sentiment and, therefore, what’s likely to occur on BTC/USD as a result of their actions.Previously, as new all-time highs of $65,000 appeared, Fear & Greed was nearing historic record highs in line with the tops of bull markets past.At nearly 80/100, a sell-off was clearly on the cards as per the metric, which took around a week to react to the price dip down to $46,000.Now, however, the pressure is off, and the index has gone from “extreme greed” to “fear” — effectively a “reset” of sentiment, which provides scope for further price gains.It’s not just private individuals who have undergone a serious mood change. According to other metrics, erratic behavior from professional traders has also been effectively cleansed from the market.In his latest update for Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano’s market newsletter on Friday, analyst William Clemente noted that longs had once again become an attractive bet.“There was some silver lining to this event, greed and leverage was flushed out,” he wrote.Also approaching a “full reset” is the spent output profit ratio (SOPR), a metric, which Cointelegraph previously noted, tends to dictate local market bottoms.“Currently, SOPR is approaching the full reset mark, meaning price has either reached, or is very closing to reaching, the bottom of the current correction,” Clemente added."
341,"Investment strategist Raoul Pal has identified that Bitcoin’s fortnightly relative-strength indicator, or RSI, recently fell to levels not seen since the “Black Thursday” crash of March 2020. The Global Macro Investor and Real Vision Group CEO also noted that Bitcoin’s (BTC) weekly RSI has crashed to levels comparable to that of the corrections produced during “the first part of the 2017 bull run, before Bitcoin hit hyperspace.”The observation was made after Bitcoin crashed roughly 15% over the weekend, with BTC dropping from $55,000 to find support near $47,250 on Sunday, according to TradingView.Bitcoin is nearly as oversold as it was in March 2020... pic.twitter.com/ZYHESpW5HG“Corrections in a bull market are opportunities and not threats,” Pal added.On-chain analytics provider Glassnode also noted the depth of the crash, reporting that the number of Bitcoin addresses now at a loss had tagged a nine-month high of almost 6.4 million on Sunda. Despite the milestone, 86% of Bitcoin addresses are currently in profit.#Bitcoin $BTC Percent Supply in Profit (7d MA) just reached a 6-month low of 85.938%

The downtrend saw Bitcoin’s dominance drop to 50%. The last time BTC's market share fell below 50% was in July 2018, according to TradingView."
342,"Corrections in a bull phase are usually a bullish sign as they reduce the frothy excitement and allow stronger hands to enter the markets. However, the recent correction in Bitcoin (BTC) from its all-time high at $64,849.27 does not seem to have scared novice traders. Data from DappRadar shows that decentralized exchange volumes have picked up in the last week as traders may have exited profitable Bitcoin positions to buy altcoins at their current rock bottom prices.Another sign of interest in altcoins is the sustained high volumes in Dogecoin (DOGE), which remains the fourth most traded cryptocurrency by volume, behind Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), and XRP, according to data from CoinMarketCap.The recent fall in Bitcoin witnessed selling from the small-to-medium sized whales, who dumped $100,000 to $1 million worth of Bitcoin on the exchanges. However, a positive sign is that the larger-sized whales have continued to accumulate during this period.While the long-term bullish story remains intact, the near term could see some more downside. Generally, a correction does not end until the retail crowd throws in the towel and a state of fear grips the markets.In such an uncertain atmosphere, let’s look at the top-5 cryptocurrencies that are likely to outperform the other major cryptocurrencies in the short term.The bulls are trying hard to push the price back above the psychological level of $50,000 but are facing stiff resistance from the bears on every minor rise. This shows that the bears are trying to hold on to their advantage and extend the decline to the next critical support at $43,006.The 20-day exponential moving average ($55,671) is sloping down and the relative strength index (RSI) is close to the oversold territory, suggesting the bears have the upper hand.The BTC/USDT pair had formed an inside day candlestick pattern on April 24 and today, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. If the uncertainty resolves to the downside, the selling could intensify, opening the gates for a decline to $43,006.On the other hand, if the bulls can push the price above $52,129, the pair could witness a relief rally that is likely to face resistance at the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from this resistance, the possibility of a break below $47.459 increases.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls push and sustain the price above the 50-day simple moving average ($56,870).The 4-hour chart shows the bears have been selling on relief rallies to the 20-EMA. With both moving averages sloping down and the RSI trading in the negative zone, the advantage is with the bears.If the bears sink the price below $48,664.67, the pair could drop to $47,459. A break below this support could resume the down move.Conversely, a break above the 20-EMA will be the first sign that the selling has dried up and the bulls have a chance to extend the relief rally to the 50-SMA.The bulls have once again defended the 20-day EMA ($2,235), indicating the trend remains strong and the buyers are accumulating on dips. Ether will now try to rally to the $2,545 to $2,645 overhead resistance zone.A breakout of the overhead zone could signal the start of the next leg of the uptrend that may extend to $2,745 and then $3,000. The gradually rising moving averages and the RSI above 57 suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the bears will again try to sink the ETH/USDT pair below the moving averages. If they succeed, the pair may start a deeper correction to $1,542.The 4-hour chart shows the pair has formed a head and shoulders pattern, which will complete on a break and close below the neckline. Such a move could pull the price down to the pattern target at $1,600.On the other hand, if the bulls can push the price above $2,375, the pair could retest the all-time high at $2,645. Such a move will invalidate the pattern and the pair is likely to pick up momentum on a break above $2,645.Binance Coin (BNB) is currently consolidating in an uptrend. The bulls are buying the dips to the $480 support while the bears are defending the $600 to $638.57 overhead resistance zone. A range-bound action after a strong uptrend shows that traders are not hurrying to book profits.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI above 56 suggests that the bulls have the upper hand. If the buyers can push the price above $530, the BNB/USDT pair could start its journey to the resistance of the range at $600. The bears are again likely to mount a stiff resistance between $600 and $638.57.If the price turns down from this zone, the range-bound action may continue for a few more days. On the contrary, if the bulls push the price above $638.57, the pair could start its journey to $720 and then $832.This positive view will invalidate if the bears sink and sustain the price below $480. If that happens, the selling may intensify and the pair may drop to the 50-day SMA ($368).The 4-hour chart shows the price is stuck inside a large symmetrical triangle. Although the price rebounded off the support line of the triangle, the bears are attempting to stall the relief rally at the moving averages.If that happens and the price turns down from the current level, the bears will sense an opportunity and try to sink the price below the triangle. If they succeed, the pair could start a deeper correction to $348.Alternatively, if the bulls push the price above the moving averages, the pair could rise to the resistance line of the triangle. A breakout of the triangle may signal the resumption of the uptrend.Monero (XMR) is in a strong uptrend and repeated attempts by the bears to start a correction have failed as the bulls have aggressively bought the dips close to the $288.60 support.The bulls have successfully defended the 20-day EMA ($335) and both moving averages are sloping up, suggesting the buyers have the upper hand. However, the RSI is showing the first signs of a negative divergence, indicating the momentum may be weakening.If the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the possible start of a correction to $288.60. On the other hand, if the bulls push the price above $424.55, the XMR/USDT pair could rally to $498.The 4-hour chart shows that the volatility has picked up in the past few days. The bears have repeatedly broken the 50-SMA but the bulls have aggressively purchased the dip and pushed the price back above the 20-EMA.If the pair rebounds off the current level and rises above $405.40, a retest of $424.55 is possible. A breakout of this resistance could start the next leg of the uptrend. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the moving averages, a drop to $288.60 is likely.PancakeSwap (CAKE) had been facing stiff resistance near the $28 level for the past few days. The bears tried to sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($24) on April 23 but the bulls aggressively purchased the dip, suggesting the sentiment remains positive.Momentum picked up in the past two days and the CAKE/USDT pair has broken out to a new all-time high today. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.If the bulls sustain the price above $30, the pair could rally to $34.50. This bullish view will invalidate if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will be a significant event as the price has not sustained below the 20-day EMA since March 24.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for CAKE on April 23, just as the rally was getting started.The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for CAKE flipped green on April 23 when the price was $25.24.From there, the VORTECS™ Score consistently remained in the green and CAKE rallied to a high at $31.12 on April 25, recording a gain of 23% in about two days.The 4-hour chart shows the formation of an inverse head and shoulders pattern. This bullish setup has a pattern target at $34.70. The 20-EMA has started to turn up and the RSI has risen above 65, indicating the bulls have the upper hand.In case of a correction, the bulls will try to flip the neckline of the pattern into support. If they do that, the uptrend could resume.

343,"Tesla — a top 10 company in the Fortune 100 that is run by one of the world’s wealthiest people, Elon Musk — transferred $1.5 billion of its treasury cash into Bitcoin (BTC) in early February. Musk’s Bitcoin purchase startled traditional investors, who now had to understand how their investment in Tesla would relate to Bitcoin.Currently, much of Tesla’s revenue comes from selling surplus renewable energy credits, or RECs, which will dry up in the next several years as competing automakers produce their own zero-emissions vehicles and build up RECs with states that require them.In Tesla’s filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the company stated that it updated its investment policy to be more flexible in diversifying and maximizing returns on idle cash. As part of this plan, Tesla said it would invest in certain “alternative reserve assets including digital assets, gold bullion, [and] gold exchange-traded funds.” The statement continues:The Bitcoin market has seen Tesla’s recognition and advancement into the crypto industry as institutional validation for Bitcoin’s use as a store of value.Related: Tesla, Bitcoin and the crypto space: The show Musk go on? Experts answerTesla's other businesses produce and sell solar panels, solar roofs and batteries. The batteries are used in its cars and provide power storage for residential solar systems.Residential solar systems can feed surplus energy into the grid. The local power company will prorate a customer’s electric bill based on the amount of power drawn from the system.Tesla Powerwalls can store that surplus energy and power various things in your home, including air conditioners, and charge your Tesla electric vehicle.The excess energy from Tesla’s micro-energy sources can be rerouted to run crypto mining operations. Without crypto mining, the surplus energy is either wasted or stored and sold for pennies on the dollar. Now, Tesla and other energy companies can turn excess power into a digital asset, like Bitcoin, that is instantly bankable.Related: From mom’s house to warehouse: Bitcoin mining is going industrialMany speculate that Tesla’s investment in and acceptance of Bitcoin as payment is a significant signal of the company’s direction. As we know, Musk is also the CEO of SpaceX, the company intending to set up a colony on Mars in the coming decade. However, U.S. dollars fundamentally won’t work on Mars. The extended communication time between Earth servers and Mars servers poses a lot of problems. There will still need to be a verifiable, trusted way to transfer value between the planets’ economies.Bitcoin offers a better solution for securely transferring value between planets on a trusted network where the 10-minute block times end up being advantageous instead of a hassle. SpaceX’s colony can trade locally using a convenient local medium of exchange and securely transfer that value back home to Earth without any middlemen or concerns about inflationary monetary policies on Earth. Bitcoin offers people a more seamless way to integrate economies between planets. Therefore, colonies on Mars will likely be running Bitcoin nodes making use of SpaceX’s Starlink satellite constellation.The transition from the analog world to a digitally native society requires programmable money. The current fiat banking system is archaic, inefficient and unable to meet a technologically advanced society’s needs.Bitcoin mining is the backbone of this evolution. Bitcoin is the most recognized digital currency in the newly forming decentralized economy. Bitcoin has reached critical network effects and is the logical choice for a digitally native global reserve currency. The internet of value — where value is transmitted as efficiently, cheaply and reliably as data is now — is free from any individual government or entity’s control. Bitcoin serves this purpose because of the decentralized architecture built into the Bitcoin protocol.Critics attack Bitcoin for having too much of its processing power housed in mainland China. Meanwhile, the decentralization of Bitcoin’s computing power will continue to improve as more energy producers recognize the benefits of converting excess energy into digital assets through Bitcoin mining.Related: Is Bitcoin a waste of energy? Pros and cons of Bitcoin miningBitcoin mining is necessary to establish layer-one security for the decentralized economy, a function that central banks now provide for the fiat-centric global economy. The decentralized economy is becoming more efficient and multilayered. Bitcoin’s strength is that it has the world’s most powerful computing network with which to secure the decentralized economy’s base layer, upon which all other value transmission solutions are being built. We are witnessing the development of a new, decentralized financial ecosystem. One day, you may be able to send $20 to your buddies on Mars without thinking twice about what it took to get it there.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

344,"Momentum trading driven by retail investors seems to have taken on a new life since the onset of the global standstill occasioned by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Where celebrity challenges used to dominate viral trends on social media, issues relating to personal finance and investments seem to be as popular these days.This increasing interest in the financial markets from workaday folks has also spread to the crypto space as digital currencies posted sharp price recoveries from the slumps that characterized the Black Thursday crash of March 12, 2020.While interest is palpable, some gatekeepers question whether the new generation of retail investors is sufficiently knowledgeable to be investing in risky assets. But has the management of personal finances and investing become a new fashionable trend?Trading apps like Robinhood and Coinbase have recently become the most downloaded on Apple’s App Store, ahead of popular social media services such as TikTok and Instagram. Given the sway held by social media over popular culture in the last decade, investment apps seeing the most downloads could point to a pivot in interests especially among the younger demographic.According to a survey published by U.S. investment giant Charles Schwab, 15% of the current retail investors in America began investing in 2020. Indeed, the United States brokerage industry is estimated to have added 10 million new clients in 2020, with retail trading app Robinhood accounting for over 60% of the total figure.The retail investment boom in 2020 can be attributed to two factors: market volatility and coronavirus lockdowns. With the global economy virtually on standstill, governments sought to stimulate growth and recovery by significant cash infusions in the form of stimulus packages.According to the Charles Schwab survey, Millennials and Generation Z constitute the majority of the newbie investor class created in 2020. Indeed, Millennials accounted for over half the number of participants who said they got into the asset market amid the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Jonathan Craig, senior executive vice president and head of investor services at Charles Schwab, told Cointelegraph:Perhaps fearful of inflation and monetary debasement, more retail investors appear keen to secure suitable hedges against economic uncertainty. In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Jay Hao, CEO of crypto exchange giant OKEx, identified the COVID-19 pandemic as a significant trigger for the current retail investment surge, adding:The coronavirus continues to have a significant impact on personal finances ranging from salary cuts to furloughs or even outright job losses. Thus, it is perhaps unsurprising to see more people becoming incentivized to build emergency income sources outside the traditional 9-to-5 structure.As previously stated, Robinhood accounted for over 60% of the new investors added by U.S. brokerages in 2020. This figure puts the retail trading platform in a suitable position to determine newbie investment trends within the last year.According to a blog post on the company’s website earlier in April, the trading platform declared that its customers were leading the vanguard of the demographic change in the financial markets. In the aforementioned Charles Schwab survey, the investment giant called this new investor class “Generation Investor,” or Gen I.Gen I has a median age of 35 years, which once again positions Millennials and Gen Z at the heart of this investment demographic shift. Numerous surveys have also put this particular age range as being the most interested in cryptocurrencies, as Hao put it:Earlier in April, crypto exchange OKEx published a joint research study with blockchain analytics service Catallact showing the impact of retail interest in the crypto market. According to the report, retail activity in the Bitcoin (BTC) market outpaced that of institutional players in Q1 2021.Such is the growth in retail cryptocurrency trading activity that Robinhood has reported that 9.5 million customers traded crypto on its platform in Q1 2021 alone. This figure represents a sixfold increase in the number of customers recorded by the company in Q4 2020.Other investment and payment services have also begun onboarding crypto clients to take advantage of the current retail trading hype. The likes of Venmo and PayPal have broken from previously anti-crypto stances to adopt friendlier dispositions to digital currencies amid the potential for massive revenue streams.Outside the U.S., a resurgence in retail crypto trading has significantly impacted South Korea’s financial markets. Firms invested in cryptocurrency exchanges are experiencing massive stock price growths. K Bank, the major banker for Upbit — one of South Korea’s largest crypto exchanges — has enjoyed a sharp reversal of fortunes. The bank has recovered from the $89 million in losses recorded in 2019 to be within a year of possibly pursuing a public listing.In February, Thailand’s finance minister Arkhom Termpittayapaisith bemoaned the surge of speculative crypto investment among retail traders in the country. At the time, the government official warned that the trend could have dire implications for the country’s capital market.Thailand’s finance minister is not alone in espousing such sentiments as similar remarks have emerged from government officials and financial regulators across the world. In January 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority warned that crypto investors were liable to lose all their money owing to the high level of risk in the market.Apart from volatility and other well-worn anti-crypto rhetoric, issuers of these cryptocurrency crash portents often point to the presumed ignorance of retail investors about the intricacies of the investment market. Indeed, Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission came under significant backlash from the Thai crypto community when it sought to introduce investor qualification requirements for cryptocurrency investments back in February.Hong Kong is also another jurisdiction looking to limit retail involvement in crypto trading amid reports of a blanket ban. Like the Thai proposal, Hong Kong regulators are looking to enact a minimum income threshold for cryptocurrency investments, which could disqualify up to 93% of the city’s population.There is perhaps no better scale for examining financial literacy arguments than the GameStop saga from earlier in the year. A horde of retail investors leveraged the power of social media engagement to counter shorting of GME stock.Save for regulatory paternalism that saw stock market gatekeepers unfairly favoring the hedge funds on the losing side, the retail traders on r/Wallstreetbets may probably have run the naked shorters to the ground. It could be argued that the GameStop drama proved financial literacy is not the issue for retail traders but rather the undemocratized nature of the legacy financial system.The Charles Schwab survey offers a glimpse of the extent to which newbie investors are going in terms of financial education and advice. In its published report on the poll, the investment firm revealed that about 94% of investors are keen to access more information and tools to conduct their own research.Commenting on the investment mindset of newbie investors, Andrew D’Anna, senior vice-president at the company’s retail client experience division, stated: “Now that they’ve dipped their toes into investing, Gen I is eager to keep learning and evolving its strategies to successfully build wealth for the long-term.”According to D’Anna, the company’s survey offers proof that Gen I investors are not all about short-term risk-taking for huge gains. Instead, the emerging generational change in the financial markets led by Millennials and Gen Z are keen to acquire guidance and education to make informed decisions."
345,"In the past two years futures contracts have become widely popular among cryptocurrency traders and this became more evident as the total open interest on derivatives more than doubled in three months.Additional proof of their popularity came as futures turnover surpassed gold, which is a well-established market with $107 billion in daily volume.However, each exchange has its own orderbook, index calculation, leverage limits and rules for cross and isolated margin. These differences might seem superficial at first, but they can make a huge difference depending a traders' needs.As shown in the above, the total aggregate futures open interest rose from $19 billion to the current $41 billion in three months. Meanwhile, the daily traded volume has surpassed $120 billion, higher than gold's $107 billion.While Binance futures hold the larger share of this market, a number of competitors have relevant volumes and open interest, including FTX, Bybit, and OKEx. Some differences between exchanges are obvious, such as FTX charging perpetual contracts (inverse swaps) every hour instead of the usual 8-hour window.Take notice of how CME holds the third position in Bitcoin (BTC) futures, despite offering exclusively monthly contracts. The traditional CME derivatives markets also stand out for requiring a 60% margin deposit, although brokers might provide leverage for specific clients.As for the crypto exchanges, most will allow up to 100x leverage. Tether (USDT) orders are usually denominated in BTC terms. Meanwhile, the inverse perpetual (token margined) order books are displayed in contracts, which might be worth $1 or $100 depending on the exchange.The above picture shows that Bybit USDT futures order entry requires a BTC-denominated quantity and the same procedure takes place at Binance. On the other hand, OKEx and FTX offer users an easier option which allows the client to enter a USDT quantity, while automatically converting to BTC terms.In addition to USDT-based contracts, OKEx offers a USDK pair. Similarly, Binance perpetual futures also offers a Binance USD (BUSD) book. Therefore, for those unwilling to use Tether as collateral, there are other options available.Some exchanges allow clients to use very high leverage and while this might not pose an overall risk as liquidation engines and insurance funds are in place for these situations, it will pressure the funding rate. Thus, longs are usually penalized on those exchanges.The above chart shows that Bybit and Binance usually display a higher funding rate, while OKEx constantly presents the lowest. Traders need to understand that there are no rules enforcing this, and the rate may vary between assets or momentarily leverage demand.Even a 0.05% difference equals 1% in additional costs per week, meaning, it is essential to compare the funding rate every once in a while, especially during bull markets when the fee tends to escalate quickly.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

346,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) started 2021 by taking the cryptocurrency sector by storm and helping to kick the bull market cycle into high gear as traders capitalized on ways to easily trade cryptocurrencies and earn high yields on their hodl stacks. Eventually, high fees on the Ethereum (ETH) network and a few sharp market sell-offs helped contribute to a pullback in token prices and DeFi transactions beginning in late February, but that trend appears to have reversed over the past week as activity on decentralized exchanges is once again on the rise.As seen in the chart above, decentralized exchange (DEX) volume spiked in late February, followed by a downtrend through the first week of April which saw the total volume traded on all DEXs fall as low as $603 million on April 4.The uptick in users in mid-March was in part due to the explosion in popularity of nonfungible tokens (NFTs), and the end of that frenzy is marked by a precipitous drop-off in users seen between March 26 and March 27.One possible explanation for the spike in activity on DEXs in recent weeks can be found comparing the volume charts with the price chart for Bitcoin (BTC), which indicates a possible correlation between a dip in the price of BTC and increased trading activity.As the price of Bitcoin saw declined from April 6 through April 8, DEX volume began to increase and reached a peak on April 7, just as BTC price was bottoming out and preparing to climb higher.After Bitcoin price reached a peak at $64,840 on April 14, it fell into a downtrend that continued through April 24 as the asset remains pinned below $50,000.DEX volume saw a substantial increase beginning April 18, the same day that Bitcoin experienced a 16% pullback in price from $60,900 to $50,500, and it has remained elevated since, indicating that traders may be rotating out of Bitcoin and into altcoins as the top cryptocurrency works its way through what traders hope will be a brief corrective phase.As seen on the chart above, the daily DEX volume reached its highest level in weeks on April 22 as Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market underwent a significant downturn that saw the total market capitalization fall by more than $324 million.With Bitcoin now fighting to regain the $50,000 support level and a majority of the altcoin market now at fire-sale prices following the downturn from recent highs, decentralized exchange activity may hint at an approaching altcoin season that has historically as Bitcoin searches for direction following a pullback from a new all-time high.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

348,"Dogecoin (DOGE) saw more liquidations than Bitcoin (BTC) at one point on April 24. This shows there is a significantly high demand for trading the meme cryptocurrency even as Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) struggle to recover.Various trends and metrics, such as social volume, trading volume, and liquidations in the futures market indicate that DOGE remains one of the most frequently traded cryptocurrencies in the global market.Although some metrics, like the daily volume on small exchanges, is often exaggerated, futures market open interest and liquidations data is much harder to inflate.According to Bybt.com, in the last 12 hours, over $44 million worth of DOGE positions were liquidated. In comparison, Bitcoin saw $117.4 worth of liquidations, suggesting that the trading interest around DOGE remains relatively high.CoinMarketCap's data also shows that DOGE's daily trading volume across all exchanges is higher than most top cryptocurrenciesIn the last 24 hours, DOGE recorded $11.5 billion in daily trading volume. In the same period, Cardano (ADA), Binance Coin (BNB), and XRP  saw lower trading volume than DOGE despite having larger market capitalizations.A large portion of the demand for DOGE could be coming from the influx of new entrants into the cryptocurrency market in the wake of the bull market.A pseudonymous trader known as NYUU said that most of this friends in the past week bought cryptocurrencies.Unsurprisingly, the cryptocurrencies that were purchased recently were XRP and DOGE. The trader said:In addition to the rising demand for DOGE from new investors entering the cryptocurrency space, data from TheTie shows that the social metrics for DOGE are growing.Social media volume often demonstrates authentic interest in a cryptocurrency on Twitter and other social media platforms across a prolonged period.Analysts say that the cryptocurrency market consolidating before a possible new leg up is healthy. John Street Capital, an analyst who focuses on cryptocurrencies, said:If Bitcoin and Ether continue to consolidate comfortably above $50,000 and $2,200, respectively, it could create a more favorable environment for smaller altcoins, like DOGE, to rally."
349,"As Bitcoin (BTC) lost the $52,000 support on April 22, the futures contracts funding rate entered negative terrain. This uncommon situation causes the shorts, investors betting on price downside, to pay fees every eight hours.While the rate itself is mildly damaging, this situation creates incentives for arbitrage desks and market makers to buy perpetual contracts (inverse swaps) while simultaneously selling the future monthly contracts. The cheaper it is for long-term leverage, the higher the incentives for bulls to open positions, creating a perfect ""bear trap.""The above chart shows how unusual a negative funding rate is, and typically it doesn't last for long. As the recent April 18 data shows, this indicator should not be used to predict market bottoms, at least not in isolation.Futures contracts tend to trade at a premium — at least they do in neutral-to-bullish markets u2014 and this happens for every asset, including commodities, equities, indexes and currencies.However, cryptocurrencies have recently experienced a 60% annualized premium (basis), which is considered highly optimistic.Unlike the perpetual contract (inverse swap), the monthly futures do not have a funding rate. As a consequence, their price will vastly differ from regular spot exchanges. These fixed-calendar contracts eliminate the fluctuation seen in funding rates and make the the best instrument for longer-term strategies.As shown in the chart above, notice how the 1-month futures premium (basis) entered dangerously overleveraged levels, which exhausts the possibilities for bullish strategies.Even those that previously bought futures in expectation of a further rally above the $64,900 all-time high had incentives to cut their positions.While a 30% or higher cost to open long positions is prohibitive for most bullish strategies, as the basis rate slips below 18%, it usually becomes cheaper to long futures than buy call options. This $11 billion derivatives market is traditionally very costly for bulls, mainly due to BTC's characteristic high volatility.For example, buying upside protection using a $60,000 call option for June 25 currently costs $4,362. This means the price needs to rise to $64,362 for its buyer to profit — a 19.7% increase from $50,423 in two months.While the call option contract gives one infinite leverage over a small upfront position, it makes less sense for bulls than the 3% June futures premium. A 5x-leveraged long position will return 120% gains if BTC happens to reach the same $64,362. Meanwhile, the $60,000 call option buyer would require Bitcoin's price to rise to $77,750 for the same profit.Therefore, while investors have no reason to celebrate the 27% correction occurring over the past nine days, investors might interpret the move as a ""glass half full.""The lower the costs for bullish strategies, the higher the incentives for bulls to set up a perfect ""bear trap,"" fueling Bitcoin to a more comfortable $55,000 support.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

350,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has declined over the past day or so, falling from highs above $60,000 to below $50,000. That, however, does not necessarily mean the asset’s bull run is over, according to a well-known crypto analyst, PlanB. “Nothing goes up in a straight line,” PlanB said in a Tweet on Friday.PlanB is known in the crypto industry for his Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow, or S2F, model. The model essentially projects Bitcoin’s price along an upward path in tandem with its halvings and increasing scarcity. He has also constructed a number of other models around the concept, factoring in different aspects.Over the past several months, Bitcoin has dwarfed its 2017 all-time price high, hitting just shy of $65,000 on April 14, according to TradingView data. In the following days, BTC proceeded to fall down near $47,500 by April 23 — roughly a 26% decline. The move, however, is not out of line with previous Bitcoin bull cycles, according to PlanB’s tweet.PlanB’s tweet on Friday also included a chart of Bitcoin’s price action during the bull markets that ensued following each of its previous halvings. Halvings occurred in 2012, 2016 and 2020. Bull markets followed in 2013, 2017 and 2020/2021.Nothing goes up in a straight line. #bitcoin has gone up 6 months in a row, until this month. This looks like the mid-way dip that we also saw in 2013 and 2017. pic.twitter.com/uaCn9GCHGIPrevious bull runs have sustained sizable pullbacks in price amid the backdrop of a greater macro bull cycle. Based on BraveNewCoin’s BLX chart on TradingView, during the bull run of 2013, after notable upside price action, Bitcoin suffered a crash of about 75% between April and July 2013. After that drop, Bitcoin went on to post significant gains before 2014 hit.In September of 2017, Bitcoin suffered a drop of roughly 40% following significant gains, but went on to hit new highs in subsequent months before falling into a bear market the year after."
351,"Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market took a beating in the late ho April 22, and intense selling saw (BTC) price dip below $48,000 in a move that came as a relief to quantitative analysts like PlanB who were worried that the price growth was showing signs of being inorganic. A variety of factors have been identified as being the cause of the drop in price, including an overcrowded futures market and heavy selling activity from small- to medium-size whales. Aside from the activity of whales in the crypto market, the most impactful development was a proposal from the administration of United States President Joe Biden to raise the capital gains tax for individuals making more than $1 million per year.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that a heavy wave of selling led to a break below the $50,000 support level for Bitcoin on April 23, dropping the price to a low of $47,500 before a few courageous buyers arrived to lift it back above $49,000.The breakdown below $50,000 marks a 25% drawdown from the recent all-time high and now has Bitcoin trading at levels last seen in early March.When asked about April 22's price action, Micah Spruill, managing partner and chief investment officer at S2F Capital, indicated that the sell-off “appears to be an attempt to pin the price below the key $50,000 level where a significant number of put options would expire in the money.”Spruill noted that “bearish net inflows of BTC transfers to exchanges” were the likely catalyst that “drove us down to the next level of on-chain support around $47,500,” and also highlighted the fact that “Most of the coins moved on-chain during this most recent selloff were recently acquired coins and not long term holder coins.”According to Élie Le Rest, partner at digital asset management firm ExoAlpha, being able to hold the current price level “would confirm the accumulation pattern by institutional investors at or below $50,000, leaving room to grow for Bitcoin in the coming weeks/months.”If the price should fall further, Le Rest identified $43,000 as the next strong support level, and he highlighted the fact that altcoins really began to “flourish” the last time BTC traded in this range in February.Le Rest said that “getting back to this level may trigger a strong downside for the altcoin market as they would have lost all of their recent gains,” potentially leading to a rise in Bitcoin dominance back above 60%.Le Rest said:To help better understand the rapid sell-off in the price of Bitcoin, Jarvis Labs co-founder Ben Lilly offered an analogy that alluded to traders acting like passengers on a boat to help describe what happened as a “spontaneous synchronization.”Lilly said:Lilly pointed to several opportunities that traders used to make money off this downturn including “selling the altcoin euphoria” as well as profiting from the futures carry trade. He also highlighted the fact that capital was being used to short, not to buy, in these instances.As an indication of how rapidly the market sold off and the degree to which it caught even institutional traders by surprise, Whalemap, an on-chain analytics firm, posted the following tweet highlighting the significance of the $55,000 level.55k should have been the bottom. 263 thousand bitcoins inflowed to whale wallets at that price. In the future, it could be a trouble area for BTC. But let's see what happens. Currently, we are at support. pic.twitter.com/Ooo20xlYzqAs for what analysts think about buying BTC below $50,000, Whalemap posted the following chart and said: The market now anxiously awaits the next major move in Bitcoin's price to help determine if this is merely an overdue correction that will lead to a continuation of the bull market or the opening salvo of the next bear market cycle.Bitcoin’s drawdown hit the altcoin market especially hard, resulting in double-digit losses for a majority of the top 100 tokens.Ether (ETH), the top altcoin by market capitalization, was pummeled and at the time of writing trades more than 12% away from its April 22 all-time high of $2,640. Meanwhile, XRP and DOGE have been the hardest-hit tokens in the top 10, with their prices falling more than 20%.Three notable exceptions to the current sell-off include Compound's COMP, WAVES and Helium's HNT, which managed to overcome the selling by posting gains of 13%, 9% and 8%, res at the time of writing.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.862 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 50.7%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

352,"Bitcoin has gained increasing levels of adoption over the past several months amid its rise past $60,000. The government of the U.S. state of Louisiana recently released a resolution in which it noted some of Bitcoin’s (BTC) accomplishments.“THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the House of Representatives of the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby commend Satoshi Nakamoto for his contribution to economic security,” said House Resolution No. 33 from Rep. Mark Wright. According to an article from The Hill, the document was signed on Thursday.The shout out to anonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto came after the document gave BTC a pat on the back for its success in terms of adoption and market capitalization. The first lines of the resolution read:Bitcoin achieved a market cap greater than $1 trillion in early 2021. The milestone occurred following the asset’s break of its 2017 record high, which it tallied in late 2020.The Louisiana document described a number of details around Bitcoin, including noting its prevalence, its decentralization and its usage. The resolution even pointed toward the asset as a gold alternative. “Bitcoin, which could potentially replace gold as a monetary reserve, is limited and finite and there is a maximum capacity of only twenty-one million bitcoins allowed to be produced,” the document said.Over the past year or so, a number of companies have bought into Bitcoin as an asset, leading to increased mainstream attention."
353,"As Bitcoin price crashed below $50,000, mainstream media highlighted that the selling across the market could have been triggered by reports that the Biden administration proposed increasing the capital gains tax to 39.6% from the current 20% for people earning more than $1 million a year.In other news, there was an apparent exit scam carried out by Thodex exchange owner Faruk Fatih Özer, which has affected about 391,000 users of the Turkish crypto exchange. Rumors are afloat that the owner may have fled the country with nearly $2 billion worth of crypto assets.U.S. equity markets also sold off on April 22 as the tax hike rumors rattled investors but the S&P 500 has bounced back sharply today, indicating that market participants have discounted the news.After the fall, the next big question on the minds of investors is whether the correction will deepen or is this the opportune time to open new positions.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to identify the critical support and resistance levels that will indicate the start of a trending move.The 50-day simple moving average ($56,793) has flipped to resistance and the bulls could not push and sustain the price above it on April 19 and April 20. That may have resulted in profit-booking by short-term traders, which pulled Bitcoin’s (BTC) price below the psychological $50,000 mark today.The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover and the relative strength index (RSI) is near the oversold level, indicating a possible change in sentiment. This is the first time the RSI has plunged below 40 since the start of the bull trend in October of 2020.If the bears can sustain the price below $50,460, the BTC/USDT pair could continue to slump towards the next critical level at $43,006.77 where buyers are likely to step in aggressively. The extent of the rebound from this level will give better insight into whether the correction has ended or not.This negative view will invalidate if the price rebounds off the current level and rises above the moving averages. The next leg of the uptrend could start after the bulls push the price above $64,849.27.Ether (ETH) broke above $2,545.84 on April 22 and hit a new all-time high at $2,645. However, the long wick on the daily candlestick shows that the bulls could now sustain the breakout. This may have trapped aggressive breakout traders, who might have been stopped out of their positions today.The selling continued and the ETH/USDT pair dropped to $2,102.24 today. However, the long tail on the day’s candlestick suggests the bulls aggressively purchased the dip close to $2,040.77. This indicates the sentiment remains positive and the buyers are accumulating at lower levels.The acid test for the bulls will be in the $2,500 to $2,645 resistance zone. If the price again turns down from this level, the pair could consolidate between $2,500 and $2,040.77 for a few days.On the other hand, a break above $2,645 could resume the uptrend that may reach $2,745 and then $3,000. This positive view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below $1,900.Binance Coin (BNB) turned down from the $600 to $638.56 resistance zone on April 21, indicating that the bears are active at higher levels. The sellers pulled the price below the 20-day exponential moving average ($479) today but could not sustain the lower levels.The long tail on today’s candlestick suggests the bulls continue to buy the dips to the 20-day EMA. The buyers will now again try to push the price to $600 and challenge the overhead resistance zone.If they can thrust the price above $638.56, the BNB/USDT pair may start the next leg of the uptrend, which could reach $832.However, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance zone, the pair could remain range-bound for a few days. The first sign of weakness will be if the price dips and sustains below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could result in a drop to the 50-day SMA ($357).The failure of the bulls to build upon the rebound off the 20-day EMA ($1.22) on April 21 shows a lack of buyers at higher levels. The bears pounced on this opportunity and broke the 20-day EMA today, pulling XRP to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.86.The bulls purchased the dip today but they are likely to counter stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the possibility of a break below the 50-day SMA increases. That could pull the price down to $0.56.Alternatively, if the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USDT pair could rise to $1.46. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair may remain range-bound for a few days. The bulls may be back in command if the price rises and sustains above $1.46.Vertical rallies unless backed by strong fundamentals witness waterfall declines and that is what was seen in Dogecoin (DOGE) price. The altcoin broke the 20-day EMA (0.20) support today and dipped to $0.15, just above the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.14.Traders purchased at lower levels today and the DOGE/USDT pair has risen above the 20-day EMA. If the bulls sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may attempt to rise to $0.35.However, the flat 20-day EMA and the RSI below 57 indicate the bulls have lost their advantage. If the pair loses ground and closes below the 20-day EMA, the selling could intensify further and a drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.10) is possible.Cardano (ADA) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($1.24) on April 21, suggesting the sentiment has turned negative and traders are selling on rallies. The bears broke the $1.03 support today but have not been able to sustain the lower levels.The bulls are currently trying to keep the price above $1.03. If they manage to do that, the ADA/USDT pair could again rise to the moving averages. If the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rally to $1.48.On the contrary, if the price again turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will attempt to sink the pair to $0.80 and then to $0.70. Such a move will suggest the start of a new downtrend.Polkadot’s (DOT) recovery attempt hit a barrier at the 50-day SMA ($37) on April 22, suggesting the sentiment has turned negative and traders are offloading their positions on rallies.The selling picked up momentum today and the DOT/USDT pair dropped to the $26.50 support. However, the sharp bounce off this support suggests the bulls are defending this level aggressively.If the bulls sustain the recovery, the pair could remain range-bound for a few more days. A breakout of the moving averages will be the first sign of strength while a break below $26.50 will signal the possible start of a new downtrend.Uniswap (UNI) rose above the $35.20 overhead resistance on April 21 and again on April 22. However, on both occasions, the altcoin met with stiff resistance at higher levels as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick.The failure to sustain the breakout above $35.20 may have trapped the aggressive bulls who dumped their positions today. If the UNI/USDT pair closes below the 50-day SMA today, the decline could extend to $25.52 in the next few days.A strong rebound off this support will suggest that traders are defending this level aggressively. That could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days. On the other hand, if the $25.52 support cracks, the down move could extend to $20.This neutral to negative view will invalidate if the price turns up from the current level and rises above $35.20.The bulls tried to resume the up-move on April 21 and 22 but met with stiff resistance at higher levels as seen from the long wick on the candlesticks. The bears continued their selling today and pulled Litecoin (LTC) below both moving averages.The long tail on today’s candlestick suggests the bulls are buying at lower levels and trying to stage a recovery. However, they are likely to face stiff resistance near the 20-day EMA ($250.)If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment has turned negative and traders are selling on rallies. That will increase the possibility of a break below the 50-day SMA. If that happens, the LTC/USDT pair could plunge to $168.This negative view will invalidate if the price turns up from the current level and rises above $246.96.The relief rally in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) reversed direction from $998.49 on April 21 and the selling intensified today when the bears broke the 20-day EMA ($797) support. However, the bulls are attempting to stage a recovery from the intraday lows as seen from the long tail on the candlestick.If the BCH/USDT pair sustains the recovery, it will suggest buying at lower levels. The bulls will then try to push the price above the downtrend line. If they succeed, the pair could again rise to $1,000 where the bears will mount stiff resistance.The flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint suggest the bulls have lost their advantage. If the price turns down from the downtrend line, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the price to the 50-day SMA ($629).Such a deep fall is likely to delay the next leg of the uptrend and keep the pair range-bound for a few days.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

354,"Major American cryptocurrency exchange Gemini now lets its users purchase cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) with Apple Pay and Google Pay.According to a Thursday announcement, Gemini users can now connect their debit cards to Apple Pay or Google Pay for buying crypto with fiat on the platform. The firm noted that user funds will be available to withdraw one hour after a purchase was made.The new feature is available for over 30 cryptocurrencies supported on Gemini, including major coins like BTC, Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), as well as Ethereum-based tokens like AAVE and Maker's MKR. ""All tokens except for DAI are available for purchase with Apple Pay and Google Pay,"" a Gemini spokesperson noted.The fees while purchasing crypto with Apple Pay or Google Pay are the same as the fees while purchasing crypto using debit cards. The platform retains 3.49% of the total purchase amount from deposits carried out via debit card transfers, while wire transfers and crypto-to-crypto deposits are free of charge.The cryptocurrency industry has been expanding in recent months in terms of growing integrations with traditional finance payment services like Apple Pay. In February, major crypto payment processor BitPay announced a major Apple Pay integration allowing its users to connect to Apple Wallet and pay for goods and services with digital coins like BTC, ETH and LTC. Crypto payment firm Simplex also enabled Apple Pay users to purchase the COTI cryptocurrency in March."
355,"Untied to any single government or country, Bitcoin is often labeled a store-of-value asset and a hedge against other areas of finance. HoweverNassim Taleb, a former risk analyst and author, thinks otherwise, however. In an interview with CNBC on Friday, after noting Bitcoin’s (BTC) similarity to a Ponzi scheme, Taleb said: “There’s no connection between inflation and the coin. None.”He added:This is not the first time Taleb has expressed skepticism toward Bitcoin. Earlier this year, he mentioned selling off his BTC holdings, claiming issues with its volatility. His stance, however, was based on Bitcoin as a currency, not as a store of value — a role in which the asset has transitioned into over the years.Taleb, however, does seem to fully appreciate the technology behind BTC. “It’s a beautifully set up cryptographic system,” he told CNBC. “It’s well made, but there’s absolutely no reason it should be linked to anything economic,” he added.He described the importance of owning cash-generating vehicles and referred to Bitcoin as a gimmick. Taleb also made other comments on Bitcoin in the interview, including talking about currencies versus speculative assets.In 2020, Taleb referred to most Bitcoin advocates as idiots, citing their lack of knowledge on economic subjects."
356,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) fell by 15% and 20%, respectively, on April 23 as the cryptocurrency market became engulfed in a major correction. Five factors likely caused the price of Bitcoin and Ether to steeply drop in a single day, including mass liquidation, an overheated futures market, the decline of Kimchi premium, whales selling and concerns over United States President Joe Biden's tax plans.On April 23, in a 24-hour span, the cryptocurrency market saw over $4 billion worth of positions liquidated.According to Bybt a data analytics platform, the Bitcoin market is currently majority short, with short positions accounting for around 54%.This suggests that in the past day, billions worth of long position were liquidated, leaving a lot of short positions open.Data also shows that the open interest of the Ether futures market reached an all-time high on CME, indicating that the ETH futures market was also getting overcrowded. The open interest of Bitcoin futures similarly spiked before the price of BTC dropped.Now, both ETH and BTC are in a better position to recover because their open interests have collectively dropped.Bitcoin, in particular, saw its futures open interest on Binance, which consistently records the highest derivatives trading volume for BTC, drop to levels unseen since March 8.As the price of Bitcoin and Ether plummeted, the Kimchi premium in South Korea fell back down to 0%.The premium is now over 4%, but the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market saw a steep sell-off following a negative statement from the nation’s financial watchdogs.On April 22, Eun Sung-soo, financial commissioner of South Korea, said that the government is taxing cryptocurrencies but that are not financial assets and the government would not protect them.The unexpected statement from South Korea's financial watchdog likely led to a major sell-off in the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market, causing the Kimchi premium to collapse. On April 20, the Material Indicators team, which tracks the trade flow of Bitcoin on major exchanges, said that small- to medium-sized whales were selling.The analysts said:This trend was particularly significant because large whales were accumulating Bitcoin in the same period.The selling pressure put on by small- to medium-sized whales, who were selling between $100,000 and $1 million worth of Bitcoin on major exchanges, intensified the short-term downturn of Bitcoin.The timing of the Bitcoin price plunge also coincided with the release of U.S. President Biden's plans to raise taxes on wealthy individuals.The U.S. stock market dropped, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average declining by more than 1% in a single trading session on April 22.Holger Zschaepitz, a market analyst at Welt, said at the time:"
357,"Unlike its neighbor to the south that continues to procrastinate, Canada seems to be fast-tracking crypto assets — as evident again last week in its regulatory green light for three new Ether (ETH)-based exchange-traded funds, North America’s first.“Having an easily accessed ETF in Canada changes the competitive landscape,” Campbell Harvey, professor of international business at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business, told Cointelegraph. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission will feel pressure to approve a cryptocurrency-based ETF soon, perhaps within months, said Harvey.“It is increasingly hard to make the case to exclude crypto,” he further explained, adding: “Consider an institutional investor that wants a well-diversified portfolio. Of course, that portfolio would include names like Apple with $2 trillion in market capitalization. But what about crypto?”On April 17, Purpose Investments, Evolve ETFs and CI Global Asset Management were all approved by Canadian regulators to launch Ether ETFs. That event, while viewed positively by most, still raises a few questions.How, if at all, does an Ether ETF really differ from a Bitcoin (BTC) ETF? Would it have the same target market or the same success in assets under management as the Purpose Bitcoin ETF, for example, which has attracted 1.23 billion Canadian dollars ($983 million) since its February debut? For that matter, how significant are crypto-based ETFs as a class — are they just a halfway house on the path to widespread cryptocurrency adoption, likely to be superseded eventually by decentralized finance offerings?Chris Kuiper, vice president of CFRA — an analytics and research company — told Cointelegraph that said both retail and institutional investors prefer to make crypto investments “in a market cap weighted manner,” so as not to try to pick winners and losers. So, an ETF for Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is a plus and “would allow them to start creating this portfolio.”But BTC and ETH could also be veering off in different directions, Kuiper added, and eventually, Ether might attract its own unique constituency. After all, “Many [investors] are starting to view Bitcoin as the monetary base layer or a gold 2.0 and even an alternative to corporate treasury reserve assets,” noted Kuiper, further explaining that for those who view Bitcoin as the “ultimate store” of value, they “want the code unchanged and for transactions to remain slow.” He added:Som Seif, CEO of Purpose Investments, also appeared to see potentially broader uses for an Ether ETF, such as a way to invest in a technology platform. He recently commented: “We’re democratizing access to Ether, making the process of owning Ether easier than ever. We believe Ether [...] is poised to continue its growth trajectory and as both an important utility technology and broader adoption as an investment asset.”Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of investment management firm Arca, told Cointelegraph that the majority of investors today still don’t understand — nor are they often even aware of — Ethereum and how it differs from Bitcoin. That said, the market audience for BTC and ETH exchange-traded funds are basically the same, in his view — i.e., “those who are more restricted in their ability to buy digital assets directly.” This includes financial advisors and funds with equity mandates.As noted, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF has been a huge success by most accounts. Will an Ether ETF attract anywhere near the same attention?Kuiper expects Purpose Investments’ Ether ETF “to be successful as well in terms of garnering assets, but I would not expect it to gain the same amount of assets as their Bitcoin ETF.” Bitcoin remains crypto’s flagship currency, and even if its dominance has diminished recently, it still accounts for about 50% of the total market capitalization. Ether, in second place, trails far behind, with only 12% to 13% of the market share. One might expect roughly the same proportions to hold with its respective ETFs, said Kuiper, adding:Scott Freeman, co-founder and partner of JST Capital, told Cointelegraph: “We would not be surprised if the ETH ETFs also do well, but we expect this to be in proportion to the existing ratio of their market caps.” As for the attractions of both ETF types, Freeman said:Dorman told Cointelegraph that he too expects Ether ETFs to perform well, though mainly “because the equity world is starved for digital asset exposure, and this will be yet another pure play way to get exposure without breaking from traditional bank and brokerage workflows.”Will the SEC soon feel compelled to answer Canada with similar approvals of its own? “The SEC doesn’t have to do anything in regards to Canada,” Kuiper told Cointelegraph, “but I think they may feel some pressure to remain competitive and start to approve or at least offer more details and guidance on a Bitcoin ETF — they now have at least applications from eight different ETF companies.”Kathleen Moriarty, senior counsel at Chapman and Cutler LLP, told Cointelegraph: “The SEC will certainly note that Canada has listed Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Given that we have relationships with Canada in the securities area, this will resonate more with the SEC than it would if a country with a new securities market listed these ETFs.” That being said, Moriarty added:Harvey told Cointelegraph: “In the past, the SEC has resisted ETFs mainly because they feared manipulation of some of the price feeds from exchanges of dubious quality. I think we have enough fully regulated, liquid exchanges in the U.S. to mitigate those concerns.” This combined with a new agency chairman, Gary Gensler, who “understands the space, means that it is likely a matter of a few months before we have U.S. based crypto ETFs.”But Gensler, who once taught a course on blockchain at MIT, might have other priorities. “Gensler is going to be very busy dealing with ESG [environmental, social and corporate governance], SPACs [special purpose acquisition companies] and market structure issues. Solving existing problems may be higher on his to do list than birthing a new complex product that could pose problems down the line,” said Moriarty, who worked with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss on the first SEC filing for a Bitcoin ETF in 2013 — which was rejected by the agency in 2017.Another view shared with Cointelegraph by an expert who wished to remain anonymous is that the SEC is welcoming the Canadian listings, as now it can see “in real life” how these crypto funds actually perform, whether they cause problems, and to what extent the “customer experience” is positive.“In my experience, the U.S. regulatory bodies have never been influenced by Canada,” Dorman told Cointelegraph. “ETFs are still years away in the U.S., because most of the issues raised by the SEC in their previous rejections have not been solved.”From a global perspective, though, can’t Canada’s recent Ether ETF approvals be viewed as yet another indication that cryptocurrencies are moving into the financial mainstream?It further validates “that cryptocurrencies are here to stay,” said Kuiper, as “the market and infrastructure continues to expand.” And Harvey told Cointelegraph: “Crypto is mainstream now. The IPO of Coinbase was the watershed. We will see more and more ETFs based on other coins.”But Harvey was more nuanced with regard to the long-term impact of ETFs: “A big reason that institutional investors have steered clear of crypto until now is the custody issue,” he said, adding: “They had no mechanism to store private keys. They did not want to bear the custodial risk. The ETFs solve these problems.” Looking further down the road, however, decentralized finance could put these funds out of business. As Harvey noted:Dorman agreed that the main benefit of these funds is the access they provide to investors who don’t have the ability to buy and custody BTC and ETH directly. For them, “It is a worthwhile service as long as the fees are low,” but he added this caveat:"
358,"Bitcoin (BTC) is expected to dip as low as $32,500 in the short term after several crucial support levels faded to nothing on Friday.BTC/USD hit lows not seen since early March on Friday, as analysts line up their prognoses — and buy orders — in the latest Bitcoin price correction.BTC pullbacks tend to frighten new investors, while old hands seem to battle one another for who can put on the coolest persona as the numbers fall.As the largest cryptocurrency fell through $53,000 and then $50,000, however, signs of bearishness for the short term began to surface.For veteran trader Peter Brandt, well known for calling various BTC price phenomena in recent years, there was still much more room left to buy the dip. So much so that he revealed he had scheduled a buy order at just $32,501.I have entered orders overnight to buy $BTC at $32,501Like other popular analysts, however, Brandt is far from bearish on Bitcoin in the long term. Joining him in forecasting the price floor was popular Twitter account Dilution-proof, who argued that $46,000 would be a line in the sand for BTC/USD.The foundation for support, in fact, consists of several price points, the account explained. Bids from investors and large-volume whales, along with a technical Fibonacci level, all suggest that bears would have difficulty forcing the market much lower.“I have also observed on the blockchain a lot of on-chain buying volume around $47-49K, which I expect to act as very strong support should we even get down to those price levels,” Philip Swift of trading suite DecenTrader agreed in a fresh analysis released on Friday.More BTC was deposited to exchanges in the 24 hours to Friday than at any time since the cross-asset crash in March 2020, Glassnode data shows.For fellow Twitter analyst Rekt Capital, meanwhile, the retracement is a textbook event that has characterized every Bitcoin bull market.The start of the Q2 correction, coming around 80 days after the end of the Q1 correction from $42,000, mimics what happened to Bitcoin during its 2017 bull run, the account noted.As Bitcoin lingers, altcoins are seeing another sea of red after succumbing to a broad sell-off — but not for long.That is also the conclusion of Philip Swift, who singled out Ether (ETH) after the largest altcoin by market capitalization hit new all-time highs this week. More generally, altcoins are ripe for an influx of cash from investors who consider Bitcoin as “too expensive.”“Given the influx of new money entering the market and new entrants perceiving Bitcoin as ‘too expensive,’ I am expecting money to flow into altcoins,” he added.Bitcoin lost its controlling slice of the crypto market cap pie on Thursday, dropping into the 40%–50% zone for the first time since 2018."
359,"Bitcoin (BTC) may be making long traders miserable, but one bullish analyst says that he is “relieved” that it has shed 22% in a week.In his latest social media update, quant analyst PlanB noted that the price dip to under $48,000 has sent BTC/USD below its target laid out by his stock-to-flow price model.As such, Bitcoin is no longer “front-running” stock-to-flow, which is traditionally a highly accurate price forecasting tool. After trading above its required level, PlanB suggested that he had become concerned progress was becoming inorganic.“I am sort of relieved btc price is now under s2f model value again,” he wrote in a conversation with The Bitcoin Standard author Saifedean Ammous, who called its predictions “astonishing.”Both the terms “clockwork” and “supercycle” will be familiar to long-term hodlers, these often describing Bitcoin’s relationship to stock-to-flow and the qualities of the current bull run, respectively.As Cointelegraph reported, the two iterations of the model, stock-to-flow (S2F) and stock-to-flow cross-asset (S2FX), variously call for an average BTC/USD price of $100,000 or $288,000 between now and 2024.Previously, PlanB said he believed Bitcoin would not stop at $100,000, which it should hit this year“Bitcoiners are often too bullish in the bull market, and too bearish in the bear market!” podcast host Stephan Livera responded to Ammous.Meanwhile, various factors were being pitched as the impetus for the latest round of price losses, including CME futures now trading below spot price as bearishness enters as well as a negative Coinbase premium.The latter suggests bullishness when it is positive, but the reverse — when Coinbase spot price is lower than that of fellow exchange Binance — is also true.The flip to negative coincided with a series of a major sell orders on Coinbase, each one causing a brief downward spike in its orderbook spot price.In a sign that irrational sentiment is still to leave the market, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index also remained in “greed” territory despite dropping to monthly lows though still suggesting that a sentiment reset had yet to kick in.During its initial drop from all-time highs near $65,000, Bitcoin saw mass liquidations of long positions."
360,"Legislators in the United Kingdom have asked for greater regulatory powers to combat the rise of financial “greenwashing” — a deceptive practice where a company overstates or fabricates the extent of its green energy usage.A report by the House of Commons cross-party Treasury Committee urges the U.K. government to sharpen its definition of environmentally conscious investments and to consult on the prospect of attaching “green labels” to financial products. The report notes that “green” claims attached to financial investments are often exaggerated, and can fail to align with customer expectations:The rallying call by legislators came on the same day that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Tesla CEO Elon Musk agreed on Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential to go completely green and to subvert its image as an environmentally damaging technology.Musk and Dorsey were reacting to a new report by Square (of which the latter is CEO) and Ark Invest, which explored Bitcoin’s potential to contribute a boon to green energy usage. Titled “Bitcoin is Key to an Abundant, Clean Energy Future,” the report argued that, in combination with renewable energy storage, Bitcoin’s energy-hungry nature could present a solution to the problem that sees renewable energy often wasted in times of abundance.The desire by investors to associate only with environmentally conscious businesses has led to the rise of ESG investing, which views environmental, social and corporate governance factors as key considerations when making sustainable investments.CEO of U.K.-traded Bitcoin mining firm Argo Blockchain, Peter Wall, told Cointelegraph that he had witnessed an increase in ESG chatter in the mining space over the last few months. However, Wall noted that not all of it seemed genuine:Argo is a Bitcoin mining firm that utilizes renewable energy in the form of hydroelectric power at its various mining farms located in Canada. The firm’s share price currently stands 4,000% higher than this time last year, and it recently purchased a 320-acre plot of land in Texas to expand its mining operations into the United States.Wall agreed with the recent calls by U.K. legislators to force companies to back up their green energy usage claims:Wall said demand by environmentally conscious investors could naturally accelerate the process which sees clearer definitions applied to green labeling.“Limiting the impact of climate change is critically important, and so ensuring companies are doing whatever they can to reduce greenhouse emissions and their environmental footprint is essential. Investor demand can help drive this, and clear guidelines are necessary to enable companies to invest in cleaner technologies,” said Wall.Not everyone agreed that Bitcoin’s future prospects were as green as they seemed. As reported by the BBC, Bitcoin critic and author David Gerard referred to the Square/Ark paper as a “cynical exercise in Bitcoin greenwashing.”“The reality is: bitcoin runs on coal,” Gerard told the BBC, referencing the recent coal mine accident in Xinjiang, China, which temporarily wreaked havoc on Bitcoin miners’ ability to produce new coins.Bitcoin’s reliance on fossil fuels from China is inarguable, however, when compared to the resource consumption of the current fiat system, its effect on the environment seems much less scandalous."
361,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen below $50,000 for the first time since March, with BTC shedding roughly 10% in the last 12 hours.On Saturday, the $60,000 range was rejected, driving a crash in the Bitcoin price of nearly 20% in a single hour. While the markets consolidated near $55,000 for several days, bulls failed to defend the range on Thursday, resulting in sustained bearish action over the past day.On Thursday, Cointelegraph reported that significant profit-taking in the Bitcoin markets may suggest an impending local top, with today’s slump appearing to confirm the hypothesis. Analysts from JPMorgan similarly warned of sustained bearish action should BTC fail to reclaim the $60,000 level.The move below the psychological $50,000 mark has prompted mixed reactions on Twitter, with Messari researcher Mira Christanto noting the markets have only retraced from the all-time high by 23% — significantly less than the typical pull-backs experienced during the 2017 bull run that produced losses of 35% on average.But notorious gold bug and crypto-skeptic Peter Schiff was also quick to comment on the market action, poking fun at Bitcoin proponent Anthony Pompliano.Now that #Bitcoin is back below $50k I think it's time for @APompliano to tweet out $1k milestones on the way down the way he did on the way up.Pompliano responded: “Bitcoin is up 600% in last year. Gold is up 3% in last year. No more tweeting until gold can beat inflation, Peter!” Twitter user Fintwit also replied to Schiff, noting that “gold is up 0% since 2011.”Ether (ETH) also tumbled today, shedding roughly 8% in the past 24 hours. However, Ether has outperformed BTC over recent days, rallying to tag a new all-time high above $2,600 on Thursday.Highs on Thursday saw ETH/BTC trading at its strongest level since August 2018, with Ether trading for 0.047 BTC. Ether last changed hands for 0.045 BTC.Ether has dropped 11% over the past seven days, while Bitcoin is down 21% over the same period."
362,"A Bitcoin Cash (BCH) YouTuber has promised to buy 111 Tesla Model 3s … but only if Tesla CEO Elon Musk agrees to accept BCH for Tesla purchases from now on.Going by the title “1stmil.com,” the Australian YouTuber explained to almost 8,000 followers over three short videos that he believes Tesla would see a boost in sales as a result as there are many Bitcoin Cash supporters who want to spend their cryptocurrency, whereas Bitcoin (BTC) supporters tend to want to hang on to their holdings.In late March the Bitcoin Cash community was dismayed to learn that BCH had not been added as a payment option when Elon Musk confirmed that U.S. customers could buy a Tesla using BTC.The day following this public rebuff, BCH hit new all-time lows against Bitcoin of 0.089 BTC.It's unclear whether this latest BCH offer is just a publicity stunt by the YouTuber who has hosted his channel for three years now. 1stmil’s ability to pay for 111 Telsas is also an open question as the wallet shown in the first video, only holds approximately $141,000 in BCH, or enough to buy just three Teslas. On Reddit, he clarified that he purposefully did not want to reveal his other wallets for security reasons.Hahah!! Oh man, I am laughing out loud at the genius of this man:https://t.co/0ZaEWqwZp2

He knows that @ElonMusk's action of mentioning #BitcoinCash will also pump #BCH's price, therefore making it even easier for him to purchase 111 Tesla Model 3's.@KimDotcom @rogerkverIn earlier videos he alludes to already owning multiple millions in the crypto, predicting he will make $1 billion when BCH reaches $50,000 by 2025. If true that would mean he holds at least $14.88 million in BCH at current prices.The cars he plans to purchase, white Tesla Model 3s are currently sold in Australia for approximately $52,000. Not including the volume discount, this would equate to an initial purchase of $5.8 million.He said he intends to use the Tesla EVs for a new business project, the details of which he cannot reveal yet. However, on Reddit, he explained that the cars will be stripped out and repurposed: “Let’s just say Tesla model 3s are sold in Australia below cost. Their parts are worth more than their sum.”This isn’t the first time BCH proponents have brought the crypto to Elon Musk’s attention. On March 25, in response to Musk tweeting that “You can now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin,” Kim Dotcom compared BCH and BTC fees saying the former “is serving the mass market, not just the 1%.”Fair point"
363,"Some of Bitcoin’s most prominent backers have sought to make the case for Bitcoin’s environmental efficiency, with a collaborative paper from researchers at financial services firm Square and investment manager Ark Invest asserting that Bitcoin mining can drive increased efficiency in renewable energy production.The paper, authored by “The Bitcoin Clean Energy Initiative,” or BCEI, seeks to counter the claim that “the computation required to secure Bitcoin [...] is environmentally damaging and ruining the planet,” arguing that Bitcoin mining incentivizes the generation of electricity “from renewable carbon-free sources.”The paper has received support from top crypto luminaries including Square’s Jack Dorsey, Tesla’s Elon Musk, and Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood.TrueIn an April 22 Twitter thread, Square argues that while solar and wind can produce energy cheaper than fossil fuels, these renewable sources typically produce excessive supply when demand is low and conversely struggle to meet needs of consumers and industry when demand is high.According to the researchers, the issue of divergent renewable production and demand for electricity could be mitigated by building an ecosystem “where solar/wind, batteries, and Bitcoin mining co-exist to form a green grid that runs almost exclusively on renewable energy.”The paper describes the Bitcoin mining sector as “an energy buyer of last resort” that can be situated anywhere in the world.Despite solar and wind energy costing between roughly half and one-third of fossil fuels per kilowatt-hour, the paper asserts the geographical limitations of renewable power plans typically results in energy supply being “either abundant or non-existent.”By combining Bitcoin mining with renewable energy storage, the paper argues the limitations of batteries and energy dissipation can be offset by diverting excessive electricity to mining farms. If miners were able to capture just 20% of wind and solar energy that is delayed on U.S. power grids, BCEI estimates that global mining capacity could triple.The mobilization of miners as an electricity buyer of last resort would also bolster the profitability of the renewable energy sector, offering producers the opportunity for “arbitrage between electricity prices and Bitcoin prices.”The paper also asserts that the costs associated with expanding renewable energy will see accelerated decline.“The Bitcoin and energy markets are converging and we believe the energy asset owners of today will likely become the miners of tomorrow,” it said.Alright, I'm just gonna come out and say it. Bitcoin mining is bad for the environment. #bitcoin #EarthDay2021However, not everyone is convinced by BCEI’s assertions, with popular analyst Mati Greenspan describing the report as “justify[ing] Bitcoin’s massive energy consumption.”Rather than offer a solution to Bitcoin’s ever-increasing energy consumption, Greenspan describes BCEI’s paper as offering the blueprint for “an energy-intensive feedback loop.”“The main focus of the paper doesn't seem to seek out solutions so much as justify Bitcoin's massive energy consumption and paint a rosy picture of how it might positively impact the clean energy sector,” Greenspan argued.Earlier this year, researchers at the University of Cambridge estimated that Bitcoin consumes 121.36 terawatt-hours annually — ranking the network among the 30-largest energy users worldwide and above the country of Argentina."
364,"The big news this week happened on April 16th, when a major power outage in Xinjiang wreaked havoc on the BTC hash rate. According to local sources, the hash rates on Ant Mine Pool fell by 21.93%, BTC.com by 18.5%, Binance Mine Pool by 22%, and Huobi Mine Pool by 25.5%. Reports from Cointelegraph linked it with safety inspections resulting from a mine accident in the western-most province. Western China has a strong presence in the mining space due to cheap electricity and equally affordable real estate. Despite miners originally stating the impact would only last 1 to 2 days, the hash rate has yet to rebound. Currently the global rate is under 145 million TH/S, down from a peak of 172 million TH/S the day before the accident.Dogecoin mania set in as buyers on OKEx and Huobi helped drive the price up 370% in one week. These two predominantly Chinese exchanges accounted for 16.9% and 15.9% of global volumes respectively, with Binance making up only 5.2%. Chinese buyers tend to view all assets through the lens of a potential investment, a strong contrast to western investors who were more likely to make memes about the performance on social media.Dogecoin mania didn’t stop there. Tianyancha, a website for enterprise information, showed that two companies have tried to register the Chinese version of Dogecoin. The Chinese name, which literally translates to 'Dog-Coin', was the subject of trademark applications by two separate technology companies in Shanghai and Changsha. According to the source, the trademark is awaiting a substantive review.Binance recently appointed a new head of Greater China as the executive roles continue to shuffle. Binance is a very decentralized company which keeps many of the roles and structure hidden from the public eye. The company moved its head office out of China in 2017 after facing a lot of regulatory uncertainty. Still China possesses a high concentration of traders and investors, making the region extremely attractive for centralized exchanges.Li Bo, deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China, raised some eyebrows when he announced at a conference that the bank regards Bitcoin and stablecoins as investment alternatives. In a country where words are not generally left to chance, this is a strong indicator that Beijing’s stance on cryptocurrency continues to soften.In digital yuan news, many fear that stricter monitoring of currency could be another blow to the Macau gaming industry. The region, which depends on the mainland for around 70% of its traffic, would allegedly suffer if illegally-obtained funds became harder to traffic across borders.Finally, the former governor of the People’s Bank of China warned that applying digital taxes could trigger a tariff war. Speaking at the Boao Forum for Asia, he defended China’s growing presence in the digital economy by pointing out the importance of multilateralism. China is slowly extending its influence in neighboring countries through economic policies, a theme that could be accelerated by developed digital yuan infrastructure."
365,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent downturn temporarily pulled its dominance rate down to 49.5% which is the lowest level since August 2018. This has led a growing number of traders to predict that altcoins will outperform Bitcoin in the short term.Over the past few months, the price action from altcoins seems to be disengaging from Bitcoin. Take for example, Ether (ETH), which hit a new all-time high today even as Bitcoin price is down 20% from its all-time high.The major factor that could have tilted the scale in favor of altcoins is the massive rise in the popularity of the decentralized finance space. New York Stock Exchange president Thomas Farley pointed out in an interview with CNBC that “DeFi exchanges are doing as much volume if not more than Coinbase today.”Let’s look at the fundamentals and technicals of three tokens that have been on the rise in the past few months.Chainlink (LINK) is one of the most popular decentralized oracle solutions. To support the rapid pace of innovation in the crypto industry, Chainlink outlined its vision for the future in its new whitepaper dubbed Chainlink 2.0 on April 15.The whitepaper presents a new architecture for building hybrid smart contracts where second-layer networks called Decentralized Oracle Networks store and compute the data off-chain before feeding the input on the blockchain. This new concept could empower developers to build hybrid smart contracts quickly, similar to application programming interfaces (APIs) that developers build in the web world.Another positive for LINK investors came as Grayscale announced the addition of the altcoin to its Digital Large Cap Fund on April 6. Although the allocation is only 0.87%, the inclusion could bring it into the focus of institutional investors.On April 2 Polkadot and Chainlink announced that Chainlink’s price feeds woul be available as Substrate oracle pallet, enabling projects in the Polkadot ecosystem to integrate Chainlink oracles through a simplified library.LINK is currently correcting from its sharp rise from $23.61 on March 24 to the all-time high at $44.33 on April 15. Although the price plunged below the moving averages on April 18, the bulls aggressively bought at lower levels as seen from the long tail on the day’s candlestick.Since then, the bears and the bulls have been battling it out at the 20-day exponential moving average ($35.89). The bulls are attempting to defend the 20-day EMA support and launch the next leg of the up-move while the bears are trying to extend the correction by breaking the support.The marginally rising 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) above 57 indicate a minor advantage to the buyers. If the bulls can push and sustain the price above $40, the LINK/USDT pair could retest $44.33. A breakout of this resistance could start the next leg of the uptrend, which could reach $50 and then $55.72.This bullish view will invalidate if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the price down to the 50-day simple moving average ($31.42) and delay the start of the next leg of the uptrend.Band Protocol (BAND) was featured by Cointelegraph on Feb. 2 when its price was at $11.14. Since then the price h rallied to an all-time high at $23.30 on April 15, a gain of 109% in about two and half months.The protocol announced on April 15 that its oracle data is live on Google Cloud Public Data, which can be used to build traditional, hybrid blockchain and cloud applications. Band said that the integration into Google Cloud Public Data was the first among many use-cases being explored with partners “to bridge traditional enterprises and blockchain applications.”Band has continued to build partnerships to increase its market share. In the past month, it has announced partnerships with Krystal, Equilibrium, and Polygon. Additionally, one of the biggest financial institutions in Thailand, SCB 10X partnered with Band as a node validator.BAND is currently trading inside a large range between $11.50 and $20.62. The bulls had pushed the price above the overhead resistance of the range on April 15 and 16 but they could not build up on the breakout.This suggests that bears are active at higher levels. The sellers pulled the price back into the range on April 17, trapping the aggressive bulls. Long liquidations could be one of the reasons for the sharp fall on April 18 that momentarily dropped below the $11.50 support.However, the positive sign was that the bulls aggressively bought the dips on April 18 as seen from the long tail on the candlestick.After staying between both moving averages for the past three days, the BAND/USDT pair has broken above the 20-day EMA ($17.04) today. The pair could once again move up to $20.62 where the bears are again likely to mount a stiff resistance.The flat moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest that the range-bound action may continue for a few more days. A breakout and close above $21 could open the gates for the resumption of the uptrend. The next target on the upside could be $29.74.Qtum (QTUM) was covered by Cointelegraph on Feb. 11 when its price was at $7.59. The token took off and made an all-time high at $20.72 on April 19, rallying 173% in just over two months.The most eagerly awaited development is the transition from 128-second block average to 32-second block average that is expected to take place via a hard fork on April 30.On March 31 Qtum founder Patrick Dai said that the protocol was working to enable smart contracts for Filecoin through the Qtum network. On the same day, Dai teased that non-fungible tokens are also making their way on Qtum.QTUM’s Doji candlestick pattern on April 19 indicated that the uptrend could be losing steam. The short-term weakness was confirmed further when the price continued lower on April 20.The bulls are currently attempting to defend the 20-day EMA ($15.08). A strong bounce off this support will indicate that the sentiment remains positive and the bulls are accumulating on dips.The buyers will likely try to push the price to $18.63 and then $20.72. A breakout of this resistance will signal the resumption of the uptrend.However, the negative divergence on the RSI suggests the momentum may be weakening. If the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the QTUM/USDT pair could slump to the 50-day SMA ($10.47) where the buyers may step in to stall the decline.A strong rebound off the 50-day SMA could keep the pair range-bound for a few days while a break below the support will suggest the bears are back in the game.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

366,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been bouncing at the $51,000 support for the past 44 days. Typically, this would be interpreted as a positive occurrence, especially considering that the $50,000 level represents a 75% advance in 2021. However, cryptocurrency investors are typically short-term-focused and always overly optimistic. Thus, the current narrative for Bitcoin is slowly turning bearish but aside from sentiment, what story are the fundamentals telling?However, there is a possibility that the recent drop has its roots in the $1.55 billion options expiry set to occur on April 23. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, bears have a $340 million advantage below $57,000. That could also explain why pro traders kept a neutral stance despite the 18% dip over the past eight days.On the other hand, some analysts such as Willy Woo have said that the Chinese coal mining accident caused the violent drop in Bitcoin's hashrate. This event, plus the electricity outage in China's Xinjiang region, may have reduced the Bitcoin network's processing power by 19%, and it exposed its heavy dependency on coal-driven energy.While critics jumped in to bash Bitcoin, Coin Metrics co-founder Nic Carter produced a well-researched rebuttal to some of the key claims. Carter points out that Bitcoin mining, which is relatively portable, is concentrated in areas where electricity is unused and cheap.Moreover, while the gold industry is environmentally destructive and diesel energy-dependent, Bitcoin mining can be fully powered by clean energy. Unlike precious metals, Bitcoin miners' portability allows the use of previously wasted oil and gas resources.Whatever the case, pro traders haven't been adding positions during the recent BTC price correction.Major cryptocurrency exchanges provide data on their top traders' long-to-short net positioning. This indicator is calculated by analyzing clients' consolidated positions on the spot, margin, and futures contracts. By doing this, it provides a clearer view of whether professional traders are leaning bullish or bearish.It is important to note that there are occasional methodology discrepancies between various exchanges, so one should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.The chart above shows that top traders increased their exposure between April 14 and April 17, while the Bitcoin price was above $60,000. On the other hand, over the past five days, these whales and arbitrage desks remained relatively flat.It is worth noting that the current 1.49 ratio favoring longs on OKEx remains lower than the 1.75 level seen on April 17. This data signals that top traders reduced their positions over the past five days.A similar trend took place at Binance, where top traders net long-to-short ratio peaked at 1.25 on April 17. Albeit slightly favoring longs, the current 1.18 indicator sits at the lower range of the past three weeks.Lastly, Huobi top traders added long positions between April 14 and April 18, but they kept a steady 0.90 ratio.Therefore, there is no doubt that whales and arbitrage desks are not adding to their long positions even as BTC tests the $52,000 support with a 20% correction from the April 14 peak.However, investors are encouraged to wait for Friday's options expiry before jumping to any fast conclusions.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

367,"Square's Cash App, a Bitcoin-friendly mobile payments platform, has raised its minimum withdrawal requirements for BTC holders.The minimum withdrawal amount for Bitcoin accounts is now 0.001 BTC, or 100,000 satoshis, compared with 0.0001 BTC, or 10,000 satoshis, previously.With Bitcoin hovering around $51,800, 0.001 BTC is equivalent to $51.80. The leading cryptocurrency was in the midst of another large correction on Thursday, having fallen 6%. Bitcoin is down over 19% over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap data.“You must have a balance of at least 0.001 bitcoin to make a withdrawal,” reads Cash App’s withdrawal instructions. Users can still withdraw up to $2,000 worth of BTC every 24 hours and up to $5,000 within any seven-day period.Although Cash App appears to have updated its withdrawal terms silently, the change may be due to higher network fees. As Cointelegraph recently reported, BTC transaction fees are approaching all-time highs in dollar terms following a major decline in the network’s hash rate. The average cost of a Bitcoin transaction reached $58 on Tuesday, just shy of the $62 record set in December 2017.Cash App has emerged as a popular method for buying Bitcoin, with fees on purchases accounting for the lion’s share of its revenue. Cash App’s Bitcoin-derived revenue reached $1.63 billion in the third quarter of 2020, accounting for 80% of its total sales."
368,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is still stuck in what traders hope will be a short-term downtrend as the impact of the April 18 rumors of a crackdown on “unnamed financial institutions” for facilitating money laundering using cryptocurrencies has yet to be shaken off. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that since being pummeled below the $51,000 level on April 18, the price of BTC has been trading in a range between $52,500 and $57,500 and establishing a descending pattern of lower highs and lower lows.While regulatory concerns may have played some role in the current drawdown, there have been several other significant developments that have affected BTC's recovery.According to Micah Spruill, managing partner and chief investment officer at S2F Capital, a 20% to 25% drop in the Bitcoin hash rate caused by mandatory power blackouts in the Xinjiang region of China over the weekend ""forced approximately 80% of the miners in that area offline.”Spruill sees this drop in hash rate, combined with an all-time high in the Bitcoin futures open interest rate as the catalyst for “the perfect scenario for a major over-leverage washout.”In terms of what comes next for Bitcoin, Spruill pointed to an increase in bullish sentiment among analysts and traders “after much of the over-speculation in the market this month was tempered by the price pullback.”Spruill said:David Lifchitz, chief investment officer of ExoAlpha, echoed Spruill's perspectives, also pointing to regulatory concerns in the United States and the announced ban on cryptocurrencies in Turkey as “the match that lit the fire of an overleveraged trading environment” based on the perpetual swaps funding rate before and after the plunge.According to Lifchitz, Bitcoin is now back in the “$50,000 – $60,000 twilight zone,” which is characterized by institutional dip-buyers with orders at the $50,000 level, retail FOMO — the fear of missing out — above $60,000, and “trading bots playing ping-pong in the range in between.”Since the drawdown, Lifchitz has identified a temporary support for BTC in the middle of the range, around $54,000 to $55,000, but still considers it “too early to say if the dip is over.”Lifchitz said:Bitcoin’s current downtrend has opened the door for Ether (ETH) to step into the limelight, with the top-ranked altcoin by market capitalization hitting a new all-time high at $2,644 on the back of $47.3 billion in trading volume.Ether’s rally was accompanied by a 25% rally in the price of Maker's MKR, one of the oldest decentralized finance projects on the Ethereum network, which reached a new all-time high of $4,980.Solana's SOL has also been a strong performer as of late, surging 26% overnight to reach a new record high at $39.72.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $2.02 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 49.6%."
369,"Jackson, Tennessee is the latest city in the United States moving to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) payments and mining, following recent crypto developments in Florida.Jackson Mayor Scott Conger announced Wednesday that the city is actively exploring the option to pay its employees in cryptocurrency in addition to mining Bitcoin and adding it on the city’s balance sheet. The mayor hinted that the city is looking to enable payrolls in several digital assets, mentioning coins like Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC).“Local government will lead the way in #Bitcoin adoption, and along with it, usher in a new industrial revolution with sustainable economies that will help close the wealth gap,” Mayor Conger said in a Thursday tweet.The latest announcement comes shortly after Mayor Conger joined the crypto community’s “laser eyes” flash mob, changing his Twitter profile picture to include laser eyes earlier this week. The crypto laser eyes trend emerged in February, with industry leaders and users changing their Twitter profile avatars to include laser eyes in support of Bitcoin's price surge.The mayor’s move follows in the steps of Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who backed a major initiative to allow Miami residents to pay taxes and receive salaries in Bitcoin. The city commission has already supported a resolution to explore Bitcoin as an acceptable investment for municipal funds. A Miami-Dade County commissioner backed a similar tax resolution in April.“I’m just following your lead,” the Jackson mayor said in response to Mayor Suarez’s support of his latest crypto move.That’s my guy! https://t.co/Nk5tZ96tMA"
370,"Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin by market capitalization, hit new all-time highs on April 22 despite a bearish phase sweeping through Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed ETH/USD hitting $2,600 on April 22 for the first time, on the back of 9.2% daily gains.Against Bitcoin, Ether was also on fire, hitting 0.047 — its highest since August 2018.The second-largest cryptocurrency increasingly stood out against the rest on the day, as Bitcoin continued to consolidate lower and other altcoins suffered from a painful knock-on effect.Analysts and investors, already buoyed by the previous action from this year's ""alt season,"" were thus firmly bullish on the near-term prospects.""To be brutally honest, I stare at the chart of ETH/BTC and I see an enormous rounded bottom with potentially huge breakout just above,"" Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal told Twitter followers in a series of posts.Pal noted Ether's superior gains versus Bitcoin in recent times, part of a trend that has seen ETH/USD outperform by a considerable margin since the pit of the cross-asset price crash in March 2020.  As Cointelegraph reported, altcoins' overall strength this month was already expressing itself in Bitcoin's dwindling market cap dominance, which dipped below 50% for the first time in almost three years.Such events tend to spark the most intense part of ""alt seasons"" in which tokens see a rapid surge to a peak before cooling off.The latest ETH gains nonetheless came with a predictable pay-off: Gas fees for sending transactions began to spike on the day, a timely reminder for those caught unaware during previous phases of the bull market.Other misgivings about the market's overall strength included caution from professional traders based on Ether derivatives signals.Other altcoins, meanwhile, were beginning to show signs of life at the time of writing, including Litecoin (LTC) and Chainlink's LINK, both up around 6.5%."
371,"After weeks of Bitcoin (BTC) sell-offs, high-net worth Bitcoin holders, or whales, are finally back to buying.Their buying activity not only picked up when BTC's price broke out of the two-months ascending triangle to new all-time highs, but it has also stayed intact since the price crash on April 18.Whales' continuous buying activity comes at a time when the number of addresses holding more than 1,000 Bitcoin has reached its four-month support line.This is probably not a coincidence, as the turnaround takes place at a time when profit-taking in the market is close to its support line too.The level at which profit-taking takes place can be derived from the adjusted spent output profit ratio (aSOPR), which measures the ratio between the price sold and the price paid for a coin while disregarding temporary coin movements (movements within less than one hour).In other words, aSOPR measures how much profit holders were sitting on (in U.S. dollars) at the time they sold their coins.Since September 2020, profit-taking has continuously found positive support at higher levels. This suggests that whenever sell-offs have happened in the past seven months, sellers have been comfortable not selling at a higher profit level each time, compared with the previous sell-offs. However, this trend might eventually come to an end.When zooming out and looking at profit-taking behavior in all prior bull markets, it becomes apparent that this is not only a one-time or a short-term trend but rather a longer-term pattern in Bitcoin bull markets.These support lines tend to hold for three to 18 months. The chart below shows that a break of the second support line in each bull market hahistorically confirmed that the bull market top was in.Not only is the aSOPR close to breaking the seven-month support, but there is also one major difference in the latest pattern of this metric that could be a cause of concern.Usually, the short-term tops of the aSOPR come in at higher levels each time, as the price increases further and rising confidence leads people to hold on to higher profits after each sell-off.However, in the latest pattern, profits have been realized earlier in every sell-off wave for the last three months (see the red arrow), a pattern usually common after a bull market top was already in.The latest pattern could be explained by a slower price increase in recent months and a higher number of short-term holders realizing profits. This assumption is confirmed by looking at HODL waves, which visualize for how long Bitcoin is held.The redder the color, the shorter the holding period. It becomes visible that it is short-term holders, who have held Bitcoin for between one week and three months, who have been primarily selling into the market as of late.When looking at the profit-taking behavior of short-term holders only, one could infer that this cohort of traders might almost be done selling. The latest dip below the value of 1 shows that short-term holders have even started realizing losses.In a bull market run-up, this is usually where a bottom in price can be expected, as selling activity tends to decrease significantly.However, as bull market tops are not formed by a lack of sellers but rather by a lack of buyers, it is highly important to also look at the trend of the current demand side.Current on-chain volume activity suggests that the capital inflow trend is still intact. A high number of coins are still changing hands, suggesting that buying activity is still ongoing. The realized price, which expresses this buying activity by valuing all Bitcoin based on when it last moved on a daily basis, gives a good idea of how much capital has moved in and out of Bitcoin.A steep curve suggests high on-chain transaction volumes. If it is followed by a flat trend, it usually indicates the beginning of the bear market, as not enough buyers are coming into the market and willing to pay higher prices anymore. As long as this steep curve does not flatten, there should be no concern about a dwindling number of buyers.Although this evidence suggests that the bull market top is likely not in yet, there is also no clear confirmation that sellers are done selling just yet.A break of the aSOPR 10-day moving average support line could be confirmed in the next few days. This may signal a trend shift in sellers’ behavior from bullish to bearish. Therefore, a negative short- to mid-term scenario should be considered if this occurs.There are two major price support levels to look out for. The first one is around $51,325, which could be a support level where whales most recently acquired a high volume of Bitcoin.The second price support level is the network-value-to-transactions (NVT) ratio price, which is currently at $47,679 and is a major price support level in Bitcoin bull markets.If the market price were to fall significantly below the NVT price without a quick recovery within a few days, a detailed analysis of the demand side would be needed to judge if the market’s bullish structure has broken.The supply side suggests that sellers are currently in the driver's seat, even selling Bitcoin at a loss in the past few days. However, their selling activity is expected to significantly reduce over the next few days if current behavior stays in line with prior bull market sell-offs.If that is not the case, the breakdown of the aSOPR seven-month support line is likely and could signal a trend shift from bullish to bearish selling. Further downside should be expected, with the next major support in the range of $47,000 to $51,000.On the demand side, the capital flow still looks healthy. Enough volume is still willing to pay current prices, while whales have ramped up their buying again. Current price action is still above the NVT price, which suggests that current price fluctuations are still within the expected bullish territory.Nevertheless, the demand side should be watched closely for a potential dry-up in on-chain volume over the next few days if the price comes close to the NTV price.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

372,"Major Turkish cryptocurrency exchange Thodex has abruptly halted trading and withdrawals amid reports of police raids, Cointelegraph Turkey reported on Thursday.Thodex posted an official announcement on Twitter on Thursday, informing users that it has halted transactions for a period of four to five days. According to a statement, the platform stopped trading and withdrawals due to a purported partnership with “world-renowned banks and funding companies” to improve its services.Thodex said that its clients should not be worried about their investments, stating that “users will be informed regularly” during the suspension period. The exchange had previously announced a six-hour-long maintenance break on Tuesday.The abrupt suspension of trading and withdrawals has concerned the crypto community, as the exchange has gone radio silent since announcing the interruption.Local publications speculated that the suspension could be part of an exit scam amid reports that the company’s founder, Faruk Fatih Özer, has fled to Thailand with $2 billion worth of crypto. The founder allegedly left Istanbul Airport on Tuesday, while local authorities have launched a criminal investigation against the firm and raided Thodex’s offices.Thodex did not respond to Cointelegraph’s requests for comment.The news comes amid a new wave of concern over the Turkish government’s stance on cryptocurrency regulation. The country’s central bank officially announced a ban on crypto payments effective as of April 30. Additional reporting by Erhan Kahraman and Ayse Karaman."
373,"Bitcoin (BTC) revisited recent lows near $52,000 on Thursday as sustained weakness continued for the largest cryptocurrency.Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView revealed a lackluster day for BTC traders as BTC/USD briefly dipped below $53,000 before stabilizing around $1,000 higher. The move came as Bitcoin was about to lose its market cap dominance supremacy to altcoins in what traditionally marks the “real” start of the “alt season.”Charts from on-chain monitoring resource CoinMarketCap showed that as of Thursday, Bitcoin’s share of the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization stood at just 50.1%.Having decreased sharply this year despite its own price gains, Bitcoin’s market cap share versus altcoins looked set to break through support, which has held for over three years.Looking at historical behavior, each time Bitcoin loses the 50% mark, altcoins rapidly move in to pick up the slack, often led by Ether (ETH).The reshuffling thus sparks an altcoin run that truly fits the description of an “alt season” — rapid gains to a peak followed by a cooling-off period as Bitcoin regains some lost ground. This was the case in both mid-2017 and early 2018.Should history repeat itself, it would be music to the ears of altcoin investors, many of whom have long claimed that an “alt season” is already underway but has yet to show its true colors.A race to the top this time around could surprise even them, meanwhile, as many altcoins have already put in unbelievable performances in 2021.“BTC dominance 51.6%. The magic starts when 50% breaks,” popular Twitter account CryptoBull summarized last week.At the time of writing, Ether in particular was showing no signs of weakness in the face of fresh wobbles for BTC/USD, gaining 6% in 24 hours to approach $2,500 once again.Others were less optimistic, with the top 50 cryptocurrencies mostly down on the day.Dogecoin (DOGE), previously the star of the show, continued its slip after hitting all-time highs of $0.44 on some exchanges. DOGE/USD was already down 40% versus the high on Thursday."
374,"Bitcoin code contributors need to consider a move away from the cryptocurrency’s proof-of-work consensus mechanism, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen argued.In a Wednesday blog post, Larsen outlined major PoW-related vulnerabilities, noting growing concerns over Bitcoin’s carbon footprint. According to the executive, PoW-based coins like Bitcoin (BTC) should consider a code change to carbon-neutral validation methods like proof-of-stake or federated consensus, or something yet to be developed.“I would argue that such a change is critically important for Bitcoin to remain the world’s dominant cryptocurrency. PoW’s current energy demands and carbon footprint are already unsustainably high, with Bitcoin alone consuming an average of 132 TWh a year — equivalent to roughly 12 million U.S. homes,” Larsen noted.The co-founder pointed out that non-PoW altcoins — including Ethereum’s anticipated switch to proof-of-stake — make up 43% of all cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, with many new coins choosing to avoid PoW. “It’s clear which way the trend is moving,” he stated.Larsen mentioned that the XRP ledger has been using federated consensus to secure its network and validate transactions for about nine years. “It’s closed 62+ million ledgers without downtime, uses the energy equivalent of just 50 U.S. homes per year,” he noted. Some new successful altcoins like Binance’s native token Binance Coin (BNB) also operate a version of PoS, Larsen said.Larsen’s remarks come amid a significant drop in Bitcoin’s dominance on cryptocurrency markets. In March, the Bitcoin Dominance Index dropped below 60% for the first time since October 2020. As the altcoin market gains momentum, Bitcoin continues to lose its share of the market, with the dominance index falling to 50.7% on Wednesday.There has been a long-running debate between proponents of PoW and PoS, with the latter’s advocates seeing mining energy costs as the biggest problem for PoW. The Bitcoin and Monero community — some of the biggest PoW proponents — often argue that PoS cannot reach the level of security and decentralization provided by PoW.Niklas Nikolajsen, the founder of Swiss crypto broker Bitcoin Suisse, predicted that Bitcoin will shift to PoS once the Ethereum network proves the algorithm’s success."
375,"A group of anon uni students has come up with a way to hit former President Donald Trump where it hurts: by using his Tweets against him to raise money for charities they believe he ""despises.""'Strategic Meme Group Incorporated' has set up the website Drumpfs.io to sell Trump's tweets, at least as recorded by the Trump Twitter Archive. However, there's no digital certificate of authenticity and the legal status of ""ownership"" of Tweets outside of the Twitter platform is dubious to non-existent. One hundred of Trump's most infamous Tweets are selling for 4.5 ETH each, while regular missives from the former Leader of the Free World change hands for 0.0232 Ether.Around 97% of the money raised will be donated to Americares, Clean Air Task Force, ACLU, Southern Poverty Law Center, Doctors Without Borders, and NAACP, while the rest will fund overheads. Drumpfs can be resold on secondary platforms.NFTs have become an unlikely poster child for ruining the environment, ahead of other candidates like international flights, heavy industry and car commuters. Various estimates suggest OpenSea is responsible for a cumulative 67.8 million kilograms of carbon emissions, while the recent NFT drop from musical act The Weeknd apparently emitted more carbon than a plane flying from New York to London 86 times.Environmentally conscious NFT purchasers can now paste in the address of an NFT drop into the Aerial platform and it'll tell you how many carbon credits you need to buy from them to balance the scales. You can pay with either USD — or weirdly enough, Ethereum — a payment which itself presumably requires additional carbon credits.  Aerial co-founder Andreas Homer said: CryptoPunks are among the earliest, and consequently most valuable, NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain — with individual punks selling for more than $7 million each. In other words, most of us can't afford one to hang in the digital pool room. The Unicly CryptoPunks Collection (uPUNK) will offer 250 million fractional shares in a collection of 50 CryptoPunks. It's the largest collection of Punks to be tokenized so far (but it's not the first attempt to do so).At present, 80 investors have created 3.6 million shares at 5 cents each. While there's growing interest in fractionalizing high value NFT collections, SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce has warned such tokens could run afoul of securities laws.50 CryptoPunks have been fractionalized into uPUNK on Unicly.

This is the largest fractionalize CryptoPunks collection ever!

376,"Veteran trader and chart guru Peter Brandt has made a cheeky correlation between the current Bitcoin (BTC) market correction and the prevalence of “laser eyes” on Twitter.In a tweet on Sunday, the technical analyst tied the correction to irrational exuberance in markets as exemplified by the meme:The laser eyes meme that initially swept across crypto social media in February 2021 saw crypto influencers, industry leaders and regular users change their Twitter profile pictures to include laser eyes. The fad was to signify support for Bitcoin’s price surging until it hit $100,000.Coincidentally, it also roughly coincided with a local top for Bitcoin prices, which reached $57,800 on Feb. 21 before correcting 25% to bottom out at $43,500 a week later.In this week’s dip, Bitcoin has corrected from its recent all-time high of $64,600 on April 14 to current prices of $53,600 — a move of 17% at the time of writing.However, Brandt’s actually not all that concerned about the pullback. Brandt’s draw-down figures put the current correction closer to 20%, which he claims is “very mild historically.” In a tweet on Tuesday, he said there is a strong history of Bitcoin bull trends to test the 18-week moving average, which was at $46,615 at the time. This would entail a much larger correction of around 28%.Draw-down in Bitcoin of 20.0% to date is very mild historically.
There is a strong history of $BTC bull trends to test the 18 week MA (currently at 46,615).
I personally doubt such a retest will occur, but Bitcoin has a history of pulling surprises. pic.twitter.com/lyfXlgpAHKThe average correction magnitude from the past 14 retracements is around 35%, according to Brandt’s data. A fall to this level would send BTC prices tumbling back to $42,000.Other analysts have also pointed to the historical record as a reason not to worry. Rekt Capital tweeted that the February dip was three times deeper than this week’s dip:In February, Altcoin Market Cap retraced -21%

Then Altcoin Market Cap rallied +90% afterwards

Now Altcoin Market Cap is down -7% from its All Time Highs

The February dip was three times deeper than this one

People called for a new Bear Market in February too#CryptoBrandt explained his “laser eyes” theory in an interview with crypto researcher Laura Shin on April 13, stating that over-enthusiasm in any market is always a warning sign:At the time of writing, BTC is trading down 5% over the past 24 hours at $53,600."
377,"JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou believes that if Bitcoin (BTC) does not break above $60,000 within the next few days, the momentum signals could weaken “for several months, given their still-elevated level.” Another bearish voice was that of Guggenheim chief investment officer Scott Minerd who said in an interview with CNBC on April 20 that Bitcoin looked frothy and was at risk of a correction to $20,000 to $30,000.Minerd said that such a massive fall will be part of a normal market cycle and that will not alter his long-term target of $400,000 for Bitcoin.However, several analysts, including statistician Willy Woo, countered the bearish forecasts of technical traders with on-chain indicators. Woo pointed out that 14% of Bitcoin’s supply last moved above the $1 trillion market capitalization, hence this becomes a strong support and makes Bitcoin less likely to drop below $53,000.A recent survey by Gemini crypto exchange showed that 13% of the respondents planned to invest in cryptocurrencies in 2021. Extrapolating the numbers to the U.S. population, Gemini said that 19.3 million adults may join the crypto bandwagon this year, which “would nearly double the current crypto investor population of 21.2 million adults.”Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot the trends and then identify the paths of least resistance.The bulls are buying the dips to the $54,000 level as seen from the long tail on the candlesticks of the past three days. However, the buyers have not been able to clear the hurdle at the 50-day simple moving average ($56,769), which has flipped to resistance.The 20-day exponential moving average ($58,280) has started to turn down and the relative strength index (RSI) is trading below 43, indicating that the bears have a slight edge.If the price turns down from the moving averages, it will increase the possibility of a break below $54,000. If that happens, the BTC/USDT pair could drop to $50,460. The bulls are likely to defend this level aggressively.A strong rebound off $50,460 could keep the pair range-bound for a few days. However, if the bears sink the price below $50,460, the sentiment could sour and the pair may plummet to $43,006.77.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls can drive the price above $60,000. Such a move will suggest that traders continue to buy at lower levels. A breakout of the all-time high at $64,849.27 could attract momentum traders, starting the next leg of the up-move.Ether (ETH) strongly bounced off the $2,040.77 level on April 20, indicating aggressive buying by the bulls at lower levels. The successful retest of the breakout level at $2,040.77 is likely to attract further buying from short-term traders.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that bulls are in control. If the bulls can propel the price above the all-time high at $2,545.84, the ETH/USDT pair could pick up momentum and rally toward the next target objective at $2,745 and then $3,000.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, then a few days of consolidation between $2,040.77 and $2,545.84 is possible. The advantage will tilt in favor of the bears if the pair slips and sustains below $1,900.The failure of the bears to sustain Binance Coin (BNB) below the 20-day EMA ($476) on April 18 attracted buying on April 19. The momentum picked up further on April 20 and the bulls are now trying to thrust the price above the all-time high at $638.56 and resume the uptrend.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for BNB on April 20 at 20:30 UTC, just as the relief rally was picking up strength.The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.The 7-day chart above shows the VORTECS™ Score for BNB flipped green on April 20 when the price was $527.05.While the market was still contemplating the direction of the next move, the VORTECS™ Score picked up strength and BNB also followed higher, hitting $608.31 about 16-hours later.If they succeed, the BNB/USDT pair could start its journey toward the next target objective at $832. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to mount a stiff resistance in the $600 to $638.56 resistance zone. If the bulls do not cede much ground, it will enhance the prospects of a breakout of the resistance zone.Conversely, if the price dips back below $520, then the bears may make one more attempt to break the 20-day EMA. A break below $428 could result in a deeper correction.The bulls are aggressively attempting to defend the 20-day EMA ($1.26). This suggests the sentiment in XRP remains positive. The gradually upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone indicate a minor advantage to the bulls.The XRP/USDT pair may now rally to $1.56 where the bears are likely to again mount stiff resistance. If the price turns down from this resistance, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the price below the 20-day EMA.If they succeed, the pair could extend its decline to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.10. Conversely, a break above $1.56 could put the bulls back in the driver’s seat.The bulls attempted to resume the uptrend in Dogecoin (DOGE) on April 19 but they could not clear the hurdle at the all-time high of $0.45. The price turned down sharply from $0.43, indicating that traders are booking profits on rallies.The DOGE/USDT pair has formed an inside-day candlestick pattern today, suggesting indecision among the bulls and the bears. If the price turns down and breaks the $0.27 support, the pair could decline to the 20-day EMA ($0.19).A strong rebound off the 20-day EMA will suggest that the bulls continue to buy at lower levels. However, after such a deep correction, the next leg of the uptrend could be delayed.If the 20-day EMA support cracks, the selling could intensify as several traders who are stuck at higher levels may book their losses. The price could then drop to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.14.Cardano (ADA) dipped below the 50-day SMA ($1.20) on April 20 but the bulls staged a swift recovery. This shows that the bulls continue to buy at lower levels. If the buyers push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA ($1.27), a rally to $1.48 is possible.On the other hand, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the ADA/USDT pair could drop to the support of the range at $1.03.The flat moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest the pair could remain range-bound between $1.03 and $1.48 for a few more days.The next trending move could start if the bulls drive the price above the $1.48 resistance or the bears sink the pair below the $1.03 support.Polkadot (DOT) bounced off $31.55 on April 20 but the buyers are struggling to build upon the initial recovery today, indicating hesitation to buy at higher levels.The downsloping 20-day EMA ($38.96) and the RSI in the negative territory indicate that the bears have the upper hand. If the price turns down from the moving averages, it will suggest that traders are selling on rallies.That will increase the likelihood of a break below $31.55. If that happens, the decline could extend to $26.50.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls push the price above the moving averages. Such a move will open the gates for a rally to $42.28 and then to the all-time high at $48.36.The long tail on the candlesticks of the past three days shows strong accumulation by the bulls at lower levels. The buying picked up momentum today and the bulls are attempting to push and sustain Uniswap (UNI) above the $35.20 resistance.If they manage to do that, the UNI/USDT pair could retest the all-time high at $39.60. A breakout of this resistance could signal the start of the next leg of the uptrend, which may reach $44.88 and then $50.The 20-day EMA ($32.62) has started to turn up and the RSI has risen above 58, indicating advantage to the bulls.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level and slips below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days.Litecoin (LTC) slipped below the 20-day EMA ($252) on April 20 but the bulls arrested the decline at $234.43. The long tail on the day’s candlestick suggests strong buying at lower levels. The buyers are currently attempting to sustain the price above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $270.12.If they succeed, the LTC/USDT pair could rally to the 50% retracement level at $282.51 and then to the 61.8% retracement level at $294.91. The marginally rising 20-day EMA and the RSI above 58 suggest a slight advantage to the bulls.On the contrary, if the price turns down from $270.12, it will suggest that the sentiment has turned negative and the bears are selling on rallies. That will increase the possibility of a drop to the 50-day SMA ($216).The bulls have successfully defended the support at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $828.24. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) could now rally to $1,041.70 where the bears may again mount a stiff resistance.However, the upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the bulls can drive the price above $1,041.70, the BCH/USDT pair could retest the 52-week high at $1,213.51.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($797), it will increase the likelihood of a deeper correction. The 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $737.31 may act as a support but if it cracks, the pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($618).The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

379,"The chief investment officer of investment giant Guggenheim has repeated his warning that Bitcoin (BTC) will crash to $20,000.In an interview with CNBC on April 20, Scott Minerd warned again that Bitcoin could lose half of its value in a pullback.“Given the massive move we’ve had in Bitcoin over the short run, things are very frothy, and I think we’re going to have to have a major correction in Bitcoin,” Minerd told the network.Bitcoin lingered near $55,000 on April 21, having bounced off $52,000 in the latest pullback of its 2021 bull market.For Minerd, who last claimed in January that BTC/USD would return to $20,000, such an event would form part of a normal market cycle’s ups and downs. His longer-term forecast of $400,000 per Bitcoin still stands, he said.“I think we could pull back to $20,000 to $30,000 on Bitcoin, which would be a 50% decline, but the interesting thing about Bitcoin is we’ve seen these kinds of declines before,” he continued.Minerd, who previously garnered controversy over his BTC price remarks, was nevertheless not alone in his bearish near-term prognosis. As Cointelegraph reported, JPMorgan Chase analysts likewise sounded the alarm this week, their concern focused on futures markets.Reacting, Bitcoin proponents dismissed any idea that deeper losses were inevitable, referencing a combination of factors including strong on-chain indicators.“Wrong,” Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano responded to Minerd.On Jan. 20, the executive claimed that Bitcoin had put in a price top for the remainder of the year.

381,"April 14 was considered by many crypto enthusiasts all over the world as a watershed moment for the digital asset industry, as it marked the day when Coinbase, one of the largest crypto trading platforms in the world, made its debut on Nasdaq via a direct listing. As one can imagine, the lead up to the moment was replete with a market-wide surge, with Bitcoin (BTC) scaling up to a price point of $64,800 a day before the listing went live.In the run-up to Coinbase’s Nasdaq debut, COIN’s reference price was set at just $250, with all of the company’s staff receiving a total of 100 shares each. What’s more, in true crypto fashion, COIN’s debut was mired by volatility, with stock prices rising sharply to around $430 just minutes after trading commenced.However, following this positive price movement, the value of COIN proceeded to plunge drastically — all within a matter of hours — finally wrapping up its debut at a respectable price point of $328. Since then, COIN’s value has continued to hover between $320 and $345, settling at the lower end of that range exactly one week after the listing. At the time of writing, the stock’s total market capitalization is touted to be worth just under $64 billion, some way off the previously estimated $100 billion.COIN’s debut within the traditional finance sector is widely considered to be an important step forward for the crypto industry, especially since it provides investors — who may not be interested in trading digital assets otherwise — with indirect exposure to cryptocurrencies.Providing his thoughts on the subject, Jelle Pol, project manager for oil and gas multinational Shell’s first three blockchain projects as well as business director for Dusk Network — a privacy-oriented blockchain protocol — told Cointelegraph that Coinbase’s direct listing is potentially a very interesting wake-up call for companies and regulators that are still sticking with the “anything crypto-related is bad” angle, adding:Indeed, with Coinbase’s listing potentially bridging the gap between the traditional finance sector and crypto, an increasing number of mainstream players seem to be quite bullish on COIN. For example, New York-based asset management firm Ark Invest was quick to snap up more than 1 million shares — currently worth around $350 million — which will be spread out across three of the company’s exchange-traded fund offerings.Furthermore, it bears mentioning that back in 2013, American venture capital firm Union Square invested in Coinbase at $0.20 a share, essentially allowing the company to amass a total stock haul that is now worth more than $4.6 billion.That said, the company’s biggest backer by far is venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, through its A16z crypto fund, “which owns shares in the crypto exchange worth about $9.7 billion.” According to the information contained in Coinbase’s prospectus, just seven months after the conclusion of the firm’s Series A funding round, A16z led a $25-million Series B round, buying shares at $1 apiece.Subsequently, the firm was able to purchase $57.1 million worth of shares in October 2019, from Union Square at $23 apiece and then another $30 million in Coinbase stock at $28.83 a share just 12 months later.Outside of Union Square and A16z, fintech-focused venture firm Ribbit Capital is the third-largest investor in Coinbase, with the company owning a total of 12 million shares — worth approximately $3.9 billion — of the cryptocurrency exchange via its Series A funding round. Some of the other major players that had gotten a piece of the action include Tiger Global, Institutional Venture Partners, AH Equity Partners and DFJ Growth.Additionally, insider activity reports suggest that a number of Coinbase’s early-stage investors, as well as members of its executive brass, sold billions worth of equity shortly after the direct listing. For example, Coinbase chief financial officer Alesia Haas sold some 255,500 shares at $388.73 per share while retaining certain options. Similarly, Brian Armstrong, the platform’s current CEO, sold 749,999 shares in three transactions at various prices, netting around $291 million.That being said, while the filings initially seemed to portray a picture wherein multiple Coinbase executives sold a large part of their stake in the firm to net handsome profits, a representative for Coinbase told Cointelegraph that the sellers still maintain strong ownership positions.According to independent investment research firm CFRA, Coinbase’s stock value can potentially grow by a whopping 20+% in the near future, primarily due to the accelerated adoption of crypto-enabled technologies around the globe and the entry of more institutional players into this nascent space.In this regard, a group of CFRA analysts led by Chris Kuiper stated in a recent note to the company’s clients that within the next 12 months or so, the price of COIN could settle at around the $400 level. Not only that, but the research firm has also given its clients the green light to purchase Coinbase stock, even affording the stock a “buy” rating.Kuiper and his team believe that investors can potentially earn up to $6.89 per share for 2021 and $3.00 for 2022, pointing out that they see operating margins ramping up, which can eventually stabilize around the 35% mark. “Our base case scenario implies COIN not only becomes one of the largest financial exchanges for crypto but it is also successful in diversifying into other products and services, most notably those aimed at institutional investors,” he added.CFRA analysts have chalked out three possible scenarios for Coinbase. Firstly, they believe that COIN may be faced with bearish momentum in the coming months, causing the stock to dip to $120. The second scenario is one where the stock hits $400 and stabilizes around that range. The third case revolves around the share prices going bullish and scaling up to a price point of $840.Almost a week after the Coinbase listing, a representative for the company announced that Nasdaq started trading options for Coinbase Global — COIN.O — effective April 20. The launch of equity options will offer investors yet another avenue through which they can bet on Coinbase’s future. Simply put, equity options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock at a certain price, known as the strike price, on or before an expiration date.In the aftermath of Coinbase Global Inc. going public, the crypto market has been faced with turbulence, with the value of Bitcoin plunging by 15% in the days following the listing, dropping from $64,000 to $51,000, albeit briefly. Similar dips were witnessed across the board, with Ether (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), XRP and Cardano (ADA) also being on the receiving end of some serious negative price action.Furthermore, as part of the above-stated development, the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency sector dropped from $2.37 trillion to $1.87 trillion, only to rise once again to around $2 trillion. “With hindsight it was inevitable. Markets got too excited around the $Coin direct listing. Basis blowing out, coins like $BSV, $XRP and $DOGE pumping,” Galaxy Digital founder Michael Novogratz tweeted recently.Furthermore, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci stated following the listing that he was surprised that Coinbase’s debut was not met with more attention from banks, insinuating that legacy institutions still have been unable to realize the immensity of the crypto-led financial revolution that is currently sweeping the globe.It now remains to be seen if more cryptocurrency exchanges follow in the footsteps of Coinbase and go public in the near term, essentially bolstering traditional investor confidence in this yet evolving space.In this regard, digital asset trading platform Kraken recently announced that while it is unsure of when it will go public, it will pursue a direct listing rather than the special-purpose acquisition company route, which Israeli brokerage platform eToro took recently."

Smith stated that Baillie Gifford’s participation in the round marked “one of their first investments in a crypto company.”“It’s also a validation that a balanced and diversified retail/institutional business has incredible growth potential in the coming years,” the CEO wrote.With over $445 billion in assets under management, Baillie Gifford has emerged as a major tech investor, gaining nearly $28 billion by betting early on Tesla and Alibaba, and pharmaceutical company Moderna. One of the largest outside Tesla investors, Baillie Gifford reaped a $16 billion profit from its Tesla investment alone as of August 2020. The company is also known for backing companies like Google, Amazon and Airbnb.Baillie Gifford’s bet on Blockchain.com comes amid increasing investor attention to the company and the wider crypto industry as well. United Kingdom-based Blockchain.com is one of the biggest fundraisers this year, securing $420 million in two funding rounds in February and March and bringing the firm to a $5.2-billion valuation.According to data from business analytics firm CB Insights, crypto and blockchain firms including Blockchain.com, BlockFi and Dapper Labs received more funding in the first quarter of 2021 than over the entire course of 2020."
383,"Beatport, a digital music portal for DJs and musicians, announced this week that it would begin accepting Bitcoin (BTC) as a means of payment on its website. Beatport hosts and sells music tracks for use by DJs, returning a portion of the proceeds to the original artist.The company announced that it would accept Bitcoin starting in June. Beatport CEO Robb McDaniels said the decision to accept BTC was born out of a desire to continue innovating, even amid the COVID-19 pandemic.“When it benefits and strengthens the artist community, there is no reason to stop innovating. It’s clear that, even in the midst of a pandemic, the DJ/Producer community is willing to lead the industry towards embracing new technology and innovative mediums for engaging with their fans,” said McDaniels, adding, “And the world of crypto currencies and nonfungible tokens are a clear example of this fact.”Beatport announced on the same day that it would launch its own nonfungible token, or NFT, range titled “Music for Future Dance Floors” on Friday, in cooperation with Crypto.com. With Crypto.com Coin (CRO) ranked around 30th by market capitalization, having a current valuation of just over $5 billion, Crypto.com is a multifaceted cryptocurrency project with focuses ranging from in-store crypto-card payments to passive income staking and tokenization.The audio-visual NFT will reportedly feature collaboration from a number of prominent musicians and artists. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to charity. McDaniels said that the company was committed to reaping the benefits that future developments in blockchain technology would bring.“For Beatport, this is just the beginning of our exploration into the metaverse and we are committed to the long-term opportunities this revolutionary technology portends,” he said.Recently, a music school in Edinburgh, Scotland, announced that it would begin accepting Bitcoin as a form of tuition payment. The rush by companies to accept Bitcoin as a payment method was no doubt hastened by its spectacular price gains over the course of the past year — despite the fact that transaction fees have risen hand in hand."
384,"Nearly two-thirds of adults in the United States are interested in learning more about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or holding them soon, according to a new survey.Gemini, a crypto trading platform owned by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, released a new State of U.S. Crypto Report, providing insights about consumer trends in the crypto market in the U.S. The data was collected from a national survey of 3,000 U.S. adults aged 18 to 65 with $40,000 or more in household income.The report points to a significant expansion and diversification of the nation’s crypto investors over the course of 2021. As many as 63% of respondents identified themselves as crypto-curious, meaning that they do not currently own crypto but are either willing to learn more or planning to buy crypto soon.Based on survey findings, Gemini estimates that nearly 14% of the U.S. population — or 21.2 million adults — now owns cryptocurrency. Crypto investors are potentially set to double this year as roughly 13% of respondents indicated plans to purchase crypto in 2021. “This adds up to approximately 19.3 million adults — which would nearly double the current crypto investor population,” the report notes.The survey also identified the potential growth of female crypto investors, which make up just 26% of current crypto holders, according to Gemini’s estimations. According to the survey, more women than men indicated a willingness to get into crypto soon, making up 53% of crypto-curious respondents interested in investing in crypto.“This new research signals a valuable and welcome diversification of crypto’s investor base. A broader set of participants establishes a positive long-term evolution of the market,” Gemini chief operation officer Noah Perlman said. In order to help remove barriers to entry, the company will continue providing crypto education while also prioritizing security and smart regulation, he added.Other reports released earlier this year have signaled promising trends in cryptocurrency adoption in the U.S. A March survey by Mizuho Securities estimated that 10% of the roughly $400 billion in stimulus funds given to U.S. residents could be used to purchase Bitcoin and stocks. According to a February 2021 poll by global consumer research platform Piplsay, 25% of Americans already own crypto, with another 27% planning to invest later this year."
385,"Bitcoin (BTC) is seeing a tsunami of new user adoption as a backdrop to prices likely bottoming at around $52,000, say analysts.In a series of tweets on Tuesday, statistician Willy Woo led calls for calm about Bitcoin’s recent price dip and subsequent lingering $9,000 below recent all-time highs.Reiterating previous assertions, Woo argued that buyer support had firmly established Bitcoin as a trillion-dollar asset and that BTC/USD would, therefore, not fall much below the equivalent spot price to maintain it — around $53,000.“This revisit of lower price has created incredibly strong price validation for Bitcoin about $1T cap. 14% of the supply last moved above $1T cap,” he wrote.Woo also highlighted the continued transfer of coins from weak hands to strong ones, along with a surge in new users entering the space. For fellow analyst William Clemente III, this “hockey stick” shape of new adoption was of essential significance.“This is the most important post of this thread by far,” he replied to Woo, who noted that technical traders had been far more bearish on Bitcoin despite the strength of on-chain indicators.JPMorgan’s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, in his latest note, argued that this price dip would not see buyers step in like before.Futures positions unwinding, he added, would not reverse, and thus, overall interest in institutional Bitcoin bets would now fade.“Over the past few days Bitcoin futures markets experienced a steep liquidation in a similar fashion to the middle of last February, middle of last January or the end of last November,” Bloomberg quoted the note as stating.At the time of writing, BTC/USD was still undecided on its short-term trajectory, clinging to $55,000 as signs of life returned to certain altcoins.One cryptocurrency no longer outperforming was Dogecoin (DOGE), which was down 18% on Wednesday after “Dogecoin Day” — an attempt to boost the price to $4.20 — fell flat on its face.DOGE/USD remained up 160% in a week."
386,"Bitcoin (BTC) price is making a slow recovery after facing a sharp 16% correction in the early hours of April 18.While some analysts blame a 9,000 BTC deposit at Binance, others focused on the hashrate drop caused by a coal mining accident in China. Regardless of the reason behind the $51,200 low, options market makers were forced to adjust their exposure.Typically, arbitrage desks seek non-directional exposure, meaning they are not directly betting on BTC moving in any particular direction. However, neutralizing options exposure usually requires a dynamic hedge, meaning positions must be adjusted according to Bitcoin's price.These arbitrage desks' risk adjustments usually involve selling BTC when the market drops, which as a result, adds further pressure to long liquidations. Therefore, it makes sense to understand the current level of risk as the April 23 options expiry approaches. We will attempt to dissect whether or not bears will benefit from a $50,000 BTC price.Before the April 18 correction, BTC accumulated 74% gains in three months as it marked a $64,900 all-time high. Thus, it is natural for investors to approach protective options more heavily.While the neutral-to-bullish call (buy) option provides the buyer with upside price protection, the opposite happens with the more bearish put (sell) options. By measuring each price level's risk exposure, traders can gain insight into how bullish or bearish traders are positioned.The total number of contracts set to expire on April 23 totals 27,320 BTC, which is $1.55 billion at the current $56,500 price. However, bears and bulls are apparently balanced as the call (buy) options total 45% of the open interest.While the initial picture seems neutral, one must consider that the $64,000 call (buy) and higher options are almost worthless, with less than three days left before expiry. A more bearish situation emerges when these 6,400 bullish contracts currently trading below $50 each are removed.The neutral-to-bearish put options dominate with 70% of the remaining 19,930 BTC contracts. The open interest stands at $1.13 billion considering the current Bitcoin price, and this gives the bears a $450 million advantage.One can see that bulls were caught off-guard as Bitcoin retraced 13% after the April 14 all-time high. A meager 3,000 BTC call options are left below $58,000, which is only 24% of the total.Meanwhile, the neutral-to-bearish put options amount to 9,000 BTC contracts at $55,000 and higher strikes. This difference represents a $340 million open interest that favors bears.As things currently stand, the expiries between $57,000 and $64,000 are reasonably balanced, which suggests that the bears have an incentive to keep the price down on April 23.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
387,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) was struggling to stay above $56,000 on April 20, which whale clusters pinpointed as a crucial short-term price level.Yet, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) has continued to fall in recent weeks, dropping to its lowest point in seven weeks to 90.85.Alternative stores of value in the likes of Bitcoin and gold are priced against the U.S. dollar. Hence, when the dollar drops, the value of Bitcoin should theoretically increase, as BTC trades against the dollar.In recent days, however, Bitcoin has performed poorly following the highly anticipated public listing of Coinbase.The trend is concerning because the probability is higher for Bitcoin to see an uptrend when the dollar is declining, as shown by the inverse relationship in the chart above.But in recent days, Bitcoin has been having a hard time remaining above a key whale cluster level at $56,000, which indicates that there is heavy selling pressure on BTC, particularly as the price is struggling to rebound above the 50-day moving average (the green line in the chart below). Moreover, some analysts say the dollar may see a relief rally. If this occurs, it should create a less favorable environment for Bitcoin to regain its momentum.In a note to clients obtained by CNBC, Commerzbank strategist You-Na Park-Heger said that the eurozone's vaccine optimism and the Federal Reserve's firm stance on inflation likely drove the dollar's decline.While this put an immense amount of pressure on the dollar in the short term, Park-Heger said that the trend could possibly change in the weeks to come.She said:But not everyone agrees that the dollar will resume its uptrend. Credit Agricole researcher Valentin Marinov, for example, said that the attractive yields in alternative markets are putting pressure on the dollar.Marinov explained:10T Holdings co-founder Dan Tapiero also expects more downside for the dollar, stating that its bear market hasn't even started. How early is it still for #Bitcoin?

The US dollar bear market hasn't even begun yet.In any case, the futures market and high leverage appear to have a more immediate impact on Bitcoin's price, while a weakening dollar should continue to be a bullish factor for BTC in the medium to long term.In the short term, Bitcoin could get a boost from some bullish news and regain technical momentum. For example, Venmo's support for Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) saw its price bounce back to $56,000.Starting April 20, over 70 million customers will be able to buy, hold and sell crypto directly within the Venmo app as the feature gets rolled out over the next three weeks.Additionally, WeWork announced it will be accepting cryptocurrency payments and holding them on its balance sheet.In the foreseeable future, this renewed momentum could allow Bitcoin to regain its footing after a week of rare underperformance in tandem with the dollar.

388,"Bitcoin (BTC) saw a staunch comeback on Tuesday thanks to fresh bullish news from PayPal combined with solid on-chain indicators. Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD bouncing to $56,000 during Tuesday trading, hours after hitting local lows of $53,300.With volatility still present, the pair nonetheless looked increasingly reliable above $52,000, a significant support zone and the floor seen during last Sunday’s flash crash from all-time highs.News that PayPal-owned payment company Venmo had launched cryptocurrency buying and selling to its app appeared to buoy the recovery. On the flip side, a social media-induced “Dogecoin Day” was adding pressure to Bitcoin’s immediate upside prospects as funds continued to flow into Dogecoin (DOGE) on the day.As Cointelegraph reported, the aim of the “celebration” is to launch DOGE/USD to $4.20 to coincide with the date and the week in which SpaceX “Technoking” Elon Musk promises to “put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon” with his latest rocket launch. The hashtag #Doge420 was trending on Twitter at the time of writing, with DOGE/USD trading at just over $0.38, coincidentally up 420% in a week but flat on the day. United States traders were yet to wake up, leaving the prospect of gains later in the day open.Back within Bitcoin, meanwhile, traders were eyeing one indicator in particular as signaling both solid support at $52,000 and that this week’s dip would now bounce definitively. Stochastic relative strength index (RSI), an expression of RSI’s own strength, hinted that Sunday’s dip was already following the pattern of six previous pullbacks in BItcoin’s current bull run.As such, daily performance should now see BTC/USD lifted off its recent floor and continue grinding upward.TradingView account Elliot0511, who uploaded a chart showing the habitual behavior, said in comments that there was no reason to think that this time would be different. It summarized:Popular Twitter account IncomeSharks likewise highlighted the floor price level and pointed to decreasing DOGE inflows being apt to fuel Bitcoin’s comeback.“If you are willing to buy a hyped up meme coin at these prices, you should have no problem adding some Bitcoin spot here,” it told followers Tuesday."
389,"Payments app Square made headlines — and dollars — when it integrated Bitcoin trading into its mobile platform back during the crypto bull market of winter 2017. Now, rival payments firm Venmo, owned by PayPal, is following suit by launching cryptocurrency trading for four major coins: Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litceoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).Beginning on Tuesday and set to be widely available within the new few weeks, Venmo’s 70 million+ customers will be able to buy, hold and sell crypto directly within the Venmo app. The launch is offering users access to in-app guides to help them to better navigate the cryptocurrency trading space and will encourage them to share their cryptocurrency experiences via the Venmo feed. Venmo users will be able to buy as little as $1 worth of cryptocurrency and can use either funds from their Venmo balance or from a linked bank account or debit card to buy and sell their holdings.Over 30% of Venmo customers have already begun to purchase cryptocurrency or equities, according to the company’s research into 2020 customer behavior. Of these, 20% began their purchase during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that the public health and concurrent economic crisis has accelerated trends in digitization and experimentation with new financial technologies.Support for cryptocurrency on Venmo is facilitated through a partnership with Paxos Trust Company, a regulated provider of crypto products such as its stablecoin and other services. Venmo owner PayPal is also the holder of a conditional Bitlicense from the exacting New York State Department of Financial Services. Conditional licensees, such as PayPal, are required to pair off with firms that have already been granted full-blown licenses — as, in this case, has Paxos.Just under a week ago, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman hinted at developments underway since the payments giant first went live with its crypto offering in the United States in November of last year. Schulman said that PayPal aims to support the use of crypto for everyday transactions and to tap into smart contracts and other, more expansive features of blockchain technology. He also pitched the company’s vision of leveraging crypto for the attainment of a more “inclusive economy,” in which “things will be done much differently than today.”"
390,"Bitcoin (BTC) transaction fees measured in United States dollars are near 2017 levels amid a massive hash rate drop on the Bitcoin network.According to data from several Bitcoin monitoring resources, the average BTC transaction fee in U.S. dollars is near the all-time high recorded back in 2017. According to data from blockchain explorer Blockchair, the average cost of a Bitcoin transaction surged Tuesday to $58, approaching its all-time high of above $62 recorded in December 2017. Popular Bitcoin monitoring source BitInfoCharts suggests that current BTC fees have already broken the record of $54 in 2017 at $58 on Tuesday.Other sources, including major blockchain explorer Blockchain.com, also show that the average BTC transaction cost on Tuesday hit $58.Despite several sources showing the current BTC transaction fee near $60, other sources show a much lower figure. Major Bitcoin analytics website Clark Moody reports an average BTC fee value in dollars — over the last 2,016 blocks — of $27.5 at the time of writing. According to data from Ycharts, the average Bitcoin transaction commission is $43 at publishing time after hitting $50 on Sunday.BTC transaction fees hit over $50 in late 2017 when Bitcoin surged to $20,000 for the first time. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $55,190 following a correction from its all-time high of above $64,000 last week. The latest spike in BTC transaction fees comes amid a major decline in the Bitcoin network hash rate. On Sunday, Bitcoin saw the largest daily drop in the total BTC network hash rate since November 2017, plummeting from 172 million terahashes per second to around 154 million TH/s. According to crypto observers, the decline is likely to be attributed to massive power outages in the Chinese mining hub of Xinjiang.The decline in the BTC network hash rate could eventually impact the mining difficulty of Bitcoin, potentially pulling the measure downwards. Happening once every 2,016 blocks, — or roughly every two weeks — the next Bitcoin difficulty adjustment is expected to happen in 12 days. According to online estimates, the next BTC difficulty adjustment could be the largest downward adjustment since November 2020 if the hash rate doesn’t recover by early May.Amid spiking BTC transaction fees, some crypto exchanges have rushed to introduce less expensive ways to move Bitcoin around, with OKEx integrating the Lightning Network on Monday."
391,"Bitcoin has dropped below $54,000 on April 20 while whale clusters suggest that the key areas for BTC to reclaim in the short term are $56,274 and $55,172.The cryptocurrency market began to drop once again after an initial relief rally on Monday. Bitcoin dropped from $57,400 to sub-$54,000, losing the $55,172 whale cluster support level.In the near term, it is crucial for Bitcoin to rally above $55,172 and reclaim it as a support level. Otherwise, it is at risk of testing the $51,000 macro support area.Whale clusters form when whales or high-net-worth investors purchase or sell a significant amount of Bitcoin.Since whales tend to purchase Bitcoin at an area they previously bought at to defend their position, whale clusters are often a positive indicator of strong support areasAnalysts at Whalemap, a data analytics platform that tracks whale activity, noted that there is a lot of whale volume at $58,000.In the short term, with $58,000 acting as an area of interest, the analysts said $56,274 and $55,172 are the key near term levels to watch.The analysts said:If Bitcoin does not reclaim $56,274 and continues to decline, it would mean that whales are not adding to their existing positions.If this is the case, the $51,000 macro support level would be at risk of being tested once again, as Cointelegraph previously reported.The $51,000 level is critical because if that breaks, it would cause the higher low structure of Bitcoin to break down, which may put the entire Bitcoin bull market in danger.""These are the key levels to look out for right now,"" Whalemap analysts added.On April 18, the price of Bitcoin fell sharply from the $60,000 mark to nearly $50,000 on the day's lowest point.According to the analysts at Whalemap, it weren't just long-time holders that sold, but also whales and high net worth investors.They wrote:Based on this trend, it is difficult to speculate whether Bitcoin would see a major rally in the near term and resume its uptrend once more. Several notable traders shared a similar sentiment. Pseudonymous trader, ""Trader XO,"" said that while he is not bearish he does sees the potential of a deeper retracement.He said:"
392,"Buying something with Bitcoin (BTC) in Turkey will soon be illegal, and the topic of crypto payments has become a political debate since the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey’s April 16 announcement that it will forbid the use of cryptocurrency as a payment method. The regulation, which will go into effect on April 30, also bans the use of digital wallet providers as fiat on-ramps for crypto exchanges.Cointelegraph Turkey reached out to local blockchain and crypto industry participants for commentary. Ahmet Usta, chief editor of Blockchain Turkey Platform and co-author of Blockchain 101, described Turkey’s first crypto regulation as a “how-not-to-do” rather than a “how-to.” He told Cointelegraph Turkey that the central bank will prohibit two uses:The negative tone of the announcement damages Turkey’s international reputation and reliability, Usta added, explaining: “The positive takeaway of the announcement is the definition of crypto assets within a legal framework for the first time.” Crypto assets are now treated as “intangible assets that are virtually generated using a distributed ledger or a similar technology and distributed over digital networks,” not as money.Even the positive side of the regulation falls short, though according to him: “In the debate of using crypto assets in international trade, declaring that it’s not an instrument of payment may lead to problems later on.”Comparing the decision of Turkey’s central bank to Russia’s crypto legislation, veteran finance journalist Erkan Öz clarified that cryptocurrencies are only banned as a form of payment and that it is still legal to trade them:According to crypto lecturer İsmail Hakkı Polat, this is the central bank’s way of warning people that cryptocurrencies are not monetary assets, no matter how often people call them kripto para (“crypto money” in Turkish) — thus, they can’t be used as a form of payment. In a Twitter thread, he noted that the new regulation limits innovation among banking firms and cripples the development of crypto payment startups in the country, such as DigiliraPay.DigiliraPay is one of the local companies that has been directly affected by the new regulation. Its business model incorporates a Know Your Customer process and utilizes blockchain to enable the spending of cryptocurrencies for daily shopping. “Sadly, we will have to stop our activity as of April 30, the day the regulation comes into full effect,” DigiliraPay CEO Serkan Bayar told Cointelegraph Turkey, adding: “In a time where globally known companies like Mastercard, Tesla, PayPal and Starbucks have started receiving payments via cryptocurrencies, we are deeply saddened that these services won’t be present in our country.”Bayar explained that it’s impossible to avoid taxes within the DigiliraPay ecosystem because all transactions are written on the blockchain, fully open to any form of an audit. “The new regulation by the central bank does not focus on the needs of the market, and it will only delay the use of cryptocurrencies in our country.”While its crypto payment operations will cease to exist, the DigiliraPay team aims to improve its business model and find alternative solutions to cope with regulation. Bayar further added: “We hope that in the not-too-distant future, this regulation will be removed so as to not miss out on opportunities like blockchain technology and the everyday use of cryptocurrencies, which Turkey urgently needs to catch up on.”As for the “banking fintech firms” that Polat mentioned, they are largely unaffected by the new ruling. Semih Muşabak, CEO of central bank-licensed fintech firm Sipay, told Cointelegraph Turkey that “We need to update our planned progress accordingly.” Following the legislation, however, he clarified that: “We don’t think the regulation will hinder the access to crypto-related services for the end-users. People will still continue to use banks and other means to use crypto services.”The second part of the ban essentially means users will be unable to use local PayPal alternatives (PayPal has been banned in Turkey since 2016) to deposit or withdraw money to and from crypto exchanges. Papara, a popular digital wallet provider — which was the only way to deposit fiat money in Binance when the exchange first entered the Turkish market — has become the highlight of conversation on Twitter following the central bank’s announcement.“Over the last five years, more than a million users have used Papara wallet to deposit money in crypto exchanges,” said Ahmed Faruk Karslı, CEO of Papara. He further told Cointelegraph Turkey:Digital wallets are only one side of the fiat-to-crypto equation, the other being crypto exchanges. Yasin Oral, CEO of major Turkish exchange Paribu, believes it’s too early for either a positive or negative perception. “The regulation is more about payment providers and electronic money companies rather than crypto assets themselves.” He further added that the legislation does not really change anything for crypto exchanges.The main reason that digital wallets were used as fiat on-ramps for crypto was the lack of partnerships between banks and crypto exchanges, Oral explained. Users were turning to digital wallets to send and receive funds 24/7, without the need to wait an extra day if their banks didn’t have a partnership with their crypto exchange.Alexandre Dreyfus, CEO of Chiliz and social sporting platform Socios, stated that transactions via digital wallets like Papara count for less than 1% of its total volume, so the new regulation is unlikely to have a big impact on business for the platform. He told Cointelegraph Turkey: “We welcome any regulations and guidelines. Sometimes they bring their own issues, but it also provides a clear way and set of rules to follow.”“We also believe that payments are not the only thing crypto stands for, and it can be utilized to create engagement and innovative solutions,” Dreyfus added, clarifying further that the use case for the Chiliz (CHZ) token is different, and hence, its business model has not been impacted by the looming ban.But what about the crypto exchanges that were planning to provide crypto payments? The day of the central bank’s announcement was very busy for the law department of the Turkish crypto exchange Bitci. Just 24 hours earlier, Bitci announced that Bitcicoin (BITCI), the exchange’s native token, could be used to buy a variety of luxury cars such as a McLaren, Cadillac, Bugatti, Tesla or Rolls-Royce, thanks to a partnership with Royal Motors.Onur Altan Tan, CEO of Bitci, stressed to Cointelegraph Turkey that for now, more clarification is needed to understand whether the regulation actually prohibits using crypto for payments:“Our business model is built on sellers and establishments instantly receiving the Turkish lira in their accounts while users make their payments via cryptocurrencies,” Tan explained, adding that: “We develop all our technologies in a way that supports the current system while not going out of the legislative regulations in matters like billing and taxation.”Indeed, the central bank’s announcement was also made in preparation for a crypto tax law, according to Öz, as taxing investors would be much easier through banks. “I hope tax rates will not be so high and that the Turkish implementation will come close to the U.S. and EU regulations in the coming years,” he added. Usta also believes the announcement to be the first step toward crypto taxes, adding:The central bank’s move might also be a “temporary first step” into crypto, only to be properly updated once a more comprehensive regulation comes into effect, deduced Oral, adding that the central bank is simply making a point that: “My area of responsibility covers payment providers and electronic money companies. This way, I am drawing the lines beforehand, to be updated as necessary in the future.”Çağla Gül Şenkardeş, founding member of Istanbul Blockchain Women and founder of consulting firm Durugoru, also questioned the permanency of the regulation: “It may hinder the developer role of our country in distributed ledger technology.”She further added to Cointelegraph Turkey that: “We had many international blockchain and crypto companies as clients that were planning to invest in Turkey, and they will surely reevaluate their plans after the central bank’s regulation.”For Usta, the answer is pretty simple: “We should pave the way for innovation. It is obvious that regulations with negative verbs inhibit innovation and damage Turkey’s international reputation.”Steps are being taken all over the world to integrate crypto assets into traditional systems, mentioned Usta. “We could’ve been in an exemplary and leading spot, not only for the country itself but for the region and the whole world. We still haven’t lost that chance.” He further added:Instead of a total ban, there should be an active discussion with industry stakeholders to find solutions that will pave the way for growth within the industry, suggested Karslı: “Unfortunately, these types of prohibitions will only encourage users to utilize P2P platforms, which will result in an increase in the gray economy. I hope that Turkey will take quick actions against such risks and reevaluate regulations.”"
393,"Few traders would argue against the fact that Bitcoin (BTC) is in a bull market, but there is less consensus on whether the market is in the midst of an ""altcoin season."" A quick view of Crypto Twitter shows the schism between traders who are certain we are halfway through alt season and those who believe it has yet to begin.Typically, traders rely on a wide swath of indicators and metrics, like Bitcoin’s total market capitalization versus the total altcoin market cap, Bitcoin’s dominance rate, and whether low-cap altcoins have rallied by a certain percentage.As is the nature of investing, too much signal can at times produce mixed results, so Cointelegraph decided to have a chat with Ben Lilly, co-founder and analyst at Jarvis Labs, to see where he and his firm think the market currently stands and to determine the most appropriate metrics to use in figuring out whether or not an altcoin season is truly at hand.Cointelegraph: A number of analysts claim we’re in an altcoin season, or at least right at the verge of one. Some are looking at support/resistance flips and fractals on altcoin market cap charts (isolated from BTC's market cap) to make convincing arguments. Why do you think that we are nowhere near an altcoin season?Ben Lilly: I believe everybody’s interpretation of what defines an altcoin season varies. For many, altcoin season might exist when both BTC and altcoins move higher. This is opposed to Bitcoin rising while altcoins remain flat or drop.I think this is a fair view of altcoin season, but it’s not necessarily one I subscribe to. Simply because if this is a definition for altcoin season, it’s not a compelling reason for me to move away from Bitcoin and into altcoins from a risk-adjusted perspective.Because in that definition of altcoin season, Bitcoin is still the preferable asset to own.We think of altcoin season as market movements that take people by surprise or at least make traders rethink what is normal.CT: So, altcoin seasons are not reflecting a macro-level trend shift in the market direction of Bitcoin’s momentum?BL: Well, getting back to what I said earlier, support and resistances are helpful ways to explain. We can view these as areas that, when broken, create fast price action. It’s the type of action you want exposure to, assuming you’re on the correct side of it. While anything in between these supports and resistances can almost be assumed as ""expected"" or normal — in a loose sense.To figure out where this area might be, we can look at a Bitcoin dominance chart. This lets us know the percentage of the market Bitcoin represents. Right now, it’s trading in a range, which is to say an “expected” range. And because it’s trending down, this is good for altcoins as Bitcoin concedes some dominance to other coins.In fact, we’ve been trading in this range of expectation from the middle part of 2019, which coincides with when Bitcoin found its low and began to turn bullish.Oddly enough, we recently jumped out of this range in late 2020, and when we did, Bitcoin went on an absolute tear. During this run, altcoins lost value. And similar to how Brent Johnson describes his dollar milkshake theory, Bitcoin sucked up the market’s liquidity as it ran higher.We have since returned to this range of expectation, also known as the normal area of the market.Now, if the opposite happens and we break this expected range to the downside, in our point of view, this will signify that altcoins are the asset to be sitting in, as they will generate outsized returns relative to Bitcoin. That’s when things will get wild.CT: For years, traders have pinpointed the shifts in dominance rate between BTC and altcoins as a relevant indicator of when altcoin season begins. As the theory holds, when Bitcoin's price consolidates or is in a downtrend and its dominance rate drops below a certain percentage, altcoins capitalize on Bitcoin’s range-bound action by rallying higher. What thoughts do you have on this?BL: Similar to what I explained previously, it’s all about expectations. As soon as the market creates a change in view of what’s normal, then ""altcoin season"" will appear.Another chart I’m frequently leaning on is the ETH/BTC pair. When Ether gains in relation to BTC, this is generally a good sign for altcoins. And recently, there’s been some bullish momentum on the chart within its current range of expectation.The ETH/BTC pair is currently forming what we can describe as the Livermore Accumulation Cylinder. For more than a month, we have been discussing this in our free “Espresso” newsletter from the Jarvis Labs Substack, and what is clear is that the chart is taking form and is at the later stages of its trend.CT: While a rising tide does lift all boats, altcoins have been the top performers in the market when compared with Bitcoin. A quick look over CoinMarketCap shows that at least 50 have made moves that are well above 100%, and the altcoin market cap has risen from $250 billion in January to nearly $900 billion today. In your opinion, what is the primary signal that the market is in a proper altcoin run?BL: Now, this is a bit different than an altcoin season, in my opinion. That’s because a proper bull run for altcoins is when investors are more likely to walk further out on the risk curve of crypto versus simply buying Bitcoin, not necessarily outsized gains compared with Bitcoin.Based on this definition, we can make the case that whenever Bitcoin dominance is falling while crypto as a whole is in a bull market (like today), then this is a bull market for altcoins.While investors might not have outsized gains relative to Bitcoin in a proper altcoin bull run like they would in an altcoin season, it is wise to begin building exposure to these higher-risk assets in this environment.CT: Does on-chain data have any value in determining when alt seasons begin?BL: Absolutely. On-chain is very valuable if you know how to filter out all the noise that comes with it. With crypto, there’s so much transparency in seeing transactions on-chain. This creates a trove of data that can be looked at in hundreds of different ways, many of which are somewhat meaningless.At Jarvis Labs, we filter out all the data to find the data that matters. Then we run it through algorithms to create trade signals. It’s high-value data analytics and tends to be used in place of in-house analysts.In saying that, on-chain is still an evolving space outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum. We’re on half a dozen blockchains watching these signals evolve and generating a variety of reliable signals will better pinpoint exactly when trend shifts take place and altcoin seasons begin and end.When an altcoin season arrives, we’re likely to see USDT flow into other layer-two protocols such as Polkadot, Cosmos and Solana. That’s because many small-cap assets that are very far out on the risk curve, which tend to be bought in these types of environments, will exist on decentralized exchanges rather than centralized exchanges.As investors start buying up these small-cap assets, liquidity will arrive, and USDT is the most ubiquitous form of liquidity in the market.So, when USDT enters these ecosystems by the hundreds of millions, you can be sure it’s altcoin season, as investors will be chasing these assets only found on DEXs native to their protocol (i.e., Serum).CT: Is it possible that the narrative may be changing and that some altcoins are breaking away from their reliance on the performance of Bitcoin, shifting what an altcoin season may look like?BL: The changing landscape of risk is how I view this particular question.And as other assets begin to grow in market cap and age, the network effects will grow. This, in turn, will insulate many crypto assets from Bitcoin since a lot of value will be attached to them.In this way, over time altcoins will slightly deviate away from BTC’s performance.That’s due to macro reasons. Simply put, commodities as a whole tend to have a correlation to one another, equities as a whole have correlation, and even currencies tend to move in tandem with one another (i.e, USD, CHF, JPY). In saying this, crypto as a whole is likely to move in tandem with one another for at least most of this decade if not longer.Disclaimer: Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

394,"During strong uptrends, the best practice is to buy on significant dips as profits are produced when the price quickly rebounds from oversold conditions.  This appears to be what happened on April 18 as traders jumped at the opportunity to buy Bitcoin and altcoins at lower levels.However, no market can keep going up in a straight line and periodic corrections and phases of consolidation are needed as they drive away the speculators who only jump in and use high leverage when they sense an opportunity to get rich quickly.The sharp rise in Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price and the huge addition of subscribers in Dogecoin and other cryptocurrency subreddits last week indicate that there is an influx of novice traders who are dreaming of making easy riches.This class of trader is usually the last to enter an uptrend and the irrational buying typically results in a spike, which culminates in a short-term top as smart money view this as a signal to book profits. The inexperienced trader continues to buy on the way down and as the losses mount, they eventually panic sell the entire position right at the bottom.On the other hand, the experienced long-term investors wait patiently until the excesses are cleared from the system and then start buying. Traders should be on the lookout for the right opportunity to enter rather than get sucked into trades due to FOMO.Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to identify the critical support and resistance levels, which may signal the start of the next trending move.Bitcoin’s (BTC) strong recovery from $50,447.50 on April 18 shows traders are aggressively buying the dips. However, the failure of the bulls to sustain the price above the 50-day simple moving average ($56,486) today suggests that there is hesitation to buy at higher levels.The 20-day exponential moving average ($58,775) is turning down and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the negative territory, indicating the bears are trying to make a comeback. The longer the price trades below the moving averages, the greater the possibility of a retest of $50,460.If the price rebounds off the $50,460 support, the BTC/USDT pair could remain range-bound for a few days. On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below $50,460, the selling could intensify as the bulls who purchased the dip on April 18 may be forced to cover their positions. The pair could then drop to $43,006.77.Conversely, the first sign of strength will be a break above the 20-day EMA. Such a move will enhance the prospects for a retest of the all-time high at $64,849.27.Ether (ETH) plunged close to the 50-day SMA ($1,899) on April 18 but the bulls purchased the dip aggressively, resulting in a recovery that pushed the price back above the 20-day EMA ($2,154).However, the bulls are struggling to build upon the recovery today as the bears are again trying to sink the price below the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the ETH/USDT pair could slide to $2,040.77 and then to the 50-day SMA. A break below the 50-day SMA could intensify selling that could result in a fall to $1,542.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair rebounds off the current levels, it will suggest strong buying on dips. The bulls will then try to push the price to the all-time high at $2,545.84. A break above this resistance could start the next leg of the up-move.In strong uptrends, the bulls generally buy the dips to the 20-day EMA ($454) and that is what happened on April 18. Binance Coin (BNB) bounced off the 20-day EMA and the bulls attempted to build on the recovery today.However, the long wick on today’s candlestick suggests the bears are aggressively defending the $550 resistance. If the price turns down and breaks below the $428 support, the decline could extend to $348.69.Conversely, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA and the buyers thrust the price above $550, the BNB/USDT pair could rally to $600 and then to $638.56. A breakout of this resistance may start the next leg of the uptrend that could reach $832.75.XRP rebounded from just below the 20-day EMA ($1.23) on April 18 as the bulls accumulated at lower levels. However, the buyers are finding it difficult to extend the recovery today, indicating selling on rallies.If the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, a drop to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.10 is possible. A break below this level could intensify selling and pull the XRP/USDT pair down to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement at $0.86.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls propel the price above $1.56, the pair could rise to $1.80 and then to $1.96. The bears may defend this level aggressively but if the bulls can clear the hurdle, the pair could start the next leg of the up-move.After Dogecoin’s massive rally on April 16, traders booked profits on April 17, which dragged the price down $0.23, just below the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.25. The bears tried to extend the decline on April 18 but the bulls again purchased the dip to $0.23.The bulls have continued with their recovery today and are attempting to drive the price above the all-time high at $0.45. If they succeed, the DOGE/USDT pair could start the next leg of the rally that could reach $0.63.However, the bears are likely to defend the $0.45 level aggressively. If the price turns down from this resistance and dips back below $0.35, it will suggest that traders are selling on rallies. The pair could then remain stuck in a range for a few days. The trend will favor the bears if they can sink and sustain the price below $0.23.Cardano (ADA) broke below the moving averages and dropped to an intraday low at $1.08 on April 18. However, the bulls purchased this dip aggressively and pushed the price back above the 50-day SMA ($1.20).The bulls tried to extend the recovery by pushing the price above the 20-day EMA ($1.28) today but the higher levels are attracting selling from the bears. If the price dips and sustains below the 50-day SMA, the ADA/USDT pair could slide to $1.03. A break below the support of the range will signal a change in trend.Alternatively, if the bulls buy the drop to $1.03 aggressively, it will suggest that lower levels continue to attract buyers. The pair could then remain range-bound for a few more days. The bulls will gain the upper hand on a break above $1.55.Polkadot (DOT) hit a new all-time high at $48.36 on April 17 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. The long wick on the candlestick suggests that traders aggressively booked profits, which pulled the price back below $42.28.The selling continued on April 18 and the DOT/USDT pair slipped below the moving averages, hitting an intraday low at $32. Although the bulls staged a strong recovery, they are struggling to sustain the price above the 50-day SMA ($37.45) today.This suggests that bears are selling on rallies. If the bears sink the price below $32, the pair could decline to $26.50. The 20-day EMA ($39.784) has started to turn down and the RSI is below 41, indicating the sellers have the upper hand.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls push the price above the $42.28 resistance. A breakout of this level could result in a retest at $48.36.Litecoin (LTC) formed a shooting star candlestick pattern on April 17, which usually acts as a reversal pattern. The altcoin witnessed another sharp selling on April 18 and the price plunged to a low at $230.Although the bulls purchased the dip on April 18, they have not been able to sustain the rebound. This suggests that the bears are trying to gain the upper hand. Renewed selling has pulled the LTC/USDT pair down to the support at $246.96 today.If the bears sink the price below $246.96, the correction could deepen to the 50-day SMA ($213). Such a move could delay the start of the next leg of the uptrend.Contrary to this assumption, if the price rebounds off $246.96, the bulls will try to start a relief rally. A break above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $294.91 will indicate that the bulls are back in the driver’s seat.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) rallied from $442.96 on March 24 to a high at $1,213.51 on April 17. The altcoin is currently correcting the sharp up-move. On April 18, the price dipped to $800, just below the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $828.24 but the long tail on the day’s candlestick showed strong buying at lower levels.However, the bulls are struggling to build upon the strong recovery today. This shows that the bears have not given up and they are selling on rallies. The bears will try to sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($762) and gain the upper hand.On the contrary, the bulls will try to buy the dips and drive the price above $1,060. If they do that, the BCH/USDT pair could retest $1,213.51. A break above this resistance could start the next leg of the uptrend that has a target objective at $1,570.55.The failure of the bulls to sustain Uniswap (UNI) above $35.20 could have aggravated selling on April 18. The altcoin dropped below both moving averages and hit an intraday low at $26.97. However, the bulls quickly purchased the dip as seen from the long tail on the day’s candlestick.The recovery seems to have hit a wall at the 20-day EMA ($32.24) today. This suggests that traders are selling on rallies to the 20-day EMA, indicating a possible change in sentiment. If the bears sustain the price below the 50-day SMA ($30.66), the selling could pick up momentum and the UNI/USDT pair could slump to the critical support at $25.52.A strong rebound off this level will suggest that the bulls continue to buy the dips. That could keep the pair range-bound between $25.52 and $38 for a few days. However, a break below $25.52 could result in a drop to $20. This negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

395,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is recovering after a strong sell-off during the weekend caused by cascading liquidations in the futures market.Traders are pinpointing three levels as the critical price areas to watch in the short term: $51,200 as the major support, $60,300 as the important resistance, and $57,000 as the near term area of interest for sellers.Although the price of Bitcoin dropped to as low as around $50,000, the market structure itself does not look largely concerning, according to a pseudonymous trader known as TraderKoz.Bitcoin wicked to sub-$50,000, but it recovered quickly to around $53,000 and has sustained above $56,000 since.Referring to the chart above, the trader said:In the near term, it is important for Bitcoin to rise and hold above $57,000. If BTC’s price stabilizes at these levels, it would confirm that the weekend crash was a purely technical and futures market-driven correction.Popular pseudonymous trader Rekt Capital also emphasized that the macro support remains at $51,200. Bitcoin recovered quickly as soon as it dropped to the low $50,000 area.Therefore, Bitcoin will confirm a higher low structure if it continues to recover in the short term and does not drop below $51,200.A higher low structure forms when the most recent Bitcoin low is higher than the previous low point.The trader explained:Additionally, analysts at Santiment noted that BTC recovered rapidly immediately after the funding rate of Bitcoin on BitMEX went negative.This indicates that significant organic buyer demand emerged when selling pressure started to amp up in the derivatives market, which would support the argument for a short-term trend reversal as long as Bitcoin remains above $57,000.The analysts wrote:There were large deposits made to exchanges when the price of Bitcoin dropped, adding to the selling pressure.But, as pointed out by Bitcoin Jack, a cryptocurrency derivatives trader, exchange withdrawals or outflows exceeded the deposits nevertheless.He said:As long as exchange withdrawals are on par or higher than exchange deposits, the technical momentum of Bitcoin is not at risk of losing steam in the near term."
396,"Bitcoin (BTC) is beginning a new week, grinding back to $60,000 as the shock of a weekend price crash settles.After dropping to as low as $52,000 in a snap sell-off event, Bitcoin has spent the past two days slowly recovering its losses. What’s next?Cointelegraph presents five factors to consider as a new trading week gets underway, and cryptocurrency holders across the board nurse their wounds.The macro picture is fairly stable in Asia and Europe, with the United States markets yet to open.A mixed picture greeted investors at the open, but volatility has been broadly absent, with only oil showing signs of more pronounced weakness.As such, little impact on Bitcoin is to be expected from equities moves — these forecasts to continue building on record highs in the coming weeks.Russel Chesler, head of investments and capital markets at the Australian branch of crypto-friendly investment manager VanEck, captured the mood in a note quoted by Bloomberg.“Our current view is that with short-term interest rates set to remain low for the medium term and our expectation that earnings will continue to increase, it is unlikely that the increase in long-term interest rates will trigger an equity market fall,” he wrote.Coronavirus concerns still linger despite stocks’ relentless surge higher, with more reported official cases last week than ever before worldwide.Economic responses continue to vary, with a patchwork of openings and closings characterizing countries’ latest attempts to control the outbreak.In Bitcoin circles, the main talking point naturally remains the weekend’s events, which saw a sudden cascade of selling, which sent BTC/USD down by $7,000 in a matter of minutes.Bouncing at just above $52,000, the crash echoed several similar events this year, and Bitcoin managed to regain around 50% of its lost ground within hours.Responses, however, are split between those who consider the volatility “business as usual” and more conservative voices calling time on the latest bull run.As Cointelegraph reported, suspicions are focusing on a Chinese power blackout that hit the hash rate, as well as rumored legal action by United States regulators against unnamed financial institutions related to money laundering.In his own breakdown of what happened, popular statistician Willy Woo highlighted both China and skittish moves by futures investors as contributing to the losses.“We just saw the single largest 1-day drop in mining hash rate since Nov 2017. The hash rate on the network essentially halved, causing mayhem in BTC price as it crashed,” he told Twitter followers.In a sign that the future could see fresh sustained upside, Woo reiterated the “reset” in an on-chain metric, the spent transaction output ratio (SOPR), showing that long-term investors will likely soon stop selling altogether.“The on-chain SOPR metric near a full reset. A classic buy the dip signal,” he added.It’s not just SOPR — a whole range of Bitcoin network indicators and fundamentals are buoying bulls’ cause, even as BTC/USD remains below even February’s high of $58,300.For Woo and others, particularly important are the transfer of funds to investors who have traditionally hodled, not sold — another classic trait of Bitcoin’s rise in recent months.“Serious strong-handed holders are buying this dip. In the last 24 hours, over 200,000 Bitcoin became illiquid, a 3-year record,” fellow analyst William Clemente added Sunday.Lastly, around 13.5% of the total available Bitcoin supply has been active above $53,000, something which Woo says is confirming its status as a trillion-dollar asset. At around $53,800, Bitcoin’s market cap becomes a solid $1 trillion.“This dip happened while unprecedented numbers of new users are arriving onto the network per day. There’s been a retail influx in the last 2-3 weeks,” Woo additionally noted, with total wallet numbers nearing 10 million.A closer look at the hash rate, which at one point dipped by almost half, shows that a recovery in line with price is underway.According to rough estimates from on-chain monitoring resource Blockchain, the Bitcoin network hash rate is already back above 150 exahashes per second, having broken through the 200 EH/s barrier for the first time in history last week.Miners leaving the network due to power problems leads to Bitcoin’s network difficulty decreasing to incentivize more to come online.Further confirmation that the weekend’s issue was firmly temporary comes from difficulty forecasts — in two weeks’ time, when it next adjusts, the difficulty will only drop by around 4%, a modest move that could yet be canceled out altogether as miners return.This balance between the hash rate and difficulty is arguably the most important aspect of Bitcoin, one that allows it to govern itself and preserve security and functionality regardless of sudden events impacting network participants.In another unanticipated event that is arguably yet to be fully appreciated by the market, China has given an unprecedented stamp of approval to cryptocurrency as an “investment alternative.”Speaking at a conference organized by CNBC, Li Bo, deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China, broke ranks to validate both Bitcoin and stablecoins.“We regard Bitcoin and stablecoin as crypto assets... These are investment alternatives,” he said.The comments are surprising, as despite being a center for Bitcoin mining activity, China has had a blanket ban in place on trading and transacting in cryptocurrencies since September 2017.“Every country that bans Bitcoin eventually reverses that ban. You simply cannot be competitive in the 21st century economy without it,” Charles Edwards, founder of investment firm Capriole, responded.The market barely reacted to this high-level affirmation of Bitcoin’s long-term potential. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is still hovering at $57,000, as yet failing to see an attack of familiar resistance levels."
397,"Several South Korean financial authorities are planning to join forces to combat illegal operations involving cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC).The interagency crackdown comes in response to growing concerns over speculative investments and potentially illegal activities amid the ongoing boom in crypto markets, Koo Yun-cheol, head of the Office for Government Policy Coordination, said Monday.“There is a need to pay special attention to the occurrence of illegal activities using virtual assets,” he stated at a vice ministers’ meeting on crypto, according to local news agency Yonhap.As part of the crackdown, which is slated to continue until June, the Financial Services Commission will require local financial institutions to strengthen the monitoring of cryptocurrency withdrawals. Any suspicious activity should be reported to the state-run Financial Intelligence Unit, an agency responsible for investigating financial crimes. Other regulators like the finance ministry and the Financial Supervisory Service also plan to keep an eye on cross-border crypto transactions, the report notes.South Korea has been facing strict regulation after officially imposing the Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information in late March 2021. According to the law, local crypto exchanges must maintain relationships with local banks to ensure mandatory real-name account trading. The National Tax Service of South Korea has been increasing its efforts to combat tax evasion involving crypto, as reported in March.New regulatory developments in South Korea come amid new historic highs on crypto markets last week, with Bitcoin breaking above $64,000 on Wednesday. Despite the record crypto prices, Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol argued that cryptocurrencies have “considerable limitations” as a method of payment, warning that their volatile price fluctuations pose a threat to financial stability."
398,"Popular crypto market analyst Willy Woo noted reports identifying the blackouts were published late last week, with the power outages occurring to facilitate safety inspections in response to a recent flooding accident at a local coal mine that saw 21 miners temporarily trapped underground after power and communications went down.According to the Cambridge Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, or CBECI, Xinjiang represents nearly one-quarter of the global hash rate.The analyst noted that yesterday saw the largest daily drop in total Bitcoin network hash rate since November 2017, with hash rate plummeting from 172 million terahashes per second to less than roughly 154 million TH/s, according to Ycharts.Woo has attributed Sunday’s violent cryptocurrency crash to a sudden drop in hash rate resulting from a power outage in the Chinese region of Xinjiang.Woo points to 9,000 BTC that was transferred to Binance on Friday, speculating the funds were likely sent by a “whale with closer knowledge to happenings in China.” Coupled with heavy selling in the quarterly futures markets, the downward momentum drove $4.9 billion worth of Bitcoin liquidations and a further $4.4 billion in margin calls in the altcoin markets — with a record 1 million accounts being liquidated.However, not everyone agrees with Woo’s analysis, with Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran describing “the idea that a power outage last night in a mining region in China led to the dop in $BTC” as “utter nonsense.”1/15

You might have seen charts around claiming that there is some sort of link between the mining hash-rate and Bitcoin's price drop.

I've seen all sorts of words thrown around with this chart including 'causations' and 'correlations' by a lot of people who don't math. pic.twitter.com/Gfog3Sk8WoWoo noted that long-term whales who rarely sell have been buying heavily amid the dip, adding that the lower $50,000 range is forming “the largest cluster of price discovery since BTC was below $10k.”“Validation of BTC as a trillion dollar asset is immensely strong,” he said, adding that 13.5% of the entire BTC supply has been moved on-chain while Bitcoin’s capitalization has exceeded $1 trillion."
399,"With much of the market fixated on Bitcoin’s (BTC) sudden price correction over the weekend, retail interest in digital assets appears to be on the rise, according to the latest statistics from Reddit.The r/dogecoin community added 145,859 weekly subscribers, according to Subreddit Stats. The gains are hardly surprising, given Dogecoin’s (DOGE) dramatic rally over the past week. The meme-based cryptocurrency skyrocketed 400% during that period, bringing its yearly returns to an eye-watering 5,000%.DOGE’s parabolic rally moderated over the weekend, with social media sentiment data from The TIE and Cointelegraph indicating more pain in the short term. That’s because price action is often correlated with social media engagement; a decline in the latter is sometimes a precursor to bearish price action in the near term. Meanwhile, the r/CryptoCurrency community, which is devoted to all things digital assets, added 86,838 new subscribers during the week. New community members were welcomed by platinum award recipient u/mirza1h on Sunday. In a subreddit post, u/miraza1h said:The user also introduced new subreddit followers to Moon, the native token of the r/CryptoCurrency community.Much like DOGE, the overall cryptocurrency market limped into Sunday’s session, having declined by a cumulative $386 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. The digital-asset market capitalization briefly fell below $1.9 trillion before recovering to around $2 trillion.Massive shakeouts are nothing new for seasoned cryptocurrency investors. Even during bull markets, declines of 20% or more are fairly common, especially after major rallies. Speculation about an abrupt decline in Bitcoin’s hash power and the possibility of United States regulatory action against crypto-friendly banks may have contributed to the decline on Sunday.Even with the latest reversal, the cryptocurrency market is still double the size it was in January when it first crossed the $1-trillion milestone."
400,"Bitcoin (BTC) price witnessed a sharp dump to $50,900 on April 18, which some analysts attribute to a drop in hash rate and rumors of possible action by United States regulators against unnamed “financial institutions” alleging crypto-related money laundering.While it is difficult to pinpoint a single reason, the sale of roughly $5 billion worth of COIN stock by Coinbase executives could have also played a major role in the fall. Insider selling, especially just a few days after a high-profile listing is considered a bearish sign.After this most recent pullback, investors will be on the fence on whether they should buy the dips or close their positions in anticipation of further decline? Traders should keep a close watch on the strength in the recovery as that will provide an insight about the next possible move.Let’s study the technicals of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that could attempt to lead the recovery in the next few days.Bitcoin’s failure to rebound off the 20-day exponential moving average ($59,053) on April 17 showed the lack of buying on dips. The selling picked up pace today after the price slipped below the 50-day simple moving average ($56,264).However, the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests that buyers are attempting to stall the decline at $50,460. If the rebound sustains, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend but they are likely to face stiff resistance between $61,825.84 and $64,849.27. A breakout of this resistance zone will suggest that the current fall was only a pullback to shake out the weak hands.On the other hand, the failure to sustain the rebound or build upon the bounce in the next few days will indicate that demand dries up at higher levels. That is likely to invigorate the bears who will then try to assert their dominance and break the $50,460 support.If they manage to do that, selling could intensify as the short-term speculators and traders may also dump their positions. That could pull the price down to $43,006.77. This is an important level to watch out for because a break below it will suggest that the BTC/USDT pair has topped out in the short term.The 4-hour chart shows the bulls purchased the drop to $50,460 aggressively but the recovery is facing resistance at $56,500. This suggests that traders stuck at higher levels are closing their positions on rallies.However, the positive sign is that the bulls have not given up the fight. They are trying to defend $53,000 support. This could result in a tight consolidation between $53,000 and $56,500 for a few days.If the price breaks above $56,500, the pair could rally to the 20-EMA, which is again likely to act as a resistance. If the price turns down from this level, the pair could retest $53,000 and then $50,460.The downsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought territory show the bears have the upper hand.VeChain’s (VET) sharp rally on April 16 had pushed the RSI above 87, indicating the rally was getting overheated in the short term. The altcoin tried to extend its up-move on April 17 but the long wick on the day’s candlestick showed that traders booked profits at higher levels.The selling continued today and the VET/USDT pair slumped to $0.169, just above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.16. However, the long tail on today’s candlestick shows strong buying at lower levels.If the bulls can sustain the rebound, the pair will once again attempt to rise to the overhead resistance at $0.279. A breakout of this resistance could resume the uptrend. The next target objective on the upside is $0.362.On the other hand, if the price turns down from $0.279, the pair could remain stuck in a range for a few days. This positive view will invalidate if the bears sell on rallies and sink the price below the $0.16 support.The 4-hour chart shows the bulls purchased the drop to the 50-SMA but the recovery hit a wall at $0.227. The bears tried to resume the correction but the bulls again purchased the dip below the 20-EMA. This shows bears are selling on rallies and bulls are buying on dips.The bulls are currently attempting to sustain the price above the downtrend line but are facing stiff resistance from the bears. If they can overpower the bears and keep the price above the downtrend line, the pair could rally to $0.253 and then to $0.279.Conversely, if the bears again sink the price below the 20-EMA, the pair could drop to the 50-SMA. A break below this level will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.Solana (SOL) had been in a corrective phase since hitting an all-time high at $29.92 on April 12. Although the price plunged below the 20-day EMA ($24.49) today, the bears could not capitalize on the advantage. The altcoin has quickly bounced back above the 20-day EMA, indicating strong demand at lower levels.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls have the upper hand. If they can drive the price above $29.92, the SOL/USDT pair could resume the uptrend and rally to $38.72.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that traders are closing their positions on rallies. The pair could then decline to $21 and later to the 50-day SMA ($18.60).The 4-hour chart shows that the break below $24.70 attracted sharp selling but the bears could not sustain the lower levels. The pair rebounded strongly and climbed back above the $24.70 level.If the bulls can propel the price above $28.64, a retest of $29.92 is possible. The 20-EMA is turning up and the RSI has jumped above 55, indicating the bulls have a slight advantage in the short term.However, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below $24.70, the next stop could be $21.10. Such a move will suggest that bears have overpowered the bulls, which could result in a deeper correction.EOS turned down from the stiff overhead resistance at $8.69 after the bulls failed to push and sustain the price above it on April 16 and 17. The sharp selling pulled the price down to $5.86, just above the breakout level at $5.60.If the bulls can flip $5.60 into support, the EOS/USDT pair could again try to move up to $8.69. A break above $8.69 may start the next leg of the uptrend that could reach $11. Alternatively, if the price turns down from $8.69, the pair could remain range-bound for a few days.This positive view will be negated if the bears sell on rallies and sink the price below the breakout level at $5.60. Such a move could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($4.98), signaling that bears are back in the driver’s seat.The 4-hour chart shows the bulls are trying to start a relief rally. If they can sustain the price above $6.93, the pair could rally to the 20-EMA where the bears are likely to offer a stiff resistance.If the price turns down from the 20-EMA, the pair may again drop to $6.17 and then to $5.60. Such a move will suggest that sentiment has turned negative and the bears are selling on rallies.Conversely, if the bulls can push the price above the 20-EMA, the momentum could pick up and the pair could rally to $8.69.FTX Token (FTT) has been in a corrective phase since topping out at $59.57 on April 14. The price plummeted below the 20-day EMA ($48) today but the long tail on the candlestick shows strong buying at lower levels.If the bulls can sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the uptrend remains intact. The bulls will then try to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above the $59.57 resistance.If they succeed, the FTT/USDT pair could start its northward march toward the next target objective at $71.89.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, the selling could intensify, which could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($40). A break below this support will suggest that the pair has topped out in the short term.The 4-hour chart shows the bulls are trying to stall the correction between the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $45.62 and the 61.8% retracement level at $42.33. The relief rally is likely to face stiff resistance from the 20-EMA.If the price turns down from the 20-EMA, it will suggest that traders are selling on rallies. The bears will then try to sink the price below $44. If they succeed, the pair could slump to $40 and then to $37.On the contrary, if the bulls can push the price above the 20-EMA, the pair may rally to $54.62 and then to $59.57.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

401,"The funding rate of Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped to levels not seen since September 2020 as the price of Bitcoin plummeted below $52,000 on April 18. Quant trader and analyst Lex Moskovski says it shows fear has returned to the market.According to the data from Glassnode, the average Bitcoin futures funding rate across all exchange dropped to as low as around -0.03% on SundayBitcoin futures exchanges use a mechanism called ""funding"" to achieve balance in the market.The way the mechanism works is simple: if there are more longs or buyers in the market, the funding rate rises, and vice versa.As such, when the funding rate turns negative, it means the majority of the market is short-selling Bitcoin, indicating fear in the market.Moskovski said:Earlier this week, Bitcoin was hovering at around $64,000 in anticipation of the Coinbase public listing. At the lowest point of the day on April 18, BTC dropped to as low as $50,000.From the day's highest to lowest point, the price of Bitcoin dropped by almost 15% against the U.S. dollar.The market sentiment can change so quickly because many traders use high leverage across major exchanges.During the Coinbase public listing week, the funding rate of Bitcoin was stable at 0.1% to 0.15% on top futures exchanges like Binance and Bybit.This shows that many traders were aggressively longing or buying Bitcoin, making the futures market incredibly overheated.When this happens, the incentive to short sell Bitcoin massively increases and it puts the market at risk of a big cascade of liquidations.There has been speculation over the past 48 hours that the abrupt drop in the hash rate of the Bitcoin blockchain network led to the price drop.On April 16, major Chinese mining facilities and pools saw outages after China's Xinjiang region experienced blackouts.Consequently, the hash rate of Bitcoin dropped quickly thereafter, leading to concerns that it would hinder the market sentiment around BTC.However, Adam Cochran, a partner at Cinneanhaim Ventures, said that the Bitcoin hash rate dip likely did not cause the price of BTC to drop. He said:If the Bitcoin price drop was not caused by fundamental factors but rather was purely technical as a result of an overcrowded futures market, the case for a swift recovery strengthens.In the short term, it is favorable for Bitcoin to remain at around the $56,000 support area, as the futures market finds composure and the funding rates stabilize."
402,"In October 2019, unknown hackers infiltrated a Canadian insurance company by installing the malware BitPaymer, which encrypted the firm’s data and IT systems. The hackers demanded a ransom of $1.2 million be paid in Bitcoin (BTC) in return for the decryption software needed for the firm to regain access to its systems. The firm’s United Kingdom-based insurer — known only as AA — arranged to pay the BTC ransom, and the firm’s systems were back up and running within a few days. Meanwhile, AA started the process of seeking legal avenues to recover the BTC obtained by the hackers. It engaged the blockchain investigations firm Chainalysis, whose investigations revealed that 96 of the 109.25 BTC paid had been transferred to a wallet linked to the Bitfinex exchange.So far, this story is (unfortunately) far from unusual. Bitcoin accounts for the vast majority of ransomware payments due to its anonymity, accessibility (making it easier for victims to pay the ransom) and verifiability of transactions (allowing criminals to confirm once payment has been made). What is unusual about this story, however, is that it sparked a 14-month-long legal battle between AA and Bitfinex, one that only recently concluded after AA discontinued its claim against Bitfinex in the U.K. High Court.Having traced the stolen BTC to Bitfinex’s platform — and with the identity of the hackers still unknown — AA started its litigation against Bitfinex in December 2019. Again, this is not unusual: U.K. courts have a wide range of remedies at their disposal to assist victims of fraud in trying to recover their assets. In instances where banks, exchanges or other intermediaries may find themselves unknowingly receiving or holding misappropriated or stolen assets, victims of fraud have been able to rely on:The U.K. courts are very familiar with the preceding remedies when involving bank accounts and fiat currency. More recently, the courts have been grappling with how these principles apply to cryptocurrency. However, it is clear that the courts are willing to flexibly apply legal principles, to ensure that these remedies are available to victims trying to recover stolen crypto assets.In the AA case, Justice Simon Bryan determined — for the first time — that Bitcoin could be classified as property under British law, meaning that he could grant a proprietary injunction in relation to that property. This seems obvious, but traditionally the law has seen property as something that could either be possessed in a tangible sense or be enforced by a right to sue. Cryptocurrency obviously does not meet either requirement, but the courts have taken a pragmatic approach to ensure that novel intangible assets, like cryptocurrency, are considered property.This flexible approach meant that AA was able to obtain injunctive relief. Bitfinex duly froze the account and provided AA with information about the identity of the customer who owned the wallet with the stolen BTC.As it turned out though, the BTC had been transferred again before Bitfinex was contacted by AA’s lawyers, and could not be returned. AA reached a confidential settlement with Bitfinex’s customer (also a defendant to AA’s claim) and then turned its sights on Bitfinex, in an attempt to receive additional compensation. The insurer raised a number of legal claims against Bitfinex, including the assertion that the exchange received the BTC (or its traceable proceeds) when it was property belonging to AA. As such, AA declared that a legal trust should be imposed, holding Bitfinex accountable to AA for the BTC. It was also argued that Bitfinex was reckless with regards to whether the BTC was lawfully transferred into the relevant wallet.These are difficult arguments to prove, and after Bitfinex sent out its detailed legal defense and response to AA’s claims, AA ultimately decided to abandon its claims against Bitfinex. But this was not quite the end of the story. Usually, when a claimant abandons its case, the default position is that it must pay all of the defendant’s costs. However, AA argued that its cost liability should be reduced by 50%, based upon Bitfinex’s supposedly “unreasonable” conduct. The parties fought this out at a High Court hearing in January, culminating in the court deciding there was no unreasonable conduct that would justify any reduction. AA was therefore ordered to pay 100% of Bitfinex’s legal costs, including the costs of its own unsuccessful application to have those costs reduced.It is understandable that victims of fraud — who may not be able to successfully pursue the actual fraudster — might be tempted to take on a cryptocurrency exchange with deep pockets, perhaps in the simple hope that they can engineer a modest settlement, and avoid the time and cost of complex legal proceedings.Cyber insurers like AA might calculate that the cost-benefit associated with those steps would be justified. However, exchanges like Bitfinex will continue to defend themselves robustly, particularly when the legal merits of claims are extremely challenging, and ultimately represent an attempt to drag an innocent exchange into the fallout of a cybercrime it had neither knowledge of nor involvement in.This article was co-authored by Stephen Elam and Shelley Drenth.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors’ alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal advice."
403,"MicroStrategy’s continuous Bitcoin acquisition has drawn the ire of investment banking giant HSBC. Despite being one of the largest business intelligence firms in the world, HSBC has stated that MicroStrategy is now a “virtual currency product,” a designation akin to the pseudo-Bitcoin exchange-traded fund status attached to the company on account of its sizable Bitcoin (BTC) balance sheet.Since August 2020, MicroStrategy has embarked on a Bitcoin acquisition spree and now holds more than $5 billion worth of BTC. Michael Saylor, the company’s CEO, has also become an outspoken Bitcoin proponent. Saylor’s Bitcoin evangelism has included attempts to encourage other publicly listed firms to add BTC to their balance sheet. Indeed, some other companies in the United States have emulated Saylor’s Bitcoin adoption.With corporate Bitcoin adoption becoming commonplace, the conversation appears to be shifting toward life and annuity companies and sovereign wealth funds to see where the next wave of institutional BTC investment will emerge. However, for legacy players like HSBC, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, remain anathema even if the actions taken thus far appear to be arguably arbitrary.HSBC blacklisted MicroStrategy’s stock, preventing customers of the bank’s online retail trading platform in Canada from acquiring the company’s shares. While HSBC did not respond to Cointelegraph’s request for confirmation on the report, the bank has publicly verified the news using similar statements contained in the original message shared by customers on Twitter.In the message sent to HSBC InvestDirect customers who already hold MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock, the bank revealed that additional MSTR purchases will no longer be possible on the platform. The communique stated that such customers could hold their current MicroStrategy stock balances or sell their shares.According to HSBC, the blacklisting was in line with the bank’s crypto restrictions enacted back in 2018. An excerpt from the bank’s policy as contained in the message to HSBC InvestDirect, or HIDC, customers reads: “HIDC will not participate in facilitating (buy and/or exchange) product relating to virtual currencies, or products related to or referencing to the performance of virtual currency.”Reacting to the news, Stuart Hoegner, general counsel at crypto exchange platform Bitfinex, told Cointelegraph that the decision was a “regressive step” in the context of the growing appeal of cryptocurrencies in the mainstream arena, adding:In singling out MicroStrategy, HSBC referred to the company as a “virtual currency product,” hence its decision to prevent customers from buying MSTR. However, HDIC lists shares of several companies with significant cryptocurrency involvement including Tesla, Square and Hut 8 Mining, to mention a few.Elon Musk’s electric vehicle manufacturing giant, Tesla, acquired about $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin back in February. Hut 8 is a Bitcoin mining establishment, while Square operates Cash App, an avenue for buying BTC that also contributes greatly to Square’s revenue bottom line.Unlike MicroStrategy, which only holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet while still carrying out its function as a business intelligence firm, some of the tradable stocks on the HDIC platform belong to companies, like Hut 8, that derive value directly from cryptocurrencies.Commenting on the lack of clarity in HSBC’s decision, Jeffrey Wang, head of Americas at crypto finance provider Amber Group, told Cointelegraph: “It’s a very slippery slope for HSBC. Will they publish a clear set of defined rules for what they deem to be companies that derive value from virtual currencies?”He questioned further: “Why haven’t they also put this trading restriction on other companies that have publicly disclosed holdings of Bitcoin like Tesla? Will they block trading in Coinbase?” As an HDIC customer, Wang also expressed displeasure at the uneven application of HSBC’s anti-crypto policies, adding:HSBC’s ban on MicroStrategy stock trading becomes even more bizarre, given that customers can still buy exchange-traded funds that contain MSTR on the platform. Indeed. According to ETF.com, 88 ETFs hold MicroStrategy shares.The MSTR blacklisting is hardly the first negative consequence of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investment push. In December 2020, Citibank downgraded the company’s stock citing MicroStrategy’s “disproportionate” focus on BTC.HSBC’s action puts the bank firmly in the corner of legacy financial institutions still averse to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency innovation. The move offers the latest indication of the bank’s repudiation of digital currencies following efforts to block customers from repatriating crypto trading profits from exchanges to their bank accounts earlier in the year.Meanwhile, several major players in the traditional finance arena are increasingly becoming more exposed to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as the novel technology gains new layers of legitimacy. From offering custody services for digital currencies to establishing digital asset exchange platforms, banks across the United States, Europe and Asia are showing a greater appetite for digital currencies.For Wang of Amber Group, HSBC is holding fast to a shrinking position of being a banking institution that remains averse to cryptocurrencies, telling Cointelegraph:Recently, European investment banking giant Société Générale issued a tokenized security representing one of its structure products — investment packages linked to assets and derivatives — on the Tezos blockchain. The news marked a third consecutive year of a blockchain-related financial product being issued.In a message to Cointelegraph, Jean-Marc Stenger, managing director of digital capital markets at Société Générale and head of its fintech startup subsidiary, SG Forge, remarked that crypto companies will challenge legacy finance players that are slow to adapt to the emerging digital financial landscape. Rather than advocate for eschewing digital assets, Stenger identified the advantages held by traditional finance in real-world asset-based tokenization, adding:While Société Générale’s digital asset offerings are not tied to cryptocurrencies, major U.S. investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are looking to offer their clients exposure to Bitcoin funds.Amid the continued influx of institutional actors into the Bitcoin space, the question of whether governments will invest in BTC is likely becoming a matter of “when” and not “if.” With insurance companies and pension funds dipping their toes in the Bitcoin pool, sovereign wealth funds appear to be not too far behind."
404,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell to sudden lows of $52,000 on April 18 in a timely reminder of how price action often follows hash rate. Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed a brutal hour for Bitcoin bulls everywhere early on Sunday as the market went from $59,000 to $52,000 in minutes.Having lost $60,000 support earlier in the weekend, BTC/USD was still fairly stable before the snap price event, which liquidated positions worth almost $10 billion over the past 24 hours.At around $7,000, the hourly loss challenges the record reversal seen in February after Bitcoin hit $58,000 for the first time. In the aftermath, analysts pointed to two events as potential causes: a hash rate crash and rumors from unnamed sources that United States regulators were about to charge unnamed ""financial institutions"" with crypto-related money laundering.Hash rate — an estimate of the computing power dedicated to the network by miners — crashed by almost half according to some estimates. This was due to a mass outage in China's Xinjiang province, home to a large number of miners, which began two days ago.In a classic depiction of the old adage, ""price follows hash rate,"" BTC/USD then caught up with reality.""Price and hash rate has always been correlated,"" statistician Willy Woo argued, pointing to a similar event from November 2017.Woo added that as then, the impact on price action was temporary and that hash rate had meanwhile already ""almost fully recovered.""Coin Metrics co-founder Nic Carter was similarly unfazed as the Xinjiang problems began, but forecast that media interest in the event would be significant.""If the outage lasts 3 weeks then bitcoin will have a historically large difficulty adjustment but I think that’s unlikely — either grid comes back online or miners will move their hardware,"" he said as part of a social media discussion on Saturday.Bitcoin's difficulty declines when miners exit the network, but according to the latest estimates, its next adjustment will only see a modest 1.8% decline.Meanwhile, another topic allegedly roiling sentiment appeared to be a single tweet about U.S. legal action. U.S. TREASURY TO CHARGE SEVERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR MONEY LAUNDERING USING CRYPTOCURRENCIES -SOURCESSurfacing right at the time of the price crash, Twitter account FXHedge quoted anonymous ""sources"" as warning over regulators taking unnamed ""financial institutions"" to court over money laundering related to cryptocurrency.No other details were given, but the tweet swiftly gained over 5,000 likes and almost as many retweets, with the $52,000 nosedive then ensuing.While mainstream media seized on the action, seasoned Bitcoiners were as cool as ever about what was just business as usual in a bull run.""Honestly, after you've been in the game long enough, you go numb to Bitcoin price dips,"" podcast host Steven Livera tweeted.At the time of writing, BTC/USD had recovered about half of its losses to trade above $56,000.Rafael Schultze-Kraft, co-founder and CTO of on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode, cited a classic on-chain metric as proof that now was a perfect time to buy Bitcoin.The spent transaction output ratio (SOPR), which measures overall profit and loss, had ""reset"" for the first time since after March's all-time highs of $61,700. "
405,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) declined below $60,000 on April 17 after a strong rally throughout the past week in anticipation of the Coinbase public listing on Nasdaq.However, after the COIN listing, which is the ticker of the Coinbase stock, the cryptocurrency market started to correct.Coinbase's public listing brought significant attention to the cryptocurrency market. It marked the first public listing of a major cryptocurrency exchange, leading to high institutional demand.As a result, the cryptocurrency market rallied leading up to the listing with BTC price hitting new all-time highs above $64,00. However, it was almost expected to see Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) drop after the fact, considering the tendency of cryptocurrencies to sell off after a major event.Another major factor that contributed to the drop in price was the relatively high funding rates for longing Bitcoin. This, alongside strong technical resistance at $64,000-$65,000 were the likely reasons that BTC tested $60,000 support after the hype around Coinase's listing began to fade. Meanwhile, the $60,000 level is an important price point for Bitcoin because it took roughly a month for BTC to break out above it.Hence, it is important for Bitcoin to hold the $60,000 area to maintain the bullish market structure heading into next week.At the same time, cryptocurrency traders are mixed regarding where Bitcoin will go with its new weekly candle.For instance, Cantering Clark, a popular cryptocurrency derivatives trader, said that the market isn't necessarily bullish nor bearish, based on options data.Instead, Clark noted that the options market trend shows that Bitcoin would likely see sideways actions, which would mean consolidation at around $60,000. He wrote:In the long term, traders are still optimistic about Bitcoin. A pseudonymous trader known as ""Crypto Capo"" noted that based on historical trends, Bitcoin has broken out of a range that goes back 1,000 days.The trader emphasized:"
406,"Holger Zschaepitz, a market analyst at Welt, emphasized that Bitcoin (BTC) is nearing the valuation of Google, as it heads toward $1.5 trillion in market capitalization.Currently, as of April 17, the market cap of Bitcoin is hovering at around $1.12 trillion as the entire valuation of the crypto market remains comfortably above $2 trillion.The similarity between Bitcoin and Google that Zschaepitz pointed out is that both have dominance in their respective sectors.Bitcoin has the strongest network effect in the cryptocurrency market, accounting for more than 51% of the global cryptocurrency market.Google has dominance over the search engine market and has a massive share of the video-sharing and streaming sector with its ownership of YouTube.Zschaepitz wrote:Whether Bitcoin's dominance over the cryptocurrency market would be sustained over the long term remains in question, due to the rising valuation of Ethereum and layer-one blockchain networks.However, the major difference between Bitcoin and the rest of the market is that there is clear institutional demand for BTC as a store of value due to its unrivaled blockchain network computing power and therefore, security and trustlessness.Hence, investors generally view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and the de facto reserve cryptocurrency.In January, JPMorgan strategists wrote that Bitcoin could rise to as high as $146,000 as it competes against gold as a store of value.The strategists said:Traditional financial institutions are also acknowledging the importance of Bitcoin's network effect and its dominance in the crypto market as the go-to store of value.In the foreseeable future, the sentiment around Bitcoin remains mixed after the public listing of Coinbase.Following the listing of COIN, there is speculation that it could mark the top of the crypto market.However, most on-chain data and market indicators such as funding rates do not necessarily suggest that a blow-off top is near.For instance, popular crypto trader known as ""Crypto Capo"" said:Meanwhile, key on-chain metrics also suggest that Bitcoin price is still far from the bull market top. On the contrary, BTC price may easily reach six figures, as forecast on the popular stock-to-flow model, and even go as high as $400,000, according to Bloomberg analysts. "
407,"The cryptocurrency markets experienced a monumental green wave this week. Bitcoin and Ether calmly made new all-time highs on the back of Coinbase’s direct listing and the Berlin hard fork. Meanwhile, meme-cryptocurrency Dogecoin blasted off to more than 400% gains, briefly claiming a spot as a top 5 cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Despite the media hype and market movements of this week, PlanB showed Bitcoin still isn’t as overbought as it was at the peaks of the 2017, 2013, and 2011 bull cycles. He calculated that if Bitcoin were to reach those levels by April's end, its price would clear $90K.Yet, this explosive week still has many wondering, “Does the market have enough steam to continue this bull wave?”Experienced trader and market analyst Eric Crown thinks so:In this exclusive Cointelegraph interview, Crown explains:Watch the full video on Cointelegraph’s YouTube channel and don’t forget to subscribe!"
408,"The United States Department of Treasury is again sharpening its sword upon crypto. In January 2021, the Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued Notice 2020-2. The Notice states that FinCEN intends to amend its regulations concerning the reporting of foreign financial accounts to include digital currency as a type of reportable account. In simple terms, this means FinCEN may soon require crypto users to file annual Reports of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, or FBARs, for crypto held on foreign exchanges. The effects of such an amendment are expansive. A mere paragraph long, the notice carries several implications that affect crypto owners — well beyond a simple FBAR report.Presently, cryptocurrency accounts are not reportable accounts within the meaning of the FBAR regulations. Should a change occur, crypto owners — already burdened by heightened Internal Revenue Service focus — would then be required to report annually the highest aggregate balances of their crypto accounts to FinCEN.This requirement is in addition to the crypto disclosure question on IRS Form 1040, Individual Income Tax Return. Along with disclosing the highest aggregate balance, the crypto owner must also disclose the custodian of the crypto, its location and the crypto account number (or some other identifier). Assuming the reporting rules stay the same, the crypto accounts would be reported on FinCEN Form 114 and filed electronically by April 15 of the following applicable year (like tax returns).But not all crypto accounts would be reportable. The FBAR filing requirement only applies to foreign accounts whose balances exceed $10,000 (in the aggregate) for the tax year. So, if two accounts have a combined account balance greater than $10,000 at any one time, then both accounts are reportable.For example, if one holds $4,000 of Cardano (ADA) and another has $7,000 of Bitcoin (BTC) on a non-U.S. exchange, both holdings are reportable because, in the aggregate, they exceed $10,000. Therefore, crypto owners should carefully track the fair market values of their crypto accounts throughout the year in a volatile market. What is worth $5,000 today could exceed the $10,000 threshold in a short time.And failure to disclose a reportable account is a fool’s errand. FBAR penalties are draconian. For “non-willful” failures to file FBARs, the penalty is $10,000 per failure. The courts are currently in flux over whether that $10,000 is per account per year or just per FBAR due.The IRS — predictably — takes the former view. If the $10,000 penalty is per account per year, it is easy to see how FBAR penalties can easily exceed the actual balances of the accounts themselves. That is, a taxpayer could pay more in FBAR penalties than the worth of their accounts. And for “willful” non-compliance, the penalties teeter on unconscionability. They prescribe a civil penalty for willfully failing to file an FBAR of up to $100,000 or 50% of the balance in the account at the time of the violation. Willful violations include both knowing and reckless nondisclosures.There is yet another requirement birthed from the possible changes in the FBAR regulation. At the bottom of Schedule B of Form 1040, there is a series of foreign bank account questions. Presumably, if crypto accounts fall within the new FBAR regulations, then an FBAR-reporting taxpayer would also need to answer the Schedule B questions in the affirmative. And answering in the negative is not a good choice. Untruthfully answering “no” to the Schedule B foreign bank account questions is considered “willful” behavior in the eyes of the IRS.And importantly, unlike the FBAR rules, there is no account value threshold with the Schedule B questions. Voluntary foreign bank account disclosures do not begin and end with the filing of an annual FBAR. If applicable, the taxpayer must also answer the Schedule B foreign bank account questions truthfully.Regrettably, the work does not stop there. If crypto accounts are deemed reportable accounts under the FBAR regulations, then they are naturally reportable accounts under IRS Form 8938. If U.S. taxpayers have a financial interest in specified foreign financial assets and meet certain account balance thresholds, they must also file a Form 8938 with their Form 1040 Individual Income Tax Return. Form 8938 is an attachment to Form 1040. The same foreign bank accounts reportable under the FBAR regulations are currently the same types of accounts reportable on Form 8938. In effect, the FBAR disclosures bleed over to Form 8938.The reporting thresholds are different, however. To be reportable, for unmarried taxpayers, the foreign bank account balances must exceed $50,000 on the last day of the tax year, or if more than $75,000 at any time during the year, to implicate Form 8938. The thresholds are higher for Married Filing Jointly taxpayers. And akin to FBAR, the penalties are heavy-handed. There is a $10,000 penalty for failure to disclose on Form 8938 and an additional $10,000 for every 30 days of non-filing after the IRS notices the taxpayer of a failure to disclose for a potential maximum penalty of $60,000.Criminal penalties may also apply. Effectively, FBAR and Form 8938 are two peas in a pod, and a crypto owner may need to report on both Forms. For a good comparison of FBAR and Form 8938, see here.In all of this, there may be a ray of good news. I previously argued for a crypto income tax amnesty program, and this may be a case where amnesty emerges. Currently, there are several voluntary disclosure procedures for failures to file FBARs. Presumably, if crypto accounts are the types of accounts now reportable under the FBAR regulations, then the same amnesty procedures should apply to crypto accounts as well. Unless the new regulations carve out an exception, crypto accounts may fall within those types of accounts available to participate in the Offshore Voluntary Disclosure procedures. And importantly, the procedures capture “both” penalties for nondisclosure and the penalties for the non-reporting of income. It is an amnesty program that covers both.For example, let’s assume the new FBAR regulations go into effect in 2021. A crypto owner named Joe fails to report capital gains on his crypto in tax years 2021, 2022 and 2023. In each year, Joe also fails to file FBARs on his crypto accounts. Then, in 2024, Joe wants to come clean. Presumably, Joe can then participate in the FBAR voluntary disclosure procedures and capture both his failure to file his FBARs as well as his failure to report his crypto capital gains. While Joe must pay a 5% miscellaneous penalty under voluntary disclosure procedures, he can avoid the $10,000 “non-willful” penalty for each year and avoid any additional penalties associated with his non-reporting of crypto income, including the 20% accuracy-related penalty and civil fraud penalties. This may be a backdoor into crypto income tax amnesty.What started as an innocuous one-paragraph notice, Notice 2020-2 carries broad implications. It is not uncommon for a tax reporting requirement to touch one or more tax forms as it does here. Crypto owners are well served to understand the breadth of the tax code. A misstep in one area is likely a misstep in another.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal advice.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
409,"Speculation about the duration of the current run is endless, with Bitcoin now a stable news item even in the mainstream press. But what’s keeping the BTC price up? Is it simply the relentless slew of good news, or are there on-chain indicators that can predict future price moves?Since retesting the $50,000 barrier in early March, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has held pretty consistently above that level. Even a pullback in the last week of March couldn’t sustain, with bulls pushing the price back up toward a new all-time high close to $65,000. The argument that good news is buoying the market is self-evident simply because it’s undeniable that we’ve seen a kind of FOMO snowball effect among institutions over recent months.The bull run kicked off in the last quarter of 2020, and the fact that prices suddenly spiked in October amid news that PayPal was entering the crypto space cannot be ignored. Further bullish action followed when JPMorgan launched its long-awaited JPM coin.This year, MicroStrategy went on an epic buying spree, accompanied by Tesla’s endorsement with a $1.5-billion investment. The big banks, including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, expanding their service offerings to cryptocurrencies has added further credibility to the argument that crypto is taking its place as an established asset class. Most recently, the excitement of Coinbase’s listing on Nasdaq — the first of its kind in the crypto industry — has also played a part in ensuring that digital assets remain firmly on the global news agenda.On a macro level, the ongoing push to get a Bitcoin ETF approved by United States regulators also provides further bullish sentiments. — although, in the view of one analyst, it could still be another two years before approval is forthcoming.While the theory that good news is propping up Bitcoin prices may not create a long-term bull case in and of itself, the market action has evidently been sufficient to make big investors and institutions sit up and take notice. A report from eToroX published in January, which interviewed institutional players, seems to agree with this notion.The report found that BTC had to reach a high enough price to make it attractive to institutions when balanced against other barriers to entry, such as regulatory risk, the potential for fraud and access to the necessary infrastructure. One respondent had even gone as far as defining a price threshold of $25,000, indicating that the current prices are more than enough to keep institutional investors engaged.Johnny Lyu, CEO of KuCoin, also believes that underlying fears regarding the state of the broader markets are playing a part in institutional cryptocurrency adoption, telling Cointelegraph: “The recent rise is related to the fear of long-lasting quantitative easing and global inflation.” He further gave an inside look by saying that “trading behavior on KuCoin shows that Western investors are more involved in this run compared to their Asian counterparts.”The rationale here is that Western countries have proven less capable of handling the spread of COVID-19, resulting in more government spending and a heavier economic impact. However, Robbie Liu, a market analyst at OKEx Insights, pointed out that there’s still significant interest from Asian investors. He highlighted that the appetite for stablecoins is a bullish signal:The problem with the idea that prices are driven entirely by positive sentiment resulting from news headlines is that it doesn’t create a case for long-term price sustainability. Put simply, if the good news dries up, prices could reverse, creating a similar snowball effect of bad news in a plummeting market.From this perspective, it’s worth examining some of the on- and off-chain fundamentals that could be driving prices. Here, there are many reasons to remain positive. However, there are still fundamentals that suggest the 2021 bull run is far from over. Glassnode data shows that the volume of BTC held on exchanges is on a continuous downward trajectory, reducing liquid supply.However, the number of addresses holding over 1,000 BTC recently hit an all-time high, indicating that more whales than ever are choosing to hodl. Miners have also recently joined the trend, stacking more BTC than they’re selling. If to use the theory of market cycles, it seems inevitable that the bull run will end at some point — the question is when.If selling activity is any indicator, the peak is still some way off. According to a recent report, long-term hodlers are proving reluctant to let go of their investments, which typically occurs during the second half of a market cycle as they seek to take profits. Therefore, this bull run is particularly unusual, based on previous price peaks. Profit-seekers usually cash out after holding between one week and one month. In this case, they’re hodling firm.The realized hodl ratio chart also backs up this view, as it’s reliably correlated to all of the previous reversals in BTC macrocycles. As can be seen from the chart below, when the ratio reaches a level above 50,000, the bull market is about to reach its peak.If history can foretell the future, it will show that the bull run is only around halfway through this cycle, indicating that a $100,000 BTC before the end of this year is well within the realms of possibility. Jason Deane, Bitcoin analyst at crypto advisory firm Quantum Economics, demurred on providing a price prediction. But when speaking to Cointelegraph, he stated:Igneus Terrenus, head of communications at Bybit exchange, considers that the current speculation seen on the derivatives markets can reveal much about what to expect from the rest of 2021. He told Cointelegraph that: “With June, September and December futures trading at high premiums, we can surmise that the market is betting on the bull run to continue for the rest of 2021.” He further added that: “In the longer term, where BTC price goes is as much dependent upon its fundamentals as the strength of the [U.S.] dollar.”According to quant analyst PlanB, the stock-to-flow predictions reveal that the bull run is in an even earlier part of the cycle than the hodl stats indicate. The analyst’s “Situational Awareness Stock-to-Flow Cross-Asset Model” chart has tracked previous bull cycles with eye-opening precision, and hopes are high among the hodlers that this one will not be any different.My favorite chart for Situational Awareness: S2FX for rough long term level forecast (white line), combined with accurate on-chain bull/bear recognition signal (color overlay). #InOrbeTerrumNonVisi pic.twitter.com/KZcZCzldgIExtrapolating the current bull/bear recognition signals out, PlanB’s forecast using the S2FX model calls a 2021 high of $288,000. However, the price peak during this Bitcoin mining reward halving cycle could go as high as $576,000, with the 2021 high forming an average for the entire cycle.If this seems ambitious, then bear in mind that there’s no precedent in Bitcoin’s history for the kind of institutional inflows that are currently being seen, let alone the lack of liquidity as investors seek to hoard their holdings. So, even previous bull patterns may not be the most reliable predictors for this cycle.Overall, the solid fundamentals combined with a continuing sense of FOMO from institutions mean that there’s a solid case for believing that this bull market will keep running for quite some time to come."
410,"Ever since the publication of Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper back in November 2008, “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” the term “blockchain” has been synonymous with digital currencies in the sense of the underlying technology that allows for the transfer of value, peer-to-peer. What’s interesting is that the term “blockchain” is not used once in that white paper. The purpose of the paper was to propose a solution to the core issue of double-spending a digital currency, which is the representation of a transfer of value directly between transacting parties, without the use of a central trusted third party.Currencies by definition are a medium of exchange for goods and services, a unit of account, as well as stores of value. Money, in its traditional sense, fulfills all of these three elements.There is continued significant interest in central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, at this time — not from the blockchain and crypto community but actually from a core group of some of the most influential central banks, including the Bank of England, the Swiss National Bank, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada, the Swedish Riksbank and the Bank of International Settlements.Related: Did CBDCs affect the crypto space in 2020, and what’s next in 2021? Experts answerThe confirmation in late 2020 from the United Kingdom’s chancellor of the exchequer (the head of Her Majesty's Treasury), states that the United Kingdom will draft regulations for private stablecoins and research CBDCs, demonstrating the momentum that this topic currently has. China has undoubtedly emerged as a leader in its development of CBDCs, having recently proposed that there be a global set of rules that addresses issues such as interoperability between jurisdictions.Related: How the digital yuan stablecoin impacts crypto in China: Experts answerCentral to any national monetary policy and financial stability is the public’s trust in central banks, and its trust that money provided by the central bank fulfills those three key elements of a currency — whether it’s issued in physical or digital form. A central bank digital currency is not a stablecoin nor is it a digital asset but rather a digital representation of cash — i.e., that a digital pound today is worth the same tomorrow and its purchasing power (what its holder can buy) does not fluctuate beyond certain thresholds.The European Central Bank’s proposal for a digital euro is built upon the premise of complementing the current cash and wholesale central bank deposit system in place. It is seen as a way of ensuring that European citizens are provided with access to a safe form of money in a fast-changing digital world, while actively promoting innovation in the field of retail payments, supporting society’s vulnerable and reducing their potential financial exclusion. A digital euro is also seen as an option for the reduction of the overall cost and ecological footprint of the current monetary and payments system.Related: All that mined is not green: Bitcoin’s carbon footprint hard to estimateWith economies currently experiencing the development of ideas around central bank issues, stablecoins or private digital currencies, the experience has been roughly the same as with previous monetary innovations: coins, banknotes, checks and credit cards. Many see blockchain and distributed ledger technology, or DLT, as the mechanism to replace electronic currency in traditional bank accounts. Just as paper money succeeded gold and silver, electronic transfers could replace paper money.The current COVID-19 pandemic bought motivation for cashless transactions and impacted the way society interacts financially, which has accelerated the concept of digital currencies in people’s minds. With fewer cash transactions taking place, businesses and consumers are more aware of the attributes and advantages of digital currencies.Related: How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the crypto space? Experts answerAlready, central banks engage with other qualifying financial institutions, most often clearing banks, through the use of electronic central bank deposits. Alongside this system, they also issue banknotes and coins to the public. A shift to digital versions of those notes and coins is a natural progression in our more digitized world.However, this trend could lead to an unintended consequence: Within a cashless society, where the public no longer has access to a state-guaranteed system of payment, the private sector would control access to, development of and pricing for alternative payment methods. Unless, that is, governments issue digital currencies to the public through their respective central banks. But in a system where central banks could have a direct relationship with each individual, there would be significant disruption in the commercial banking market, including the issues of significant data holding and related data privacy. Would citizens want the central bank to know about each transaction they’ve made?To facilitate any CBDC, the technology platform should fulfill certain key attributes:With the example of Bitcoin (BTC), the blockchain infrastructure provides a fully decentralized, fully permissionless public network that, theoretically, no-one person, entity or authority has control over. In the same way, blockchain and/or DLTs can provide a similar network to support the issue of CBDCs among a national population.However, the more popular framework for digital currencies is a centralized, permissioned network that provides the issuing authority, which is usually the national central bank, with a degree of control and greater oversight of the “blockchain” that records the digital currency transactions. That centralized permissioned distributed ledger could address these key attributes.For some commentators, the ability of central banks to issue programmable CBDCs on a centralized permissioned blockchain is a positive development — for example, defining and controlling the uses of the digital money issued so that it can only be used for food, not alcohol, cigarettes or gambling. There are also transparency benefits that allow governments to act upon tax evasion and other criminal activity, by way of access to the underlying transactional data.The original rationale for Satoshi’s white paper was to establish a protocol that allowed for the digital exchange of value, peer-to-peer without the reliance or requirement to go through a central authority.It’s ironic that the very benefits that Satoshi explained in that white paper are now being considered by central banks as they research and consider how the technology could underpin new digitally issued currency. The two concepts have come into everyday conversation almost simultaneously, making it seem as if they are interwoven. Yet both the technology and the use case can exist apart.Digital Isle of Man, an executive agency for the Isle of Man’s government, continues to encourage and support research into the issuance and use of digital currencies in all their forms, including stablecoins and CBDCs. Soramitsu, a fintech company delivering blockchain based solutions to businesses and governments — which is currently an associate of the agency’s accelerator program — recently announced its partnership with the National Bank of Cambodia to establish a secure, standardized digital currency alternative to paper bank notes on a single payment platform. The Bakong system is built upon the Hyperledger Iroha DLT, integrated with the traditional banking system, and providing users with easy access via ID document scan, photo check and biometric detection. Having such international experience provides the island with significant insight into any potential future implementation of digital currencies.There are, of course, a number of technical, economic, financial and legal issues, including the impact of a digital currency on monetary policy, financial stability and banks’ business models, which are unfortunately beyond the limits of this article.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
411,"After breaking out of the two-months ascending triangle, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) is firmly staying above $60,000. Current on-chain volume suggests investors are still strongly buying Bitcoin at current price levels.Furthermore, the current price is not even close to a short-term price top when comparing to historic network valuation multiples.While bear market bottoms often coincide with seller exhaustion, bull cycle tops happen to occur with buyer exhaustion. Watching long-term investor activity during the different stages in a bull market proved to be a good indicator for BTC price support levels and overheated conditions in the past. Current investor activity suggests that the market price is far from overheated.On-chain analyst Willy Woo, who developed a methodology to measure this activity, describes it as follows:The investor activity, expressed in on-chain volume is then multiplied by the 2-year moving median of the ""Network Value"" over ""Transactions"" (NVT) and is then divided by the circulating supply. The price that is derived through this methodology is called ""NVT Price.""NVT price does not only give a good indication of how much volume is willing to pay current prices but it can also be used as an estimate of the price floor in a bull market due to the long-term moving average of NVT. Therefore, NVT could also be called the valuation multiple of the network derived from transaction volume or could be thought of as the PE, or ""price to earnings,"" ratio of Bitcoin.The market price rarely dipped below the NVT price during a bull market. If it did, it proved to be an excellent buying opportunity. The current NVT Price is $47,500. Based on yesterday's closing price of $61,600 per Bitcoin, the market is willing to pay a premium of 1.3 times the current long-term investor valuation. This multiple is called the NVT premium.During prior bull markets, NVT premiums above 2 turned out to be short-term price tops, and above 3.5 marked the top of a bull market. Currently, this metric suggests that the current NVT premium of 1.3 is nowhere near prior bull market tops.Based on the current NVT price of $47,500, the next major short-term top with an NVT premium of 2 could likely be at or above $95,000 while a potential cycle top, with an NVT premium of 3.5, could be at or above $166,300.While an NVT premium of 1.3 may see a short-term drop in the price by 30% or more, the multiple also shows that it would be at least another 54% price increase from yesterday's closing price to reach a potential short-term cycle top.However, this assumes that history will repeat again and that similar NVT premiums as in prior bull markets would be reached again. Neither is guaranteed, of course. Nevertheless, if this phenomenon were to repeat, the risk-to-reward ratio certainly favors the upside.What's more, a $166,000 price tag may actually be a fairly conservative prediction, according to Woo. As Cointelegraph previously reported, the analyst explained that BTC price could also reach as high as $300,000 by December 2021, based on other metrics.

412,"Dogecoin’s (DOGE) massive rally to $0.45 propelled it to a market capitalization of over $54 billion to make it the fifth most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap.This lofty market cap comes as a surprise to many since the project has no active developers and is only a meme coin, thus the current rally brings back memories of the excesses seen during the ICO boom in 2017.Rallies like the one seen in Dogecoin indicate that several traders have entered the fray and are looking to get rich overnight. The only positive sign is that the mania has not spread to other coins. If it does, then the crypto markets are likely to witness a sharp correction in order to shake out the weak hands.CNBC host Jim Cramer has become one of the first well-known people to reveal that he closed half of his Bitcoin (BTC) position. While Cramer’s selling is an isolated event, it does warn that not all professional investors who have recently turned Bitcoin believers are going to be long-term HODLers.If the institutional investors rush to the exit, it could cause a huge correction in several cryptocurrencies. Traders should be mindful of irrational exuberance and avoid being sucked into FOMO-driven trades as it's better to stick to a trading plan and think long-term rather than dream of overnight riches.Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to identify the critical support levels and outline various bullish and bearish scenarios.The bulls could not capitalize and build upon the breakout of the overhead resistance zone at $60,000 to $61,825.84 on April 13. Bitcoin price turned down on April 14 after hitting an all-time high at $64,849.27 and the bulls are currently attempting to flip the $60,000 level to support.If they manage to do that, the BTC/USDT pair may make one more attempt to resume the uptrend. A breakout of $64,849.27, could start the next leg of the uptrend that could reach $69,540 and then $79,566.However, the negative divergence on the relative strength index (RSI) is warning of a possible correction. Interestingly, the price reversed direction when the RSI had reached close to the downtrend line.If the price dips below the 20-day exponential moving average ($59,427), it will be the first sign that buyers may be losing their grip. The break below the 50-day simple moving average ($55,814) will further cement the view that a deeper correction is likely.The bulls may attempt to arrest the decline near $50,460.02 but if this level cracks, the pair could drop to the critical support at $43,006.77.Ether (ETH) extended its uptrend and hit an all-time high at $2,545.80 today. Profit-booking by traders pulled the price down to $2,300 but the long tail on the day’s candlestick suggests that bulls continue to buy on dips.If the price recovers and the bulls push the price above $2,545.8, the ETH/USDT pair could start the next leg of the uptrend. The next target objective on the upside is $2,745 and then the psychological level at $3,000.The upsloping 20-day EMA ($2,131) and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. This bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the price down to $1,925.10.Binance Coin (BNB) formed a Doji candlestick pattern on April 14 and that was followed by an inside day candlestick pattern on April 15. Both these setups indicate indecision among the bulls and the bears. This uncertainty resolved to the downside today.However, a minor positive is that the bulls are defending the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $483.95, as seen from the long tail on the day’s candlestick. The bulls will now try to push the BNB/USDT pair above the all-time high at $638.56 and resume the uptrend.Conversely, a break below $483.95 could pull the price down to the 20-day EMA ($437). A break below this support will suggest that the traders are rushing to the exit and that could result in a drop to the breakout level at $348.69.XRP is currently correcting the sharp rally. The bulls are attempting to defend the first support at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.48, as seen from the long tail on the day’s candlestick.The XRP/USDT pair may now consolidate between $1.48 and $1.96 for a few days before starting the next trending move.A break above $1.96 could start the next leg of the uptrend that could reach $2.54. The rising moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest the bulls have the upper hand.Contrary to this positive assumption, if the bears sink the price below the $1.48 support, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($1.18). Such a move will suggest the bullish momentum has weakened and that could delay the next leg of the uptrend.Dogecoin’s momentum has been picking up since the past three days and that has resulted in the massive pump today. This shows that more and more traders are getting sucked into the trade due to FOMO.Usually, such buying frenzies end in a major top formation. After the last bull has purchased, the price reverses direction and the waterfall decline starts. It is difficult to predict a top during such a frenzy but the psychological $0.50 level may act as a hurdle.The decline after the DOGE/USDT pair tops out is likely to be vicious. The usual 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level may not hold and the pair is likely to drop to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.20.Traders should control the urge to get into such trades even at the risk of missing out on some profits.Cardano (ADA) has been facing a tough battle between the bull and the bears near $1.48 for the past two days. Although the bulls managed to push the price above $1.48 today, the bears have been quick to pull the price back below the level.After the third unsuccessful attempt to sustain the price above $1.48, the bulls seem to have dumped their positions today, resulting in the formation of an outside day candlestick pattern.However, the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests the bulls bought the dips to the 20-day EMA ($1.28) aggressively. The bulls may now make one more attempt to drive the price above the $1.48 to $1.55 resistance zone.If they manage to do that, the ADA/USDT pair could resume the uptrend and start the journey toward $2. Conversely, a break below the moving averages could offer the bears an opportunity to sink the price to $1.03.The bulls pushed Polkadot (DOT) above the $42.28 level on April 13 but could not challenge the all-time high at $46.80. This shows a lack of demand at higher levels. The altcoin has dropped below $42.28 today and the bears will now try to sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($40).If they succeed, the selling could pick up further as the bulls may rush to cover their positions. Such a move could sink the DOT/USDT pair to $32.50 and then to the critical support at $26.50.Contrary to this assumption, if the price again rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bulls have not given up. They will make one more attempt to thrust the price above the $46.80 resistance and resume the uptrend.Litecoin (LTC) is in a strong uptrend. The bears had tried to start a correction today but the bulls purchased the dips aggressively as seen from the long tail on the day’s candlestick. The reversal may have caught several aggressive bears on the wrong foot, which could be the reason for the pick-up in momentum.The LTC/USDT pair has broken out of the target objective at $307.42, clearing the path for a rally to $374. However, the RSI above 76 signals caution because, in the past, the pair has repeatedly entered a correction when the RSI level reaches close to 80.The critical support to watch on the downside is the 20-day EMA ($241). A break below this support will be the first sign that the bulls are tiring and a deeper correction is likely.Uniswap (UNI) broke out to a new all-time high on April 15 but the bulls are struggling to sustain the higher levels. When the price fails to follow up higher after breaking out of a significant resistance, it indicates exhaustion.However, the long tail on the day’s candlestick suggests the bulls continue to buy on dips. If the buyers can propel the price above the all-time high at $39.60, the UNI/USDT pair could rally to $43.43 and then $50.On the other hand, if the price again turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($32), several aggressive bulls who had purchased the breakout of $35.20 may bail out of their positions. The long liquidation could pull the price down to $27.97.Chainlink (LINK) surged above the $36.93 overhead resistance on April 14, signaling the resumption of the uptrend. The altcoin hit an all-time high at $44.33 where profit-booking set in.However, the long tail on the day’s candlestick suggests that the bulls aggressively purchased the dip to $38.52 today. This indicates that the sentiment remains positive and the bulls are buying at lower levels.The buyers will now try to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $44.33. If they succeed, the LINK/USDT pair could rally to $50.Contrary to this assumption, if the price again turns down and breaks below the $36.93 support, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($34). If this support cracks, the decline could extend to the 50-day SMA ($30).The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

413,"It’s undeniable that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) are currently the two most dominant cryptocurrencies, and as a result, they receive most of the attention from the mainstream media, institutional investors and retail investors, but this doesn't mean that the sector leaders are not occasionally challenged by competitor networks.Two forked projects that once sought to challenge Bitcoin and Ethereum for their seats at the top are Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). In the past week, both coins have demonstrated that they are still capable of generating excitement and producing big gains.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that the price of BCH has climbed 125% over the past two weeks, ring from a low of $523 on April 4 to a high of $1,175 on April 16. During the same time period, ETC staged a 250% rally from $13.30 to a new all-time high at $46.53 on April 16.Bitcoin Cash arose out of contention in the Bitcoin community centered around the scalability of the Bitcoin blockchain and the desire to increase the block size.As a result of the disagreement, part of the community split off and “forked” Bitcoin to create Bitcoin Cash in order to implement the desired code updates.The protocol now aims to be a peer-to-peer electronic cash system capable of being used to conduct fast payments around the world with low fees, user privacy and a high transaction capacity.Momentum for Bitcoin Cash began pickup up at the beginning of April as the cryptocurrency market as a whole received increased attention from the mainstream media and financial markets. One theory suggests that new investors look for older coins with lower valuations as a starting point instead of chasing after Ether and Bitcoin, which may appear expensive to new crypto traders.With Bitcoin now back above $61,000 and its hash rate hitting a record high of 200 exahashes per second, the top cryptocurrency is out of reach for many smaller investors and miners who may be turning to BCH as a more feasible option.Ethererum Classic emerged in 2016 as the result of a hard fork within the Ethereum community following the hack of a popular platform called The DAO. Initially, The DAO was an early decentralized autonomous organization intended to act as an investor-directed venture capital firm.Ethereum Classic is actually the original legacy chain of the Etherum network that didn’t take corrective measures to recover funds lost in the hack, an act take as a way of maintaining the ethos of finality.While Ethereum has gone on to become the widely adopted version of the network, Ethereum has continued on its own path and is once again gaining attention from the crypto community as high transaction costs and Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake consensus has lifted ETC to new highs as users look for compatible options.The hash rate of the Ethereum Classic network has steadily been climbing over the past six months alongside the rising price of ETC, helping to make the network more attractive to interested miners and increasing the overall security.As more participants enter the crypto market in search of good deals on established projects, legacy coins like BCH and ETC could possibly see further price growth.

414,"Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a classic indicator of a coming bull run pass a historic milestone as miners commit more and more resources to its future.According to data from on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode on Friday, Bitcoin’s network hash rate has passed total exahashes per second for the first time in its history.Coming as a spike in a long-term uptrend, crossing the significant boundary means that the hash rate has doubled in under nine months. An estimate of the computing power dedicated to the network by miners, the hash rate has traditionally acted as an early signal that a bull run is imminent. Price action, as various sources have noted over the years, tends to follow any major rises weeks to months later.As Cointelegraph reported, however, the hash rate is just one of a host of on-chain metrics flashing firmly bullish this year. Commenting on their relationship to price, investor and serial Bitcoin pundit Anthony Pompliano argued that new all-time highs for BTC/USD were similarly foretold by prior on-chain activity.“This comes as no surprise, with last week’s letter describing a very bullish setup on-chain and was just a waiting game until price broke out of consolidation,” he wrote in his latest newsletter Friday.Joining the optimism on the day, meanwhile, was the so-called “Coinbase premium,” a metric dedicated to the difference in the price of Bitcoin on major exchange Coinbase versus fellow trading platform Binance.As noted by data resource CryptoQuant, the higher the “premium,” the more implied buying pressure Coinbase is seeing. Currently, the figure sits at 0.33, spiking sharply overnight.Coinbase successfully debuted on Nasdaq earlier this week, bringing its profile and that of cryptocurrency more broadly to a new mainstream audience.Bitcoin itself, however, has yet to see a transformation — its price coming down from the highs witnessed just before Coinbase went public to test $60,000 support repeatedly thereafter.An area around $61,200, described as crucial to maintaining upward momentum, failed to secure bulls’ interests.Turkey moving to ban transactions in cryptocurrency, while practically irrelevant to the industry as a whole, did not help sentiment as the news broke earlier on the day. The ban will take effect on April 30."
415,"Three exchange-traded funds offered by Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest, including the flagship Ark Innovation ETF, all added further shares in Coinbase (COIN) to their positions on Thursday.According to a report from Reuters, the Ark Innovation ETF, Ark Next Generation Internet ETF and Ark Fintech Innovation ETF purchased a combined total of 341,186 shares, valued at $110 million at the close of trading on Thursday, with each share valued at $322.75.The previous day, the three ARK funds together accumulated 749,205 COIN shares, worth approximately $246 million combined. Wednesday's bolstering of Ark's Coinbase position brings the three funds' total stock of Coinbase shares, just days after the cryptocurrency exchange's Nasdaq debut, to over a million shares — 1,090,391 to be exact.Ark Invest has offered the bullish prediction that Bitcoin's (BTC) future total market capitalization will one day “comfortably eclipse” that of gold and exceed $10 trillion. Wood herself has also been optimistic about the prospects of regulatory approval for a Bitcoin ETF from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission under the new Joe Biden administration. She has pointed, in particular, to President Biden's pick for SEC chair, Gary Gensler, whose knowledge and understanding of cryptocurrencies and related technologies is solid. Ark Invest's call on Coinbase this week further increases its indirect exposure to cryptocurrencies. As analysts noted yesterday, the funds simultaneously sold a portion of their shares in Tesla — itself an investor in Bitcoin. Tesla stock nonetheless remains Ark's largest position by value on its major funds.Shares in Coinbase had a pre-listing reference price of $250 and opened at a significantly higher figure of $381 on their Wednesday debut. A volatile first day of trading saw shares in the exchange peak at $429.54 and drop to $310.44 before closing at $328.28. "
416,"r/Wallstreetbets, a subreddit famous for organizing a pump for Dogecoin and the GameStop short squeeze, is enacting a crypto discussion ban after officially allowing the topic for a single day.Subreddit moderator u/bawse1 announced on Thursday that r/Wallstreetbets has now banned crypto discussions forever, following a Bloomberg article titled “WallStreetBets Bows to Crypto.” Just a day before, the same moderator officially announced that the subreddit will finally allow crypto discussion strictly limited to Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE). The new post reads:A Thursday update to r/Wallstreetbets rules reads that the subreddit will automatically remove content mentioning cryptocurrencies alongside nonfungible tokens. “You can mention it in passing but posts whose sole topic is cryptocurrency or the underlying technology are not allowed. The crypto market tends to consist of small accounts and pump & dumps,” the subreddit’s content guide notes.Founded back in 2012, r/Wallstreetbets is a subreddit where participants discuss stock and option trading. Boasting nearly 10 million members, the subreddit became extremely popular this year after r/Wallstreetbets collectively pumped GameStop’s stock, skyrocketing the price from about $20 in early January to above $340 on Jan. 28.While the GME craze has somewhat cooled down, with the stock trading at $158 at the time of writing, DOGE has been repeatedly breaking new all-time highs recently, setting a new record of $0.29 on Friday. The altcoin is up more than 380% over the past seven days, gaining more than 6,000% in the past 12 months."
417,"Depending on where you stand on the GameStop saga, which saw organized retail traders extract $6 billion from Wall Street overnight, you may think someone should either take the matches away from Elon Musk, or give him more.The CEO and “Technoking” of Tesla was accused of pouring “jet fuel” on the GameStop short-squeeze at a critical moment by hedge fund manager David Einhorn, founder of Greenlight Capital, in a letter to investors published on Thursday.Einhorn said Musk and venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya were the real instigators behind the short-squeeze, claiming both had supplied “the real jet fuel” for the pump with their tweets and TV appearances.“We note that the real jet fuel on the GME squeeze came from Chamath Palihapitiya and Elon Musk, whose appearances on TV and Twitter, respectively, at a critical moment further destabilized the situation,” wrote Einhorn, according to Markets Insider.Amid the orchestrated short-squeeze on GameStop by redditors on r/Wallstreetbets, Musk tweeted what some interpreted as his support for the endeavor. On Jan. 26, shortly after the GME stock was pumped 91% in a single day, Musk tweeted the phrase “Gamestonk!!” accompanied by a link to the r/Wallstreetbets sub-reddit.Over the course of the next 24 hours, GME’s stock soared 134%, climbing from a unit price of $147 to $347. The following 24 hours brought even more fireworks, and by Jan. 28, the value of GameStop shares had hit an all-time high of $483 — an 18,693% increase on the stock’s value just nine months earlier.Palihapitiya appeared to voice his support for the short-squeeze on Jan. 27 when he told interviewers on CNBC that the GameStop saga was an example of the man on the street pushing back against the man on Wall Street.Einhorn said that “quasi-anarchy” now reigns, based on what he sees as toothless regulation of the stock market. Einhorn compared the situation, where “the laws don’t apply to [Elon Musk],” to the defunding of the police force.“Many who would never support defunding the police have supported — and for all intents and purposes have succeeded — in almost completely defanging, if not defunding, the regulators,” said Einhorn.Previously, Musk was suggested to have unduly influenced the cryptocurrency market with his vocal support of Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) via Twitter. Legal professionals suggested in February that Musk’s tweets may have acted as a catalyst for the coins’ gains at the time and warned that such tweets could attract attention from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.Musk laughed off the suggestion at the time, claiming that he would welcome any SEC investigation into his tweets and that he simply liked “dogs and memes.”"
418,"A new ban in Turkey will prohibit crypto holders from using their digital assets for payments in addition to preventing payments providers from providing fiat onramps for crypto exchanges.According to a Friday announcement by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, the ban will come into effect on April 30, rendering any crypto payments solutions and partnerships illegal.The bank stated that “any direct or indirect usage of crypto assets in payment services and electronic money issuance” will be forbidden.While banks are excluded from the regulation, which means users can still deposit Turkish lira on crypto exchanges using wire transfers from their bank accounts, payment providers will be unable to provide deposit or withdrawal services for crypto exchanges.Payments providers and digital wallets are widely used in Turkey to transfer fiat funds to crypto exchanges and vice versa. Major global exchange Binance partnered with local payment provider Papara when it had first entered the Turkish market to provide a lira onramp for several different cryptocurrencies. This new regulation means that users have two weeks to clear their balances if they exclusively use payment providers as fiat-to-crypto gateways. Historically, the Turkish government has always had a tight grip on the payments ecosystem. In 2016, Turkey banned major global payment provider PayPal in the country.Crypto regulation has been a hot topic for Turkey in recent months. Last month, the Turkish Ministry of Treasury and Finance announced that it was going to monitor the crypto ecosystem and work with the Central Bank, Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency, and Capital Markets Board to regulate crypto.Additional reporting by Cointelegraph Turkey’s Emre Günen."
419,"Dogecoin (DOGE), the meme-based altcoin that has become a favorite talking point of Elon Musk, has doubled in 24 hours to hit all-time highs of $0.29.Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed DOGE/USD outperforming other major cryptocurrencies by an order of magnitude on Friday.In what appears an almost unbelievable move, Dogecoin has also become the eighth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, surpassing Litecoin (LTC), Chainlink’s LINK and Uniswap (UNI), among others.At the time of writing, a single DOGE was trading at around $0.25. Gains on any timeframe remained beyond impressive — 80% on the day, 300% over the past week and year-to-date returns in excess of 5,000%. Versus the same date one year ago, shortly after the pit of the brief 2020 bear market, Dogecoin is up 12,600%.It appeared that even professional traders had been caught by surprise.“This is the first DOGE pump I have missed in years, but I still absolutely love to see it. Favorite asset of all time, changed my life in 2017. Happy for you guys who are in it, innit?” Scott Melker tweeted.As with altcoins more broadly, meanwhile, Doge’s historic reversal of fortune came at the expense of Bitcoin (BTC) on the day, with the largest cryptocurrency seeing a forecast retest of previous all-time highs around $61,000.Several tests of $61,000 support left the door open for further dips on Friday, bringing daily losses to around 2.8%.Bitcoin’s market cap dominance stood at 52.1%, also down noticeably in recent weeks as altcoins see their time in which some analysts believe will only reach a peak later this summer.A ban on transactions by Turkey’s central bank was tipped to have fuelled the loss of upside momentum, this being done due to possible “irrepairable” side-effects to the country’s established fiat payment network.“It is considered that their use in payments may cause non-recoverable losses for the parties to the transactions due to the above-listed factors and they include elements that may undermine the confidence in methods and instruments used currently in payments,” Reuters quoted a statement as saying.Also showing signs of a cooldown was Ether (ETH), which returned closer to $2,400 after seeing its own all-time highs above $2,500 the day before."
420,"The hashing power of top Bitcoin mining pools located in Northwest China appears to have plummeted due to a regional blackout to enable safety inspections.The news was reported by Wu Blockchain, the author of Chinese crypto newsletter Wublock, who noted significant drops in the hash rate of several major pools — with Antpool crashing 24.5%, Binance Pool dipping 20%, BTC.com falling 18.9% and Poolin dropping by 33%.The hashrate of Bitcoin mining pools plummeted in 24 hours. Antpools fell by 24.5%, https://t.co/1YRYr58dLy fell by 18.9%, Poolin fell by 33%, Binance pools fell by 20%. The reason is that Northwest China is undergoing a complete blackout for safety inspections. pic.twitter.com/vaWgYsMEFHAccording to an article on Chinese media outlet Wu Talk, the region of Xinjiang is currently experiencing a “comprehensive power outage safety inspection.”The inspections follow a recent flooding accident at a coal mine in Xinjiang that saw 21 miners temporarily trapped at three different locations. The mine was swamped in a sudden flood while making technical upgrades, resulting in communication interruptions and power outages underground. Nearly 1,500 rescue personnel were deployed to the mine to assist with the emergency.Xinjiang is a major source of global Bitcoin hash rate, with the Cambridge Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, or BECI, estimating the region currently represents nearly roughly 36% of China’s combined hashing power. With China comprising two-thirds of global mining power, BECI estimates Xianjian to comprise 23.3% of the global hash rate.According to Ycharts, the outages appear to have driven a roughly 2.2% drop in the Bitcoin network’s combined hash rate in the past 24 hours, which has slid from 169.4 million terahashes per second, or TH/s, to 165.8 TH/s as of this writing."
421,"Business TV personality and converted Bitcoin proponent Jim Cramer has sold half of what he calls his “phoney money” Bitcoin portfolio to pay off his mortgage..@jimcramer discloses that he bought a lot of bitcoin when it was around $12K. He says he sold half of it to pay off his mortgage yesterday. ""It was like phony money paying for real money... I think I won."" https://t.co/L909N1g6x0 pic.twitter.com/hfkzTmIdWlDuring Thursday’s broadcast of “Squawk on the Street,” co-anchor Jim Cramer revealed that he’s “decided to become an apostate,” by selling off half of his Bitcoin holdings to pay off his home. Cramer, who also hosts Mad Money, said that he bought a lot of Bitcoin at $12,000 because he thought it was a currency, and finally decided to take profits.“It was like, kind of, phoney money paying for real money,” Cramer laughed. “I now own a house — lock, stock, and barrel — because I bought this currency. I think I won!”Twitter user “SZ BeatzCoin” likened Cramer selling to the infamous pizza purchase for 10,000 BTC.Once a Bitcoin critic, Cramer told his CTO to put $500,000 into Bitcoin after speaking to Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano in September last year. He even considered putting 1% of his $150 million net worth into the digital asset.At the time, BTC was hovering between $10,000 and $12,000 but is now sitting at $63,000, up 425% in only six months.Famous NFL player Russell Okung, called to Pompliano to pull Cramer back onto the straight and narrow:Selling Bitcoin?

Yo, @APompliano, get your boy. https://t.co/DsxXQl7BXjIn December, Cramer said he bought more around the $17,000 price range, although he didn’t reveal how much.The TV personality returned to Pompliano’s podcast on March 22 to thank-him for the encouragement, explaining that he has since pulled out his initial investment and is now playing “with the house’s money,” and that he’s “never going to touch it.” That obviously hasn't lasted.Although he didn’t reveal how much his Bitcoin portfolio was worth, according to the cryptocurrency’s performance, it could have been around $2.4 million.Selling only 50% after a 5x gain doesn't sound toooo silly.During the brief discussion on “Squawk on the Street” Cramer also reaffirmed his opinions regarding Coinbase’s listing yesterday, stating that a $600 price target for Coinbase’s COIN stock is still right.By investing in Coinbase stock, he added, you not only get crypto but also “honest management.”"
422,"It was a relatively quiet week in China’s blockchain space as events were overshadowed by the surge in the BTC price and the Coinbase direct listing in the U.S. Many locals reacted with surprise to the news, showing that exposure to cryptocurrencies is still relatively isolated in the world’s most populous country.Many netizens responded skeptically to the Coinbase story, with news aggregation account “Jiemian” on Weibo calling Bitcoin a scam, highlighting its connection to terrorists, and encouraging investors to stick to China’s A-shares. (For a quick comparison, the Shanghai composite index is down 2.13% this year, while Bitcoin has a YTD return of over 116%.) Jiemian has over 10 million followers on Weibo, but caters to a more traditional audience. The takeaway here is that despite China’s aggressive adoption of DCEP (Digital Currency Electronic Payment, also known as the digital yuan), other digital payments, and internet technology, cryptocurrency acceptance remains relatively isolated.Some experts on China’s blockchain industry spoke to Cointelegraph regarding DCEP on April 10th, discussing how the digital yuan has affected the space. Kevin Shao, co-founder of Bitrise Capital, summed up the situation by stating that “overall, China’s digital currency still serves the central bank’s monetary policy and monetary functions.” It’s safe to say that the rapid DCEP advancement has little cross-over with the country’s active blockchain space, and probably will remain independent for the foreseeable future.While all that was going on, volumes were spiking on cryptocurrency exchanges around the world. Huobi, China’s largest exchange by liquidity, experienced a wave of trading on more established tokens. The top seven most traded on Thursday were BTC, DOGE, ETH, XRP, FIL, TRX and BCH. All of these projects have roots in previous bull runs, showing that nostalgia is not lost on Chinese investors.Customs in Hong Kong have busted a smuggling operation involving nearly 300 graphics cards, which are suspected to be Nvidia CMP 30HX models and worth about 2 million RMB, or $300,000. There were no labels on the front of the graphics cards, and this particular model comes without a video output port, and is built exclusively for cryptocurrency mining. According to a source, this is the first time that Hong Kong Customs has seized graphics cards smuggled for the purpose of mining.Finally, in policy news, The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television issued standards for blockchain-related media content. The standard system is intended to promote healthy and sustainable content pertaining to the use of blockchain in industries such as auditing systems, business processes, food safety and management. The State Administration is very proactive with its standards, detailing how technologies, trends, and other themes should be portrayed in the media.This weekly roundup of news from Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong attempts to curate the industry’s most important news, including influential projects, changes in the regulatory landscape, and enterprise blockchain integrations."
423,"Now that the Coinbase (COIN) stock listing is out of the way, the focus of traders has shifted back to the crypto market as Bitcoin (BTC) price works to regain its footing above $63,000 and altcoins move higher.After reaching a new all-time high near $65,000, BTC price dipped below $62,000 before finding a bit of momentum in the range which one fund manager called a “great opportunity to buy.”Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that Bitcoin has steadily climbed higher since Wednesday's correction and bulls are attempting to flip the $63,500 level from resistance to support.Trading action for COIN was muted on Thursday as the price declined during the early trading hours and closed the day at $326.88.For those who are curious about how Bitcoin's current price action compares with previous bull cycles, Jarvis Labs co-founder Ben Lilly says looking at the time it took for BTC price to reach its peak following its most recent halving is a good place to start.As seen in the chart above, the current cycle is falling somewhere in between the 2012 and 2016 halving cycles with the price action ""setting up to be faster than what we saw in 2017, but slower than 2013.”While Bitcoin and COIN faded from the spotlight on Thursday, altcoins stepped up to carry the market higher. Dogecoin (DOGE) was the breakout star of the day with a 60% rally that saw its price sprint to a new all-time high at $0.1918.Momentum for DOGE was kicked off when one of cryptocurrency’s well-known proponents and “Technoking of Tesla” Elon Musk posted the following tweet for his 50.8 million followers.Doge Barking at the Moon pic.twitter.com/QFB81D7zOLOther notable altcoin performances include Maker (MKR), which gained 43% on the day for a record high of $4,102 as its ecosystem moves towards full decentralization, and Band Protocol (BAND), which rallied 38% to a new all-time high at $22.83 following the announcement of integration with Google Cloud.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $2.26 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 53.7%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

424,"Three of Cathie Wood’s ARK exchange-traded funds bought nearly $246 million worth of Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) shares on its listing day. Another fund, Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) also purchased COIN stock. These purchases show that ETFs are eager to buy into the crypto growth story.However, Blackrock CEO Larry Fink has a different point of view. Fink said that institutional investors were fascinated by crypto but that did not translate into demand from institutions worldwide.One of the reasons for the fascination not turning into demand could be the sharp rally in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A new survey of professional investors by Bank of America shows that 74% of the respondents believe Bitcoin (BTC) is in a bubble.Such criticisms are not new to cryptocurrencies. Traders who ignore the noise and purchase fundamentally strong coins generally tend to make huge returns in the long term.Let’s retouch on three tokens which Cointelegraph analyzed earlier this year to see if they have continued their upward trajectory.Horizen (ZEN) was featured on Cointelegraph on Jan. 12 when the price of the token was at $28. The token sustained its momentum and has hit an intraday high at $108.77 today, a gain of 288% in just three months. Let’s look at some of the important developments that have taken place with Horizen in the past few weeks.Recently Horizen said that development on the Zendoo mainnet release, which is due in the third quarter, is on track. The team claims Zendoo will offer improved scalability and flexibility suitable for commercial applications.Decentralized finance has also opened a plethora of opportunities to investors. Horizen’s partnership with liquid staking platform StakeHound allows ZEN investors to participate and benefit from the Ethereum-based DeFi ecosystem.Additionally, a string of partnerships with APIS, IOTA, DIA and Copper were announced in the past few weeks to expand the Horizen sidechain ecosystem. These developments seem to have attracted users as the company said its community had grown 13.2% in Q1 2021.ZEN rallied from $52.54 on April 4 to an intraday high at $108.77 on April 15, a 107% rally in 12 days. Although the bears offered a stiff resistance at $86, the bulls have cleared the hurdle with force today. The first target objective on the upside is $119.45 and then $162.The sharp rally of the past few days has pushed the relative strength index (RSI) above 83, indicating the ZEN/USDT pair is overbought in the near term. This could result in a minor correction or consolidation within the next few days.If the bulls can flip the $86 level into support during the next correction, it will suggest that sentiment remains positive and traders are accumulating on dips. The bulls will then make another attempt to resume the uptrend.This positive view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below $86. In such a case, the pair could drop to the 20-day exponential moving average ($71). A break below this support will signal the start of a deeper correction.Hedget (HGET) was at $3.20 when it was highlighted by Cointelegraph on Jan. 14. Since then, the token rallied to an intraday high at $11.25 on March 31, a 251% return in about two and a half months.The protocol has been forging partnerships to increase its user base. Hedget announced a tie-up with Fire Protocol on March 8 to issue HGET tokens on the HECO chain and integrate Hedget options within the Fire Protocol ecosystem. This will open the possibility for Hedget to provide options-based insurance mechanisms for the lending protocols on the HECO chain.On March 9, Hedget announced a partnership with Clover Finance to build and test a two-way bridge between Binance Smart Chain and the Polkadot blockchain. Hedget said it will deploy its platform on the Clover Ecosystem, which will make it the first options trading platform in the Polkadot ecosystem.On March 17, Hedget partnered with APYSwap to offer Vault token holders an opportunity to use options to reduce their impermanent loss.These partnerships by Hedget show that the protocol is widening its user base, which is a long-term fundamental positive.HGET has been in a corrective phase for the past few days. The token slipped from an all-time high at $10.95 on March 31 to $8.51 on April 11, a 22.28% correction in 12 days. In an uptrend, corrections to strong support levels offer a low-risk buying opportunity to traders.The HGET/USDT pair has twice taken support on the 50-day simple moving average ($8.17) in the past few weeks. This suggests that the bulls are buying the dips to the 50-day SMA aggressively.The pair has been trading just below the 20-day EMA ($8.93) for the past few days. However, the bears have not been able to capitalize on this weakness and challenge the 50-day SMA. This suggests that selling dries up at lower levels.Both moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand.This equilibrium is unlikely to remain for long. If the bulls can drive the price above the 20-day EMA with force, the pair could retest the all-time high. A breakout of this resistance could start the next leg of the uptrend that could reach $12.39 and then $15.This bullish view will invalidate if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 50-day SMA. Such a move could pull the price down to $7 and then to $5.18.Zcash (ZEC) was one of the tokens that was covered by Cointelegraph on Jan. 14 when it was trading at $109.93. Since then, the token has continued its northward march and hit an intraday high at $252.89 today, a 130% return in about three months.Electric Coin Co., the company behind Zcash, announced the next set of upgrades dubbed Harlo Arc, set to release on Oct. 1 of this year, in conjunction with the activation of Network Upgrade 5 (NU5) and unified addresses.Halo Arc will include updates to Zcashd, the ECC Reference Wallet apps and the ECC wallet SDKs. NU5 will move Zcash from zk-SNARKs to the Halo proving system and unified addresses will improve usability, increase the ease of interoperability and support shielding Zcash by default.ZEC price has been in a strong uptrend. It has risen from $162.52 on April 7 to an intraday high at $252.89 today, a rise of 55% in nine days. The sharp rally of the past few days has pushed the RSI into the overbought zone, indicating the possibility of a minor correction or consolidation.The first major support on the downside is the 20-day EMA ($194). The bulls are defending this support in the current leg of the rally as seen from the strong bounce on April 8.If the ZEC/USDT pair again rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will try to resume the uptrend. If they succeed, the pair could start its journey toward $350.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA and the $190 support, it will suggest the start of a deeper correction to the 50-day SMA ($155) and then $120.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

425,"A crypto app has warned that Bitcoin is facing a liquidity crisis — and the lack of supply on the open market could have ramifications for buyers and sellers alike.According to SwissBorg, the amount of Bitcoin held in exchanges’ wallets has decreased markedly in recent months. This has resulted in a number of major trading platforms suffering outages — with some forced to impose temporary limits on buy orders.Whereas many crypto apps rely solely on one exchange, SwissBorg is connected to four leading platforms: Binance, Kraken, HitBTC and LMAX. The company says this means there is a much higher probability that its customer’s orders can be routed through a functioning exchange in times of high market volatility.SwissBorg analyst Fidel Velasco says the daily moves of above 10% that Bitcoin has seen at times is rather unusual for an asset with a total market cap of over $1 trillion.Drilling down into the fundamentals helps explain why this is the case. Firstly, the fact that BTC monetary policy isn’t controlled by a single entity means that wild swings are to be expected. Second, institutional adoption has coincided with a dramatic reduction in the amount of new coins entering circulation — and in the second half of 2020, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust purchased 133% of the new Bitcoin mined during this period.Although Bitcoin theoretically has a circulating supply of 18.68 million, the reality is much different. A December 2020 report from Glassnode found that 14.5 million BTC (about 78% of the circulating supply) is held by illiquid entities. All of this means that just 4.2 million BTC is available for buying and selling. Decreases in liquidity usually coincide with spikes in the value of this digital asset, such as the one we’ve seen so far this year.To compound the problem, Velasco cited figures from Bitcoin investment manager Timothy Peterson that suggests 4% of Bitcoin’s available supply is lost every year — with an estimated 1,500 BTC a day being rendered inaccessible after users lose their hardware wallets and private keys. Indeed, a number of horror stories have done the rounds in recent months, including a software engineer who lost the password to a hard drive wallet that contained 7,002 BTC. SwissBorg says it addresses this problem through multi-party computation technology, a keyless approach that was pioneered by Curv.MORE INSIGHTS FROM SWISSBORG HERESwissBorg says that its Smart Engine helps users continually get the best price — irrespective of current market conditions.A grand total of 258 unique crypto-to-fiat pairs are available. Users are given the freedom to exchange any of the 15 fiat currencies it supports for any of the 12 cryptocurrencies on the platform, regardless of whether that pair already exists on another exchange.Smart Exchange Reports ensure that investors get full visibility of the path their transaction has taken, too.SwissBorg’s goal is to help take the guesswork out of investing, and take advantage of the price differences that can emerge across exchanges at busy times.Full transparency on fees is also guaranteed — and the crypto app says that it takes pride in offering a crucial point of difference from rivals. Some platforms claim to deliver “zero fees” but end up hiding them in the exchange rate or spread that’s on offer. Instead, SwissBorg offers the best possible price, and charges a small transparent fee that is then reinvested in its ecosystem.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, SwissBorg is also making yield farming accessible to all — bringing the advantages of centralized and decentralized finance together through its Smart Yield wallet.Learn more about SwissBorgDisclaimer.

426,"A Miami-Dade County commissioner is backing a new resolution to allow residents to use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) to pay local taxes.According to a Thursday document acquired by the Miami New Times, County Commissioner Cohen Higgins has brought a resolution to Miami-Dade’s Infrastructure, Operations and Innovations Committee calling for the establishment of a 13-member crypto task force.The task force would examine the feasibility of allowing residents to pay their county taxes, as well as pay for fees and services, using digital currencies including Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC). According to the document, crypto payments have the “potential to enhance convenience and save costs.” “The item would establish a task force that could delve into the feasibility of using cryptocurrency in Miami-Dade County, to explore any potential benefits and pitfalls that could result from its use. It is important to explore all avenues that can support an expanding tech and startup presence to benefit our economy,” Higgins said.The proposal will go before the Miami-Dade committee on Thursday at noon local time. If the resolution passes, it still must be approved by the full county commission.The resolution mentions a similar initiative enacted by the administration of the City of Miami on Feb. 11, which called for a study to determine the feasibility of allowing Miami residents to pay taxes, and for city employees to receive salaries in Bitcoin. The resolution was proposed by Miami Mayor Francis Suarez who is aggressively campaigning to make the city a crypto hotspot in the United States.Hemang Subramanian, a blockchain-focused assistant professor at Florida International University’s business school, suggested that crypto could be attractive for Miami residents due to the city's large population coming from other countries. As crypto is stored in digital wallets and not tied to a specific country, foreign investors and residents won’t need to pay exchange fees to change their home currency into the U.S. dollar and vice-versa."
427,"Bitcoin (BTC) looked set to retest previous all-time highs on Thursday as a fund manager called it a “great opportunity to buy.”Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed a 3.3% daily comedown for BTC/USD taking aim at new support levels on Thursday.After surging to nearly $65,000 on Monday, Bitcoin began to consolidate in a new range as the buzz around Coinbase’s successful Nasdaq listing cooled.At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency traded at around $62,600, around $700 higher than March’s record of $61,700This area, Vailshire Capital Management CEO Jeff Ross believes, should now set the scene for a support-resistance flip, which, if successful, will allow BTC/USD to continue rising.“Healthy retest of previous consolidation wedge ceiling. Macro view: Wildly bullish. On chain analytics: Wildly bullish,” he wrote on Twitter on the day.A look at exchange order books appeared to confirm appetite even among ardent sellers for allowing Bitcoin a few thousand dollars’ further growth on short timeframes. On Binance, sell orders were lined up first at $65,000, with a more significant band of resistance now in place at $70,000 and $72,000.Those upper levels have long been the focus of analysts, with one even describing them as “destiny” for the short term.Other on-chain metrics showed sustained engagement from investors across the board, with the total number of Bitcoin wallet addresses containing 0.01 BTC or more passing 9 million for the first time.

428,"Almost 5 million Swedish savers have, largely without knowledge of it, indirect exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) via the default government alternative to private savings options on the country’s private pension market. According to local crypto site Trijo News, at least two companies in which the Swedish state pension fund AP7 Såfa owns shares have invested in Bitcoin. Firstly, 0.09% of all shares in Tesla are owned by AP7 Såfa: The former is well-known for its high-profile purchase of 48,000 BTC worth in total around $3 billion at today’s prices. AP7 Såfa’s 5 million clients, thus, collectively own roughly 43 BTC, worth aroun $2.7 million. Calculated per saver, this works out at just $0.59 in Bitcoin (940 satoshis or one hundredth-million of 1 BTC) each.AP7 Såfa also holds a little over 0.1% of all shares in Square, whose BTC holdings are somewhat more modest than Tesla’s. Calculated per AP7 Såfa client, Trijo reports that each owns roughly $0.12 in BTC (190 satoshis) via the fund’s shareholdings in Square. Trijo notes that both calculations for Tesla and Square are approximate and may be a little out of date — yet they provide an indication of the circuitous and little-known exposure of millions of Swedes to the cryptocurrency.As previously reported, Norwegian savers are in a similar situation to their Scandinavian neighbors. Recent research has revealed that the Norwegian Government Pension Fund — aka the Oil Fund and the largest sovereign wealth fund — owns almost 600 BTC through its investment holdings."
429,"Europe’s second-largest insurance firm, AXA, has become Switzerland’s first all-line insurer to offer its customers the option to pay their bills with Bitcoin (BTC), facilitated through a collaboration with the established cryptocurrency broker Bitcoin Suisse.Bitcoin payments will be accepted for nearly all AXA products, except for life insurance due to regulatory barriers to the latter. AXA has cited the accelerated digital transformation of the global economy during the coronavirus pandemic as being a key factor in its choice to integrate cryptocurrency into its everyday operations. However, even back in 2019, the insurer notes it had conducted market research showing that roughly a third of respondents aged between 18 and 55 already owned or were interested in crypto.According to Claudia Bienentreu, head of open innovation at AXA Switzerland, the acceptance of Bitcoin payments is “AXA’s response to growing demand from its customers for alternative payment solutions, with new technologies playing an ever greater role.”The setup on the customer front will be a simple online transfer with a reference number: The amount owed in Swiss francs will be calculated into an equivalent sum in Bitcoin, and the indicated exchange rate will remain valid for a specified time. During this time window, customers will not bear any exchange rate risk, and AXA is not charging any additional fees for customers who choose to pay their bills in Bitcoin rather than fiat currency.AXA itself will not be holding any Bitcoin it receives on its balance sheets. Instead, the Bitcoin will go into the hands of crypto broker Bitcoin Suisse. Notably, while AXA itself is not adding any fees for Bitcoin payments, Bitcoin Suisse does incorporate its own commission of 1.75% when it calculates Bitcoin/Swiss franc exchange rates for AXA customers.AXA’s prior engagement with blockchain-based technologies includes its membership of the car dossier platform since 2017, which uses blockchain to track and record the life cycle of vehicles. The insurer also sponsors the University of Basel’s Blockchain Challenge, where it backs research into the use of smart contracts in the insurance industry."
430,"Finance officials from both sides of the globe are taking the opportunity to criticize the value and utility of cryptocurrencies as media focus intensifies on the space following Coinbase’s direct listing on the Nasdaq.Bank of Korea governor Lee Ju-yeol said cryptocurrencies had “considerable limitations” as a method of payment, following a monetary policy meeting on Thursday, reports local outlet KBS World.While asserting that it was difficult to accurately value cryptocurrencies due to their volatile price fluctuations, Lee said the BOK had not shifted on its stance that they had no intrinsic value.Lee also referenced United States Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, noting that the head of the Fed shared his sentiments on the crypto space.Hours earlier, Powell stated in a virtual interview with The Economic Club of New York that cryptocurrencies were purely speculative, adding that they had not been readily adopted as a means of payment.“They’re really vehicles for speculation. They’re not really being actively used as payments,” Powell said, according to CNBC.Flying in the face of Powell and Lee’s comments is the recent adoption of cryptocurrency by major global payment processors. Visa, Mastercard and PayPal all began to implement crypto payment options in the past few months, while Tesla introduced Bitcoin (BTC) as a payment option for its electric car business.That’s not to say Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a sure thing as far as payment methods go. Bitcoin’s average transaction fee is currently around $30 due to its limited block size and resultant network congestion. For this reason, payment processors are often forced to eat such transaction fees as a cost of doing business until they can no longer afford to, as was the case with gaming platform Steam in 2017.One point of agreement shared by Powell and the crypto community is the suggestion that cryptocurrency could be compared to gold — but for completely different reasons. Cryptocurrency (particularly Bitcoin) proponents argue that the technology can be used as a long-term store of value in the same manner as a precious metal.Powell, however, intended the comparison to be derisory. The Fed chairman’s opinion of gold seems to be no better than that of cryptocurrency.“For thousands of years, human beings have given gold a special value that it doesn’t have,” said the chairman of the fiat-printing center of the United States."
431,"Bank of America released a new survey that found that the majority of professional investors are not very optimistic about the world’s largest cryptocurrency.Nearly 75% of respondents in the April Bank of America Fund Manager Survey said that they see Bitcoin (BTC) as a “bubble,” CNBC reported.The survey polled 200 respondents with $533 billion in assets under management. Just 16% of respondents said Bitcoin is not a bubble, while 10% were uncertain.More than 30% of survey respondents cited tech as the most crowded trade — i.e., an asset with a history of rapid price appreciation and a high number of like-minded, speculative investors. Moreover, 27% of respondents said that Bitcoin is the most crowded trade right now, while 10% predicted that BTC will outperform tech in 2021.Bank of America previously released a survey showing that “long Bitcoin” flipped “long tech” as the most crowded trade in January 2021.The latest Bank of America survey shows significant skepticism regarding Bitcoin after the bank’s analysts recently slammed the cryptocurrency as “exceptionally volatile,” “impractical” and an environmentally disastrous asset. Other major American banks are more bullish on digital assets. After Goldman Sachs revealed that 40% of its clients already had exposure to crypto as of March 2021, the investment bank announced it was preparing a Bitcoin product. Also in March, JPMorgan announced its Cryptocurrency Exposure Basket, a debt instrument portfolio including stocks of companies that hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset."
432,"Bitcoin (BTC) investors in Canada have two more outlets for BTC exposure this week — and can now even bet on a price crash.In a press release on Wednesday, Horizons ETFs Management confirmed that its two new exchange-traded funds would start trading on the Toronto stock exchange on Thursday.Already a pioneer in the regulated institutional investment space for Bitcoin, Canada has now given the go-ahead for the first of such a fund dedicated to Bitcoin price losses, not gains.Dubbed the BetaPro Inverse Bitcoin ETF (BITI), the fund allows investors to short Bitcoin futures. Rather than a sign of bearish sentiment, however, executives describe the offering as a way to capture episodes of price volatility.Its sister, the BetaPro Bitcoin ETF (HBIT), will function in the more traditional sense, complementing the short opportunity.“We know that there are polarizing views on bitcoin and as a result, there are investors with a high degree of conviction on both the bullish and bearish cases for the asset class,”  Steve Hawkins, president and CEO of Horizons ETFs, said in the release.The move comes as Bitcoin circles new all-time highs near $65,000 and institutional interest grows in tandem.This week, open interest in Bitcoin futures reached a fresh historic peak, passing $25 billion ahead of exchange Coinbase being listed on Nasdaq.Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust nonetheless continued to produce a negative share price premium relative to spot prices and traded at around a 14.3% discount on Thursday. United States regulators have yet to approve a single Bitcoin ETF, giving Canada a firm edge despite its market being a fraction of its neighbor’s.The Purpose Bitcoin ETF, the first to get the green light in the country earlier this year, now has $1.4 billion Canadian dollars ($1.12 billion) in assets under management.As Cointelegraph noted, however, exposure to ETFs is still possible indirectly in the United States."
433,"Those who oversee the traditional finance sector won’t just let Bitcoin (BTC) wander off into the sunset without a fight.That’s the sentiment expressed by the World Economic Forum’s head of blockchain and digital assets, Sheila Warren, who said a “dramatic” round of regulation was about to befall Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency space. Warren told Bloomberg on Thursday:Warren’s comments arrived a matter of hours after Coinbase became the first cryptocurrency exchange to list its shares on the Nasdaq. Combined with Bitcoin’s booming ascent over the past year to reach new heights of close to $65,000, industry observers hoped the correlation of the two would lend some newfound legitimacy to the cryptocurrency space and perhaps cause regulators to relax their itchy trigger fingers.That possibility could still emerge as a reality, especially if Securities and Exchange Commissioner Hester Peirce’s recommended approach to regulation is taken into consideration. Peirce recently suggested that crypto projects should have a three-year grace period to establish operations before having to register any resultant token as a security — assuming certain conditions are met.Among other things, a blockchain network would have to prove itself to be sufficiently decentralized by the end of the three-year period in order to avoid further SEC scrutiny.But Warren thinks the scrutiny is unavoidable and suggested it would only increase as Bitcoin’s price rises further. Warren said the flurry of activity sparked by the crypto boom and the Coinbase listing was only the start of the process, not the culmination.“Some are seeing this as the peak, I think that is absolutely wrong,” said Warren.The rhetoric stemming from government entities on the issue of cryptocurrency regulation tends to focus on consumer protection — a very real concern in an industry still prone to malicious hacks, shady scams and costly accidental bugs.However, calls for regulation are also motivated by a natural desire by governments to control the issuance and flow of money within their borders. The free-wheeling, autonomous nature of cryptocurrency poses a serious threat to the preeminence of fiat systems. Most major economies are already engaged in the process of absorbing the impact of crypto through taxation and regulation or are building central bank digital currencies to compete with and, eventually, replace it."
434,"Numerous United States exchange-traded funds are loading up on shares in the world’s top crypto firms.According to ETF.com, hundreds of funds have invested in publicly listed companies that are holding Bitcoin (BTC) on their balance sheets. As of this writing, 88 ETFs hold MicroStrategy shares, while 144 ETFs hold Square, and 222 ETFs hold Tesla. Sixteen ETFs have direct exposure to Bitcoin mining stocks.Almost 200 ETFs hold shares in BlackRock, which recently profited $360,457 after starting to “dabble a bit” in crypto.Nine funds are exposed to both crypto mining stocks and firms with BTC on their balance sheets. As a share of its overall portfolio, the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) has the greatest exposure to crypto. Seven of BLOK’s top 10 allocations are in leading crypto firms, including Galaxy Digital, Marathon Digital, Voyager Digital, Hut 8 Mining, Hive Blockchain, Riot Blockchain and Argo Blockchain. These stocks represent one-third of BLOK’s capital.The fund describes its investments as targeting “transformational data sharing technologies.”BLOK is among the top-performing ETFs of 2021 so far, having gained 71.7% since the start of the year. So far in 2021 it’s recorded the eighth-highest returns among all ETFs — and it ranks second if you exclude leveraged and inverse products. Among ETFs, BLOK is the single-largest hodler of both MicroStrategy and Marathon’s stock.The Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (BLCN) is the only other crypto-exposed ETF that ranks among the top 100 ETFs by YTD performance when excluding inverse and leveraged funds, coming in at 82nd with a YTD gain of 23.15%.BLCN currently holds $5.63 million worth of Marathon stock, $5.4 million in MicroStrategy and $5.24 million in Square.When measured by total value of assets, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) is the ETF with the heaviest allocations to crypto-exposed firms. The VTI currently represents $2.77 billion worth of Tesla, $478 million of Square, $29.4 million of MicroStrategy and $11.38 million of Riot Blockchain. VTI also owns $516 million worth of Blackwater. The iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (ITOT) is the second-largest fund by overall exposure to crypto, holding $450 million worth of Tesla, $4.4 million of MicroStrategy, $3.86 million of Marathon and $3.12 million in Riot.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is yet to issue a verdict on seven applications for Bitcoin ETFs, including Fidelity Investments, Skybridge Capital, WisdomTree, Morgan Stanley and NYDIG, VanEck, and Valkyrie Digital Assets.The Purpose Bitcoin ETF began trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange in mid-February and has accumulated roughly $1 billion worth of BTC since inception. Canada’s Ninepoint Partners and CI have also announced plans to convert their Bitcoin funds into ETFs."
435,"The Bitcoin energy consumption debate is heating up faster than the planet, with corporations facing pushback from the public and shareholders over Bitcoin (BTC) investments.According to a Citigroup Inc. report, Bitcoin is consuming 66 times more electricity than it did in 2015. It added that the carbon emissions associated with mining will likely face increasing scrutiny, according to Bloomberg.This assertion is backed up by new research from Mastercard — which just released its own Carbon Calculator — that shows 54% of people believe that preserving the environment is more important now than it was pre-COVID-19.Citigroup analysts also stated that:However, the network’s electricity usage is rising much more slowly than the price, which has risen by approximately 170 times over the same period.The Citigroup report, citing numbers from the Cambridge University Center for Alternative Finance, stated that the global power demand by the Bitcoin network reached an annualized 143 terawatt-hours. This is about 4% higher than Argentina’s total electricity generation in 2019.The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index currently estimates Bitcoin’s annual electricity consumption is currently somewhere between that of Sweden and Malaysia at 141.6 TWh per year.The report suggested that China may crack down on mining due to environmental concerns:Bitcoin’s environmental impact has been fiercely debated, with many arguments about it either refuted or at least shown to be much more complicated than opponents suggest. In late March, Coin Metrics co-founder Nic Carter produced a well-researched rebuttal to some of these key claims.In it, he stated that there is an abundance of energy in the four Chinese provinces that the majority of BTC mining occurs, and much of it is derived from solar, wind and hydropower. Additionally, the Chinese government actually curtails or sequesters power by removing excess energy from the grid or public consumption, often to maintain price levels.To maintain profits, miners will generally use the cheapest power available. There is an annual migration to Sichuan province to take advantage of cheap hydroelectric power during the rainy season. Studies suggest that between 39% and 76% of Bitcoin mining uses renewable energy."

437,"Garry Tan, a prominent angel investor and the founder of Initialized Capital, was one of the first investors to provide seed funding to Coinbase eight years ago. Less than a decade later, and after today's highly anticipated Nasdaq listing for Coinbase's COIN stock, Tan's 2013 investment of $300,000 into Coinbase is now worth $2.4 billion.Coinbase debuted on the Nasdaq on April 14 at $381 per share, making it one of the most hyped listings in the U.S. stock market of the year.In 2013, when Tan invested in Coinbase, it was unclear whether Bitcoin would be recognized as a global asset and an established store of value.At the time, there were not many reputable exchanges, and the few that existed were often hacked. Tan's investment took place before the monumental Mt. Gox hack that saw billions of dollars worth of BTC stolen.Even after launch, Coinbase was not always in an uptrend. According to Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, from 2014 to 2017 the company faced numerous hardships. Ehrsam said:Coinbase is the first publicly listed major cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. stock market and its availability on Nasdaq now provides mainstream investors with exposure to the crypto sector. Even if the listing fails to impress on day one, the company still has strong financials and user metrics.1) Today, an exchange will list an exchange.

One of them:
--operates 24/7
--lists innovative assets
--allows users to onboard
--has a mobile app, website, and API
--made $1b last quarter

The other one is NASDAQ.

Congrats, @coinbase.Coinbase made $1 billion in the last quarter and has more users than every financial institution in the U.S. apart from JPMorgan, making it a highly compelling trade for investors in the traditional financial market."
438,"Coinbase (COIN) listing on Nasdaq could eventually boost cryptocurrency adoption and attract droves of institutional investors. However, that is unlikely to happen immediately. In the first few days after the listing, volatility could be high as Wall Street tries to value Coinbase. This could also increase the volatility in cryptocurrencies. Sharp movements in the price of Bitcoin (BTC) could also result in liquidations of leveraged positions in the derivatives market. The massive $27 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest and $8 billion in Ether (ETH) futures open interest indicate that a spike in volatility could chop several traders.PlanB, the analyst behind the popular stock-to-flow price model for Bitcoin, cited the monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator and said that the current reading of above 92 is high but falls short of the 95 levels hit in the previous bull markets of 2017, 2013 and 2011.According to PlanB’s calculation, Bitcoin’s price would have to rise to $92,000 by the end of April to push the RSI to 95.Traders will keep a close watch on the price action in COIN and that is likely to determine the short-term sentiment. Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to identify the critical support and resistance levels.Bitcoin broke above the stiff overhead resistance at $61,825.84 on April 13, indicating the resumption of the uptrend. The sharp rally also completed the breakout from the inverse head and shoulders pattern that has a target objective at $69,540.The upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($58,713) and the RSI above 63 suggest the bulls have the upper hand. However, the BTC/USDT pair is unlikely to run away vertically.Usually, after the breakout from a critical level, the price retraces and retests the level. In this case, the pair could drop to $60,000. If the bulls can flip this level into support, the pair could resume its uptrend.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, it could catch several aggressive bulls off guard. That could intensify the selling and the pair may even crack the 50-day simple moving average ($55,241). Such a move will increase the possibility of a deeper correction.Ether broke above the $2,200 resistance on April 13, which resumed its uptrend. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($2,040) and the RSI above 70 suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.The bulls will now try to push the ETH/USDT pair toward the next target objective at $2,618.14.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair turns down from the current level, it could drop to the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off this support, it will suggest that the bulls are buying on dips as they anticipate the rally to rise further.Alternatively, a break below the 20-day EMA will suggest that traders are booking profits in a hurry. That may pull the price down to the trendline.Binance Coin (BNB) is currently in a corrective phase following the sharp uptrend that took it from $233.81 on March 26 to $638.56 on April 12, a 173% rally in a short time. The first strong support on the downside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $483.95.If the price bounces off $483.95, it will suggest the sentiment remains positive and the bulls are accumulating on dips. The buyers will try to resume the uptrend by thrusting the price above $638.56. If they succeed, the BNB/USDT pair could start its journey toward $888.70.The Doji candlestick pattern today suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. If this uncertainty resolves to the downside and the bears sink the price below $483.85, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($417), which is likely to act as a strong support.The strong up-move in XRP continued with a breakout above $1.50 on April 13 and reached an intraday high at $1.96 today. However, the price has reversed sharply, which suggests the bears are aggressively defending the psychological level at $2.The first support on the downside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.43. A strong rebound off this support will indicate that the sentiment remains bullish and traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then again try to resume the up-move by pushing the price above $1.96.On the other hand, a break below $1.43 could pull the price down to the 20-day EMA ($1.05). Such a deep fall will suggest that traders are dumping their positions in a hurry, which may delay the next leg of the rally.Cardano (ADA) pierced the $1.48 overhead resistance today and climbed to an intraday high at $1.55. However, the bulls have not been able to sustain the breakout as seen from the long wick on the candlestick.The bears have pulled the price back into the $1.48 to $1.03 range. They will now try to sink the ADA/USDT pair to the 20-day EMA ($1.24).If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls may make one more attempt to push the pair above the overhead resistance at $1.55. If they succeed, the pair could rally to $2.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below the moving averages, a drop to $1.03 is possible.The tight range trading in Polkadot (DOT) resolved to the upside on April 13 and the bulls pushed the price above the $42.28 overhead resistance. However, the price has again dipped back below $42.28 today, indicating selling at higher levels.If the bears pull the price below the 20-day EMA ($39.78), the selling could intensify and the DOT/USDT pair could drop to $32.50.On the contrary, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to clear the overhead hurdle at $46.80. If they succeed, the pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that could reach $53.50 and then $57.Uniswap (UNI) broke out to a new all-time high on April 12 but the bulls are finding it difficult to sustain the momentum. The altcoin formed an inside day candlestick pattern on April 13 and has extended its correction today.If the price turns up from the current level and breaks above $38.16, the UNI/USDT pair could start the next leg of the uptrend. The first target on the upside is $43.43 and if this resistance is crossed, the pair could march toward the psychological mark at $50.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below $33, the pair could lose momentum as the bulls who bought the breakout on April 12 may rush to the exit. That could pull the price down to the 20-day EMA ($31) and keep the pair range-bound for a few more days.Litecoin (LTC) flipped the breakout level at $246.96 into support on April 11 and 12. This reignited buying from the bulls and the altcoin resumed its uptrend on April 13. The next target objective to watch on the upside is $307.42.The 20-day EMA ($227) is rising and the RSI is close to the overbought territory, suggesting the bulls are in command.However, the long-legged Doji candlestick pattern today shows indecision among the bulls and the bears. If the price slips below $255, the LTC/USDT pair could drop to the $239 to $246.96 support zone.A strong rebound off this zone will suggest the bulls are accumulating on dips while a break below it could drag the price down to the 20-day EMA.Dogecoin (DOGE) broke above the stiff overhead resistance at $0.087 on April 13, indicating the resumption of the uptrend. The breakout has been followed by further buying today, which has propelled the price to an all-time high at $0.145.The sharp rally of the past few days has pushed the RSI above 85, which suggests the rally is getting overheated in the short term. The bears may try to stall the up-move at $0.15. If they manage to do that, the DOGE/USDT pair could enter a minor correction or consolidation.The first support on the downside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.112. A bounce off this support will suggest strength. The bulls will then again try to resume the uptrend. If they can propel the price above $0.145, the pair could move up to $0.20.On the other hand, a break below $0.112 could result in a drop to the breakout level at $0.087.The bulls have propelled Chainlink (LINK) above the $36.93 overhead resistance today, indicating the resumption of the uptrend. If the bulls can sustain the price above $36.93, the altcoin could continue its march toward $50.The 20-day EMA ($32) has turned up and the RSI has risen above 65, suggesting the bulls are back in the driver’s seat.However, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above the $36.93 level, then it will indicate aggressive selling by the bears at higher levels. That could result in a drop to the 20-day EMA. A strong rebound off this level will suggest the sentiment remains positive.Conversely, if the bears sink the LINK/USDT pair below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the current breakout was a bull trap.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

439,"A tranche of long-dormant Bitcoin seized in the 2016 hack of the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange are on the move today, an over $620 million sum that has some market participants spooked and may be contributing to a downward slide for Bitcoin. Blockchain analytics bot Whale Alerts was the first to raise the alarm, calling attention to a series of over five dozen transactions from wallets that have largely been inactive since the 2016 hack:⚠ ⚠ ⚠ ⚠ ⚠ ⚠ ⚠ 1,241.37 #BTC (78,246,494 USD) of stolen funds transferred from Bitfinex Hack 2016 to unknown wallethttps://t.co/yLsJDXUBvEThe largest transaction was for 1,241.3672 BTC, worth well over $78 million (for which the hacker paid a 0.00072910 BTC fee, or roughly $45), though other transactions were for as little as 1.5 BTC. Cointelegraph counted 63 transactions in all, moving just over 10,050 BTC worth over $620 million. While the hacker has a spotty history of intermittently moving their coins between wallets, the transfers today comfortably account for the largest transactions of hacked Bitcoin since the attack itself. Throughout the years the hacker has moved between 1 and 2% of their coins, and today they moved 8.3% of their nearly 120,000 BTC worth over $7.4 billion.The purpose of the transactions are difficult to augur. Some of the transfers were between wallets known to be associated with the hacker, though many were to newly-created wallets. Multiple observers have pointed out that it’s near-impossible for the hacker to sell their BTC, as no major exchanges will accept the tainted coins. The hacker tried to sell some 736 BTC in 2020 via a Russian darknet market, with some ironically ending up back on Bitfinex.The hacker’s inability to sell their coins prompted some Twitter traders to speculate that the point of the transfers is simply to spook the market, possibly in tandem with a short position:No, th e Bitfinex hacker can't sell the #Bitcoin (not in any volume).
But he/she/they can move it to try to manipulate the market while they short it elsewhere ...The hunt for the hacker is still ongoing, as in August last year Bitfinex offered up to $400 million as a reward for information on the attacker. The case seemed to have a breakthrough in 2019, when two Israeli brothers were accused of involvement in the attack, but police recovered wallets containing far less than the nearly 120,000 BTC lost in the hack. The Bitfinex whale breaching adds to an already tumultuous day for markets. After a surge to over $425 per share, Coinbase is struggling to find a price floor at $350/share. While still well above the reference price of $250 per share, traders have nonetheless interpreted the trading as a negative signal as Bitcoin has dropped to $61,000."
440,"Following months of build-up and speculation, Coinbase (COIN) listed on the Nasdaq and in true cryptocurrency fashion, opening day trading was a volatile affair that may have had a widespread effect on the cryptocurrency market.COIN's reference price was initially $250 but the stock opened at $381 and rapidly rose to a high of around $429.54 before reversing course to $310 once the initial frenzy died down.Typically, stocks are quite volatile on their first day of trading and COIN is no exception to that trend. Therefore, the success of today's launch and the strength of Coinbase as a company should not be purely connected to how COIN performed at listing. Currently, COIN trades for $326 and traders are likely watching to see how the stock performs as the daily close approaches.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that the downturn in COIN was followed by an immediate sell-off in the price of Bitcoin (BTC), which established a new all-time high at $64,890 in the early hours of April 14. Interestingly, shortly after COIN listed, Bitcoin price corrected 5% to hit a daily low at $61,658 and this triggered a sharper sell-off in altcoins.There were several tokens that were able to fend off the downturn and put up positive gains for the day including THORchain (RUNE), which put on a gain of 30% to establish a new all-time high of $16.25, and Digibyte (DGB), which is up 19% at the time of writing and trading at a price of $0.0978. The overall cryptocurrency market capitalization experienced a 16.5% decline alongside the drop in BTC, falling from a high of $2.6 trillion just before the launch to a value of $2.17 trillion at the time of writing. Bitcoin dominance rate now stands at 53.6%"
441,"Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) have continually surged toward record highs, causing the futures market of Bitcoin to see a substantial increase in volume and open interest. The term “open interest” refers to the total sum of active trades in the Bitcoin derivatives market. Currently, the open interest of the Bitcoin futures market is hovering at historic highs, currently $27.43 billion.Following the Coinbase listing, traders and investors generally anticipate the uptrend of Bitcoin and Ether to continue. But there are also short-term bear cases due to various factors such as a potential “sell-the-news” scenario and an overheated futures market.According to Adam Cochran, partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, Bitcoin should theoretically be at $70,000 going into the Coinbase listing. The investor said that the reason behind BTC’s gradual uptrend is the use of heavy leverage in the Bitcoin futures market, causing BTC to drop when the derivatives market gets overheated.High leverage can cause short-term drops to occur because when there is a significant percentage of highly leveraged buy orders or longs in the market, the funding rate increases. Funding is a mechanism used by Bitcoin futures exchanges to achieve balance in the market.When there are more buyers in the market, the funding rate increases. When the funding rate rises, buyers have to compensate short-sellers with a portion of their position. Since buyers have to pay sellers every eight hours to keep their positions open, it becomes less attractive to long Bitcoin, making it vulnerable to a drop. Cochran said:He further added: “The only reason $BTC isn’t at $70k already is because the retail-kiddies don’t know how to use leverage without getting mega-nuked at every all time high.”Despite the price of Bitcoin hovering at an all-time high, the relative strength index is lower than where it was during the 2017 peak of the previous bull run. When the price of Bitcoin violently dropped in a short period, its RSI was at around 95. Currently, the RSI is at 92, which is lower than the tops of both the 2017, 2013 and 2011 rallies.PlanB, the creator of the Stock-to-Flow indicator — which predicts Bitcoin will likely reach $200,000 — said that BTC would have to rally toward $92,000 to hit an RSI of 95. The analyst said: “#Bitcoin is looking strong at RSI 92.”The price of Bitcoin is strongly rallying in anticipation of Coinbase’s public listing. Investors and traders generally believe that the cryptocurrency market will continue on an upward trajectory post-Coinbase listing, mainly due to the strong momentum of the market. However, there are some who believe that the listing of the stock, which will trade under the ticker “COIN,” will mark a temporary top for cryptocurrencies.On-chain data also suggests that Bitcoin is in a favorable position to see a broader rally. Elias Simos, protocol specialist at Bison Trails, said that the supply of Bitcoin among addresses that hold 100 to 1,000 BTC has hit an all-time high. This indicates that the number of high-net-worth investors holding Bitcoin is increasing. He stated:Atop the technical and fundamental strong points of Bitcoin heading into the Coinbase public listing, the general sentiment around the event remains overwhelmingly positive. Nic Carter, a long-time Bitcoin investor and researcher, said COIN is gearing up to be one of the most explosive public listings in the history of the United States stock market:Although a big part of the interest comes from the fact that the stock market is seeing the first debut of a major U.S. crypto exchange, Coinbase’s financials have impressed investors in the traditional financial market. Anthony Pompliano, a noted Bitcoin investor and co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital, pointed out in early April that Coinbase made more in revenue in the previous 90 days than it did in all of 2020.The primary bear case surrounding the Coinbase listing remains the high probability of a “sell-the-news” drop in the cryptocurrency market. Atop this, there is a chance that buyers will rush into COIN, possibly selling Bitcoin, Ether and other major cryptocurrencies in the process.Mohit Sorout, partner at Bitazu Capital, also emphasized that he believes the final leg of the Bitcoin bull market is approaching, based on historical trends. He said, “Truth be told I seriously think we’ve entered the final leg of this $btc bull market. To be clear, final leg could be 2-3 weeks or even more. Price could reach 200k or even more who knows. Just don’t make irrational life decisions based on unrealized PnL.”On top of the possibility of a peak approaching for the cryptocurrency market, the funding rate of the Bitcoin futures market is at around 0.11% on average. The default funding rate of Bitcoin is 0.01%, so this is 11 times higher. Hence, the likelihood of a flush correction in the short term remains relatively high."
442,"A decentralized platform allows investors to gain access to well-balanced baskets of digital assets that serve as an effective store of value.Digital Reserve offers several portfolios — the construction of which are based on votes from community members. The project says no single entity or person is in control, as users interact directly with smart contracts.The first portfolio is geared toward capital appreciation. While 40% is allocated to Wrapped Bitcoin, 40% is also dedicated to PAX Gold, an asset-backed token that is pegged to a troy ounce of the precious metal. The remaining 20% is allocated to Wrapped Ether.A less volatile alternative, which aims to deliver capital preservation, sees 90% of the vault allocated to the USDC stablecoin. The remaining 10% is then split equally between PAX Gold and Wrapped Bitcoin to reduce inflation risks.The third portfolio focuses on high volatility and “aggressive capital appreciation.” While 30% is allocated to Wrapped Ether, the remaining 70% is divided between the Harvest and 88mph reward tokens. Another portfolio focused on alternative assets is currently in the proposal stage, and proposals are being accepted on the DR Discord channel. Interest-bearing vaults are set to emerge in the second quarter of 2021.At the center of this project is the Digital Reserve Currency, which is designed to become a decentralized digital store of value with a limited supply and a zero inflation rate.Digital Reserve says its approach can ensure holders of DRC tokens can hedge against inflation and find portfolios that match their appetite for risk. A diversified, balanced portfolio has never been more important in these volatile times — and the project aims to ensure that achieving one is as straightforward as possible. A user-friendly interface means deposits and withdrawals can be completed instantly, and investors can track their portfolio’s performance in real time.All of the portfolios offered by Digital Reserve are regularly rebalanced on a weekly or monthly basis, depending on market conditions. The smart contract underpinning DR has been audited by Dedaub, helping users gain peace of mind from a security standpoint. In the coming months, funds held in DR vaults are set to be insured.MORE INSIGHTS FROM DIGITAL RESERVE HEREAdditional vaults are going to be created on a regular basis going forwards — and although the crypto markets have been performing strongly in recent months, DR’s ecosystem of products are designed to help investors preserve their capital in the event of an economic downturn.Simoleon, a hedge fund that operates under Halcyon Global Opportunities with $700 million in assets under management, recently purchased an undisclosed amount of DRC tokens on the secondary market. Their investment in DRC comes from a strong belief in its value proposition and long-term viability.At the beating heart of the project is the DRC Foundation, which is headed up by five community members who are voted in by DRC holders once a quarter to help advance the platform’s development. Its mission is to advocate for the ecosystem and to facilitate its global adoption and success, rather than control or manage the network itself.“We believe that because of the flaws in the current financial system, with its overvalued assets, leveraged products, and centralized manipulation, the demand for decentralized and censorship-resistant “store of value” assets will increase significantly,” the foundation says.Looking ahead, the creation and launch of new vaults is a priority for the coming months — as well as the expansion of a global outreach campaign. In the second half of this year, the DRC Foundation intends to explore partnership opportunities with international organizations, all with a view to making its crypto platform more accessible in developing countries. Work will also begin to establish ties with financial service providers, giving them an opportunity to embed DRC into their own ecosystems.Learn more about Digital ReserveDisclaimer.

443,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has addressed the platform’s transaction fees as the company's shares list on Nasdaq today.In a CNBC Squawk Box interview on Wednesday, Armstrong discussed public concerns associated with Coinbase’s massive returns coming from transaction fees. As previously reported, nearly 96% of Coinbase’s entire revenue in 2020 was generated from transaction fees charged to users.When asked about the potential impact of greater competition on transaction fees on Coinbase, Armstrong said that the platform might see some fee reduction in the long term:Armstrong said that a big part of the crypto transactions fees come from a custody fee that is “already baked into the transaction fee.”The CEO said that Coinbase expects to gradually move its focus to other revenue streams with products like its debit card, staking, educational program Coinbase Earn, as well as custody business for institutional customers.“We’ve started to invest in revenue streams that are starting to provide these green shoots of revenue [...] These are providing more steady predictable streams of revenue and my guess is that in five or 10 years we will see that be maybe even 50% or more of our revenue,” Armstrong stated.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Coinbase’s professional platform Coinbase Pro completed a major fee structure update in 2019, increasing some maker fees as high as 233%. Following the update, Coinbase made $1.1 billion in direct revenue in 2020, a significant increase from $482 million in 2019."
444,"As the price of Bitcoin continues to reach new all-time highs, major corporations with existing crypto offerings in place are beginning to discuss grand plans for the future. Most recently, Dan Schulman, CEO of PayPal, hinted at future developments for PayPal’s crypto offering during Forbes’ “2021 Blockchain 50 Symposium: Crypto Goes Corporate,” an online event that took place on April 13.During a fireside chat with Michael del Castillo, associate editor at Forbes, Schulman mentioned that the financial system will undergo more changes over the next five years compared to the progress that has been made in the previous 30 years. Schulman further noted that digital currencies, like Bitcoin (BTC), will lead the way, mentioning that there will be far less cash and credit card transactions in the next five to 10 years. Schulman said:According to Schulman, one of the biggest challenges facing society today is the fact that millions of people everywhere are being excluded from today’s financial system. This has become especially apparent in the United States, as Americans with bank accounts have started receiving their latest round of economic stimulus checks via direct deposit. Unfortunately, millions of unbanked and underbanked Americans must wait much longer to receive paper checks in the mail.Schulman noted that today’s financial system is relatively inefficient, mentioning that it takes too long to receive money, which is even more challenging for lower-income individuals. “It’s not inclusive at all,” he said.In order to solve these ongoing issues, Schulman explained that PayPal’s crypto offering, which went live in the United States in November 2021, will eventually allow users to do more than just buy, sell and hold Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). While PayPal revealed at the end of March that the platform would soon allow its merchants to accept cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange, Schulman hinted that this is just the beginning of many possibilities:In addition to crypto payments, Schulman shared that PayPal will eventually leverage smart contracts and other underlying technologies to ensure that a payment is more than just a transaction. “This is the promise of all digital currencies — they can create incremental value from just a basic transaction.”While PayPal’s crypto plans are notable, it’s important to point out that innovation may take longer than expected. For instance, when del Castillo asked Schulman about how long he expects PayPal’s crypto service to reach $200 million in volume, Schulman boldly answered that it would take only a matter of months, or maybe less.Although this is encouraging for crypto adoption, del Castillo noted that it took Coinbase Commerce, a platform that supports cryptocurrency payments for online retailers, 13 months to generate $200 million in volume.However, Cointelegraph previously reported that the success of Coinbase Commerce was partly due to the 8,000 retailers currently using Coinbase for payment services. Schulman mentioned during the fireside chat that PayPal has over 375 million consumers of digital wallets and about 30 million merchants on the platform. In turn, PayPal may very well break new boundaries when it comes to digital payments for commerce.Although Schulman appears to have a highly optimistic attitude toward cryptocurrency adoption, the executive shared that there are still no plans to add Bitcoin to PayPal’s balance sheet in 2021. “I think the probability of this is low,” he said.When asked why, Schulman explained that PayPal’s balance sheet consists of safe assets with less volatility since funds need to be used in ways that may return money to shareholders. “We really need to be sure of what’s on that balance sheet to ensure consistent capital allocation,” Schulman said.While this may be, Michael Saylor, chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy, has a different belief regarding Bitcoin’s volatility. This shouldn’t come as a surprise, though, as the business intelligence firm recently announced that its board of directors would receive bonuses in Bitcoin instead of fiat.Saylor also shared his thoughts on the future of Bitcoin during Forbes’ “2021 Blockchain 50 Symposium: Crypto Goes Corporate” event. During a fireside chat with Steve Ehrlich, digital assets research director at Forbes, Saylor commented that there has been “a huge change across the sentiment in the corporate world” toward Bitcoin. However, he noted that thousands of companies are still hesitant to add Bitcoin to their balance sheet for two reasons: volatility and intangible accounting.According to Saylor, volatility is a misnomer, noting that Bitcoin has been the most successful asset of the decade because it has been doubling in price every six months for 10 years straight. Saylor commented:Saylor further explained that the only logical reason why most companies still haven’t added Bitcoin to their balance sheet is due to intangible accounting methods, noting this is more problematic than volatility. Although this may be the case for many companies, Saylor remarked that MicroStrategy’s balance sheet will be 99% invested in Bitcoin. He said:"
445,"Bitcoin (BTC) can surge to $92,000 in the next two weeks and still “only” be matching its past performance, new data claims.In a tweet on Wednesday, PlanB, the analyst behind the stock-to-flow family of Bitcoin price models, noted that despite this week’s gains, BTC/USD still has plenty of energy in it.PlanB focused on Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI), a classic metric used to chart the progress of price runs in particular. RSI can give a useful insight into whether Bitcoin is overbought at a certain point in its bull run, while the opposite — oversold — is also true. As Cointelegraph reported, PlanB has highlighted the metric’s cues for hodlers throughout the past year, including during the Spring bear market bottom and in August, when sentiment was gearing up for the bull run that continues to this day.Currently, RSI measures 92/100. This is near the top of its range but at least three points off the peak of Bitcoin’s 2013 and 2017 bull runs — to match them, a lot more upside is needed.“Bitcoin is looking strong at RSI 92. Still not above RSI 95 like 2017, 2013 and 2011 bull markets,” PlanB summarized.For those who consider $92,000 to be overly optimistic, PlanB is not alone in predicting more, not less, vertical movements from Bitcoin in the future. This week, the latest chart showing BTC’s 2021 performance compared to 2013 and 2017 likewise revealed that Bitcoin is in fact behaving “modestly” and not increasing too quickly.PlanB, meanwhile, touched on a major event for exchange Coinbase set for Wednesday: its debut on the Nasdaq.Despite concerns that a sell-off may occur as a result — behavior typical of a related move, the initial public offering — Coinbase’s direct listing is being hailed as a watershed moment for cryptocurrency.As such, with its new status, Coinbase may usher in a similarly new era for Bitcoin and altcoins alike, with price action potentially foreshadowing what is to come.With its pre-debut valuation of approximately $149 billion, Coinbase will effectively become the ninth-largest “bank” in the world by market cap, figures circulating online on Wednesday showed."
446,"The Purpose Investments ETF, the first Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund to launch in North America, has seen its assets under management soar to $1.1 billion less than two months after launching. Two Bitcoin ETFs that launched shortly after Purpose’s in Canada have also seen their AUM’s swell to a combined $200 million in the same time period, taking Canada’s combined Bitcoin ETF net value to around $1.3 billion.The Purpose Bitcoin ETF launched in late February and generated nearly $100 million in trading volume on its first day. The ETF accrued more than $500 million in assets under management in its first week as investors rushed to gain access to Bitcoin trading without having to own the underlying asset.The acceptance by regulators and eventual launch of the purpose ETF acted as an opening of the floodgates for Canadian Bitcoin businesses, and two more ETFs were launched in the following weeks.The success of Purpose’s ETF was a prime example of a first-mover advantage in full effect, as it continues to hog the lion’s share of Canada’s nascent ETF industry. Evolve Fund Group’s Bitcoin ETF commenced operations just two days earlier and has accrued just $106 million in AUM, according to its website, despite offering 25% lower management fees than Purpose.Likewise, the CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, which launched just a few days later still, currently has just over $90 million in AUM, this time slashing management fees to 0.4%, reports Canada’s Globe and Mail. All ETFs, however, have seen their respective values rise in line with Bitcoin’s own meteoric ascent in recent times, with each unit priced higher now than at launch.A plethora of American firms has registered applications for Bitcoin ETFs with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. However, no fund has been approved on U.S. soil to date. Galaxy Digital, SkyBridge Capital and Fidelity all filed ETF applications in recent months, among many others. And while the general feeling is that one (or all) will be approved eventually, the timeline is still far from certain.Some analysts believe the U.S. will see its first Bitcoin ETF launch within one to two years, while others hope Bitcoin’s recent ascension, combined with the example of other North American regulators, will fast-track the process."
447,"Led by Bitcoin’s (BTC) ascent to a new all-time high along with much of the wider cryptocurrency market, Ether (ETH) continues to push new all-time highs on Wednesday as the coin’s price flirted with the $2,400 range for the first time.The Ethereum network is scheduled to undergo an update in the next day or so when the blockchain reaches block number 12,244,000. The blockchain was at block number 12,237,070 at time of publication. Based on current average block times of 14 seconds, the update is poised to land on Thursday at around 12:00 pm (UTC+1). The update — dubbed “Berlin” — will introduce several technical changes, all aimed at making the network more cost efficient.The Ether’s price peaked at $2,397 on numerous exchanges on Wednesday, according to aggregator data from CoinMarketCap, following a 10.8% growth surge over 24 hours. Ether’s growth for the week stands at 22.4%, while the coin’s price is now up 110% for the quarter — a figure that would be more notable under less explosive circumstances in the altcoin market of late.The Berlin update will be rolled out in the form of a hard fork — an irreversible change to the protocol of a blockchain. The hard fork is non-contentious, meaning no ideological differences in the community will lead to the formation of a new coin — as was the case with Ether and Ethereum Classic (ETC) in 2016.Anyone holding Ether in wallets or on exchanges will be unaffected by the hard fork, however, miners and Ethereum node operators will have to update their software to synchronize with the latest version of the chain. Data from EtherNodes.org shows that 72% of Ethereum software clients have achieved Berlin-ready status in anticipation of the hard fork.Speculation surrounding Ether’s potential price movements in the short term has ranged from tremendously optimistic (and definitely “not crazy”) to conservative and measured."
448,"Open interest in Bitcoin futures has surged to new record highs ahead of Coinbase’s Wednesday direct listing on the Nasdaq.Crypto market data aggregator Glassode states that Bitcoin open interest has exceeded $27 billion for the first time as Bitcoin (BTC) pushed into new record highs above $63,000. The milestone suggests traders may be speculating on higher prices, although some may also be hedging against incoming volatility.#Bitcoin Futures Open Interest across major exchanges reaches record highs of more than $27B as $BTC hits new ATHs.

Chart: https://t.co/GqgQ98W7Mq pic.twitter.com/KYBQC9WZxCThe lion’s share of trading activity is on Binance, where the $5.2 billion in positions accounts for almost 20% of all outstanding positions being held on the exchange. It’s followed by Bybit with $4.66 billion, OKEx with $3.75 billion, and then Huobi, FTX and CME with roughly $3 billion each.Despite the record open interest, Bitcoin futures volumes appear to have been declining over the past month, sagging from $117 billion as of March 15 to range between $50 billion and $75 billion during April, according to crypto derivatives data aggregator Skew.The waning volume may suggest traders have become increasingly cautious about opening new positions as the date for Coinbase’s listing was approachin, with a significant share of open interest likely representing positions that have been opened during previous weeks and months.Of the $75 billion worth of BTC futures that changed hands over the past 24 hours, Binance makes up more than one-third of the volume with $26.9 billion, followed by Huobi with $14.5 billion, OKEx with $12.7 billion and Bybit with $10.6 billion.By contrast, open interest in Bitcoin options has declined since a record $6 billion worth of contracts expired at the end of March. Options volumes have increased during April, with the data suggesting many traders have been hedging their positions as billions were mobilized to protect against a crash down to $40,000 last week.Bitcoin is not the only market that derivatives traders are speculating on, with open interest in Ethereum futures also spiking to record highs above $8 billion as volumes increased over recent weeks.Ethereum’s options markets have also seen an increase in activity, with open interest pushing into 30-day highs near $3.2 billion. Ether options volumes jumped 90% overnight, surging from $200 million to $380 million.However, many Ether (ETH) traders appear to be looking beyond Coinbase’s listing this week, with analyst Cantering Clark noting significant volume targeting prices above $3,200 for the end of June earlier this month."
449,"Coinbase, the top cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, will soon be a publicly listed company once its COIN stock launches on the Nasdaq stock exchange on April 14.Generally, the sentiment around the listing has been overwhelmingly positive from both the crypto and traditional financial markets. With the date just one day away, analysts have been issuing a variety of perspectives related to how the listing could impact Bitcoin and altcoin prices.As Cointelegraph previously reported, Coinbase is not actually conducting an initial public offering (IPO).Instead, the exchange is directly listing on the Nasdaq, bypassing the need to work with investment banks, which is often costly for businesses.  Despite the lack of involvement of investment banks in the process of listing Coinbase, there is significant hype around COIN.While speaking CNBC's Squawk Box on April 12,  Jim Cramer said:""You got to buy $COIN when that deal comes,"" says @JimCramer. ""This is a $2T market maybe going to $3T.""#btc #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/ItLMx1tbIlThere are several reasons why investors in the traditional financial market are optimistic abou COIN.Most notably, the two main factors are to get exposure to the crypto market without owning cryptocurrencies and the lucrative business model of Coinbase.According to Ben Lilly, co-founder of Jarvis Labs: A financial researcher from John Street Capital, a venture capital firm, noted that Coinbase is massively profitable, with an annual revenue of $1.8 billion.Atop the compelling financial report and revenue, the user base of Coinbase is much larger than Cash App and Venmo.In fact, Coinbase has the biggest user base out of all financial institutions in the U.S., with the exception of JPMorgan Chase. The researcher wrote:Although some traders believe crypto could reach a top after the Coinbase listing, the market sentiment building up toward the listing is highly positive.When asked about the significance of the Coinbase listing, Ben Lilly said: Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, believes the Coinbase ""IPO"" could boost Bitcoin to $70,000. He said:Another crypto firm that went public in the past year is billionaire investor Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital.Since Galaxy Digital listed in Canada's stock exchange, its stock has rise more than twentyfold.Although the business model and the market capitalization of the two companies at launch are massively different, this shows that there is interest in publicly listed crypto-focused companies at launch, which will likely be reflected in COIN's value."
450,"A nightclub in Miami is set to return from a COVID-19-related shutdown of over a year by accepting Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies as a form of payment.Luxury nightclub E11even Miami announced Tuesday that it will soon start accepting cryptocurrency as payment for tables, drinks, merchandise and other services. According to the official announcement, the list of supported cryptocurrencies will include Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE).In order to provide the new payment method, E11even has partnered with a major cryptocurrency processing company, but did not specify the name of the payment processor.“With the tremendous growth and relevancy of cryptocurrency coupled with Mayor Francis Suarez leading the charge for Miami’s tech boom, we felt it made sense to introduce Cryptocurrency as an option to our guests to pay for their night out,"" E11even creator and CEO Dennis DeGori said. ""E11even is dedicated to always staying ahead of the curve, and we believe cryptocurrency is here to stay.”According to the Miami Herald, crypto payments are part of the club’s post-pandemic reopening on April 23 after E11even shut down in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The move comes as a natural step for E11even, as a number of its clients have become increasingly involved in the crypto industry. “We have a very cutting-edge clientele from all over the world, and many are crypto savvy already,” E11even operating partner Gino LoPinto said, adding:E11even did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph's request for comment.Miami itself is emerging as a major cryptocurrency-friendly city in the United States, with the city's mayor, Francis Suarez, campaigning to make Miami the capital of crypto in the country. In February, Suarez proposed an official resolution to allow Bitcoin to become an acceptable payment method in different parts of the city’s administration."
451,"South Korea’s “big four” crypto exchanges — Bithumb, Korbit, Upbit and Coinone — are showing a marked cooling off in Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiasm.Meanwhile, altcoins are now accounting for the highest 24-hour trading volume according to data from multiple market aggregators.Apart from XRP, which is often popular among crypto traders in Asia, altcoins with smaller market capitalizations are leading the way in terms of trading volume on the big four.Data from crypto research outfit Messari shows Ravencoin (RVN), Near Protocol (NEAR) and New Kind of Network (NKN) as the three top-traded cryptos by volume on the Upbit exchange.NKN’s volume surge on South Korean exchanges is indicative of the altcoin pivot seemingly gaining a foothold among crypto traders in the country.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, NKN saw a 1,400% surge between March 8 and April 6, with the token up 83-fold year-to-date as of the time of writing.CoinMarketCap’s exchange data shows XRP as the number-one traded altcoin across all of the big four crypto exchanges in South Korea. Indeed, the top 10 trading volume figures across the four exchanges are dominated by smaller-cap tokens such as MileVerse (MVC) and Chiliz (CHZ).Compared to a snapshot of the CHZ trading volume on Upbit back in January, the social token’s 24-hour activity has grown from under $5 million to over $730 million in April. The smaller-cap altcoins dominating trading activity on South Korean exchange platforms have increased by an average of 3,000%.This scramble for altcoins capable of delivering “face-melting” gains has led to a decline in Bitcoin trading volume across South Korean exchanges. BTC volume is down between 30% and40% across the big four.Bitcoin is currently experiencing another round of positive price action and has set a new all-time high above $62,000. BTC is trading at an average of $71,200 across the South Korean big four with the Kimchi premium at about 13% as of the time of writing."
452,"Ether (ETH) surged to a new all-time high on Tuesday, with the next major update in its ongoing development — dubbed “Berlin” — scheduled for Wednesday, April 14.Ether’s price reached $2,228 on Tuesday, marking the highest dollar valuation the coin has achieved since its conception. The coin’s market capitalization exceeded $250 billion for the first time. For context, the market cap of Bitcoin (BTC) was at the same level just six months ago, in late October 2020.Ether’s 1,328% growth over the past year persisted despite major concerns regarding the Ethereum network’s transaction fees. In February, the average Ethereum transaction fee hit an all-time high of $38.21, according to data from Bitinfocharts, making Ether generally unsuitable as a transactional currency.But investors apparently hold out some hope for a reprieve from Ethereum’s unwieldy fees, particularly in the form of an upcoming network upgrade that will radically alter the way fees are paid. The “London” upgrade, scheduled for this summer, has drawn the ire of Ethereum miners, as it entails plans to burn some of the fees that would normally be accrued by mining rig operators.Wednesday’s Berlin upgrade is expected to be less impactful in the short term but will pave the way for London and will make four major changes to the network as it stands. A full technical breakdown can be found on the official release page, but a variety of changes will be made to the blockchain to reduce costs for certain transaction types. A new transaction envelope will also make it easier to package multiple transactions into a single transfer.It wasn’t the only coin to reach a new all-time high on Tuesday; Bitcoin also hit new heights as the BTC coin price surged to above $63,000. Meanwhile, the coins immediately behind Bitcoin and Ether in the market cap rankings — Binance Coin (BNB) and XRP — also hit new all-time highs in the past 24 hours."
453,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high at $63,478 on Tuesday on Binance. The market sentiment around Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) is overwhelmingly bullish, but the short-term sentiment remains mixed.Analysts use the term “price discovery” when the price of an asset reaches a new all-time high.On Tuesday, the price of Bitcoin entered price discovery, surpassing its record high as it made its way above $62,000.When an asset enters price discovery, two scenarios could emerge: It becomes overbought and sees a severe correction, or it sees stronger technical momentum and rallies further.While the momentum of Bitcoin is evidently strong, traders are mixed in the near-term trajectory of BTC.Scott Melker, a cryptocurrency derivatives trader, said that the four-hour price chart of BTC has started to enter into overbought territory.Atop the technical indicators show that Bitcoin could be overbought in the short term, while the futures market also remains extremely overcrowded.Bendik Norheim Schei, the head of research at Arcane Research, said that the three-month premium on BTC futures contracts is reaching 50%.Premiums in the futures market indicate whether the derivatives market is overheated with buyers. If the premiums are high, the risk of a severe sell-off as a result of investors taking profit increases.According to Mohit Sorout, the founding partner of Bitazu Capital, there is a chance that Bitcoin is in the final leg of its uptrend. He said:However, there is also a strong possibility that Bitcoin does not top out like it did in 2017. Rather, it could range and consolidate for a long time after it peaks, similar to gold in its early days."
454,"Pennsylvania software firm Integrated Ventures has announced the purchase of 4,800 Bitcoin (BTC) mining rigs from Chinese manufacturer Bitmain. The deal is worth just over $34 million and will see 400 of Bitmain’s Antminer model S19J’s delivered to Integrated Ventures each month for the next year.Integrated Ventures partnered with Wattum Management, a mining solutions provider, to carry out the deal, with Wattum expected to help host and manage INTV’s mining operations. The mining rigs deliver 100 terahashes each, giving IV close to 0.5 million TH/s by the time the full shipment of mining rigs is delivered in 2022.Based on Bitcoin’s current hash rate of 170 million TH/s, this gives the firm a sizable, if still a relatively modest, share of the coin’s hashing power. It’s worth noting that Bitcoin’s hash rate doubled in the past year alone, meaning IV’s equipment could feasibly be worth much less come next year.Perhaps with this in mind, INTV secured downside price protection for 12 months as part of the deal, as well as the right to replace the current S19J mining rigs with newer models when they are released in the coming year.Few would expect the cryptocurrency market to remain static for any great length of time, however, INTV calculates expected revenues of between $19 million and $21 million in the next 12 months, based on the current Bitcoin price of around $60,000.Integrated Ventures CEO Steve Rubakh said the deal effectively doubled the firm’s existing Bitcoin hashing power, adding that he was pleased to secure the purchase of mining equipment at a time when the hardware was scarce.“The Company is very pleased to secure this large scale purchase agreement, especially during a period of scarce supply of mining hardware. Going forward, INTV is committed to deploy any raised capital for purchases of the mining equipment,” said Rubakh."
455,"Margin trading allows an investor to borrow money or cryptocurrency to leverage their trading position and increase its size or the expected return. For example, borrowing Tether (USDT) will allow one to buy Bitcoin (BTC), thus increasing the exposure. Although there’s an interest rate involved with borrowing, the trader expects BTC's price appreciation to compensate for it.Newer traders might be unaware of this, but investors can borrow BTC to margin trade a short position, thus betting on price downside. This is why some analysts monitor the total lending amounts of Bitcoin and Tether to gain insight into whether investors are leaning bullish or bearish.Interestingly, data shows that even as Bitcoin's price aims for a new all-time high, the BTC/USDT borrow ratio on OKEx has reached its lowest level since Nov. 20, 2020. While this figure still favors bulls, it raises questions about what catalysts are behind the move.Whenever traders borrow USDT or other stablecoins, they are likely using it to long cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, BTC borrowing is mainly used for short positions.This means that theoretically, whenever the USDT/BTC lending ratio goes up, the market is angled in a bullish manner. The opposite movement indicates more demand for Bitcoin shorts.As shown in the chart above, USDT loans on OKEx have been holding at roughly eight times larger than Bitcoin-denominated loans. Albeit on the bullish side, this is near the lowest level since Nov. 17, 2020.Unlike perpetual futures (inverse swaps), margin trades take place in regular spot markets. To start margin trading, a trader only needs to transfer collateral funds to a margin account. Most exchanges offer 3x to 10x leverage, depending on the asset’s volatility and market conditions.This indicator has halved since late February, despite BTC marking a new $61,800 all-time high and sustaining daily candle closes above $55,000 for the past 17 days. Nevertheless, a hike in the Bitcoin borrowing rate would undoubtedly cause BTC shorts to reduce their leverage.According to data from Bitfinex, BTC’s short-term lending has rate plummeted to 1% per year. Therefore, high costs are definitely not behind the much smaller BTC borrowing activity. Although OKEx does not provide a chart, both the Poloniex and Quoine exchanges displayed a similar trend, according to data from Coinlend.Traders betting on a negative price swing must borrow BTC to margin trade a short position. Even in this situation, they will still need to pay interest and trade it to U.S. dollars or stablecoin. To close the transaction, the buyer must repurchase the BTC while hoping for a lower price and return it to the lender with the additional interest.This time around, there has been a massive spike in the USD lending rate in mid-March as Bitcoin surpassed $60,000. The leveraged long frenzy quickly reverted as BTC dropped 13% over the following days, and this caused fiat and stablecoin borrowing rates to normalize.Traders looking to borrow USD or stablecoins to buy Bitcoin have been paying from 15% to 23% per year over the last couple of weeks. This rate is likely why the OKEx USDT and BTC borrow ratio fails to increase despite Bitcoin’s price strength.A meager 1% annualized fee was not enough to entice borrowers to short Bitcoin, which is a positive indicator. Had there been any demand for it, the borrowing rate would have gone up.Consequently, traders should not perceive that the OKEx margin lending ratio being at its lowest level in five months as a bearish signal.Even though a 23% margin rate for longs is considerably expensive, there is room for further leverage. Hence, $60,000 becoming a support level for Bitcoin should come as no surprise.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

456,"On the latest episode of Blockchain and Booze, Draper Gorem Holm’s Adam Levy sits down with three leaders in the blockchain industry to talk about layer-two solutions on the Ethereum network. Levy is joined by Stani Kulechov of Aave, Jack O’Holleran of Skale and Antonio Juliano of dYdX. What began as a discussion on high fees quickly transitioned into a greater commentary on the potential power of decentralized finance.For those not familiar with the Ethereum situation, it’s becoming prohibitively expensive to send transitions on-chain. At the time of publication, the average cost of sending an Ethereum transaction is just under $20. Complex smart contracts like those found in decentralized finance protocols can easily run over $100 as the network becomes increasingly congested. Layer-two solutions are protocol that can lighten the load and offer much faster, less expensive transactions.As Aave’s Kulechov explains, the disruptive potential of layer-two solutions is massive. Not only are they incredibly promising, but they are still a nascent technology that has yet to be fully implemented:All three guests are proponents of layer-two solutions due to the benefits they can bring to decentralized systems. But how do these protocols actually operate? O’Holleran has an elegant example: He compares the Ethereum settlement layer to a poker game and layer-two solutions as a record of wins and losses.Imagine a group of friends arriving to play poker. After a full night of gaming, the players don’t walk away with their winnings; instead, they record them on a ledger at the table. Participants can play a number of games, record their wins and losses, and only “cash out” — or use the settlement layer — when they don’t want to play anymore. Similarly, layer-two solutions like Polygon allow Ether (ETH) and ERC-20 users to use the layer-two network until they want to “cash out” their tokens onto Ethereum.Broadening the scope, layer-two networks also open up the DeFi space for those who are unable or unwilling to spend high fees on a single transaction. According to O’Holleran, there is a focus on financial inclusion within the development community, which is driving the adoption of low-cost solutions. The more people can participate in DeFi, the stronger the DeFi network becomes.Near the end of the conversation, Levy asks the group what the “end goal” of DeFi is, or what comes next after DeFi has been “solved.” After a pause, O’Holleran speaks about the potential that DeFi’s systems have to offer the world at large:Juliano echos this sentiment, adding:To insiders, the DeFi space may appear mature and massive, having recently surpassed $100 billion in total value locked. But to the financial world, this is a very small, almost quaint valuation. While traditional finance is currently “interested” in DeFi, according to Juliano, there is still much work to be done behind the scenes. O’Holleran echoes this sentiment, predicting the future intersection of centralized and decentralized finance:Layer-two solutions might not be as flashy as the newest nonfungible token or Bitcoin breaking a new all-time high, but if our panel of experts is to be believed, they might be just as important."
457,"Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone equated the current consolidation in Bitcoin (BTC) price to that of a “caged bull, well-rested to escape.” When compared with the rallies a year after the previous two Bitcoin halvings in 2012 and 2016, the strategist called the current price action “tame.’According to McGlone, Bitcoin is “still in price-discovery mode” and its plateau is still far away.While Bitcoin remains in focus, altcoins have continued to steal the show. Bitcoin’s market dominance, which stood closer to 70% on Jan. 4 has continued to slide even though its price has risen more than 104% year-to-date. The current market dominance at 54.3% is the lowest since April 2019 according to data from CoinMarketCap. This suggests that several altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin by a large margin.However, approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund could tilt the advantage back in favor of Bitcoin. Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital became the latest to file an application with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for a Bitcoin ETF on Monday. The growing list of candidates applying to launch a Bitcoin ETF shows that there is still huge demand for the digital assetWill Bitcoin continue to trade sideways while altcoins rally or will it resume its uptrend and lead from the front. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin formed an inside day candlestick pattern on April 11, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. The bulls tried to resolve this uncertainty to the upside today by piercing the all-time high at $61,825.84, but the bears had other plans. They again successfully defended the overhead resistance.Although the bears are defending the overhead resistance, they have not been able to sink the price further away from $60,000. This suggests the bulls are not closing their long positions in a hurry as they anticipate the uptrend to continue.If the bulls can drive and sustain the price above $61,825.84, the BTC/USDT pair will complete a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern. That could result in a rally to the pattern target at $69,540. If the momentum sustains, the next target to watch out for is $79,566.This bullish view will invalidate if the pair turns down and breaks below the 50-day simple moving average ($54,7823). Such a move could signal the start of a deeper correction.Ether (ETH) has been trading above the breakout level at $2,040.77 for the past three days, but the up-move lacks momentum. The long wick on the April 10 candlestick and the inside day candlestick pattern on April 11 suggests hesitation by the bulls to push the price higher.If the price does not pick up momentum within the next few days, the bears will try to pull the price back below $2,040.77. If the ETH/USDT pair breaks below the 20-day exponential moving average ($1,985), the next stop could be the trendline. A break below this support could signal the start of a deeper correction.However, the upsloping 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) above 61 indicate advantage to the bulls. If the bulls punch the price above $2,200 with force, the pair may start the next leg of the uptrend that could reach $2,618.14.Binance Coin (BNB) is in a strong uptrend, but the up-move of the past two days is showing signs of a melt-up. The long wick on today’s candlestick suggests some traders are booking profits at higher levels.Although the 20-day EMA ($385) is sloping up, the RSI above 84 indicates the rally is overheated in the short term. This could result in a minor correction or consolidation for the next few days. In strong uptrends, the corrections generally do not last for more than three days.The first support on the downside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $483.95. If the price rebounds off this support, it will suggest the sentiment remains positive and bulls are buying on dips. They will then try to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above the all-time high at $638.56.If they succeed, the next leg of the uptrend could begin, which may propel the BNB/USDT pair to $888.70. On the contrary, if bears sink the price below $483.95, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA.The volatility contraction on April 9 was resolved to the upside on April 10 and XRP rallied above $1.11. The bulls continued their purchase on April 11 and pushed the price to $1.50. However, the long wick on the day’s candlestick suggests traders booked profits at higher levels.The bears could not build up on the advantage today and start a correction. The bulls tried to resume the uptrend but failed, resulting in the formation of a Doji candlestick pattern. This suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears about the next directional move.If the buyers can propel the price above $1.50, the XRP/USDT pair could rally to $2. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and dips below $1.30, the pair could start a correction.The major support on the downside is $1.11. If the buyers can flip this level into support, the pair will make one more attempt to rise above $1.50. On the other hand, a break below $1.11 may result in a drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.89).The bulls successfully held Cardano (ADA) above the 50-day SMA ($1.17) in the past few days and are currently attempting to start an up-move. However, the long wick on today’s candlestick suggests that buying dries up above $1.33.If the bulls fail to sustain the price above $1.33, the aggressive bears may again try to sink the price below the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the ADA/USDT pair could drop to the $1.03 to $0.98 support zone.A rebound off this zone could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days. Alternatively, if the bears sink the price below the zone, the pair could decline to $0.80.This negative view will invalidate if the pair sustains the price above $1.33. That could push the price to $1.48. A break above this resistance could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $2.Polkadot (DOT) has been sandwiched between the 20-day EMA ($39.30) and the overhead resistance at $42.28 for the past few days. However, this tight range trading is unlikely to continue for long.If the bulls can propel the price above $42.28, the DOT/USDT pair could rally to $46.80. The bears may again offer resistance at this level but if the bulls can overcome the barrier the pair could climb up to $53.50 and then $57.The marginally upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI above 54 suggest only a minor advantage to the bulls. If the bears can sink the price below the moving averages, it will open the gates for a decline to $32.50 and then $26.50.Uniswap (UNI) has soared above the all-time high at $36.80 today. Although the moving averages are yet to turn up, the RSI has risen close to the overbought territory, indicating a pick-up in momentum.If the bulls can sustain the price above $35.20, it will suggest strong demand at higher levels. The UNI/USDT pair could then march up to $43.43 and if this level also gets taken out, the up-move may hit $50.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above $35.20, it will suggest that traders are booking profits at higher levels. If the price dips and sustains below $35.20, the range-bound action in the pair could continue.Litecoin’s (LTC) volatility contraction on April 8 and 9 was followed by an expansion in favor of the bulls. The buyers pushed the price above $246.96 on April 10 and have successfully managed to sustain the price above it since then.The upsloping 20-day EMA ($218) and the RSI above 63 suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the buyers can drive the price above $262.93, the LTC/USDT pair could rally to its next target objective at $307.42.This bullish view will invalidate if the price breaks and sustains below $246.96. Such a move will suggest that traders booked profits at higher levels. The critical support to watch on the downside is the 20-day EMA.A strong bounce off it will suggest the sentiment remains positive and the bulls will once again try to resume the uptrend. Conversely, a break below the 20-day EMA could pull the price down to $170.Chainlink (LINK) is stuck between $24 and $36.93. The marginally rising 20-day EMA ($30.92) and the RSI above 55 suggest the bulls have a slight edge. However, the failure of the bulls to challenge the $36.93 overhead resistance indicates that demand dries up at higher levels.The bears are currently trying to sink the price below the $32 support. If they can accomplish that, the possibility of a break below the moving averages increases. Such a move could pull the price down to $24.Contrary to this assumption, if the price bounces off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to drive the price above $36.93. If they succeed, the LINK/USDT pair could resume its uptrend and rally toward $40 and then $50.The bulls are attempting to resume the uptrend in Stellar Lumens (XLM) but they are facing stiff resistance at the $0.60 level. The bulls pushed the price above the overhead resistance on April 11 and today but they could not sustain the breakout.If the bulls do not allow the price to slip below $0.55, it will suggest accumulation on dips. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.47) and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest the bulls are in control.A breakout and close above $0.60 will be the first sign that bulls have overpowered the bears. If that happens, the XLM/USDT pair could resume the uptrend and rally to $0.72 and then $0.85.On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below $0.55, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

458,"Cointelegraph Consulting’s 2021 ranking of the top five United States-based regulated crypto asset management firms highlights that Bitcoin’s explosive growth in price has catapulted many digital asset managers past the half-billion-dollar mark. As more and more investors are turning to the digital asset market, these companies are on track to becoming important players in the U.S. financial industry.Grayscale is one of the largest and well-known firms in the crypto world, which was founded in 2013 by its parent organization — Digital Currency Group. Grayscale now has a total of more than $40 billion in assets under management, which consist of investments in Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Zcash (ZEC), Stellar (XLM), Horizen (ZEN) and more. The fund offers various products to its clients, both single-asset products and diversified baskets.Pantera Capital was founded in 2003 by Dan Morehead and is headquartered in California. Pantera is focused on a wide range of assets connected with the digital economy — private equity, tokens and more. Pantera’s $4 billion in AUM is distributed among four main funds: liquid token fund, early-stage token fund, Bitcoin fund and venture fund.Bitwise was founded in 2017 by a team of software experts combined with experienced asset managers and is located in San Francisco. This company has more than $1 billion in AUM, which is concentrated in several funds: 10 crypto index fund, decentralized finance crypto index fund, Bitcoin fund, and Ethereum fund, among others.This firm has several offices across the world including London, Hong Kong and Amsterdam with its headquarters in New York. Galaxy Digital focuses mainly on BTC and ETH, although it also has a diverse crypto index fund. In total, Galaxy Digital’s AUM is more than $800 million. The CEO of Galaxy Digital, Mike Novogratz, is a regular commentator on traditional TV news networks such as Bloomberg. He recently claimed he believes that nonfungible tokens will stay “for the rest of our lives.” They are also known to be involved in mining proof-of-work-based digital assets and launching a regulated investment vehicle for retail investors.Located in California, Wave Financial offers several investment solutions such as funds: Select 5 Index fund, a BTC Income & Growth Digital Fund, Tokenized Real Asset fund (tokenized Kentucky Whiskey Barrels), Active Hybrid VC fund. Additionally, the fund offers wealth management solutions for crypto treasury and wealth management, alongside protocol treasury and inventory management. According to data shared by Wave Financial, the fund has $500 million in assets under management.The Cointelegraph Consulting’s 2021 ranking of the largest U.S.-based and regulated digital asset managers only includes asset managers that are dedicated to cryptocurrency and blockchain. Traditional asset managers that have a small allocation to digital assets were not included.This list also does not include crypto-focused asset managers that are only invested in venture capital and private equity.

459,"Bitcoin (BTC) is a “caged bull,” and the end of its current price run is nowhere near at $60,000, said Bloomberg Intelligence.In a tweet on Monday, senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone delivered his latest bullish verdict on the state of Bitcoin this month. According to McGlone, who eyed a declining BTC supply coupled with roaring demand from new investors, Bitcoin has far to go before it reaches a cycle top, or ”plateau.”“Still in Price-Discovery Mode, Bitcoin Plateau Appears Distant — Bitcoin supply is declining and demand is rising, leading us to expect continued price appreciation and the establishment of a higher plateau as the crypto matures,” he commented.An accompanying chart described Bitcoin as a “caged bull, well rested to escape.” It included Bollinger Bands for Bitcoin, a popular tool for assessing upside and downside volatility.Compared to the year after its two previous block subsidy halvings in 2012 and 2016, meanwhile, 2021 for McGlone is “tame” in terms of price action.This chimes with other analysts’ perspectives, among them the popular Ecoinometrics Twitter account, which, on Monday, again highlighted just how modest Bitcoin’s post-halving growth has been over the past year compared to cycles past.McGlone is a well-known Bitcoin fan, frequently voicing his excitement for the cryptocurrency’s growth based on various macro and on-chain metrics.At the time of writing, BTC/USD is hovering at around $60,400, having briefly broken below $60,000 support in what remains choppy trading conditions.The upcoming Coinbase direct listing on Nasdaq was fuelling excitement among analysts, with altcoins likewise surging ahead of the launch on Wednesday this week.Exchange coins, notably Binance Coin (BNB), led the gains, while the largest altcoin, Ether (ETH), also hit historic all-time highs.The total cryptocurrency market cap stood at $2.087 trillion on the day.Among institutions, crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital became the latest actor to apply to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the United States. Regulators are yet to approve any of the now nine applications, but anticipation is high that they will finally do so after Canada beat the U.S. to the punch in February."
460,"Galaxy Digital has submitted a Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.According to the form S-1 published by the SEC on Monday, the Galaxy Bitcoin ETF — if approved — will trade on the NYSE Arca exchange, with the Bloomberg Galaxy Bitcoin index tapped as the pricing mechanism.Detailing the price mechanism for the prospective Bitcoin ETF, the filing reads:As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Galaxy Digital, via its financial services subsidiary, launched a Bitcoin ETF product in the Canadian market back in March.Galaxy’s Bitcoin ETF filing did not list any custodian or administrator. The filing document also did not provide details of the trustee beyond the organization being a “Delaware trust company.”The Bitcoin ETF filing by Galaxy Digital comes on the heels of a similar application by Fidelity back in March.The SEC is yet to approve any Bitcoin ETF, with the previous leadership citing volatility and price manipulation concerns.Meanwhile, the SEC has less than two weeks to deliver its initial response to VanEck’s Bitcoin ETF filing following the commission’s acknowledgment of the submission back in mid-March."
461,"India has been the subject of intense speculation regarding the future legal status of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies in recent months.Speculation went into overdrive in February when an anonymous Indian minister told Bloomberg that a nationwide blanket ban on cryptocurrency was imminent and that holders would be given a matter of months to dispense with their coins and tokens.Fears were then allayed — somewhat — when finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told CNBC that reports of a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies had been overstated, adding that any pending regulation would take a much more “calibrated” approach.Perhaps it was this promise of calibration that caused a massive spike in sign-ups to one of India’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, WazirX, during the first week of April. Head of communications at WazirX Priyanka Sharma told Cointelegraph that WazirX had witnessed more sign-ups during the first six days of April 2021 than in the entire first six months of the previous year.Another Indian crypto exchange, CoinDCX, saw its sign-ups double in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the final months of 2020, the firm’s co-founder and CEO, Sumit Gupta, told Cointelegraph.Pessimism stemming from genuine fears of a country-wide crypto ban appear to have been counterbalanced by optimism sparked by developments in other parts of the world.The high-profile adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by major firms such as PayPal, Tesla and MicroStrategy have not gone unnoticed in India, according to Sharma, who also pointed out the role that the COVID-19 lockdown has played in the spike in crypto interest:Data from publicly available plugins reveal visits to WazirX’s website have increased 630% in the past six months, climbing from around 500,000 to over 4 million monthly visitors. Sharma said the most rapid influx of new sign-ups came from users aged 20–30, adding that people were confident regulators would take a lenient approach when cryptocurrency laws are eventually passed.The trend was similar over on CoinDCX, which has seen its visitor numbers more than treble since November 2020. According to Gupta, the majority of new sign-ups also fell under the 18–34 age range.With no smoking gun having yet been presented by authorities, Sharma believes the fear, uncertainty and doubt, or FUD, created by ministerial leaks in February has been all but eradicated:Indian cryptocurrency exchanges aren’t the only ones thinking this way. Leading American crypto exchange Coinbase recently began a recruitment drive in India with a view to basing some of its IT and engineering services in the country.Gupta said demand for cryptocurrency has been growing in India all year, especially following the Indian Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the crypto ban that the Reserve Bank of India had placed on banking institutions.“Currently, there are over 750,000 investors in India and more than 340+ crypto startups that have come into existence since March 2020. Additionally, the trading volumes have grown over 500%, post-March 2020,” said Gupta.WazirX CEO Nischal Shetty recently joined other industry leaders in drafting a speculative regulatory framework, which they hope will be taken into consideration by lawmakers."
462,"Bitcoin’s bullish 2020 closeout was not enough to prevent Canaan from incurring a net loss in 2020.According to the company’s unaudited financial report for Q4 2020, the Bitcoin (BTC) miner maker’s net loss for 2020 was about $33 million. However, Canaan’s 2020 net loss is significantly lower than the $148 million recorded in 2019.Indeed, the reduction in net loss for Canaan was a common theme across the company’s quarterly performance in 2020. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, significant growth in gross margin on the sale of mining rigs helped the company lessen its year-on-year net loss by over 90% in Q2 2020.As part of the report issued on Monday, Canaan revealed that its 2020 net revenue amounted to about $68.6 million — a 66% decline from the revenue figures in the 2019 financials.The marked revenue decline also meant Canaan’s year-on-year gross profit took a steep tumble falling from $79 million in 2019 to under $6 million in 2020.However, despite the drop in net revenue, Canaan said the trend will reverse in 2021, with the company forecasting a $61-million net revenue target for Q1 2021.Like other Chinese miners, Canaan’s crypto mining inventory is on backorder amid the ongoing global semiconductor shortage.According to Canaan CEO Nancheng Zhang, the volume of pre-orders for the company’s Bitcoin mining hardware will drive revenue growth, stating:At the time of writing, the stock price of the Nasdaq-listed Canaan is about 50% down from its 2021 high attained a month ago. Despite the drop, Canaan is still up 179% year-to-date."
463,"Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy announced on Sunday that its board of directors will now receive bonuses in Bitcoin (BTC) instead of cash.A modified 8-K form filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission revealed MicroStrategy’s decision to dispense with cash bonuses and instead use Bitcoin to compensate those on the company’s board. The modified filing states:“Going forward, non-employee directors will receive all fees for their service on the Company’s Board in bitcoin instead of cash.”MicroStrategy has dollar-cost averaged into Bitcoin since the end of 2020, buying small amounts here and there until it eventually accumulated a war chest of over $4 billion worth of BTC.The 8-K form stated MicroStrategy’s belief that Bitcoin could function as a reliable store of value and commended its open-source nature, which means it isn’t beholden to any one corporate entity.“In approving bitcoin as a form of compensation for Board service, the Board cited its commitment to bitcoin given its ability to serve as a store of value, supported by a robust and public open-source architecture, untethered to sovereign monetary policy,” states the filing.The dollar amount of bonuses paid to board members will not change under the new system. Instead, the dollar value of the bonus in question will be converted to Bitcoin at the time of the payment and sent to the director’s wallet. The filing elaborates:“Under this modified arrangement, the amount of Board fees payable to non-employee directors remains unchanged and will be nominally denominated in USD. At the time of payment, the fees will be converted from USD into bitcoin by the payment processor and then deposited into the digital wallet of the applicable non-employee director.”"
464,"Bitcoin (BTC) is back with a vengeance this week as a new day’s trading gets underway with a fresh attack on $60,000.After a weekend in which the largest cryptocurrency avoided a correction, Monday is looking bullish — but what could shape price action in the short term?Cointelegraph presents five factors to keep an eye on for Bitcoin traders as the market inches closer to historic all-time highs.The macro picture is a tale of two coronavirus moods this week.With the United Kingdom exiting lockdown, sentiment among business leaders has bounced to highs, indicative of pockets of optimism surfacing in the West still battered by coronavirus restrictions.The picture is muddied by eurozone main players France and Germany, in which the picture is much less rosy, while the United States is also a patchwork of policy when it comes to the virus.As such, stocks are broadly flat as the week begins, while elsewhere, a looming lockdown is sending sentiment plummeting in India, Monday’s main downward mover.The controversial measures from Delhi “are unnerving markets and no one is sure whether lockdowns will help bring cases under control,” Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities told Bloomberg.Markets commentator Holger Zschaepitz, meanwhile, described a “busy” week for equities, noting new highs for mainstream risk assets on Friday — something which increasingly includes Bitcoin.The signal of the moment within Bitcoin is finally tied to the spot market.On Monday, $60,000 is back after BTC/USD last passed the significant price level early on Saturday.The weekend saw the largest weekly close in Bitcoin’s history at around $60,000.At the time of writing, the BTC/USD pair is targeting $61,000 again, less than $1,000 from all-time highs. Among analysts, expectations of Bitcoin reentering uncharted territory are predictably high.“Another breakout attempt,” on-chain analytics service Skew summarized.A look at order book activity on major exchange Binance shows sellers lined up at $60,500, $61,500 and $62,000 before orders begin to dry up. On the buy side, $59,000, $58,000 and $57,000 remain strong areas of interest.The resulting constriction of volatility, with Bitcoin sandwiched between major buy and sell interest, is a classic signal for the final stages of price consolidation. At 50 days, Bitcoin has now been in such a consolidatory regime since hitting $58,300 for the first time in the last week of February.For popular Twitter trader Crypto Ed, the latest move is surprising, as just last week, more bearish signals filled the low-timeframe landscape. Sunday, in addition, was pointing to an incoming drop.“Surprising PA this morning invalidating this idea,” he commented.Cointelegraph has often reported on the strength of Bitcoin on-chain indicators this year, these consistently demanding a continuation of the bull market throughout 2021.Despite the past weeks’ consolidation, nothing has changed for fundamentals, which show that Bitcoin is not yet near the bull cycle peak, for example like that of December 2017.For Twitter account Byzantine General, which produced a comprehensive overview of indicator data this weekend, there is thus no reason to be bearish at $60,000.“Summary: - derivs a bit overheated - constant strong spot bid - institutional driven flow - no peak retail euphoria yet - mainstream adoption getting very real - Coinbase IPO could be volatility catalyst,” it concluded.Many of those points refer to material already covered by Cointelegraph, while Coinbase’s upcoming direct listing on Nasdaq (Wednesday) may provide a rare counterpoint narrative this week.Specifically, listing day can often see a sell-off for companies going public, and this Wednesday may therefore see temporary volatility.“Coinbase’ google searches suggest that normies haven’t caught on yet,” Byzantine General added.It’s not just Bitcoin shooting for the moon on Monday — altcoins are setting records, indicative of a broader leg up for cryptocurrency interest.These are being led by Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin by market cap, which has hit new all-time highs on the day, currently at $2,190.Long tipped to be targeting $5,000 and even $10,000 this cycle, ETH/USD has gained 7% in the past week, frequently outperforming Bitcoin itself.That performance nonetheless pales in comparison to other major cap altcoins, notably Binance Coin (BNB), which is up 70% in seven days and nearing $600.“I think $BNB is headed to $600. Pennant break. All time high break. Price discovery. A lot to like. Looks insane on $BTC pair as well,” analyst Scott Melker commented on the action last weekend in a timely prediction.As Cointelegraph reported, “alt season 2.0” is expected to hit its stride only in summer and reaching hitherto unknown proportions. Fellow analyst Filbfilb, co-founder of trading suite DecenTrader, believes altcoins’ time is already here.Finally, another event that cast the spotlight on Coinbase, this time, involving users rather than the company itself.According to on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode, Sunday saw a sudden spike of $750 million in outflows from Coinbase’s books.While not unequivocally indicative of a major buy-in, such an event would not be unheard of in the current environment, but would be significant in terms of size.Institutional investors continue to both buy and champion Bitcoin as an investment, while rumors swirl of more famous names reportedly eyeing an allocation."
465,"The Keep Network has released details for the second iteration of its “trust-minimized” Bitcoin tokenization protocol, tBTC.In a blog post on Sunday, Keep Network community member Evandro Saturnino outlined several changes the protocol is considering to address its past issues with collateralization.The second iteration of tBTC is expected to require stakers to only lock up Keep rather than both Keep and Ether (ETH), alongside introducing changes to its wallet-generation mechanism. The protocol allows users to tokenize their Bitcoin (BTC) for use on the Ethereum network.While Saturnino notes the changes “will provide a way of greatly decrease[ing] the collateral ratio of the staking assets,” he warns of new risks associated with the proposed upgrades.To offset a “small risk to the peg” resulting from the changes, Saturnino advances using insurance coverage pools to protect against malicious validators, describing the pools as “perfectly suited to ensure against fraud in tBTC v2.”tBTC works with ETH collateral on a network of blockchain validators and parties that individually contribute to the minting and backing of the asset, with activity kept in check on the blockchain. Saturnino explained:Once the user submits a request to mint tBTC and a deposit bond, a randomly selected signing group generates a public BTC wallet address to the user. Signing group members are picked from an eligible pool of signers who agreed to bond ETH as collateral.The bonded ETH is an incentive to align the interests of the signers and can also be used to penalize members in the case of misbehavior. Signers must bond 150% of the total deposit size in ETH as collateral in a mechanism that is similar to the MakerDAO and Dai stablecoin system.The developer acknowledged the team has learned a lot since the second launch of the tBTC mainnet in September 2020. Within just a few days of its initial launch in May 2020, Keep protocol was briefly shut down after a bug was detected in its redemption codes. The protocol also struggled to scale, added Saturnino.Despite being backed by venture capital giant A16z and other big names, Keep’s tBTC has failed to gain traction among DeFi users, with a circulating supply of just 1,293 tokens according to CoinGecko.Existing Bitcoin tokenizations solutions have enjoyed significant growth and popularity over the past year, with the custodial Wrapped BTC currently ranking as the second-largest DeFi protocol with a TVL of $8.7 billion, according to DeFi Llama. Competitor renBTC has also amassed a TVL of $926 million and currently ranks as the 27th top DeFi project."
466,"Reddit’s r/Cryptocurrency community revived an interesting piece of Bitcoin (BTC) history on Sunday with a new thread reminiscing about the time that American software developer Gavin Andresen gave away 19,700 BTC. A thread started by u/GroundbreakingLack78 took the Reddit community all the way back to June 2010 when Andresen first launched the so-called Bitcoin faucet website. Using the domain “freebitcoins.appspot.com,” Andresen gave visitors the opportunity to earn 5 BTC per day just by solving a captcha, which is a program intended to distinguish human from machine input.User u/GroundbreakingLack78 explained:The faucet’s creator announced his “really dumb” idea of giving away free BTC on the now infamous Bitcointalk forum in a post that appeared on June 11, 2010. His motivation: “[...] I want the Bitcoin project to succeed, and I think it is more likely to be a success if people can get a handful of coins to try it out.”Andresen played a major role in Bitcoin’s development during its formative days. He was the main software developer for BTC’s reference implementation, having joined the core development team in 2012 after Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous founder, announced they would be leaving the project.Although the Bitcoin faucet website is no longer functioning, a screengrab of the domain’s homepage revealed a very basic setup where users can earn BTC and set up their digital wallet. The Bitcoin faucet reportedly gave away 19,700 BTC to users just for solving a captcha. Those BTC are worth almost $1.2 billion at today’s prices.With Bitcoin amid yet another bull market, many investors would love to get their hands on just 5 BTC. However, that’s easier said than done at current values. Given the apparent shortage of BTC on major exchanges, the flagship digital currency could be poised to go higher in the short term. On-chain data reveals that Bitcoin’s moonshot could still be months away, which means investors remain overwhelmingly bullish.The Bitcoin price peaked just below $62,000 in mid-March before the rally paused and altcoins played catch-up. At current values, Bitcoin’s market capitalization exceeds $1 trillion. Major institutions and corporations have invested in the digital asset as a hedge against currency debasement, among other motivations."
467,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) hesitation near the all-time high suggests that the bulls and the bears are waiting for a trigger to start the next trending move.The bulls are searching for a positive catalyst to thrust the price above the overhead resistance. On the contrary, the bears may be standing by in anticipation of any signs of weakness that could confirm a short-term top.The event that may act as a trigger is the Nasdaq listing for Coinbase's COIN stock on April 14. A successful listing is likely to be cheered by the crypto bulls because that could signal increased crypto adoption by traditional investors in the future. Conversely, a tepid reception to the Coinbase listing could embolden the bears.Onchain indicator HODL waves suggests that both the long-term investors and the short-term speculators are not booking profits as they expect higher levels in the future. An increase in the number of HODLers is generally a bullish sign but could become an overhang if fresh money dries up and the market starts to reverse direction.If that happens, the short-term speculators are likely to panic first and dump their positions. That may hit stops of the swing traders and intensify the selling, paving way for a deeper correction.As markets wait for a trigger, let’s analyze the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that could benefit from a bullish sentiment.Bitcoin soared above the $60,000 overhead resistance on April 10 and reached $61,301.21, just short of the all-time high at $61,825.84. However, the bulls continue to find difficulty in keeping the price above $60,000, indicating stiff resistance from the bears.The price has yet to close above $60,000 which means the inverse head and shoulders pattern is still not complete.The bears will try to capitalize on the small window of opportunity and pull the price down to the 20-day exponential moving average ($57,513). A strong bounce off this support will increase the possibility of a break above $61,825.84.If that happens, the BTC/USDT pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that could push the price to $69,540 and then $79,566.On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair could challenge the critical support at the 50-day simple moving average ($54,723). A break below this support will be the first indication of a possible change in trend.The 4-hour chart shows the bears are active above $60,000. However, the positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to sustain below the 20-EMA. This means the bulls are buying on every minor dip.If the bulls can once again push the price above $60,000, the pair may challenge the all-time high. On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below the 20-EMA, a drop to $57,600 is possible. If this support cracks, the next stop could be $55,600.Stellar Lumens (XLM) broke above the $0.60 resistance today and rose to a new 52-week high at $0.65. Whenever an asset hits a new 52-week high, it is a sign of strength because it shows that traders are in a hurry to buy as they expect the price to rise further.The upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.46) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought territory suggest the bulls have the upper hand. If the bulls can propel the price above $0.65, the XLM/USDT pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that could reach $0.72 and then $0.85.However, the long wick on today’s candlestick suggests that the bears have other plans. They are trying to trap the aggressive bulls and pull the price back below $0.60. If the bulls do not allow the price to dip below $0.55, it will suggest accumulation on dips. That will keep the sentiment positive.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below $0.55, a drop to the 20-day EMA is possible. A break below this support will indicate that the bulls have lost their grip.The 4-hour chart shows the pair closed above $0.60 but the bulls could not build upon this strength. The bears pounced on the opportunity and have pulled the price back below the breakout level at $0.60.However, if the bears fail to sink the price to the 20-EMA, it will suggest the bulls are accumulating on dips. That will increase the possibility of the resumption of the up-move. Conversely, a break below the 20-day EMA may tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.IOTA (MIOTA) is in an uptrend. The bulls pushed the price above the psychologically important level at $2 on April 10. If bulls can sustain the breakout, the up-move could reach the next target objective at $2.35 and then $2.60.The upsloping 20-day EMA ($1.66) and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest the bulls have the upper hand.However, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above $2, the bears may try to pull the price down to the 20-day EMA. The bulls have successfully defended this support since the start of the current leg of the rally in March.Hence, if the price again rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the sentiment remains positive and the bulls are buying on dips. Alternatively, a break below the 20-day EMA will suggest that the bears are making a comeback.The 4-hour chart shows profit-booking above $2. The MIOTA/USDT pair could now drop to the 20-EMA, which is sloping up. If the price rebounds off this level, it will enhance the prospects of the resumption of the uptrend.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below the 20-EMA, the pair could extend its decline to the 50-SMA. Such a deep correction could delay the start of the next leg of the up-move.Monero (XMR) broke above the $268.60 resistance on April 10, indicating the possible resumption of the uptrend. If the bulls can sustain the breakout, the altcoin could rally to the next target objective at $334 and then $384.The rising 20-day EMA ($258) and the RSI above 75 suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.However, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above $288.60, the XMR/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA. A strong bounce off this support will suggest the sentiment remains positive and the bulls are buying on dips. The bulls will then make one more attempt to resume the uptrend.On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest a possible change in sentiment. That could result in a drop to the 50-day SMA ($232).The 4-hour chart shows the bears attempted to stall the rally near the psychological resistance at $300 but the bulls did not give up much ground. They purchased the dip to the 20-EMA and pushed the price above $300.The rising moving averages and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest the bulls are in control.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages. Such a move will indicate the demand has dried up and traders are booking profits. That could pull the price down to $250.Tezos (XTZ) is in a strong uptrend. It broke above the stiff overhead resistance at $5.64 on April 5 and completed a successful retest of the breakout level on April 7 and 8. The altcoin resumed its uptrend and made a new all-time high at $7.21 on April 10.The 20-day EMA ($5.42) is sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought territory, indicating advantage to the bulls. In a strong uptrend, corrections usually last between one to three days as traders buy every minor dip aggressively.The long tail on today’s candlestick suggests traders are buying at lower levels. If they can drive the price above $7.21, the XTZ/USDT pair could rally to the next target objective at $8.14.The major support on the downside is the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off this support, it will suggest the sentiment remains bullish. The buyers will then again try to push the price above $7.21. Conversely, a break below the 20-day EMA will suggest the bullish momentum has weakened.The 4-hour chart shows the bulls are trying to arrest the pullback at the 20-EMA. If they can push the price above $6.85, a retest of $7.21 is possible. A breakout of this resistance will start the next leg of the up-move.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair breaks and sustains below the 20-EMA, it may drop to the 50-SMA. The bulls are likely to defend this support aggressively because the price has not dipped below the 50-SMA since March 29.However, if the bulls fail to arrest the decline at the 50-SMA, the slide could extend to $5.40 and then to $4.60.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

468,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been struggling to break the $60,000 resistance for almost a month. But despite the impasse, BTC futures markets have never been so bullish. While regular spot exchanges are trading near $59,600, the BTC contracts maturing in June are trading above $65,000.Futures contracts tend to trade at a premium, mainly on neutral-to-bullish markets, and this happens on every asset, including commodities, equities, indexes and currencies. However, a 50% annualized premium (basis) for contracts expiring in three months is highly uncommon.Unlike the perpetual contract — or inverse swap — these fixed-calendar futures do not have a funding rate. Thus, their price will vastly differ from regular spot exchanges. Fixed-calendar futures eliminates eventual funding rates’ spikes from the buyers’ perspective, which can reach up to 43% per month.On the other hand, the seller benefits from a predictable premium, usually locking longer-term arbitrage strategies. By simultaneously buying the spot (regular) BTC and selling the futures contracts, one gains a zero-risk exposure with a predetermined gain. Thus, the futures contracts seller demands higher profits (premium) whenever markets lean bullish.The three-month futures usually trade with 10%–20% versus regular spot exchanges to justify locking the funds instead of immediately cashing out.The above chart shows that even during the 250% rally between March and June 2019, the futures’ basis held below 25%. It was only recently, in February 2021, that such phenomena reemerged. Bitcoin surged by 135% in 60 days before the three-month futures premium surpassed the 25% annualized level on Feb. 8, 2021.While professional traders tend to prefer the fixed-month calendar futures, retail dominates perpetual contracts, avoiding the expiries’ hassle. Moreover, retail traders consider it expensive to pay 10% or larger nominal premiums, even though perpetual contracts (inverse swaps) are more costly when considering the funding rate.While the recent 0.20% funding rate per eight-hour is extraordinary, it is definitely not unusual for BTC markets. Such a fee is equivalent to 19.7% per month but seldom lasts more than a couple of days.A high funding rate causes arbitrage desks to intervene, buying fixed-calendar contracts and selling the perpetual futures. Thus, excessive retail long leverage usually drives the futures’ basis up, not the other way around.As crypto derivatives markets remain largely unregulated, inefficiencies shall continue to prevail. Thus, while a 50% basis premium seems out of the norm, one must remember that retail traders have no other means to leverage their positions. In turn, this causes temporary distortions, although not necessarily worrisome from a trading perspective.While exorbitant funding rate fees remain, leverage longs will be forced to close their positions due to its growing cost. Thus, December’s $73,500 contract does not necessarily reflect investors’ expectations, and such a premium should recede.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

469,"For the very first time in a Bitcoin (BTC) bull market, not only long-term investors but also short-term speculators who usually add to the daily sell pressure toward the end of a market cycle have become increasingly confident of higher prices as they hold on to their Bitcoin.This only adds to the already existing supply shock. If demand remains strong, this is a recipe for another leg up for the BTC price.Every Bitcoin bull market usually coincided with an increasing number of short-term speculators coming into the market hoping to turn a quick profit, while long-term speculators start to add sell pressure toward the second half of the market cycle to realize their profits.One of the best on-chain indicators to see this trend unfold in each cycle is called HODL waves. Hereby, the length at which each BTC address holds Bitcoin before they are sold into the market is clustered into term buckets that are then visualized in different color bands.For example, someone who held on to their Bitcoin for five months would fall into the 3m–6m bucket, the light orange color band. If that person decides to sell, it falls out of that bucket and would show up in the 24h-term bucket, the dark red color band.This means, the redder the colors are in the HODL waves chart on a respective date, the more short-term turnover of Bitcoins happens. This activity is almost at its lowest during a bear market and at its highest during a bull market, while the short-term activity tends to peak around a bull market top.Since the Bitcoin price fluctuates significantly during the market cycles, and HODL waves only account for the absolute number of Bitcoins moved, this chart does not account for the total value realized on a respective day by a Bitcoin seller.As it becomes increasingly lucrative for hodlers to take profit the higher the price rises, the HODL waves can be weighted by the realized price, which is the price at which each Bitcoin on average was last bought /sold.This adjustment allows for visualizing the value-driven profit-taking on a daily basis through the value-adjusted colored, term buckets.Once HODL waves are weighted by the realized price, the Realized Cap HODL Waves are derived, a concept that was first introduced by on-chain analyst Typerbole. This adjustment reveals that the 1w–1m bucket tops coincide with every single bull market top so far.This indicator does not only suggest that the current selling activity is not at a typical bull market peak yet, it even reveals that for the first time in Bitcoin’s bull market history this trend is declining while the price continues to rise.This is a very unusual trend in a bull market. Assuming that the price peak has not been reached yet, this suggests that profit-seekers, whether they are short- or long-term focused, are starting to hold on to their Bitcoin again, expecting higher prices to come and by that adding to the Bitcoin supply squeeze on exchanges.Rafael Schultze-Kraft, chief technology officer of Glassnode, takes a similar view by looking at long-term hodlers through Coin Days Destroyed, an indicator that shows the total holding days “destroyed” by holders selling their Bitcoin.Based on a three-month moving average of this indicator, the destruction has retraced to a level last seen in the summer of 2019, at times where the price peak was already reached.Ok, this is beautiful.

Experimenting with Coin Days Destroyed: Despite $BTC prices above $50k, 3-month CDD at low levels and recently declining.

Old hands extremely strong here, HODLers showing conviction and doing what they do best.

Doesn't look like a top to me.#Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/z8OL8Gt73EIf the price was close to a bull market peak, a much higher indicator value would be expected as long-term holders would be taking profit in material size, which is currently not the case.When taking this concept of Coin Days Destroyed further and looking at it with respect to average value destroyed in perspective to the market capitalization, one arrives at the so-called dormancy flow. This is a concept invented by analyst and trader David Puell.The dormancy flow describes the yearly moving average of Bitcoin holders’ spending behavior. It is based on the held value that gets destroyed in perspective to the overall accrued value in the market.This indicator suggests that the 365-day average spending behavior of Bitcoin measured in United States dollars is very healthy and far below prior bull market spending.Bitcoin selling activity, whether it is from speculators or long-term holders, is declining while also the annual spending behavior relative to the market capitalization is surprisingly low. All these on-chain data points suggest that the market is inching to an even deeper supply squeeze. This is one of the best rocket fuels to send the Bitcoin price higher.However, this is not a guarantee, as it requires continuous demand for the price to appreciate in this environment. Therefore, a close eye on high-net-worth individuals and institutions’ demand should be kept, as they have recently been the main driver on the buyer side.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

470,"Venture capital funding for crypto and blockchain startups looks set to break records in 2021. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, crypto firms received more funding in the first quarter of 2021 than the whole of 2020.Indeed, three companies in the market attracted $1.1 billion from backers in Q1 202 — a third of the total funding for crypto and blockchain firms reported in 2018. With the current bullish enthusiasm in the crypto space, VC funding appetite for blockchain startups might continue throughout the year.This early-stage funding frenzy also appears to be spreading to the retail side with initial decentralized exchange offerings regularly becoming oversubscribed. As such, the native tokens of IDO launchpads are now some of the best-performing in the cryptocurrency space.In Q1 2021, 129 crypto and blockchain startups received about $2.6 billion in funding, according to a Bloomberg report culled from data by business analytics firm CB Insights. This figure is already $300 million more than the total funding for such companies in the whole of 2020.Crypto wallet provider Blockchain.com, lending outfit BlockFi and blockchain game studio Dapper Labs accounted for almost half of the $2.6 billion funding received by startups in the industry in Q1 2021. At the end of March, Dapper Labs announced a $305-million investment from sports stars and other celebrities amid growth in the sale of NBA Top Shot nonfungible tokens.VC funding for crypto and blockchain startups in the United States has eclipsed the numbers recorded in other regions since the emergence of the crypto space, according to the recently published “Blockchain Venture Capital Report” by Cointelegraph Research. This trend is despite the lack of regularity clarity for the market in the country.According to Jehan Chu, founder of Hong Kong-based VC investment firm Kenetic, the regulatory climate in the U.S. has done little to dissuade private equity funding for blockchain startups, telling Cointelegraph:The potential for outsized returns continues to be a driving force behind increased equity investments in crypto startups both for blockchain and mainstream VC funds. In its recently published “Blockchain Venture Capital Report,” Cointelegraph Research revealed that blockchain private equity has outperformed traditional private equity across one-, three- and five-year horizons.Indeed, blockchain private equity performance has proven itself to be largely uncorrelated with the mainstream asset class. This trend offers some form of assurance for VC funds looking to diversify their early-stage investment portfolios.Commenting on the basic investment thesis for VC funds in the blockchain space, Xinshu Dong, a partner at VC firm IOSG Ventures, told Cointelegraph: “Crypto is a very attractive direction with not just unparalleled growth potential but also quite promising validation, especially in the past few months from the buy-in from U.S. institutions.”Given the marked increase in funding for crypto startups in Q1 2021, the proportion of blockchain-focused VC funding to the overall market might be set for a trend reversal. After almost peaking at 2% during the 2017 bull run, blockchain private equity fell to less than 1% of the global VC market as of the end of 2020.This decrease can be attributed in part to the trends that emerged post-2018 bear market and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. According to data from Cointelegraph Research, blockchain-focused VC funding dropped by 13% between 2019 and 2020, while traditional equity funding increased by 18% during the same period.Since its emergence, the crypto landscape has been likened to the early days of the internet market in the 1990s and early 2000s. Where the internet boom led to the initiation and subsequent rise of sectors like e-commerce and social media, the blockchain space has been touted to drive innovations such as decentralized finance and the decentralized web.Legacy brands that were dismissive of the promise of the then young internet space saw the rise of e-commerce and online merchants challenge the primacy of these brick-and-mortar firms in the retail arena. Social media also grew to arguably eclipse the reach of print and broadcast media as web-based services disrupted several industries.With blockchain touted as having similar global business process disruption capabilities, several notable participants in the mainstream arena appear keen to interact with the emerging technology. This appetite for backing players in the novel arena appears even more apparent among VC firms with Dong telling Cointelegraph: “It’s an opportunity of a generation that VCs can hardly miss.”The token economy associated with blockchain startups also offers early backers the opportunity to acquire cryptocurrencies that could appreciate in value within a short period. Even with vesting schedules that mandate a significant lock-up of these tokens for VC funds, the gains often outsize their initial equity investment.Decentralized finance’s rise to prominence has offered significant expansions to the crypto market through activities like staking and protocol governance. According to Baek Kim, director of investments at VC fund Hashed: “The most important part of the crypto VC investments is that this is also an entry ticket to participate in crypto networks as a shareholder.” He added further:This growing appetite for blockchain startups is not restricted to established players in the still-nascent crypto space. New projects, especially those in the DeFi space, are also enjoying significant interest from private equity firms looking to be early backers of the next DeFi bluechip.In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Rob Weir, chief operating officer of upcoming DeFi platform Jigstack, attracting investments from VC funds was the easiest part of the private equity funding process. According to Weir, new blockchain projects need to consider issues such as vesting schedules and implications of token-represented equity on future price action for their native “coins.”Weir said that balancing these key issues is essential for new projects in determining how to allocate tokens to private and public funding, adding: “VCs require a significant amount of token represented equity and consolidate a large portion of what would become selling pressure. If they deliver on their promises then they are well worth the upfront sacrifice.” He further added that “community-oriented raises leave you resource shy and carry other inherent risks.”Early-stage backing by retail investors is also another growing trend in 2021, especially amid the gains enjoyed by projects bootstrapped on IDO launchpads. Launchpad platforms often utilize a tiered subscription package that allows holders of their native coins to gain access to project token allocations before the public listing.According to data from cryptocurrency aggregator CryptoDiffer, the top 10 launchpad platforms in the market have recorded average returns on investment ranging between 11.3% and 68.2% thus far in 2021."
471,"This is the year cryptocurrency finally starts to break into the mainstream. From Elon Musk and Tesla investing in and accepting Bitcoin (BTC) to the recent nonfungible token craze, the days of blockchain tech being the domain of cypherpunks and coders are behind us.Still, the technology has not quite advanced to the stage where the average person will feel comfortable using it. And the longer the usability of cryptocurrency takes to reach the level where it connects with nontechnical users, the higher the risk that centralized companies will take over the task of improving accessibility instead, harming the censorship resistance of this relatively new technology as it finally surges into the mainstream consciousness.Let’s look at the state of the crypto usability landscape as it stands today.When Bitcoin chose to reject on-chain scaling via big blocks, it essentially placed all its hopes and dreams of being usable as an everyday currency on second-layer scaling solutions, foremost among them being the Lightning Network. While functional today, the Lightning Network nonetheless introduces a whole new host of complexities, including liquidity balancing, opening and closing channels, routing payment paths, maintaining connectivity at all times in order to receive funds and so on. And perhaps most challenging to new users, moving funds off-chain onto the Lightning Network requires an on-chain transaction (as do various other Lightning Network functions), triggering those awful, long confirmation times and high transaction fees. All in all, this is a frustrating experience even for a savvy cryptocurrency user and an absolute non-starter for complete newbies.Thankfully, tireless developers have deployed a new generation of Lightning Network wallets that significantly improve the user experience to a level where a nontechnical user may be comfortable using them. The second-generation Lightning Network wallets, such as Phoenix, achieve this by outsourcing some of the functionality of a regular Lightning Network node — including opening channels, managing liquidity, automatic backups and more — to the wallet provider.Essentially, they resemble custodial wallets in almost every way except that they’re noncustodial. That is, the user maintains control over their own funds and the service provider can’t run off with (or deny access to) their money. Basically, two main objectives were prioritized: ease of use and user control over funds, and any and all necessary trade-offs were made in order to achieve this. And the results are pretty good: If you use a second-generation Lightning Network wallet, you can send and receive pretty easily without being exposed to the complicated inner workings of the network, and you still keep full control over your money at all times. You just have to trust the Lightning Service Provider, or LSP, for a lot more than if you were just using Bitcoin on-chain.The challenge comes in the precedent and direction this sets for the ecosystem. This approach makes an increasing number of users reliant on a shrinking number of large LSPs to move their Bitcoin around with ease, resembling the legacy financial system where transaction processing coalesces around a small number of major payments companies.Sure, many users would still be able to control their own funds and become protected from inflation and currency manipulation, but save for a hardy few technophiles running their own nodes, most people will be relying on centralized entities in order to transact.To be fair, not every cryptocurrency suffers from the complications of a congested main chain and a still-nascent second-layer solution. Plenty of chains, most notably the major Bitcoin forks and projects like Litecoin (LTC), have low on-chain fees and regular confirmation times. However, even this experience is insufficient for an end-user.No matter what Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fans say, transactions are not, in fact, instant, and paying through many popular payment processors or depositing to exchanges will still necessitate waiting for several confirmations, which can take many from minutes to, sometimes, hours. The average user won’t understand why they have to wait, or why the waiting time is variable, or that the service should have been able to trust zero-confirmation transactions but chose not to. They will only understand that they had to wait, and will be frustrated as a result.Of course, some coins, such as those based on proof-of-stake, can be considered secure after a single conformation, significantly cutting down on waiting times. Depending on the chain, this may or may not be sufficient to ensure a seamless user experience. Dash (DASH) transactions become permanent after a single confirmation (roughly 2.5 minutes) and can be considered highly secure in under two seconds, creating an experience rivaling or surpassing that of proof-of-stake coins despite being a proof-of-work network.However, not all exchanges and services fully understand the underlying technology, and so this experience can be hit-or-miss. Still, other networks, like Nano (NANO), reach transaction finality in a matter of seconds. However, this may come with significant network reliability trade-offs. No one cares that they can get a payment instantly finalized if the entire network can become unreliable for days, even weeks, due to spam attacks.Even once the problem of fast, reliable transactions is solved, there still remains a major key to usability necessary for mass adoption: usernames. While QR code scanning can be simple enough, for web, remote and other situations, copying and pasting long cryptographic hashes is a non-starter. We need a simple, social way for people to pay, leveraging human-readable usernames and contact lists.There are quite a few systems out today that accomplish this to a certain degree. However, most have significant trade-offs in either usability or trust, or both. Solutions like Ethereum Name Service simply resolve to a static address, which still often reveals said long, ugly address in the user interface, and creates some troubling privacy issues by exposing your entire transaction history to anyone who can simply paste your address into a block explorer. The Foundation for Interwallet Operability is similar, except with even more complexity due to wallet-specific domains and implementations.Related: Crypto transactions must be easier. That's it. That's the headlineAnother solution is provided by HandCash, a popular wallet for Bitcoin SV (BSV), which does not resolve to a static address and supports contact lists. The problem is that the solution is centralized: Users must rely on the company and its infrastructure entirely. A similar setup across the BSV ecosystem, Paymail, lets users easily resolve to a new address every time without relying on a single centralized system. However, just like with email, Paymail relies on whichever server hosts your domain, with the only option for censorship-resistance being hosting your own server. Also, there is no universal contact list system. Both of these more user-friendly solutions underscore the unfortunate direction toward centralization, as easy-to-use solutions are hard to make decentralized.Once again, DASH is focused on providing the most elegant solution to the usability problem — building a decentralized application layer that, among other things, offers both usernames and contact lists on the protocol level in an intuitive, user-friendly, completely decentralized form. However, this years-in-the-making solution is still on testnet, and it remains to be seen if a wide public release will happen in time to impact the trend of mass adoption toward centralized services.Of course, the real risk isn’t that cryptocurrency ease-of-use solutions will struggle or fail to take hold. The greater risk is that fully custodial solutions will simply win out, returning us to the same old financial system we sought to escape from, only (allegedly) backed by crypto.We’re already seeing examples of this, from incentivized blogging platform Publish0x encouraging withdrawals directly to centralized exchanges in order to avoid high Ethereum fees to United States fast food giant Chipotle giving away Bitcoin exclusively to exchange accounts. Then there are the forays into crypto that payment giants like PayPal and Visa have made. If we’re not careful, in the future we could be spending our cryptocurrency through the exact same companies and services we used for our fiat currency, still at the mercy of the same players we sought freedom from in the first place.We’re at a crossroads: Create ease of use in a decentralized way or let mainstream adoption power the death of decentralization. The challenge is formidable, but the stakes are too high to simply concede. Is cryptocurrency up to the task?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

472,"Ether (ETH) is likely to outperform Bitcoin (BTC), at least in the short term, said veteran trader Scott Melker in an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph. Melker sees this period of Bitcoin’s price consolidation as particularly bullish for the second-largest cryptocurrency, which recently reached new all-time highs. Melker sees Ether’s outstanding performance as the main catalyst of the recent altcoin market bull run.He also revealed he has been largely switching his dollar-cost averaging strategy from Bitcoin to Ether in the last few months, in order to take advantage of Ethereum’s “tremendous upside potential.”According to Melker, Ether could reach the $10,000 price target by the end of 2021.To find out about Melker’s outlook on Ether, XRP and other large-cap altcoins, watch the full interview on our YouTube channel and don’t forget to subscribe!"
473,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has surpassed $61,000 on April 10 for the first time in nearly a month. Following the breakout, traders are starting to look at new levels of resistance and support in the short-term as optimism returns to the market.In the near term, besides the all-time high at around $61,800, there are three key Bitcoin price levels to observe: $61,188, $58,387 and $53,000.As long as the price of Bitcoin stays above $58,387 and keeps attempting to break out above $61,188, it would likely see a new record high in the foreseeable future.If Bitcoin breaks out to a new record high, traders also anticipate the altcoin market to pullback slightly for the time being, at least until BTC starts to stagnate after reaching a new high.According to the pseudonymous trader ""Rekt capital,"" the key for Bitcoin to cleanly reach a new all-time high in the coming days is to solidify $58,000 as a support area.The $58,000 level is an important area because it marks the peak of the initial BTC rally to the $60,000 resistance level in mid-February, as shown in the graph below.In technical analysis, when the price of an asset stabilizes above the previous peak, it is considered to be a very bullish sign.The trader noted:Raoul Pal, the CEO of Global Macro Investor, emphasized that the macro view of Bitcoin remains positive.Pal emphasized that Bitcoin broke out of a three-month range, which indicates that BTC's technical momentum is starting to regain steam. He said:A cryptocurrency derivatives trader ""Cactus"" also added that on-chain analytics are stronger than ever, considering that large BTC exchange outflows indicate accumulation among high-net-worth investors.$BTC / USD

Seeing some huge bullish momentum for BTC...

- On-chain analytics are stronger than ever
- We are seeing biggest exchange outflow's ever
- Previous monthly close is now support
- Highest weekly close ever likely to be printed pic.twitter.com/zovWNVrKuSMeanwhile, other traders are expecting the altcoin market to take a breather if Bitcoin enters price discovery once again.Kaleo, a well-known pseudonymous trader, said that there is a high chance altcoins do not rally nearly as much as expected when the volume is sucked up by Bitcoin.The trader explained:In the short term, Bitcoin would likely outperform altcoins if it continues to rally, and the momentum would only shift to altcoins once BTC consolidates as it finds a new range after breaking new highs.

474,"The debate around the environmental impact of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem is heating up once again as academics have provided a fresh dose of perspective on the subject. In an opinion piece written by Noah Smith, a former assistant finance professor turned columnist, took aim at the Bitcoin (BTC) mining industry in March, suggesting that the constantly growing energy consumption of the network is simply unsustainable. Smith’s belief is that more countries will clamp down on Bitcoin mining as they use more power, given that the increasing price of BTC is always matched by rising hash rates.While Coin Metrics founder Nic Carter has rebutted some of the points raised in Smith’s column, there still seems to be divided opinion around the amount of energy that Bitcoin mining draws, the sources of this energy and the carbon footprint that the industry has on the planet.The mining industry is arguably inclined to downplay the extent of its resource-intensive work, and some industry insiders have suggested that talk of Bitcoin’s environmental impact is a non-issue and that data suggests a large share of hash power draws energy from renewable sources. Nevertheless, environmental advocates have aimed their sights at the industry in return, which has created a seemingly never-ending debate on the subject.Cointelegraph has spoken with several academics in this area to gain an alternative view on the matter, for example, those behind the Cambridge Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, which has become a trusted point of reference for the estimated power consumption of the Bitcoin network, albeit with some self-confessed limitations.Furthermore, Aalborg University Ph.D. fellow Susanne Köhler and associate professor Massimo Pizzol co-authored a study titled “Life Cycle Assessment of Bitcoin Mining” that gives some data-driven assumptions about the environmental impact of the industry.In an interview with Cointelegraph, Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance crypto asset and blockchain lead Anton Dek unpacked the history of the CBEC and the methodology used to produce the energy consumption estimates of its Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index.The Cambridge research associate said the team had observed that other models that were looking to create accurate estimates of the Bitcoin network’s energy usage had used a top-down approach, using data such as the amount miners spend on electricity as an example.The CBECI methodology is a “bottom-up approach” that uses data on the available mining hardware to create a lower and an upper bound estimate of the Bitcoin network’s energy consumption. Dek explained that the information is: “Based on assumptions from objective figures like hash rate.” He further added: “These different machines all have known efficiencies, joules of energy they expend to solve hashes. Based on these assumptions, we built the index.”The index provides an estimated power consumption range, with its current theoretical lower bound annualized electricity consumption at 43.32 terawatt-hours to the theoretical upper bound at 476.18 TWh. The estimate of Bitcoin’s current consumption is based on the assumption that miners use a mix of profitable hardware.While the CBEC has not made any models on the breakdown of the energy sources powering the Bitcoin network, the original intention for the creation of the CBECI index was to provide a carbon emission model. Dek said that his team is still working on that model, which he hopes to see go live later this year.The CBECI website also provides a global mining map that essentially gives a breakdown of how the Bitcoin mining network is distributed around the world. The map provides country-by-country hash rates, while China’s 12 provinces are also accounted for, given that more than half of the world’s Bitcoin hash rate is situated in the country.The breakdown of hash rate locations is derived from data provided by mining pools BTC.com, Poolin and ViaBTC, which contribute to 37% of the overall Bitcoin hash rate. Dek also noted that their data set is now over one year old but still allows researchers to make some accurate assumptions about the energy sources used by miners in specific countries or regions.That regional view of China also gives a glimpse of the energy mix that miners are using in different regions. The team hasn’t released that specific data visualization yet because it believes that the current 37% hash rate, which is the basis of their data, is not representative enough to make accurate estimates of the network’s carbon footprint. Dek added: “If we look at the energy mix of every region, and then each country, we’ll be able to assume the energy mix and then we’ll be able to more accurately estimate the carbon emission factor.”Nevertheless, Dek said that other researchers have arrived at estimates by taking the total annual power consumption of the Bitcoin network, around 130 terawatts-hour, and multiplying that by the average carbon emission factor (~0.5kilograms/carbon dioxide per kWh produced). The Cambridge researcher suggested that such an estimate may not be representative, given some assumptions that can be drawn from regional location data of mining activity:Dek pointed to the widely reported presence of mining facilities in the region that operate on electricity produced by hydroelectric dams in Sichuan. The CBECI data also reflects the increase in the hash rate in the region during the wet season, where excessive rains lead to an abundance of power generated by swollen dams. According to him, Sichuan’s estimated share of global hash power: “In April (2020) it’s 9.66%, in September 2019 it was 37%.”Köhler and Pizzol’s 2019 “Life Cycle Assessment of Bitcoin Mining” study provides an estimate of Bitcoin’s environmental impact using a well-established life-cycle assessment methodology. It estimated that the Bitcoin network consumed 31.29 TWh with a carbon footprint of 17.29 metric tons of CO2 equivalent in 2018 using data, information and methodology from previous studies on the subject.In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Köhler noted that their study shows that the impact of new capacity being added to the Bitcoin mining network decreases based on two assumptions. The first is that equipment becomes more efficient, which was proven to be true some two years later. The second assumption — that miners would move to regions with more renewable energy sources — did not quite happen as expected: “Even if mining is more efficient, there is much more mining done, and this means a larger impact.” She added further:As Köhler explained, their initial assumption has been debunked to a certain extent, as the sheer growth of the Bitcoin network’s hash rate has led to higher electricity usage and, therefore, more of an effect on the environment.Nevertheless, the Aalborg Ph.D. fellow concedes that arriving at an accurate estimate of the energy consumption of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem as well as its carbon footprint is a tall order. This is due to a number of factors, including the exact location and shares of miners, mining equipment being used and the accuracy of data from various sources.Another fascinating point raised by Dek is the interest that his department has received from different players in the cryptocurrency industry. Private firms and fund managers have enquired about data or services that can accurately prove how “green” a Bitcoin is, which is determined by whether or not it was mined using a renewable energy source:Dek also said that some miners are looking for ways to prove that they used green energy to mine their BTC. This could potentially create a market for “green Bitcoin” being sold at a premium, which could motivate miners to switch to green energy sources. Meanwhile, Köhler believes that many miners are primarily focused on profit margins and that cheap electricity, however it is produced, will override the allure of green energy sources if they aren’t as affordable:Dek shared these sentiments, saying that miners are typically rational about their business decisions. If there is a cheaper energy source, they’re likely to use it despite how that energy is being created or what incentives are being offered to use green energy sources: “I find that miners, especially big Bitcoin miners, are rational economic players. I think they’ll continue to act this way — if there’s a cheaper option, they will switch, and if not, they’ll stay.”Data is keyAs Köhler aptly summed up, more access to data from industry players could well provide the answers to a debate that is likely to continue for many more years: “Better data and more transparency from the mining industry would allow for better models and less speculations — within the crypto space and in the public,” she added further:Dek agreed with the assessment regarding the debate on Bitcoin’s environmental impact due to the distributed nature of the network, even when more data and tools become available. He also paints a stark reminder that Bitcoin’s protocol was designed this way for a reason: “Bitcoin has to be inefficient by design. If it’s very efficient, it would be very cheap to perform attacks on the network.”"
475,"Bitcoin (BTC) returned to $60,000 on April 10 as a bout of long overdue volatility hit the market in line with analysts' expectations.Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed a sudden push allowing BTC/USD to exit the $50,000 corridor overnight on Friday.The move had been weeks in the making — a convincing attack on $60,000 resistance, the last before all-time highs, had previously failed to materialize before.Bitcoin is about to Bitcoin. ⤴️ $BTC pic.twitter.com/8IY19LdtmBNow seemend different, however, with Bitcoin going on to pass $61,000 before consolidating at around $60,650 at the time of writing.""$163,745,606 of Bitcoin shorts liquidated in an hour,"" quant analyst Lex Moskovski noted on Twitter as the market turned.The picture was indeed a surprising one for traders who had spent weeks in a sideways market which occasionally tapped multi-week lows.The impetus behind the latest rise was still to become clear on Saturday, as was the true extent of its staying power given the importance of $60,000 as a psychological support level to capture.One notable change was funding rates across exchanges, which had decreased markedly in previous days, translating to reduced friction at and above $60,000 before spiking as the market rose higher.Some had nonetheless called for an optimistic take on the market setup this week. Among them was Filbfilb, co-founder of trading suite Decentrader, who stated that Bitcoin at $58,000 had a lot in common technically with Bitcoin at $20,000.""I'm still very bullish above 58K. Structure the same as at 20K IMO; a lot of other market nuances similar too in orderflow and depth,"" he told subscribers of his Telegram trading channel on Friday.A day earlier, fellow Decentrader analyst Philip Swift had voiced similar leanings, using the upcoming cross of two important moving averages to suggest that BTC/USD had further to run.These were the 111-day and 350-day moving averages, the latter multiplied by two, together known as a Pi Cycle.""My current near-term market outlook for Bitcoin is neutral-bullish, so my personal view is that there is a good probability this is not the market cycle top for Bitcoin when the Pi Cycle Indicator moving averages cross in a few day’s time,"" Swift wrote in a market update.Others agreed but were slightly more cautious, including statistician Willy Woo, who on Friday warned that Bitcoin could be finishing the first of a ""double top"" price construction.""Volatility is visibly lower this cycle,"" he summarized, adding that once cleared, the $1 trillion market cap level — corresponding to a Bitcoin price of around $53,600 — would ""unlikely"" be broken again."
476,"Hong Kong tech company Meitu revealed on April 8 that it had added $10 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) to its holdings which were purchased at an average rate of $57,000 per coin. After the latest purchase, Meitu’s total cryptocurrency portfolio consists of $49.5 million worth of Bitcoin and $50.5 million worth of Ether (ETH). This acquisition shows that institutional investors are confident that the rally in Bitcoin is still in its early stages.Tom Jessop, Fidelity’s head of the crypto division, believes that Bitcoin has reached a tipping point and that traditional finance companies will continue to adopt cryptocurrency aggressively in the next few years. Jessop believes the massive monetary stimulus from governments and central banks has accelerated institutional adoption and this is a trend that could extend for at least another year.It is not only institutional investors who are rushing into cryptocurrencies. Data shows that the number of retail investors trading cryptocurrency has also increased. Popular trading app Robinhood reported on April 8 that crypto trading on its platform surged to 9.5 million users in Q1 2021, a six-fold increase over Q4 2020.While crypto adoption is on the rise, some legacy finance firms are still taking an anti-crypto approach. HSBC has reportedly blacklisted MicroStrategy stock and will not allow customers on its HSBC InvestDirect platform to buy shares from the company.Will Bitcoin and major altcoins extend their uptrend and attract more buyers or will they enter a corrective phase? Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.The bears could not capitalize on Bitcoin’s break below the 20-day exponential moving average ($57,043) on April 7. Their failure to break the 50-day simple moving average ($54,572) support could have attracted buying from the aggressive bulls, resulting in the rebound on April 8.However, today's Doji candlestick suggests the bulls are struggling to sustain the momentum at higher levels.The BTC/USDT pair has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern that will complete on a breakout and close above $60,000. This bullish setup has a target objective at $69,540. If the bulls sustain the momentum and clear this hurdle, the uptrend may reach the next target at $79,566.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level, the bears will once again try to break the critical support at the 50-day SMA. If they succeed, the selling could intensify as short-term traders may rush to the exit. That could pull the pair down to $50,460.02 and then $43,006.77.Ether’s (ETH) drop on April 7 was arrested at the 20-day EMA ($1,933), which shows the bulls are accumulating on dips. The price rebounded sharply on April 8 and rose above the resistance at $2,040.77.The bulls will now make one more attempt to climb above the all-time high at $2,150. If they manage to do that, the ETH/USDT pair could resume its uptrend and march toward the next target objective at $2,618.14.However, the bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price below the 20-day EMA. If that happens, several aggressive bulls may get trapped. That could intensify the selling, resulting in a drop to the trendline. A break below this support will suggest a change in trend.Binance Coin (BNB) continues to be in a strong uptrend. The bulls flipped the $348.69 level to support on April 7 and followed that up with a breakout to a new all-time high on April 8. This shows a strong appetite from the bulls.The upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) above 75 indicate that the bulls are in command. The next target objective on the upside is the $500 to $530 zone where the bears may mount a stiff resistance.On any correction, the first support to watch out for is the 20-day EMA ($334). A strong rebound off this support will suggest the sentiment remains bullish and traders are buying on dips.However, if the BNB/USDT pair dips below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bullish momentum is weakening.XRP made successive inside day candlestick formations on April 7 and April 8. The current price action is pointing to another inside-day candlestick pattern today. The drop in daily volatility shows the altcoin is still digesting the recent gains.This tightening of the intraday range usually ends with a strong breakout. If the uncertainty resolves to the upside and the bulls drive the price above $1.11, the XRP/USDT pair could start the next leg of the rally that could take it to $1.34 and then $1.66.Alternatively, if the indecision resolves to the downside, it will suggest that supply exceeds demand and traders have dumped their positions. If that happens, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.72). A break below this level could pull the price down to $0.65.Cardano (ADA) dipped below the 20-day EMA ($1.18) on April 7 but the bulls did not allow the price to slip below the 50-day SMA ($1.16). This shows the bulls are defending the moving averages aggressively.The buyers will now try to push the price above $1.33. If they manage to do that, the ADA/USDT pair could rise to $1.48. This is an important level to watch out for because the pair has returned from it on two previous occasions.If the price again reverses direction from $1.48, it will suggest that the range-bound action may continue for a few more days. On the other hand, if the bulls can drive the price above $1.48, the pair could resume the uptrend toward the next target objective at $2.A break below the moving averages will be the first sign of weakness and that could result in a drop to the $1.02 support. If this level breaks down, the bears could start a deeper correction to $0.80.Polkadot (DOT) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($38.68) on April 7, indicating buying on dips. The bulls will now try to push the price above the overhead resistance at $42.28.If they succeed, the DOT/USDT pair will retest the all-time high at $46.80. A breakout and close above this level could start the next leg of the rally that has a target objective at $53.50 and then $57.The gradually upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the bulls have the upper hand.However, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the moving averages, it will indicate that traders are closing their positions on rallies. That could result in a fall to $32.50 and then $26.50.The bulls successfully held the $27.97 support on April 7, which is a positive sign as it shows accumulation on dips. Uniswap (UNI) bounced back above the 20-day EMA ($29.65) on April 8 and the buyers will now try to push the price above $32.50.If they succeed, the UNI/USDT pair could rally to the $35.20 to $36.80 overhead resistance zone. The bears are likely to defend this zone aggressively. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level, the bears will make one more attempt to pull the price below the $27.97 to $25.50 support zone. If they manage to do that, the pair could start a deeper correction to $20.74.Litecoin (LTC) successfully completed the retest of the breakout level from the symmetrical triangle on April 7. That was followed by a rebound on April 8, but the bulls are struggling to pick up momentum.This shows hesitation to buy at higher levels. If the bulls do not overcome the hurdle at $246.96 within the next few days, the possibility of a break below the 20-day EMA ($207) increases. In such a case, the LTC/USDT pair could drop to the support line.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls sustain the momentum and propel the price above $246.96, the pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $307.42. The gradually rising 20-day EMA and the RSI above 59 suggest a minor advantage to the bulls.Chainlink’s (LINK) sharp reversal on April 7 could not break below the 20-day EMA ($30.29). This shows the sentiment remains positive and the bulls are buying on dips. The rebound on April 8 rose above the $32 resistance but the bulls are struggling to build on this strength today.If the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages, it will suggest that supply exceeds demand at higher levels. That could pull the price down to the critical support at $24.On the other hand, if the bulls again defend the 20-day EMA, the LINK/USDT pair could rise to the all-time high at $36.93. A breakout and close above this resistance will suggest the bulls have absorbed the supply and that may indicate the start of the next leg of the uptrend.However, if the price again turns down from $36.93, the pair could extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.After the large range day on April 7, THETA made an inside day candlestick pattern on April 8 and has followed it up with another one today. This shows indecision among the bulls and the bears about the next directional move. While the bears are defending the overhead resistance, the bulls are buying on every minor dip.The upsloping 20-day EMA ($11.33) and the RSI above 62 suggest a minor advantage to the bulls. The buyers will have to clear the hurdle at $14 to signal the start of the next leg of the uptrend. If they manage to do that, the THETA/USDT pair could rally to $17.65 and then $22.50.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, it will be the first sign of a possible change in sentiment. It will suggest that the bulls are no longer buying the dips to the 20-day EMA. The next critical support to watch will be $10.35. If this level is taken out, a deeper correction to the 50-day SMA may start.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

477,"We’re living today “amidst an explosion of risk related to fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing, and data privacy,” said United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in February — and she specifically cited cryptocurrencies as a “tool to finance terrorism.”Yellen appeared to be flagging an important new turn in the war against terror, and it begged some questions: Is crypto in the hands of terrorists a real, present danger to governments and society? If so, should the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry be worried?Recent evidence suggests that crypto’s role as an enabler of terrorism globally remains relatively minor. “Cryptocurrencies have been used in several terror finance cases, but it has not yet become a primary means of terror financing,” Matthew Levitt, director of the Jeanette and Eli Reinhard Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told Cointelegraph.Gina Pieters, assistant teaching professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Chicago, told Cointelegraph: “Her [Yellen’s] statement is factually true — it is a tool.” But Yellen also chose her words carefully. “She did not say it was a major tool — she specifically said it was a growing one. And that is also true, as cryptocurrencies grow they will be used in more criminal activities.”Dave Jevans, CEO of CipherTrace, expressed some unease about the treasury secretary’s remarks. “If leaders like Janet Yellen set a fearful attitude toward cryptocurrencies associated with criminality, regulators could take harsh action to impose more strict rules on cryptocurrency transactions that may not be warranted,” he told Cointelegraph, adding: “Such action, like the blanket cryptocurrency ban in India, would greatly inhibit mass adoption and innovation in the space.”“I think she wanted to raise the issue and put it on people’s radar,” remarked Levitt, who added that misuse of cryptocurrencies looms as more of a geopolitical concern with regard to states trying to evade Western political sanctions — like Russia, Iran or Venezuela — than with would-be terrorists.Still, it doesn’t take much money to finance a terrorist act, so any help that Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies provide to terrorist groups that are trying to obscure their funding sources remains a worry. For that reason, Jesse Spiro, chief of government affairs at Chainalysis, told Cointelegraph that Yellen wasn’t exactly exaggerating the threat. That said, “Terrorism financing represents an incredibly small portion of cryptocurrency transactions.” In 2020, Chainalysis traced just 37.35 Bitcoin that went toward terrorism financing, or “a mere 0.00324 per cent of the overall illicit activity,” he said.In August 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice seized the cryptocurrency accounts of three Middle East-based terrorist financing operations. This was the “largest ever seizure of terrorist organizations’ cryptocurrency accounts,” according to the DoJ. “It is a fact that jihadi groups, led by ISIS and Al-Qaeda, have been using cryptocurrency for years,” Steven Stalinsky, executive director at the Middle East Media Research Institute, told Cointelegraph. “Following the fall of ISIS’s caliphate, it quickly became even more important for them.”In its daily monitoring of jihadi groups online, MEMRI sees groups and individuals discussing the use of different cryptocurrencies, “But this use has not recently developed to the extreme proportions that it could have and still might,” said Stalinsky. “Any arrests and public news of jihadis using cryptocurrency has so far led to the companies acting to shut down these and related accounts, and this seems to be creating a balance to curb the problem.”A 2019 Rand Corporation study noted that “No current cryptocurrency can address all of the terrorist organizations’ financial needs” — which include anonymity, usability, security, reliability and acceptance — but cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, “particularly with improved usability, could be appealing to use in fundraising, and some evidence is emerging that terrorist organizations might be using cryptocurrencies for this purpose.” It is critical for such groups to be able to receive money from donors, beyond the gaze of governments.In an intelligence brief, Chainalysis noted that advertisements and messages from BitcoinTransfer, a Syrian-based cryptocurrency exchange that has been publicly cited as being run by jihadis, “often emphasize security and anonymity, as well as its ability to facilitate transfers from European countries without submitting identification documents or ‘exposing your friend or family to danger.’”Bitcoin, the world’s oldest and largest blockchain network, isn’t really anonymous, as Al-Qaeda and affiliated terrorist groups discovered with the DoJ’s August 2020 takedown. Internal Revenue Service, Homeland Security Investigations and Federal Bureau of Investigation agents tracked and seized all 150 crypto accounts that laundered funds to and from the al-Qassam Brigades’ accounts, for instance. The group had advertised that its Bitcoin donations were untraceable and would be used for militant activities.Perhaps as a result of the disruption to the three cyber-enabled jihadi campaigns, reports have surfaced recently that terrorist groups are moving from BTC to other cryptocurrencies, including privacy coins like Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC), that are more difficult to trace.“BTC has always been the most popular and is the most well known,” Stalinsky told Cointelegraph, but others, including Monero and Zcash, are also being used by terror groups. Jevans added:Still, privacy coins, even if they are better at obfuscating transactions, “haven’t been adopted to the extent that one may expect,” Spiro told Cointelegraph. This is mainly because they lack liquidity. In 2020, several crypto exchanges, under pressure from regulators, began delisting privacy coins, so accessibility has become an issue for aspiring terrorists. “Cryptocurrency is only useful if you can buy and sell goods and services or cash out into fiat, and that is much more difficult with privacy coins,” explained Spiro.If one accepts that crypto use isn’t exploding among terrorist groups, is it at least growing? “Cryptocurrency adoption is growing everywhere, including among domestic and international terrorist groups,” answered Jevans, while Spiro highlighted: “We have seen evidence of them using cryptocurrency to pay for online infrastructure that facilitates recruitment and propaganda.”The MEMRI Domestic Terrorism Threat Monitor, which focuses on terrorist groups in the U.S. and other Western countries, has seen an upsurge in the use of and references to cryptocurrencies — “very much like what happened with jihadis a few years ago,” said Stalinsky. He added:Stalinsky continued: “After the events of January 6, when the U.S. Capitol building was stormed by extremist groups, there is more pressure to go after these groups’ fundraising online. A year ago it was common to see many of these individuals, groups, and organizations openly using mainstream banking platforms, from major credit card companies to regular banks, Apple Pay, PayPal, and other platforms.”But they have now been largely forced off these platforms, he added, and need to raise funds — “whether for recruitment, solicitation of support, or sales of merchandise such as books and clothing lines — through cryptocurrency wallets, which they are all using and promoting.” Bitcoin remains the favored cryptocurrency among these groups, though Monero is also popular, he said.When asked about the particular attraction that cryptocurrencies hold for terrorists, Pieters answered: “It is the ability to move a large value of funds without physical transportation, along with the relative speed and low risk compared to other digital alternatives.”Should the blockchain industry itself be worried about such nefarious uses of cryptocurrencies? After all, it could further blacken the industry’s image, undoing progress toward bringing blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies into the economic and societal mainstream. According to Spiro:Cryptocurrencies are widely thought to be anonymous and untraceable, but they actually “operate on public, transparent blockchains,” Spiro continued. “We’ve found that once lawmakers, regulators, and law enforcement agencies understand this, they find that crypto can actually help, not harm, their missions to weed out illicit activity.”Antonio Fatás, professor of economics at INSEAD, told Cointelegraph that in recent decades, many Western nations have put in place strict regulations to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. “Cryptocurrencies have been left out of these regulations partly because they were small, partly because it is not always easy to implement this regulation to decentralized forms of money.” But it is now clear that this exclusion will not be allowed much longer, said Fatás. Industry players will need to comply.All in all, any funds that go toward funding terrorism on a blockchain network should be of concern to government and society, as well as the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, even if the gross amounts still aren’t large.There is a silver lining in all this, though. “The good news is that cryptocurrency is inherently transparent,” said Spiro, whose firm, Chainalysis, assisted the DoJ in disrupting the previously mentioned Middle Eastern terror-financing operations in August 2020. “With the right tools, law enforcement can trace that activity,” he concluded."

While it is true that Bitcoin (BTC) could theoretically crash by the tens of thousands of dollars necessary to take it to zero, one Reddit user has pledged their intention to buy up the blood.On the r/Bitcoin subreddit yesterday, Reddit user u/Substantial-Ad-5012 posted a thread titled: “Bitcoin will never go to zero in my lifetime.” Why? “Because I am willing and able to buy all the bitcoin ever mined at 1 cent each,” the user explained, adding:CoingGecko estimates that the total number of Bitcoins mined since the genesis block is around 18,677,925. In the unlikely event that Bitcoin does in fact drop to $0.01 USD, it would cost a mere $187,000 to pick up every coin in circulation — not accounting for the fact that some believe 20% of all Bitcoin are inaccessible.Over the years, many old-world financial personalities have forecast Bitcoin's eventual demise, including gold evangelist Peter Schiff. In 2020, Jim Rogers, a notable investor, said he expects a future price of $0 for BTC. In 2018, Bill Harris, the former CEO of PayPal, also predicted a $0 price tag. Additionally, Distributed Lab CEO Pavel Kravchenko said Bitcoin could become worthless, although his stance was contingent on certain conditions.U/Substantial-Ad-5012 is not the only one ready to buy Bitcoin either, in the event of a dramatic price spiral. Entrepreneur Alistair Milne has also expressed similar intentions in the past, as demonstrated by his 18.52 million BTC buy order last year. In 2020, after the March crypto market crash, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao also tweeted about the asset not hitting zero, due to his intent to buy before then.  Still worried about #btc going to 0?

Don't! So long as I have a penny left, it won't happen.Other factors that could lead to total price depreciation for Bitcoin include attacks on the global power grid or the destruction of all technology on Earth. The asset does have some safeguards in place in the event of a cataclysmic disaster, however, including a satellite-based system that maintains Bitcoin’s blockchain.Bitcoin is trading near $58,000 at time of publication.

479,"Buying MicroStrategy stock is reportedly no longer possible for HSBC customers on the bank’s online trading platform — HSBC InvestDirect, or HIDC.According to a supposed message from the bank to its customers, HSBC has directed users that already own MicroStrategy stock not to buy additional shares.Twitter user Camiam claimed to have received such a message from the banking giant on March 29:Hey @michael_saylor , you may want to ask your legal team if what @HSBC_CA is doing here is legal. It sure does not sound like it is! They wont allow us to buy @MicroStrategy . They maybe naked short... pic.twitter.com/GWSpt5t9eHThe MSTR blacklisting appears to be part of the bank’s amended user policy prohibiting users from interacting with cryptocurrencies, with an excerpt from the message reading:According to the alleged HSBC communique, MicroStrategy is a virtual currency product, hence the reason for the blacklisting.MicroStrategy, a business intelligence and software firm, has pioneered Bitcoin (BTC) adoption among publicly listed companies in the United States.Since first adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet back in August 2020, the Fortune 500 company now holds over 90,000 BTC, currently valued at about $5.26 billion.The blacklisting of MSTR is only the latest in HSBC’s recent anti-crypto moves. Earlier in the year, the world’s sixth-largest bank also reportedly blocked customers from moving profits from crypto exchanges to their bank accounts.Despite banning users from buying MicroStrategy stock, reports of similar prohibitions have yet to emerge for other companies with Bitcoin investment interests.Indeed, companies with significant Bitcoin investments such as Tesla, Hut 8 Mining and Square, to mention a few, are still listed on the HIDC trading catalog.HSBC becomes the latest bank to react negatively to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin involvement. Back in December 2020, Citibank downgraded MSTR over the company’s “disproportionate” focus on the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.MicroStrategy's Bitcoin investment initially seem to trigger a positive run for the company's stock price, reaching a 21-year high above $1,200 back in early February. MSTR has since struggled and is now almost 50% down from its 2021 peak.Neither HSBC nor MicroStrategy immediately replied to Cointelegraph’s request for comments."
480,"After rallying more than 100% in 2021, Bitcoin (BTC) seems to be struggling to turn the $60,000 level into support. After all, what is so special about this magic round number and its accompanying $1 trillion market capitalization?Gold's $11 trillion market cap might hold the answer, as Bitcoin's current trading volume and the amount held by institutional investors seem to match 10% of the precious metal's numbers.Technical indicators and derivatives data provide interesting short-term insights. But to analyze cryptocurrencies in a broader context, one should focus on market capitalization, precious metals and global wealth.Keep in mind that the 18.67 million current BTC circulating supply is 11.2% more than existed in December 2017. Therefore, using unitary prices for longer-term comparisons can be misleading.The $1.1 trillion valuation translates into a 250% increase from December 2017 peak market capitalization at $327 billion. So because of the additional issuing, that number differs from the 200% increase of the $20,000 nominal tag versus the current $60,000.Another essential metric, gold, the precious metal, has always been a proxy for the leading cryptocurrency. Although Bitcoin has multiple use cases, store of value has always been its flagship feature while the debate behind its commodity-like features and currency persists.Regardless, as the United States expanded its monetary base over the past twelve months by 53% to an astonishing $5.25 trillion, the number of institutional investors seeking Bitcoin as a safe haven for inflation skyrocketed.Legendary investors Ray Dalio and Paul Tudor Jones both compared Bitcoin's unique features with gold, triggering even more companies, insurers, and fund managers' attention.Therefore, the comparison with gold's market capitalization became even more relevant.According to the above data, BTC's current $1 trillion market capitalization translates to roughly 10% of gold's, worth $11 trillion. To assess how those markets compare, one should compare their volume traded, ETF and ETN markets, in addition to institutional holdings.Meanwhile, there's $183 billion daily liquidity for gold, including registered over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, in addition to regulated futures markets and gold exchange-traded products.At the same time, the daily volume for BTC is approximately $15.9 billion. Exchange-traded products such as Grayscale Bitcoin Fund (GBTC) add another $1.5 billion daily liquidity, according to CryptoCompare. Therefore, Bitcoin's $17.4 billion average daily volume can be compared to roughly 9.5% of gold.Bitcoin's multiple exchange-traded products such as Grayscale $GBTC and exchange-traded notes have been growing considerably. There are $58.7 billion assets under management, or AUM, locked in crypto exchange-traded products, according to CryptoCompare's March 2021 report.So with gold-backed ETF products amounting to $198.8 billion, Bitcoin's $58.7 billion AUM represents 29.5% of this amount.Nevertheless, a fair comparison needs to include physical holdings, the preferred instrument of governments and banks. Meanwhile, regulation for most fund managers requires BTC holdings to use exchange-listed products, causing the disparity.For instance, central banks and the IMF hold 35,197 tonnes of gold, which translates to $1.96 trillion. Gold.org estimates 44,384 tonnes are held by private investment, including ETF markets, and those are worth another $2.47 trillion. All of this adds up to $4.41 trillion in gold held by institutional investors.With Bitcoin, addresses holding 100 to 10,000 BTC own 48.9% of the supply, equivalent to $538 billion held by large investors.Considering institutions' gold holdings amount to $4.41 trillion, BTC displays a 12.2% equivalent indicator, thus supporting its current $1 trillion market capitalization.Yassine Elmandjra, a crypto asset analyst at Ark Invest, believes Bitcoin has the potential to surpass gold's $10-trillion market cap. As Bloomberg senior commodity strategist, Mike McGlone puts it:McGlone goes further, however, adding that ""adoption of the benchmark crypto as a global reserve asset has crossed the mainstream threshold,"" which could propel BTC price to as high as $400,000 in 2021. So to sum up, Bitcoin's average volume traded and large investors' holdings roughly match 10% of gold's markets. But while the $1 trillion market cap level may be a watershed moment for the next phase of Bitcoin adoption, BTC may remain pinned below $60,000 for quite some time, particularly as some analysts believe the price may only see a major surge toward the end of the year.

481,"The share price of Chinese Bitcoin mining company Ebang continues to fall, while the firm refutes claims made in a Hindenburg Research report that alleged it was pilfering American investors’ cash.The Hindenburg Research report, published on Tuesday, described Ebang as “simply the latest chapter in the ‘China Hustle’ disguised as a Bitcoin mining play.” The report alleges that Ebang raised hundreds of millions of dollars through public offerings in the United States under the guise of operating as a Bitcoin (BTC) mining company.The money raised in the funding rounds was reportedly funneled out of the company in “a series of opaque deals with insiders and questionable counterparties.” Ebang describes itself as a “leading Bitcoin mining machine producer,” yet according to Hindenburg’s research, the firm hasn’t released a new product since 2019, and its sales have dwindled steadily since.Ebang, along with Canaan Creative, is one of only two Chinese Bitcoin mining companies publicly traded on U.S. stock markets. The share price of NASDAQ: EBON has fallen 20% since the start of the week. After trading at $6.35 on Monday, the share price had dropped to $5.00 by Tuesday’s close, equating to 21% losses. The stock has since bounced back to $5.03, leaving weekly losses in excess of 20%.The Hindenburg report alleges that Ebang saw the writing on the wall for its mining rig business, which was said to produce inferior machines to local competitors. The company is said to have then spun itself into a cryptocurrency exchange, dubbed Ebonex. The initial announcement apparently boosted the EBON market cap up to $922 million.Hindenburg researchers claim to have found out that the Ebonex exchange was purchased from a crypto exchange service provider called Blue Helix, which offers “out-of-the-box” exchanges for no money upfront.After launching just months ago, Ebonex miraculously soared to record some of the highest trade volumes in the world, despite having no online presence whatsoever. Its allegedly fictitious figures are not recorded on crypto market tracker websites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko, and Hindenburg refers to the whole affair as “yet another cautionary tale for inexperienced retail investors.”The report prompted an official response from Ebang International Holdings Inc, which claimed the review was full of speculation and unsupported claims. The announcement stated that Ebang would examine the claims made by Hindenburg and take the necessary steps to protect its investors.“Based on the review by the Company’s management team, we believe that the Hindenburg Report contain many errors, unsupported speculations and inaccurate interpretations of events,” stated the announcement.It added, “The Board, together with its Audit Committee, intends to further review and examine the allegations and misinformation therein and will take whatever necessary and appropriate actions may be required to protect the interest of its shareholders.”"
482,"A long-forgotten Bitcoin (BTC) hard fork has surged almost 200% in a week — simply because traders are buying the wrong altcoin.Bitcoin Gold (BTG), a relic from the 2017 forking season, traded at $113 on Friday — the highest price since February 2018 — after 30% daily gains as trading volumes topped $250 million. A curious contrast to an otherwise lackluster cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin Gold’s success appears to be not wholly genuine — but also not the fault of its holders or developers.As Cointelegraph reported on Tuesday, a new Bitcoin fund from Brazillian investment bank BTG Pactual moved a step closer to launching this week after teaming up with the Winklevoss twins’ Gemini exchange for custody management.While having nothing to do with Bitcoin Gold, the biggest Brazilian investment bank does share the altcoin’s ticker — and the coincidence was good enough for hungry buyers.After the Gemini news broke, Bitcoin Gold saw a flurry of demand, which, at the time of writing, shows no sign of abating. This, reactions argued, showed that the cryptocurrency industry was still very much in its nascent phase.“We’re so early that people buy Bitcoin Gold BTG, because there is a new fund called BTG Pactual,” podcast host Anita Posch warned Twitter users.By contrast, Bitcoin Gold announcing an actual partnership in late March did hardly anything for it price action.Bitcoin Gold came about as one of the multiple hard forks of Bitcoin in 2017, the year that also spawned Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) and others.Unlike their parent, the forks have achieved only limited success. As Cointelegraph recently reported, despite the broad uptick sweeping through altcoins, BCH, for example, continues to lose value in BTC terms.Some of their proponents have adopted an aggressive marketing stance that positions the fork as Bitcoin itself, a misleading move that has likely also contributed to demand.Cointelegraph reiterates that buying Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Cash or any cryptocurrency with a ticker other than BTC means that one holds an altcoin, not Bitcoin itself."
483,"Hong Kong tech company Meitu has taken the total value of its cryptocurrency holdings to approximately $100 million after the firm disclosed the purchase of an additional $10 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) on Thursday.Meitu HK, the wholly-owned Hong Kong subsidiary of Meitu Inc (incorporated in the Cayman Islands), acquired 175.67798279 units of Bitcoin for a combined price of $10 million, implying a purchase price of around $57,000 per coin. The purchase was reportedly made using existing cash reserves, based on spot prices on the open market.Last month, Meitu racked up $90 million worth of cryptocurrency purchases split between Bitcoin and Ether (ETH). Following Thursday’s latest acquisition, the firm has now purchased $49.5 million worth of BTC and $50.5 million worth of ETH.The firm previously stated that it couldn’t have made its prior purchases without the help of United States-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. No mention of Coinbase was made in the latest disclosure, however, the exchange has been responsible for handling the investments of other corporate entities, such as MicroStrategy, in the past.The disclosure laid out the firm’s reasons for adding to its Bitcoin holdings, comparing the technology’s potential impact to that of the mobile internet:The disclosure notes Bitcoin’s utility as a store of value, a feature helped by its limited supply. Also mentioned are its portability and its position as a hedge against inflation caused by the aggressive money printing practices of central banks.“Some of these features potentially even render Bitcoin as a superior form to other alternative stores of value such as gold, precious stone and real estate. Being an alternative store of value, its price is primarily a function of future demand that is driven by consensus of investors and the general public,” states the disclosure statement.Publicly listed firms in China tread on choppy waters when making cryptocurrency investments. China recognizes cryptocurrencies as commodities but not as usable currencies. Their trade with fiat money is prohibited, but due to their commodity status, some have suggested cryptocurrencies could still be traded with each other in the same manner as other commodities in what remains a hazy situation in the far East."
484,"Real Vision co-founder and CEO Raoul Pal has sparked a spirited debate after predicting that Ether (ETH) and other coins with “network effects” will outperform Bitcoin (BTC) over time.Pal shared a chart of Ether’s price relative to BTC since Aug. 7, 2015 —  six years after Bitcoin was created — showing that “ETH has outperformed BTC by 250%.”Fascinating to see that since inception ETH has outperformed BTC by 250%. It only fell below its initial price in BTC for the first 5 months of its existence in 2015.

Let that put rest to the idea that all other tokens trend towards zero in BTC terms. pic.twitter.com/ulCpsjG8upAccording to TradingView’s Bittrex chart, ETH began trading for roughly 0.006 BTC on Aug. 10, 2015. It is currently sitting at 0.0359 BTC.Bitcoiners weren’t pleased with Pal’s interpretation of events, with Craig Wright antagonist, Arthur van Pelt, arguing Ether has outlived its early hype and that since the 2017 bull run, “it’s down 77% and on a long term decline. Cold hard facts.”In response, Raoul remarked: “Since this halving cycle started, it’s up over 100%. Cold hard facts.”Fund strategist and Bitcoin advocate Brad Mills took issue with the comparison itself, asserting the logic underpinning the analysis is flawed, as it does not offer a comparison between the currencies since their respective beginnings.On-chain analyst Willy Woo suggested that Ether’s price rise was simply the initial hype cycle playing out and that ETH has little potential for future price increases. The first four-year cycle of any coin, he explained, “is its highest climber,” adding that ETH will likely just oscillate around Bitcoin’s price from here on, and it’s time to move on from it:There’s more riding on this debate about ETH’s rise in BTC terms than just pride. In November last year, What Bitcoin Did podcaster Peter McCormack challenged Pal to a bet, taking the position that BTC will be up against ETH after one year. Pal took the other side and stated ETH will rise closer to Bitcoin’s price after one year — with the loser having to fly the winner over for drinks in either London or the Caymen Islands.Pal didn’t let the opportunity slip to also call a potential early victory:Patience young grasshopper"
485,"Blockchain security company Beosin has been the focus of a major scandal after its chief marketing officer, Gao Ziyang, was taken into custody and charged with embezzlement of state-owned assets. He is alleged to have been using government funds to unsuccessfully short Bitcoin (BTC), resulting in a massive liquidation of over 300 million renminbi, or $45 million.Beosin, also known as Lianan Tech, had a working relationship with Chinese authorities and was helping them investigate fraudulent fundraising schemes. After the seizure of funds back in 2020, Beosin was tasked with storing and selling the assets, to be later returned to the state treasury. Instead of selling the assets, Gao allegedly opened a short position in late August, hoping to increase the size of the positions for personal gain. At the time, BTC was trading around $12,000.Authorities say that records obtained from OKEx show the position began using 10x leverage before increasing to 100x and eventually ended up in liquidation. They began to ask about the whereabouts of the funds before finally realizing that the assets were no longer in the wallet. Online, people have marveled at the age of Gao, who was described as in his 20s. The future of Beosin, which was once regarded as a credible blockchain security company in China, is now in serious doubt.On Wednesday, PayPal co-founder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel warned that the Chinese government may be using Bitcoin as a “financial weapon” to undermine the stability of the U.S. dollar. The reaction was quite muted, as only 30 comments responded to the story on Sina Finance, a social media account with over 23 million followers. One of the top comments simply pointed out that “Bitcoin wasn’t invented by China,” while another comment simply stated “Impossible.”On Thursday, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ, appeared as #1,664 on Forbes’ annual billionaire list. His net worth is now listed at $1.9 billion, an increase of $700 million from the last list in 2020.U.S. company Future FinTech announced earlier this week that it had agreed to a deal to acquire China-based mining company Nanjing Ribensi Electronic Technology Co. Nanjing Ribensi operates a mining farm that can handle up to 30,000 Bitcoin mining machines. The deal was worth approximately $9.1 million dollars and stipulates that the mining company must generate no less than approximately $2.3 million dollars in 2021.China’s National Development and Reform Commission called for the accelerated implementation of blockchain standards in a new plan released on April 1.

486,"Bitcoin’s bull run from last year has caused even some of its biggest skeptics to soften their stance. From economists to hedge fund managers, the world is opening itself up to technology, and at the center of this movement is decentralized finance, or DeFi. While the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has hit $2 trillion, worth as much as Apple, it’s the promise of DeFi — a small corner of the blockchain industry today — that’s grabbing the attention of institutional investors.As Bitcoin’s (BTC) bullish trend persists, interest-bearing crypto products have become all the rage. Some services offer up to 8% returns on Bitcoin holdings. For investors who are already expecting a rise in value, this can be incredibly useful for maintaining cash flow without selling any assets.The three main factors solidifying institutional interest in Bitcoin are the current historically low interest rates, the inflation rate and geopolitical instability. With near-zero interest rates expected for the foreseeable future, investors are gearing up to move their funds into alternative locations for securing wealth.The United States Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation target has incited concern in investors fearing devaluation, and with tensions between the U.S. and China on a precarious edge, portfolios denominated in U.S. dollars are becoming riskier by the day.Buying, storing and using cryptocurrencies securely is still quite a complex ordeal — far more involved than setting up a bank account. However, according to Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock — a global investment management fund with nearly $9 trillion in assets under management — Bitcoin could evolve into a global market asset and achieve new highs in the upcoming years.In the traditional financial system, money markets are parts of the economy that issue short-term funds. They usually deal with loans for periods of a year or less, and offer services like borrowing and lending, buying and selling, with wholesale trading taking place over the counter. Money markets are composed of short-term, highly liquid assets and are part of the broader financial markets system.Money markets are traditionally very complicated, with expensive overheads and hidden fees pushing most investors to hire a fund manager. However, their existence is paramount to operating a modern financial economy. They incentivize people to lend money in the short term and allocate capital toward productive use. This improves the overall market’s efficiency while helping financial institutions meet their goals. Basically, anyone with extra cash on hand can earn interest on deposits.Money markets are composed of different kinds of securities, such as short-term treasuries, certificates of deposits, repurchase agreements and mutual funds, among others. These funds generally consist of shares that cost $1.On the other hand, capital markets are dedicated to the trade of long-term debt and equity instruments, and point to the entire stock and bond market. Using a computer, anyone can purchase or sell assets in mere seconds, but companies issuing the stock do so to raise funds for more long-term operations. These stocks fluctuate, and unlike money market products, they have no expiration date.Since money market investments are virtually risk-free, they often come with meager interest rates as well. This means that they will not produce huge gains or display substantial growth, compared with riskier assets like stocks and bonds.To hedge against currency risk, institutions have started using Bitcoin, and retail investors are following their lead. More than 60% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply hasn’t moved since 2018, and BTC is predicted to push well above $100,000 in the next 24 months.If the current trend carries forward, investors will continue to stockpile BTC. However, while much of the supply of the world’s first cryptocurrency remains in storage, the DeFi industry is constantly producing alternative platforms for interest-bearing payments through smart contracts, which increases transparency by allowing investors to view and track on-chain funds.The average return for DeFi products is also much higher than in traditional money markets, with some platforms even offering double-digit annual percentage yields on deposits. From asset management to auditing smart contracts, the DeFi space is creating decentralized infrastructure for scalable money markets.According to Stani Kulechov, co-founder of the Aave DeFi protocol, rates are high during bull markets because the funds are used to leverage more capital, with the cost of margin pushing up the yield. “New innovation in DeFi is consuming more stablecoins, which further increases the yield. Unless there is a new capital injection — these rates might stick for a while,” he said.The Ethereum network currently hosts most of the DeFi applications, and this has barred tokens that aren’t available on the network from participating in decentralized finance. Bitcoin, for example, despite being the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has only recently found its way onto DeFi platforms.Related: DeFi yield farming, explainedWith Kava’s Hard Protocol, investors can yield farm using Bitcoin and other non-ERC-20 tokens like XRP and Binance Coin (BNB). Backed by some prominent names (Ripple, Arrington XRP Capital and Digital Asset Capital Management, among others), the platforms allow users to stake their cryptocurrencies into a pool of assets, which is lent out to borrowers to generate interest.The team also plans to add support for Ethereum-based tokens in the near future. The network’s upgrade to Kava 5.1, which was postponed to April 8 after failing to reach the required quorum, will also introduce the Hard Protocol V2, bringing powerful incentivization schemes and enhancements to its governance model.Most loans in DeFi are overcollateralized, meaning the pool always has more money than it lends out. In case the value of the issued token drops, funds in the pool are liquidated to compensate.According to Anton Bukov, co-founder of decentralized exchange aggregator 1inch, blockchains are the first-ever unbiased executors in human history — very limited, but ultimately fair — and could deliver new services and new flows of interactions in future. “Developers are doing their best to solve potential dishonesty issues of existing flows and invent new flows by replacing intermediaries,” he said.By creating an automated platform to borrow and lend assets, decentralized finance enables money markets without intermediaries, custodians or the high fees that stem from high infrastructural costs.Of the many trends DeFi has set into motion over the last few years, yield farming has attracted quite a lot of attention. Yield farming is when the network rewards liquidity providers with tokens that can be further invested into other platforms to generate more liquidity tokens.Simple in concept, yield farmers are some of the most vigilant traders out there, constantly switching up their strategies to maximize their yield and tracking rates across all platforms to ensure they’re getting the sweetest deal. The potential rate of return can become obscenely high, but it’s still unclear whether yield farming is just a fad or a phenomenon in the making. Kulechov added:Yield farming has an incredibly positive feedback loop, with an increase in participation pushing the value of its governance token up, driving further growth. According to Kava CEO Brian Kerr, while this feedback loop can produce very positive results in bull markets, it can have entirely the opposite effects in falling markets:Money markets are the pillars of our global financial system, but most of its transactions occur between financial institutions like banks and other companies in time deposit markets. However, some of these transactions do find their way to consumers through money market mutual funds and other investment vehicles.Decentralization is the next frontier for finance, and as prominent investors continue to engage with the DeFi space, a decentralized economy seems all but inevitable. Participating in the burgeoning environment may be a risky bet today, but what decentralized finance platforms learn now will be the foundation of the robust DeFi applications of the future. According to Bukov, the higher interest rates of DeFi platforms are “absolutely sustainable.” He added:From smart contract malfunctions to the unauthorized withdrawal of community funds, the DeFi space is a place of both miracles and nightmares. DeFi-based yield farming platforms are still in their very early stages, and while the numbers can be all too tempting at times, it’s crucial to do your own research before investing in any platform or asset."
487,"Riot Blockchain is continuing its Bitcoin (BTC) mining expansion efforts. Reports suggest that the United States-based miner is set to purchase Whinstone US Inc, currently owned by Northern Data.The planned purchase was announced by Riot Blockchain on Thursday via a press release, with the U.S. Bitcoin miner paying $80 million in cash. The remainder will come from the sale of about 12% of its stock to Northern Data.Whinstone reportedly operates the single largest Bitcoin mining facility in the United States. Based in Texas, Whinstone’s data center reportedly has a total capacity of 750 megawatts, with an additional 300 MW expansion currently in the works.Indeed, upon the completion of the transaction, Riot Blockchain is expected to become the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining enterprise in North America based on operating capacity metrics.For Riot Blockchain, the Whinstone acquisition offers an opportunity for the company to upscale its Bitcoin mining capacity. According to Riot CEO Jason Les, the path forward for the Bitcoin miner is one that involves increasing U.S. participation in the global BTC mining landscape.In its own announcement of the deal, Northern Data revealed that the Whinstone sale to Riot Blockchain will not negatively impact its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — otherwise known as EBITDA. According to the Northern Data release, the company’s profitable multisite strategy means that all previous EBITDA guidance for fiscal year 2021 remains unchanged.The planned $650 million Whinstone acquisition comes on the heels of numerous inventory expansions by the U.S. Bitcoin miner. Indeed, Cointelegraph recently reported that Riot Blockchain purchased 42,000 Antminer rigs from Bitmain for about $138 million.Riot Blockchain has been pursuing a capacity expansion agenda in recent times, with its hashing power growing almost fivefold in 2020. The company’s efforts are indicative of the larger push by Bitcoin miners based in North America to challenge China’s hash rate dominance."
488,"Bitcoin can undermine the U.S. dollar if the United States does not take a lead role in accepting it, argued Anthony Pompliano.Speaking to CNBC on April 8, the Morgan Creek Digital co-founder followed up on a warning from investor Peter Thiel that China could use Bitcoin (BTC) to destabilize U.S. dollar hegemony.""I do wonder at this point whether Bitcoin is to be thought of, in part, as a Chinese financial weapon against the U.S. It threatens fiat money, but it especially threatens the U.S. dollar,"" Thiel had said in an appearance at the Nixon Seminar.Asked whether this was a potential problem, Pompliano was quick to point out that Thiel was not an opponent of Bitcoin but rather that it, like the internet, could have both positive and negative consequences for Washington should policymakers make ill-thought-out decisions.""I think what we've got to understand is that Bitcoin is an open, decentralized protocol,"" he explained to CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" segment.The legal landscape surrounding Bitcoin in the U.S. remains a patchwork one, despite certain states, notably Wyoming and Florida, actively seeking to become a haven for its adoption.""I think what [Thiel] is doing here is he's saying, 'Look, there's a global competition happening here, and there are other countries who are going to try to use this to try to destabilize or financially attack the United States,'"" Pompliano continued.Institutional and retail investor interest in cryptocurrency as a whole remains prominent thanks to higher prices this year.Beneath those movements, however, a separate narrative continues to play out — one involving state-focused power struggles for a piece of, specifically, the Bitcoin network's power.This so-called ""hash war"" could yet affect any state, including those targeted by U.S. sanctions in recent years, such as Iran and Venezuela.China's place in the Bitcoin mining game, meanwhile, has been well known for years, despite a ban on transacting and its central bank's digital yuan project."
489,"Nearly half a billion in Tether (USDT) inflows were recorded on April 8 across major Bitcoin (BTC) exchanges, based on Glassnode data.Considering that the inflows, the biggest since mid-March, coincided with a minor Bitcoin pullback, it indicates that buyers could be waiting to step in following BTC's price drop.There are two major on-chain metrics that often signal a bigger Bitcoin rally is forming: BTC outflows and stablecoin inflows.Stablecoin inflows occur when traders deposit their sidelined funds to exchanges to buy back into cryptocurrencies.Meanwhile, large BTC outflows typically happen when high-net-worth investors withdraw their Bitcoin from exchanges to self-hosted wallets, which often suggests their intention to hold for the long term. In one hour, more than $476 million worth of stablecoin deposits were spotted on exchanges. According to Lex Moskovski, chief investment officer of Moskovski Capital, this demonstrates that there is no shortage of capital waiting to buy Bitcoin dips.Moskovski said:On April 2, Bitfinex chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino shared that the market capitalization of Tether, the largest stablecoin in the global market, had reached $42 billion.. @Tether_to $USDt 42BIn the following six days, the market cap of USDT added another $2 billion, showing strong momentum.Since Tether is essentially digital dollars that can be easily converted into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, this uptrend suggests that the amount of sidelined capital in the crypto market is growing.Theoretically, when there is a lot of sidelined cash in the market, it represents significant firepower to drive a new rally of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.When asked whether large USDT deposits could also mean that there’s a demand to cash out instead, Moskovski countered by saying that USDT deposited to exchanges typically represents an intention to buy. He explained:Meanwhile, data from CryptoQuant depicts a similar trend. For instance, the all exchanges stablecoins ratio, which divides all Bitcoin reserves on exchanges by stablecoin reserves, is rising once again, suggesting that investors could be reentering the market."
490,"State Street, the second-oldest operating bank in the United States, is moving into the cryptocurrency industry by agreeing to provide its technology for a new crypto trading platform.Currenex, a foreign exchange technology provider owned by State Street, has entered into an agreement with crypto firm Puremarkets to provide its trading infrastructure and tech for the new crypto trading platform Pure Digital. Announcing the news Thursday, Pure Digital said that it will also collaborate with State Street to further explore the digital currency trading industry.According to the announcement, Pure Digital will be a fully automated over-the-counter market for digital assets and cryptocurrencies, with physical delivery and bank custody. Scheduled for launch in mid-2021, the new platform will reportedly allow institutional investors to trade using bilateral credit and multiple custody solutions. “Trading participants will be free to leverage their preferred digital asset custody solutions and manage risk through a smart custody routing mechanism,” the announcement notes.State Street announced in late March that the bank has been exploring the role of Bitcoin (BTC) in multiasset portfolios over the last nine years. “The case has yet to be made for Bitcoin as an equity hedge, though it may be heading in that direction. The key for investors is to combine their preferences for risk mitigation and upside potential with Bitcoin’s expected diversification and return properties to determine their optimal allocation,” the bank wrote.State Street has been actively exploring the cryptocurrency industry in recent years. In late 2019, the bank announced a digital asset pilot in collaboration with crypto exchange Gemini. The pilot built on the research and development in the digital asset space to combine Gemini Custody with State Street’s back-office reporting.Earlier this year, Bank of New York Mellon announced plans to hold, transfer and issue Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as an asset manager on behalf of its clients."
491,"Among the many offshoots produced as a bi-product of the ongoing cryptocurrency experiment, nonfungible tokens have turned out to be one of the most explosive. In a few short months, over half a billion dollars worth of NFTs changed hands, as celebrities (from lists A to Z) clamored to profit from crypto’s latest craze.But amid the rush to jump on the bandwagon, few have stopped to consider the veracity of the terminology applied to NFTs. After all, why would you stop to ponder semantics when there are millions of dollars to be made at the click of a button?But in lieu of said millions, we decided to ask the question: Are nonfungible tokens actually a little bit fungible after all?An asset or good is considered to be fungible if it can be interchanged with another of the same type of equal value. Hence the United State dollar is fungible because any one dollar can be exchanged for any other. The same applies to Bitcoin (BTC).Fungibility makes up one of the four pillars of Aristotle’s concept of “good money” and is possibly the most important in creating a working currency. All cryptocurrencies are fungible by nature.Nonfungible assets are those that can’t be trusted to have equal value due to unique variations in their make-up. For example, while diamonds could be useful in a bartering situation, their minute differences in cut, shape and quality exclude them from meeting Aristotle’s evaluation of good money.But when it comes to NFTs, currency characteristics are irrelevant. The whole point is that each unit of the asset can be varied, unique, exclusive and rare. This is precisely where much of the perceived value of the NFT comes from — its nonfungibility.On the Ethereum blockchain, NFTs are mostly built upon a token standard known as ERC-1155. Tokens built using ERC-1155 ensure nonfungibility and, as such, would be useless in forming the backbone of a regular currency.Regular Ethereum tokens are built on the ERC-20 standard, which enables the issuance of identical, fungible tokens for use as actual currency. For this very reason, an ERC-20 token’s utility in registering anything unique or rare is null and void.But hypothetically, if one were to create 21 million ERC-1155 NFTs — all programmed to be identical to each other — and then distribute them in a free airdrop, would an actual currency not naturally begin to form?What would stop the tokens from being traded on the open market, each holding the same identical value as the other? This concept is not an invention of Cointelegraph’s; “fractionalized NFTs” are a phenomenon that has already emerged and quickly drawn the ire of United States Securities and Exchange Commissioner Hester Peirce.Peirce, also referred to as “Crypto Mom” for her lenient stance on cryptocurrency regulation, warned that the use of fractionalized NFTs skirts dangerously close to breaking SEC securities laws. The very reason NFTs don’t constitute securities is because they are unique and nonfungible, noted Peirce, who said people were “getting very creative in the types of NFTs they’re putting out there.”Conversely, the ERC-20 standard Ethereum token that many people will have held in their wallets at some point is designed to be fungible — but is that always the case?An Ethereum developer who helped create the ERC-1155 token standard, Philippe Castonguay, recently posed a question to his Twitter followers that probed this very issue. We’ve established that ERC-20 tokens are fungible, but could they be nonfungible?Castonguay polled his followers, asking: “Is an ERC-20 token with a forever total supply of 1 an NFT?”Some 46.8% of respondents answered yes, 36.4% answered no, and 16.7% declined to speculate.Fine-tuning the definition further, Castonguay then asked if a non-divisible ERC-20 token with a capped supply of one was an NFT. After all, an ERC-20 token is divisible down to many (possibly infinite) decimal points, meaning its utility as an NFT would be gone.“Is an ERC-20 token that is not divisible (0 decimals) with a forever maximum supply of 1 an NFT?” Castonguay asked. This time 72.1% said yes, 15.4% said no, and 12.5% declined to answer.Cointelegraph asked Castonguay about the usage of the terms fungibility and nonfungibility as applied to cryptocurrency tokens. Is there really that much difference between the two? Are we just talking about two different ways of skinning a cat? He answered:One social media philosopher summed up the situation by referencing the age-old question that has plagued the world’s deepest thinkers for millennia.

492,"The number of cryptocurrency holding disclosures in Russia has been on the rise over the past several months, according to a new report.Russian news agency Izvestia reports Thursday that Russians have been increasingly disclosing their income from crypto trading for tax purposes. The report cites data from consulting and law firms such as KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, FTL Advisers, as well as Moscow-based public policy think tank the Center for Strategic Research.“We’ve observed that Russian residents have started voluntarily disclosing income from operations with digital assets, mainly with cryptocurrency, in tax declarations,” FTL Advisers’ partner Maria Kukla said. She noted that it’s still early to determine whether the tendency will become widespread. The currency tax reporting period ends on May 1 and, per Kukla, much could change before then. Evgeny Sivoushkov, director of PwC Russia’s division of individual taxation, said that interest in disclosing crypto holdings has increased during the ongoing tax declaration period. According to Sivoushkov, the new trend was fueled by the adoption of Russia’s crypto law “On Digital Financial Assets,” as well as the increased focus of tax authorities and compliance services on the origin of income and Russians’ foreign assets.FTL Advisers did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph request for comment. PwC Russia declined to comment.The reported surge in the number of crypto tax filings comes despite Russia not having officially enforced any dedicated legislation related to cryptocurrency taxation. However, according to Izvestia’s sources, the Federal Taxation Service of Russia says that the procedure of crypto income taxation by individuals is formally described as part of a letter by the Ministry of Finance issued in May 2018.According to the letter, the tax base from crypto trading is defined in Russian rubles as the “excess of the total income amount received by taxpayers from the sale of cryptocurrency over the total amount of documented expenses for its acquisition.”Russia is progressing with new proposed legislation that would require Russian residents to pay income tax from cryptocurrency trading. The bill, which was approved by the State Duma in the first reading in February, required residents to report crypto transactions if their total amount exceeds 600,000 rubles ($7,800) on an annual basis."
493,"Bitcoin (BTC) barely recovered its losses on Thursday as fresh doubts emerged about the bull run continuing this month. After sliding 5% on Wednesday, BTC/USD saw only a modest rebound to circle $57,000 at the time of writing, Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed. Following multiple failed attempts to crack resistance close to all-time highs, analysts were becoming wary of a further dip and a temporary halt to further price gains.Filbfilb, co-founder of trading suite DecenTrader, described this week’s current floor of $56,760 as “not a convincing bottom.”As reported on Wednesday, funding rates among trading platforms call for a shakeout of leveraged long positions from those overly bullish on a continuation. For Filbfilb, those rates remain “way too high,” he told subscribers of his Telegram trading channel.Popular Twitter trader Cantering Clark, meanwhile, pointed to Bitcoin’s 20-week moving average (MA) — a classic “line in the sand” for price performance — still lingering at around $40,000.“More fuel for why I think April-May puts a lid on $BTC until later in the year,” he commented on a comparative chart.Despite institutional interest continuing in recent weeks, fuelled by major new adoption announcements from banks, signs of a slowdown were also beginning to show on the day.The Purpose Bitcoin exchange-traded fund saw a slight reduction in its BTC holdings after consistent growth, with its assets under management dipping in tandem from highs of $976 million to $944 million.Fellow institutional portal Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) maintained its negative premium, meanwhile, a phenomenon that has put pay to further Bitcoin accumulation since February.But not everyone was wholly gloomy. For trader Crypto Ed, the ultimate market trajectory was clear.“Not in a rush to get in a position,” he told Twitter followers on Thursday.Beyond crypto, a buoyant outlook for United States stock markets coupled with a weakening dollar could further serve Bitcoin’s purpose in the short term.“With excess savings, new stimulus savings, huge deficit spending, more QE, a new potential infrastructure bill, a successful vaccine and euphoria around the end of the pandemic...U.S. economy will likely boom,” noted JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon in his annual shareholder newsletter earlier this week."
494,"The Ripple community has launched a new petition to “stop the war” on XRP.Crypto & Policy founder Thomas Hodge has started a Change.org petition directed at Securities and Exchange Commission chair nominee Gary Gensler, asking him to end the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple once he’s confirmed as chairman of the commission.Announcing the news Wednesday, Crypto & Policy called on Gensler to investigate the potential motives of former SEC chair Jay Clayton and his SEC Director of Corporate Finance William Hinman for “favoring” Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) while harming XRP. The petition alleges that Clayton and Hinman could have had financial interests in Bitcoin and Ether:Hodge further alleged that Hinman “received millions of dollars in payments” from the law firm of Simpson Thacher, which is a member of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance. The petition claims that Hinman “collected checks from the firm” while the firm earned fees supporting the initial public offering of Chinese crypto mining giant Canaan.The XRP advocate outlined the uncertain regulatory status of the altcoin, stating that Clayton spent four years of his tenure without providing a clear response on whether XRP was a security. Hodge continued:At the time of writing, the online petition has collected about 1,600 signatures.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs, as well as its CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Christian Larsen on Dec. 22, 2020, alleging that XRP was a “$1.3 billion unregistered securities offering.”Amid the ongoing legal battle, a U.S. court granted Ripple Labs access to the SEC’s documents on defining crypto assets as securities in early April. Earlier this week, the price of XRP crossed the $1 mark for the first time since March 2018. The latest price milestone is still far from its all-time high of above $3 recorded in January 2018."
495,"After becoming a corporate pioneer in cryptocurrency adoption, Elon Musk could be about to take the next step and begin paying rent in Bitcoin (BTC).While no announcement has been made by the “Technoking” himself, news broke on Wednesday regarding a partnership between Los Angeles real-estate firm Caruso Properties and the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, founded by the Winklevoss twins.Following the partnership, Caruso will accept Bitcoin payments for rent at its various retail and residential properties. The firm’s deal with Gemini also saw Caruso convert about 1% of its treasury into Bitcoin, reports the L.A Times.Caruso owns the property that houses the Tesla dealership at the Americana, at Brand center in Glendale, California. Tesla’s Musk has thus far proven to be a pioneering figure in the cryptocurrency space — at least among those in the eccentric billionaire bracket.After acquiring $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin and then accepting BTC as payment for his Tesla electric vehicles, would it be too much to expect for Musk to start paying rent in the digital currency?Owner Rick Caruso said there hadn’t been a rush to pay rent using Bitcoin just yet but noted that the investment the company made had already turned out to be profitable.“I believe it’s a good hedge and has already proven to be a good investment for us,” said Caruso.Caruso appears to be planning for the future by opening up his properties to prospective Bitcoin buyers. He compared Bitcoin’s adoption status to that of credit cards 50 years ago — an odd and often untrusted piece of technology that is now commonplace in modern-day society.“I believe Bitcoin and blockchain are going to be doing the same in the future. We want to be ahead of the curve,” Caruso added.CEO and co-founder of Gemini Tyler Winklevoss said his firm was “thrilled” to see cryptocurrency usage extend to the real estate market, adding that the move would benefit both Caruso and its customers.“We are thrilled to partner with Caruso as they continue to push the real estate sector to new heights by embracing cryptocurrency for the benefit of both their customer experience and their own business operations,” said Winklevoss."
496,"Bitcoin (BTC) miners are stashing away their coins for higher prices, with direct transfers from miners to exchanges having plummeted nearly 40% since mid-March.Data from on-chain analytics provider Glassnode shows that miners’ BTC balances have been increasing since late March, following heavy outflows throughout January and consistently reduced selling during February and earlier in March.Glassnode chief technology officer Rafael Schultze-Kraft noted several metrics pointing to recent miner accumulation — including flows from miner addresses, unspent BTC supply and miner position net change.Glassnode’s data shows that unspent supply — BTC that has never been transferred from the (miner’s) original recipient address — has begun to rise after seeing a sharp drop in January, when 15,000 previously dormant coins were moved from mining addresses for the first time.Since February, roughly 5,000 newly minted BTC have been added to Bitcoin’s unspent supply, bringing the total up to 1.765 million Bitcoin.Direct transfers from miner wallets to exchanges have also dropped substantially in recent weeks, falling from a 30-day moving average of nearly 450 BTC in mid-March to 275 BTC today.Schultze-Kraft described Bitcoin mining as showing “great fundamentals,” noting a new all-time high for daily hash rate of 178 exahashes per second on Tuesday and new record highs for Bitcoin mining difficulty.He also shared data showing that miner revenues are up by 300% in roughly one year, pushing into new all-time highs above $50 million to currently sit at a seven-day moving average of nearly $60 million.“Miners have little to no incentives to be cashing out right now,” he concluded, adding “selling or capitulation [is] not in sight.”The apparent prosperity of Bitcoin miners can be seen in the share performance of North America’s listed mining firms, with recent analysis finding the stocks of the four-largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies gained 5,000% in 12 months, while spot BTC prices went up 900% over the same period."
497,"Analytics company Santiment reports that cryptocurrency sentiment has fallen to near-record low levels for 2021 — even as some experts are doubling down on a $400,000 Bitcoin (BTC) price target.Sentiment nosedived following Bitcoin’s drop below $60,000 to its current price of $56,300 and Ether’s (ETH) dip under $2,000 this week, according to Santiment. Ether is currently trading at $1,998.The crowd mood toward #Bitcoin and #Ethereum appears to have dropped to extreme negative territory after $BTC fell back under $60k & $ETH dipped back under $2k this week. Historically, buying during this level of #FUD & fear is a #bullish opportunity. https://t.co/u7LKbvoqSt pic.twitter.com/ZTxQFroEfMBut other analytics platforms show a less convincing shift, with crypto predictive data platform Augmento seeing sentiment slide from “bullish” to “slightly bearish.” The Alternative Crypto Fear & Greed index, meanwhile, shows almost no change, with the counter still clearly sitting at “greed.”Yesterday’s sell-off, which saw the entire cryptocurrency market cap drop briefly below $1.8 trillion before stabilizing around $1.9 trillion, doesn’t appear to bother seasoned analysts. Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan stated in his April 8 newsletter that the dip “took place on relatively low volumes.”He noted that Bitcoin miners seem to have not even noticed the dip, with the network’s hash rate reaching a new all-time high of 179 million exahashes, adding “that miners are hoarding Bitcoin right now instead of selling it back to the market.” This is often taken as a sign they expect higher prices. Released on Monday, a report by Bloomberg Intelligence strategist Mike McGlone predicted Bitcoin could soon approach $400,000 based on past Bitcoin bull runs, adding:Although it doesn’t give a specific time-frame for when this peak might be achieved, the report does specify that over the next quarter the price is likely to “breach $60,000 resistance and head toward $80,000.”Bitcoin analytics account Ecoinometrics tweeted that historically, the BTC price broke out between 300 and 350 days from previous halvings. We are currently at 329 days from the latest halving. If it plays out anything like previous halvings, next May could see a Bitcoin price past $700,000... or drop to well below $40,000."
498,"A wave of selling took command of the cryptocurrency market on Wednesday after Bitcoin’s (BTC) price dropped below $56,000.The market-wide sell-off led to $1.4 billion in liquidations, and some analysts suggested that this could be the final sweep out of overleveraged long traders before Bitcoin can make a run higher to the $70,000 level. One sign that the market had moved ahead of itself over the past week was the rapidly rising Kimchi premium, which was followed by a 7% decline in BTC’s price on Wednesday as traders worried that it might be the signal for a market top.Despite the market downturn, analysis of on-chain data suggests that Bitcoin could soon see a rally to a new all-time high as whales, miners and long-term holders have decreased or stopped selling altogether and institutional demand remains high.Equities markets traded near their all-time highs on Tuesday as accelerating job growth, record levels of service sector activity and an expansion in manufacturing resulted in unexpected optimism that pushed stock prices higher.Despite this positive news, the Dow and Nasdaq closed down 0.06% and 0.16%, respectively, while the S&P 500 managed to end the day with a 0.06% gain.A few altcoins did manage to rally throughout the day after Coinbase revealed that it would list 1Inch, Enjin (ENJ), New Kind of Network (NKN) and Origin Protocol (OGN) on Coinbase Pro. Starting today, inbound transfers for 1INCH, ENJ, NKN & OGN are available in the regions where trading is supported. Traders cannot place orders and no orders will be filled. Trading will begin on or after 9AM PT on Fri 4/9 if liquidity conditions are met. https://t.co/L5KlZvMiuAFollowing the announcement, the price of 1Inch and ENJ saw modest gains of 5%, while Origin Protocol saw a 10% increase, and NKN rallied 27%.Solana (SOL) also rallied 10% and Ether (ETH) declined 7% to trade below $2,000.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.90 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 55.6%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

499,"After flirting with a $2 trillion market capitalization for the last couple of days, the cryptocurrency market took a 7% hit on April 7, dropping the total crypto market cap to $1.8 trillion. As the unexpected sell-off took place, investors scrambled to find a reason to explain the move.Analysts typically identify the use of excessive leverage as the prime suspect, as this usually occurs as the market reaches an all-time high and traders get greedy, but this is an easy conclusion to reach.The actual cause could be near impossible to determine. Still, a starting place is looking at how high buyers' leverage was compared with the previous weeks. Analysts must also question whether a $1 billion liquidation is even significant in the current bullish environment.The negative price swing on April 7 resembles the rally that took place two days earlier. However, retail traders deploy leverage by using perpetual futures contracts (inverse swaps), which can amplify price corrections.A 5% move is enough to liquidate traders using 20x leverage, and exchange order books tend to become thin below that level, as traders seldomly have orders in place.As shown above, there is $4.6 million worth of bids down to $1.15 for Cardano's ADA in the above example. Behind the 5% threshold, there's only $1.9 million down to $1.06, or 12% below last trade.Thin order books are a gold mine for scalpers and arbitrage desks. Once retail markets enter highly leveraged positions, there are multiple incentives to push down the price and trigger liquidations.Today's 12-hour, $1.4 billion liquidation might seem excessive, but this aggregates the entire futures markets. Moreover, this represents a mere 3% of the total $46 billion in open interest. Had this movement taken place some six months ago, the figure would have been north of 12%.However, implying that liquidations triggered the drop is not the best answer, as those are only triggered when markets drop 4% or more. Although analysts may never fully understand what has triggered the correction, a ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" event could have taken place after Coinbase presented its quarterly earnings.It's also important to review how high the funding rate was and, more importantly, for how long. Even if the eight-hour fee reaches 0.20%, equivalent to 4.3% per week, this will not force longs to close positions.As shown above, the average funding rate across top exchanges did not rise above 0.10%, which is substantially lower than the late February levels.It is natural during rallies for long traders to enter excessively leveraged positions, and this situation can last from a couple of hours to weeks.Whales and market makers likely knew that the exchange order books were thin and that retail traders were excessively leveraged. Thus, one cannot discard today's price action being a premeditated maneuver.However, arbitrage between exchanges and futures markets happens almost instantly, so no trail is left. Analysts and pundits might pinpoint numerous reasons for today's move, but the available data suggests that leverage itself isn't to blame.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
500,"According to CoinShares, the institutional inflow into crypto products hit $4.5 billion in Q1, which is 11% higher than the intake seen in Q4 2020. This shows that institutional interest is on the rise but the quarter-on-quarter growth has slowed down from the 240% recorded in Q4 2020. As Bitcoin price moves higher, more funds are needed to sustain the levels. Therefore, if institutional inflows do not pick up in the next few days, Bitcoin (BTC) and other altcoins could witness a major correction.The next correction could test the resolve of institutional investors and even though these investors have deep pockets, some may have jumped into crypto only for quick speculative gains. There is always the possibility that investors may dump their positions if Bitcoin starts a correction.While this may accelerate the fall, lower levels are likely to attract investors who may have missed the bus earlier. If this assumption plays out, volatility throughout the market may remain high in the next few days.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to see if it also projects a possible correction.Bitcoin’s failure to cross the stiff overhead resistance zone at $60,000 to $61,825.84 seems to have attracted profit-booking from short-term momentum traders. This has pulled the price back below the 20-day exponential moving average ($56,863) today.If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, the bears may sense an opening and are likely to challenge the critical support at the 50-day simple moving average ($54,333). If this support cracks and the bears manage to sustain the price below the 50-day SMA, the selling could intensify.The next support on the downside is $50,460. If this level also gives way, the BTC/USDT pair could plummet down to $43,006.77. The flattening moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) dropping below 52 suggest that the bulls may be losing their grip.Contrary to this assumption, if the price rebounds off the 50-day SMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the pair to a new all-time high. If they succeed, the pair could start its journey to the next target objective at $69,540 and then $79,566.Ether (ETH) broke to a new all-time high on April 2 but could not take off and continue its climb. This showed hesitation among the bulls and even though they managed to push the price to a new all-time high at $2,150 on April 6 the rally has since stalled.That may have frustrated the momentum traders who seem to have dumped their positions today, resulting in a drop to the 20-day EMA ($1,904). If the ETH/USDT pair rebounds strongly from the 20-day EMA, it will indicate demand at lower levels.The bulls will then make one more attempt to drive the price above $2,150. If they succeed, the pair could start its journey to the next target objective at $2,618.14.This positive view will invalidate if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest a possible change in sentiment and that could drag the price down to the trendline.Binance Coin (BNB) is in a strong uptrend. The bears tried to pull the price back below the breakout level at $348.69 today but the long tail on the candlestick shows the bulls purchased this dip aggressively.The rising moving averages and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest the bulls are firmly in command. If the buyers can flip $348.69 into support, then the BNB/USDT pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that could take it to $500 and then $530.On the other hand, if the price dips below $348.69, it will suggest that higher levels are attracting profit-booking from traders. The bullish momentum may weaken if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($314).XRP’s breakout above $0.65 on April 5 completed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which had a target objective at $1.11. The altcoin met this target on April 6 when it reached an intraday high at $1.11.Traders who follow technical analysis seem to have booked profits near the target objective, resulting in a sharp pullback today.The bulls are attempting to stall the correction near the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.84 as seen from the long tail on the candlestick. If the buyers can sustain the rebound, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels and keep the prospects of a break above $1.11 alive.On the other hand, if the XRP/USDT pair breaks below $0.84, the correction could deepen to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.77. Such a deep correction may delay the start of the next leg of the uptrend.Cardano (ADA) attempted an up-move on April 6, but the long wick on the day’s candlestick suggests a lack of demand at higher levels. The bears have latched on to the opportunity today and are attempting to sink the price to $1.03.The bulls are likely to defend the $1.03 support aggressively. If the price rebounds off this level strongly, the bulls will try to push the price above the moving averages. If they can do that, the ADA/USDT pair could remain range-bound for a few more days.The flat 10-day EMA ($1.18) and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.This neutral view will invalidate if the $1.03 support cracks. In such a case, the pair could start its journey toward the support at $0.80 and then $0.70.The failure of the bulls to push the price above the all-time high at $146.80 on April 5 and 6 could have attracted profit-booking from the short-term traders. That may have pulled Polkadot (DOT) back below the breakout level at $42.28 today.The bulls are currently attempting to defend the 20-day EMA ($38). If they can achieve a strong rebound off this support, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The buyers may then make one more attempt to clear the all-time high. If they succeed, the DOT/USDT pair could rally to $53.50.On the contrary, a weak rebound will suggest weakness and a lack of urgency among traders to buy aggressively. That will open the chances for the bears to pull the price below the moving averages. If that happens, the pair could drop to $26.50.Uniswap (UNI) attempted to rise above the $32.50 resistance but failed. This shows a lack of buyers at higher levels. The bears are now attempting to sink the pair below the $27.97 to $25.50 support zone.If they succeed, the UNI/USDT pair could start its journey toward the next support at $22 and then $18.However, the flat 20-day EMA ($29.59) and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. If the bulls can defend the support zone, the pair is likely to extend its range-bound action for a few more days.Litecoin (LTC) broke above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle on April 5 and followed it up with another up-move on April 6 that took the price to the stiff resistance at $246.96.The failure of the bulls to clear the hurdle at $246.96 may have attracted profit-booking from short-term traders and selling by aggressive bears. That pulled the price down to the breakout level from the triangle today.If the LTC/USDT pair rebounds off this level aggressively, it will suggest that the bulls are accumulating on dips. The buyers will then make one more attempt to climb the wall at $246.96. If they manage to do that, the pair could start its journey to $307.42.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below the moving averages, the pair could drop to the support line of the triangle.Chainlink (LINK) broke above the $32 resistance on April 5 and followed it with another up-move on April 6 but the bulls could not challenge the all-time high at $36.93. This suggests the bears have not given up and are active at higher levels.The LINK/USDT pair has dipped back below the $32 level today. The bulls are attempting to defend the 20-day EMA ($29.85). If they manage to do that and push the price back above $32 within the next couple of days, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels.The bulls may then again try to propel the price above $36.93. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the moving averages, it will suggest that the recent breakout above $32 was a bull trap. The pair could then drop to $24.After trading in a tight range for the past few days, THETA surged today and attempted to break out of the $14 to $14.96 overhead resistance. However, the bears thwarted this attempt as seen from the long wick in today's candlestick.If they succeed, the THETA/USDT pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that has a target objective at $17.65 and then $22.50. The 20-day EMA ($11.13) has started to turn up once again and the RSI has risen above 68, suggesting the momentum favors the bulls.However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to stall the uptrend in the overhead resistance zone. If they manage to do that, the pair could extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

501,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has been under severe selling pressure by whales for the past two months, on-chain data reveals.However, five key indicators suggest that major sellers are about to turn into hodlers or even accumulators of Bitcoin again, while institutional demand remains high. This is an explosive setup that may send Bitcoin to new all-time highs in the near term.The number of whales, which are Bitcoin addresses with a balance equal to or more than 1,000 Bitcoin, have declined by more than 10% since Feb. 8, suggesting a large sell-off of Bitcoin.While the price of Bitcoin managed to see two all-time highs during the two-month dumping period, the overall price rise has significantly slowed down, with BTC finding strong resistance at around $60,000. Since March 31, however, large holders of Bitcoin have stopped selling.Portfolio rebalancing as a quarter ends is a typical time for sell-offs. As Bitcoin has seen a 104% price rise since the beginning of this year, this was to be expected.Grayscale, the largest digital asset manager, announced on April 6 that it had just rebalanced its digital large-cap fund at the expense of selling Bitcoin.If rebalancing is the major driver, and considering that the number of addresses holding equal to or more than 1,000 BTC is back at levels last seen at the end of 2020 — when the price started rising — whales could be finished selling for now.When Bitcoin broke its previous 2019 high in October 2020, this begn one of the fastest, most prolonged increases in coin days destroyed (CDD).The CDD on-chain metric expresses the ""weight"" at which long-term hodlers are selling. It is calculated by taking the number of coins in a transaction and multiplying it by the number of days it has been since those coins were last spent. This means that the higher the CDD is, the more volume is sold.However, since the beginning of the year, selling by long-term hodlers is not only drastically slowing down but has almost come back to the level at which the sell-off was initially triggered in 2020.This suggests that long-term hodlers have become increasingly confident in a higher Bitcoin price in the near term.Because Bitcoin miners' revenue stream is newly mined BTC, they regularly have to sell their mined BTC to pay for their operational expenses such as electricity costs. However, some miners tend to speculate on the price.By holding back on selling Bitcoin, they become net accumulators. This is expressed in the miner net position change metric, which shows the 30-day change of the supply held in miner addresses.The last time miners were hesitant to sell their Bitcoin was right before a major price increase almost three months ago. This positive change suggests that miners expect higher prices in the near future.Despite material selling pressure from whales, institutional demand for Bitcoin has not slowed down. The net transfer volume of Bitcoin from/to exchanges is deep in the red, almost at a historical low, meaning that more Bitcoin is currently being withdrawn from exchanges than deposited.This is a sign that these coins are moving to cold storage. This is typical for institutions, as they tend to make long-term investments and prefer safer custody solutions rather than leaving them on an exchange.Since the pandemic, there has been a historic supply crunch of exchange Bitcoin balances. It has become even more material as institutions have started to accumulate in greater quantities since November 2020.This is made clear by the large continuous drop in Bitcoin balances on exchanges over the past few months, particularly Coinbase, which is a frequent choice for institutions.Meanwhile, Coinbase released its quarter one earnings and outlook yesterday, in which it states:Not only is it certain that institutions have materially added to their revenue, but this data also shows Coinbase's confidence that this trend of buying is likely not going to stop soon.Since the beginning of February, a weekly ascending triangle has formed. Statistically, this chart pattern gives a higher likelihood of breaking to the upside than to the downside.If the price were to break to the upside, the size of the triangle suggests a potential breakout target toward $79,000. While neither the break to the upside nor the price target is a certainty, it is a chart worth keeping an eye on alongside major on-chain signals.Strong forces in the market — whether they are long-term hodlers, miners or whales — are all showing signs of confidence in an increasing price of Bitcoin.The ascending triangle gives even more reason to believe that this move could be imminent and to the upside. While no one would mind a $79,000 Bitcoin price in the near future, a breakdown of the triangle is also a possibility that should be taken into consideration as not all key on-chain signals have fully aligned just yet.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

502,"Facebook is no stranger to data hacks and leaks, with the company having been on the receiving end of many high-profile security breaches in recent years. For example, back in 2018, the social media giant revealed that it had inadvertently exposed the personal information of more than 50 million users due to a small error in its platform coding, thus allowing miscreants to gain access to its users’ accounts.Similarly, in 2020, the Mark Zuckerberg-led firm was embroiled in another major controversy when it came to light that thousands of developers had been able to access data from inactive platform users, again drawing the ire of many folks across the globe.Now in 2021, the tech juggernaut has once again been hit with a fresh wave of data leaks, however, this time around, the number of users whose records were exposed was not 50 million but a staggering 500 million. On April 3, Alon Gal, chief technical officer of security firm Hudson Rock, revealed that sensitive personal information for over half a billion Facebook users was shared on a well-trafficked hacking forum.To be more specific, the records include phone numbers, full names, locations, birthdates, bios, and, in some cases, email addresses of over 553 million located users across a total of 100 countries. Not only that, of the above-stated figure, 32 million users are apparently from the United States, while 11 million are from the United Kingdom.Lastly, this data which is now doing the rounds online has potentially put at risk the savings of millions of digital currency traders and hodlers who now may be vulnerable to SIM swapping and other identity-based attacks, which have happened in recent years.How exactly does this most recent breach place at risk the crypto assets of individuals? Dave Jevans, CEO of blockchain security firm CipherTrace, told Cointelegraph that people who have had their phone numbers leaked need to be extra cautious since a lot of fraud involving digital assets hinges on such info, adding:He went on to add that individuals who believe their crypto may be at some sort of risk need to reconsider their existing privacy strategies — basically, thinking twice before storing all their holdings in a centralized exchange that may leverage user phone numbers for two-factor authentication.Jevans further opined that managing one’s own keys could be a better way to protect our valuables from being phished via the use of stolen phone numbers. However, he conceded that even that may not be enough. “Phishing attackers can still use other means of acquiring account and address information, but it’s much harder,” he added.Providing a take on the matter, Ben Diggles, co-founder and chief revenue officer for Constellation — a scalable enterprise-grade blockchain creating a standard for securing data in transit — told Cointelegraph that Facebook’s latest security lapse is not surprising, especially since most users of the social media platform tend to adhere to a different mindset — i.e., they like their world to be managed and organized for them.He added that for most users, if they forget their passwords, they can just have the system reset it for them. Not only that, in Diggles’ view, most folks using Facebook aren’t even totally aware of how big their digital footprint actually is — a facet that Facebook doesn’t make too obvious either — adding:That said, as a precautionary measure, he believes that it would be best if most users change their passwords across all of their social media accounts as well as other platforms that share their data with Facebook.As more data leaks continue to happen, an increasing amount of people around the world are beginning to realize the value proposition that decentralized systems put forth from a security standpoint, especially since they do not feature a single point of failure.On the subject, Eli Arkush, a cloud solutions engineer at cybersecurity firm GlobalDots, opined that having the backend system of a platform distributed using blockchain technology might make it a bit harder on the hackers to get a hold of user info; however, once credentials fall into the wrong hands, password reuse can become an issue.Similarly, Diggles believes that few people are educated enough to understand why decentralization actually counts, since, in theory, everything already seems fairly decentralized in their experience, at least from a digital standpoint.He added that most people don’t know that the internet plays by its own rules and thus when he tells people about how technologies such as Brave and the Basic Attention Token work, it’s mind-blowing to them: “Most people aren’t aware of their involvement in the grander data world, and I can see why humans have been conditioned to think centralization is safer.” He added: “If users are made aware that value is being siphoned off of them every day, I think they would change behaviors quickly.”However, Stephen Wilson, a member of the Australian government’s National Blockchain Roadmap Cybersecurity Working Group and CEO of security services provider Lockstep Group, is of the opinion that contrary to what some may believe, it’s never a good idea to save personal information on any sort of blockchain ecosystem.He pointed out that the type of personal information breached by Facebook should never be stored in a blockchain, and even if one does, such data can never totally be protected by blockchain with any sort of long-term effectiveness. He stated further that “there are many different facets of decentralization and distributed systems,” adding:Late last year, crypto hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger was on the receiving end of a data hack, as a result of which the private information of more than 270,000 users was leaked online. Following the incident, users started reporting extortion threats from bad actors resulting in many users even considered initiating legal action against the firm.Furthermore, a total of 28 attacks were witnessed in relation to various prominent cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms in 2020, with the total sum of money being compromised as a result of these ploys amounting to around $300 million.Related: Crypto wallets in 2021: From hot to cold, here are the optionsAccording to a report released by CipherTrace, more than 50% of all nefarious activities in relation to the crypto market last year were linked to various decentralized finance protocols after the immense amount of growth over the past year.In the past, most hacking schemes have, by and large, focused on stealing funds from cryptocurrency exchanges, for example, in 2014 and 2018, the amount of money compromised as a result of exchanges being hacked lay at $483 million and $875 million, respectively.However, an increasing number of miscreants are now turning their attention to stealing user data because it provides them with unique avenues to acquire funds with relative ease. Thus, it is of utmost importance that crypto owners learn how to protect their assets, using advanced tools not to fall prey to such breach attempts."
503,"The so-called Kimchi premium, which measures the premium of the Bitcoin (BTC) price in South Korea’s cryptocurrency exchange market, has plummeted.The premium declined from 22% to 15% within a matter of hours on April 7, and it is continuing to drop across major South Korean exchanges.As CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju noted, the price of Bitcoin fell particularly hard on South Korean exchanges.As the price of Bitcoin dropped, the Kimchi premium fell in tandem. But, since BTC’s price fell significantly harder on South Korean exchanges, the premium plunged quickly within a matter of hours.There are two possible reasons why the premium dropped in the manner that it did.First, traders from outside of South Korea might have found a way to successfully arbitrage the premium. One potential way this could happen is if traders from other Asian markets coordinate with whales in South Korea to sell BTC and withdraw on the same day.Second, altcoins that were increasingly gaining momentum throughout the week severely corrected. As the capital from the altcoin market exited, traders might have also sold BTC and Ether (ETH), bringing down the large-cap cryptocurrencies.Ju said:XRP, as an example, was consistently one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the South Korean market throughout the past week.As Cointelegraph reported, XRP broke out against Bitcoin, rising above $1 for the first time in over three years.But, as altcoins like XRP fell, it is possible that the market sentiment around Bitcoin and Ether also worsened in the Asian market, bringing down the premium.When the Kimchi premium fell substantially in 2017, the price of Bitcoin plummeted by more than 50% within several days.This time around, the price of Bitcoin dropped by 5% to $56,000 and started to recover fairly quickly thereafter. The probability of the cryptocurrency market recovering in the short term remains high because there were large liquidations in the past 48 hours.For example, a single Stellar Lumen (XLM) trade resulted in a liquidation worth $84 million. Given that well over $1 billion was liquidated in the last 24 hours, the crypto derivatives market is likely to reset.The funding rate of Bitcoin across major futures exchanges was around 0.15% before the drop. This is 15-fold higher than the default 0.01%, indicating that the derivatives market was extremely overheated.Though, as the chart above shows, the funding rates remain at relatively high levels, which suggests that the price may see more downside in the short term. "
504,"Bitcoin (BTC) extended its price drop on Wednesday amid warnings that excessive long positions needed to be flushed out to allow for fresh gains. Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD hitting new local lows of $55,760 during Wednesday trading. A second day of more substantial losses for the pair came as altcoins also began to reverse their earlier successes, with Ether (ETH) dropping below $2,000.A look at trader behavior pointed to leveraged long positions in place at previous spot price, indicating belief that further upside is more likely than another correction. These positions, analyst Filbfilb believes, need to be liquidated before Bitcoin can make a meaningful attempt at new all-time highs.The latest price action went some way to refreshing market composition — $2 billion in liquidations in the past 24 hours, $600 million of which in a single hour alone, according to data from monitoring resource Bybt.“A large inflow to a whale wallet happened at $55172 on the 23rd of March,” monitoring service Whalemap added, eyeing a possible floor.On altcoins, strong performance was in jeopardy at the time of writing, with Ether back below its historic $2,000 marker and heading away from all-time highs.XRP and Polkadot’s DOT were the biggest losers in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, shedding over 10% on the day. All but one of the top 50 tokens, excluding stablecoins, were in the red.Commenting, popular trader Scott Melker blamed overly sensitive traders.“Bitcoin sneezes and drops a few hundred dollars, edgy traders panic sell their alts like jabronis and Bitcoin Dominance rises. Good times,” he tweeted.Alts remain tipped for a dramatic return to form in summer, with Filbfilb even arguing that the second incarnation of “Alt Season” is already here."
505,"Changpeng Zhao, founder and CEO of the largest global cryptocurrency exchange Binance and one of the world’s top crypto billionaires, does not own much except crypto.“I’m one of those guys who value liquidity much more than owning something. I actually prefer not to own anything,” Zhao said in a Bloomberg interview on Wednesday.He noted that various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) now make up nearly 100% of his entire net worth as he does not own any real estate or much fiat holdings. When asked how much of his net worth is invested in crypto, Zhao said:Zhao said that it took him a while to ramp up his crypto portfolio. After buying his first Bitcoin, the CEO was in a big hurry to sell his apartment that he bought back in 2006 in Shanghai. “I sold my apartment to buy Bitcoin, and I also quit my job,” he said. ”You can rent an apartment or stay in a hotel — that gives you much higher liquidity,” Zhao added.The Binance CEO has previously claimed that he does not hold any fiat currencies. “I hold 0 fiat,” Zhao declared on Twitter in February, stating that he only converts crypto to fiat for payments that can only be made with traditional money. According to data from China’s Hurun Research Institute, Zhao is one of the world’s richest men in the crypto and blockchain industry, ranked the third-richest crypto billionaire with a total wealth estimated at $8 billion as of January 2021.

506,"The United States’ biggest crypto exchange would have made more money by simply buying and holding Bitcoin (BTC) in 2013. Data circulating on social media reveals that despite Coinbase’s $800-million profits in Q1, the company would still be richer had it used its seed funding cash to buy BTC.Ahead of its initial public offering on April 14, Coinbase reported bumper revenue this week. At $1.8 billion, Q1 outperformed the entirety of 2020.The numbers became an instant talking point as market participants weigh up the likely impact of the IPO launch. Other IPOs, including the recent Deliveroo sale, sparked sell-offs.Amid sky-high valuations and the associated buzz, however, it appears that all Coinbase had to do in order to outperform was to buy Bitcoin.Specifically, the exchange’s $30-million seed funding in 2013 would be worth up to $2 billion had it been converted to BTC at the time.By contrast, Coinbase’s lifetime profits total to date are estimated to be somewhere between $780 million and $1.3 billion.“Coinbase is going to list publicly in less than 10 days and reported blowout numbers today (~800m in profit on 1.8B on revenue),” developer Vijay Boyapati commented.As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin’s compound annual growth rate has topped 200%, and since April 2013, BTC/USD is up over 43,000%.Boyapati was touching on another, more controversial aspect of Coinbase’s business model to come to light this year. For all its success, executives have always chosen to hold a fairly modest amount of BTC.According to its recent filing with U.S. regulators, the exchange owns 4,486 BTC. By contrast, as Boyapati notes, newcomer MicroStrategy, despite not being an exchange, has bought in excess of 91,000 BTC since August last year — a stash that has doubled in U.S. dollar terms for the company to date. “It’s almost as if Coinbase doesn’t even believe in the industry in which they are one of the biggest players. Sad,” he added.Not everyone was convinced. Erik Voorhees, founder of crypto exchange service ShapeShift, argued that Coinbase’s contribution to the cryptocurrency phenomenon made it incomparable to MicroStrategy.“Imagine holding MicroStrategy in higher esteem than Coinbase. The latter struggled for eight years to build the most successful Bitcoin company in the world, serving 50 million people,” he responded to a tweet from Casa co-founder Jameson Lopp. Meanwhile, data on Wednesday showed a conspicuous spike in exchange outflows this week, a sign that long-term hodling and overall interest in buying Bitcoin is growing fast.“Are we in the market cycle high? No,” Ki Young Ju, CEO of on-chain analytics service CryptoQuant, which published the data, commented, highlighting the difference between the current climate and traditional Bitcoin cycle tops.Coinbase Pro, the professional trading arm of Coinbase, saw 12,000 BTC leave in a single transaction."
507,"United Kingdom-based Bitcoin (BTC) mining firm Argo Blockchain just recorded the best quarter in its history, generating record revenues for three months straight. Yet despite the burgeoning cryptocurrency mining venture emerging in the west, the vast majority of Bitcoin production still takes place in China, where cheap, coal-powered electricity fuels an untold number of mining rigs.A recent report by Nature.com revealed that as much as 75% of Bitcoin mining takes place in China — news which must fall hard on the ears of Shark Tank and Dragon’s Den investor Kevin O’Leary, who recently labeled all Bitcoin mined with the use of fossil fuels as “blood coin.”The investor went so far as to say that from now on, the only Bitcoin he would purchase and deal with would be “clean coin” — that is, Bitcoin sourced from miners who utilize green or renewable energy.O’Leary also claimed that institutional investors would soon begin to take notice of the environmental concerns involved when using Bitcoin and may soon begin to seek out “virgin” coins — i.e., those with their source of production already known and agreed upon beforehand.According to researchers at Nature, China’s greenhouse gas emissions from Bitcoin mining alone will have exceeded the total emissions of both the Czech Republic and Qatar combined by 2024:Helped by cheap fossil fuel energy and their close proximity to the epicenter of mining hardware production in South East Asia, Bitcoin miners in China dominate the global landscape in terms of generating BTC.“Due to the proximity to manufacturers of specialized hardware and access to cheap electricity, the majority of the mining process has been conducted in China as miners in the country account for more than 75% of the Bitcoin network’s hashing power,” states the report.In related news from closer to home, Argo Blockchain just notched up record revenues in three consecutive months, as the firm achieved its best financial quarter to date. Using renewable energy sources in operational centers based in Canada, Argo mined 387 BTC in the first quarter of 2021, with revenues exceeding 13.4 million British pounds ($18.5 million). The firm reportedly held 764 BTC in total as of the end of March.“I’m delighted that Argo has generated record mining revenue and profits for the third month in a row, making this quarter Argo’s best performing since the company’s inception,” said Argo chief executive Peter Wall.Argo recently announced it would set up a clean energy Bitcoin mining pool powered only by renewable, hydroelectric sources.The extent of “blood coin” production in China is hotly debated, not to mention, refuted, by many in the crypto space — and beyond. Recently, the mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, claimed that 90% of Bitcoin was sourced via “dirty” energy sources."
508,"According to digital asset investment manager CoinShares, the first quarter of 2021 hit a new record for institutional crypto product inflows.As reported in CoinShares’ Tuesday “Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly” bulletin, Q1 of this year hit a new record with $4.5 billion in inflows compared with $3.9 billion in the final quarter of 2020.It added that inflows for the past week recorded, which ended on Friday, totaled $106 million, helping push the total for the three-month period 11% higher than the previous quarter. The inflow was down on previous weeks, however, as the week ending March 12 recorded a $242-million inflow.While institutional inflows have slowed, CoinShares believes it is not indicative of a broader slowing trend, as quarterly growth rates tend to be varied.Inflows for the past week have been dominated by $83 million in Bitcoin (BTC) products, or 78% of the total, and $20 million in Ether (ETH). Overall volumes for Bitcoin investment products comprise a relatively small share of 6.7% of the total trading volume for regulated or “trusted” cryptocurrency exchanges.Assets under management for both active and passive crypto investment products are at an all-time high of $59 billion. Grayscale makes up the lion’s share of this AUM figure with $46 billion, or 78% of the total. The second-largest crypto asset fund is CoinShares itself with $5 billion in assets under management.The European digital asset investment firm has expanded its institutional products this week with the introduction of a physically backed Litecoin exchange-traded product. The new CoinShares investment product will be initially listed on Switzerland’s regulated crypto exchange, SIX Swiss Exchange.The Litecoin (LTC) ETP is the third institutional-grade product the firm has launched in 2021. It follows a physically backed Bitcoin ETP launched in January and a similar one for Ether in February.On Thursday, Cointelegraph reported that CoinShares had entered a partnership with Canadian investment fund manager 3iQ in order to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund in Canada.In April 2020, 3iQ launched Canada’s first institutional Bitcoin fund, and it currently has $1.7 billion in assets under management according to the CoinShares report."
509,"Coinbase has announced impressive first-quarter results one week before the exchange’s direct listing on Nasdaq, estimating that trading volume is up 276% and quarterly revenue has hit $1.8 billion.The bountiful revenue, revealed in the company’s Q1 earnings call, dwarfs its $190-million revenue from the same time last year, with the company attributing a portion of this explosive growth to Bitcoin’s (BTC) bull market.The American exchange estimated net income between $730 million and $800 million and an EBIDTA of approximately $1.1 billion.The bull market has also seen monthly active users grow to more than 6 million users, up from 1.3 million in the first quarter, with crypto assets on the platform rising 1,200% year-on-year from $17 billion to $223 billion.The U.S.-based exchange’s chief financial officer, Alesia Haas, said:Boasting 56 million verified users, Haas suggested that active monthly users could rise to 7 million at most this year, although she warned this could drop to 4 million if a bear market hits this year.The company is spending big to acquire new customers. Following next week’s listing, Coinbase intends to increase its sales and marketing expenditure to between 12% and 15% of this year’s net revenue in an effort to drive “meaningful growth in 2021.”The report results are preliminary and unaudited, however, the exchange wanted to release a detailed report prior to the Nasdaq listing set for April 14. The company will register nearly 115 million shares of Class A common stock under the ticker symbol COIN. As a direct listing, the exchange won’t be selling new stock and can only register existing stock, allowing existing stakeholders to sell their shares to new investors.Coinbase has received multiple valuations ranging from $68 billion based on private market transactions to more than $120 billion.Investment research firm New Constructs CEO David Trainer had his doubts about the lofty expectations. “Coinbase’s expected valuation of roughly $100 billion is far too high,” he said in a note to clients Monday.FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried took to Twitter to congratulate Coinbase on its impressive quarterly figures and upcoming IPO listing and compared it to his own, much newer exchange’s figures.5) FWIW, FTX likely had:

a) ~5-15% of the revenue
b) ~10-25% of the earnings
c) ~2x the volume
d) way fewer users
e) higher in-quarter growth
f) a bit higher year-on-year growth

510,"Bitcoin bulls are still struggling to push the price to a new high but the positive sign is that BTC has not corrected sharply in the past few days and the top-ranked cryptocurrency has held a market capitalization above $1 trillion since March 26. While many are wondering what Bitcoin’s next move will be, a Bloomberg Intelligence report by senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone projects that BTC will rally to $80,000 in the second quarter rather than slump to the $40,000 level.Bitcoin’s consolidation has not held back altcoins, which have continued their march higher over the past few weeks. Cointelegraph recently reported that the number of cryptocurrencies commanding a $1 billion market capitalization has doubled in the past two months to hit the 100 mark.Decentralized finance assets have also rallied significantly as the total value locked in DeFi reached $100 billion on April 6 according to data from DeFi Llama. At the start of the year, the TVL metric was only $20.74 billion, which shows there has been a massive amount of growth in the space.Keeping the focus on altcoins, let’s analyze the fundamentals of three tokens that have done well in the past few days.Celer Network’s CELR token was featured on Cointelegraph on March 16 when the price was at $0.059. Since then the token has continued its uptrend and hit a new all-time high at $0.103 on March 28, a further 74% rally in a short time.The DeFi space has been in focus in the past few months for its mouth-watering yields. However, surging Ethereum network fees have limited these benefits to larger players and retail-sized investors with less capital have missed out on many great investing opportunities.To address this problem, Celer announced the launch of Layer2.finance on Feb. 18, which claims to tremendously cut the cost of accessing DeFi. According to the team, the project is in its final stages of an audit and is expected to launch soon. If this succeeds, Celer could address one of the main problems that may is limiting the rise of DeFi.CELR has been in a correction since topping out at $0.103 on March 28. The pullback has reached the 20-day exponential moving average ($0.071) but the bulls are struggling to defend this level.This suggests that the bullish sentiment has weakened and traders are not rushing to buy the dips. The flattening 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) below 54 points to a possible range-bound action in the short term.If the buyers defend the $0.065 support, the CELR/USDT pair could attempt to resume the up-move but it is likely to meet stiff resistance at $0.087 and then $0.095. However, if the bulls propel the price above $0.103, the pair could rally to $0.122 and then $0.155.On the downside, if the bears sink the price below $0.065, the decline could extend to the next support at the 50-day simple moving average ($0.047). Such a deep correction usually delays the start of the next leg of the uptrend.Cartesi (CTSI) aims to take the traditional tools used by the developer community and merge them with decentralized tools. This could attract several developers to decentralization who are currently held back due to the different programming languages being used for blockchain. Additionally, the team believes that their technology could increase the computational power of certain applications by 10,000%.In the past couple of months, Cartesi has announced partnerships with Injective, Travala, IOTA, Polygon, Elrond, and Avalanche. Over the next few weeks and months, the crypto community will keenly watch Cartesi’s layer-2 technology to see if it can enhance computational throughput and implement processing-intensive applications without compromising security.CTSI has been in an uptrend for the past few weeks. It rallied from an intraday low at $0.077 on Feb. 8 to an intraday high at $0.896 on April 4, a 1,063% rally within two months.However, after the sharp rally of the past few days, the CTSI/USDT pair is currently witnessing profit-booking. The bears have pulled the price below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.583 and the next support is the 50% retracement level at $0.486.If the pair rebounds off the $0.486 level, it will be a bullish sign as it will show that the previous resistance of $0.466 has flipped to support. The bulls will then try to resume the uptrend but are likely to be met with heavy selling near $0.65.If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair could remain range-bound for a few days. A breakout and close above $0.65 will be the first indication that the bulls are attempting a comeback. On the other hand, a break below $0.466 could signal a possible change in trend.Compound (COMP) continues to grow stronger despite setbacks in the DeFi sector. On Feb. 21, the protocol reported a total supply of $10 billion, which has since then surged to over $15 billion on April 3. The protocol continues to lead the DeFi rankings with a total value locked at $9.53 billion.On March 1, Compound announced the launch of Gateway, a Substrate blockchain, which the team believes will eventually evolve into the backbone of a global interest rate market that is capable of supporting any asset.on March 26 Compound Labs founder and CEO Robert Leshner tweeted that he had given a DeFi presentation to Federal Reserve staff. This is a major first step as it shows that the leading central bank in the world is interested to know m about DeFi.On April 3, Compound received 629,000 Ether ($1.3 billion) from an anonymous whale and many suspect that this is proof that major institutions are jumping into DeFi.COMP rallied from an intraday low at $330 on March 25 to an intraday high at $562.85 on April 4, a 70% rally within a short time. The bears are aggressively defending the overhead resistance zone between $558 and $573.The COMP/USDT pair is stuck inside a large range between $320 and $558. The current pullback could find support at the 20-day EMA ($444), which has started to turn up. If the pair rebounds off this level, the bulls will once again try to push the price above the overhead zone.If the bulls succeed, the pair could start the next leg of the uptrend which has a target objective at $796.Contrary to this assumption, if the price slips below the moving averages, it could extend the decline and reach the support at $320. A break below this critical support could intensify selling and pull the price down to $200.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

511,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been trying to break the $60,000 resistance for the past 23 days. Generally, investors don’t seem too worried about this, as they consider it a healthy consolidation period, and even recent analysis from JPMorgan Chase estimates that Bitcoin price will reach $130,000. Even as most investors expect the price of Bitcoin to rise above $100,000, derivatives data shows $2.52 billion worth of ultra-bearish options from the $40,000–$50,000 range.At the moment, there are multiple signals that the crypto market is overheating. There is an 11% BTC price premium in South Korean markets, and this week, Cointelegraph reported that there are 100 cryptocurrencies with a $1 billion market capitalization.As a comparison, just two months ago, this figure stood at 51. The combined altcoin market capitalization surged to $800 billion from $450 billion in 60 days. Thus, buying protective put options makes sense, especially during these periods of relatively low volatility.Even though a 60% average historical volatility is not mild, this is the lowest the metric has been in four months. To understand how high this figure actually is, one can look at the historical volatility of iShares expanded tech-software exchange-traded fund, IGV, which currently stands at 42% — its highest in 11 months.Bitcoin’s high volatility causes options to trade at very high premiums, making buying downside protection quite costly. For example, a $44,000 put option for April 30 is currently trading at 0.007 BTC, equivalent to $411 at the current $58,800 price.The total open interest between $40,000 and $52,000 put options totals 42,800 BTC contracts. This is equivalent to $2.52 billion at the current $58,800 price. Although there are multiple expiry dates involved, to put things in perspective, these 42,800 put options for the May 28 expiry would cost $56.4 million today.The data shows that some wealthy players are betting on ultra-bearish BTC options, but primarily as protection against the chance of downside given the state of the ""overheating"" market. Traders should also factor in the bullish call options between the $80,000 and $100,000 strikes.The ultra-bullish call options total 24,500 BTC contracts, equal to $1.44 billion in open interest. Had these been bought for the May 28 expiry, these would cost $30.4 million today.Although looking at the extremes might paint a bearish picture, traders should remember that the call and put options between $50,000 and $66,000 are balanced. Therefore, at the moment, there is little incentive to drive the price either way regarding options markets.Buying protective puts for an unexpected downside or buying ultra-bullish call options do not necessarily imply that investors are betting that these wild price swings will occur. Hedging a portfolio allows a trader to further increase their positions with less risk from high volatility.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

512,"Cryptocurrency books aimed at novice users or non-users tend to follow a very similar pattern. Almost all start with an obligatory “history of money” and explain why fiat is, let's say, ""flawed,"" — to be polite. Then Bitcoin (BTC) in introduced, wielding a fistful of shiny new tech that can address some of these issues.The books go into mining, wallets, exchanges, Ethereum and smart contracts, altcoins and decentralized finance — also known as DeFi. Once the authors are sure that the reader is sold on the idea of buying into crypto, they wrap it nicely up with a (foregone) conclusion and settle smugly back down.However, even equipped with the desire (and know-how) to buy their first cryptocurrency, the reader may still feel there is a barrier to taking the next step. In fact, once the purchasing decision has been made, a whole new raft of questions crop up tha a savvy crypto convert will want answered.How much should I spend? What strategies are open to me? Should I invest or consider trading? How can I maximize gains while minimizing risk? Few books delve deep enough into such territory to give a reader the confidence to enter the market with at least half an idea of what they are doing.Digital Assets: Your Guide to Investing and Trading in the New Crypto Market aims to fill that gap. Written by Jonathan Hobbs, an investment industry veteran turned independent advisor, the book is divided into two parts.Admittedly, the first part kicks off as expected with cash-bashing; but in fairness, it would be hard to leave this out of a crypto book aimed at beginners. And let’s be honest, it never gets old to hear how bad the traditional financial system really is.Hobbs then gives the lowdown on Bitcoin, but only so much as to show that it can be trusted, that it is a hedge against inflation and that there is a reason for it to continue to appreciate in value over the long term.Ethereum and DeFi are similarly explained from an investor's perspective, such as how money can be made through staking tokens on lending platforms, trading derivatives or providing exchange liquidity.Part One is rounded out with a couple of chapters on how the range and accessibility of crypto products have much improved, for both institutional and retail investors. The development of institutional-grade custody solutions and crypto-exposed funds and trusts has finally opened the floodgates to an increasing amount of institutional and corporate money.Improvements in the security and functionality of retail exchanges and wallet solutions, along with the rise of DeFi, cater to the needs of individual investors like never before, and this gets us to the point at which we are left off by most of the other books.Luckily, this is where Digital Assets is just getting started. The longer Part Two deals with all the nitty-gritty on trading and investing, starting with the question of how much of one's assets should be held in crypto.Hobbs explains the importance of a diverse investment portfolio and compares the historical returns on various proportions of stocks, and having up to 10% in Bitcoin. Certain readers may be dismayed to hear that due to crypto’s volatility, he does not recommend putting too much of one’s nest egg into it.Digital Assets also provides examples showing the effect that rebalancing a portfolio can have on reducing risk and exposure to volatility.The book continues on to crypto investment strategies, covering the ever-popular HODLing, dollar-cost averaging and the more aggressive value averaging. The potential results of each are illustrated with examples using real historical data over various time frames.And then, it gets started with the big kid stuff...If you are an average enthusiast, technical analysis will be a baffling source of confusion. Of course, some may understand what a ""falling wedge"" is, what ""flipping resistance into support"" means and the importance of the ""20-week moving average.""But you will have no idea why these things affect Bitcoin's price the way they do, and hence, you will have no real faith that you can use them to predict future action. Correction: By this point, you should have some idea.Hobbs’ primer on reading charts, identifying trends, moving averages, trading volume and Fibonacci retracements makes it seem like technical analysis is something that can actually be done, or at least learned over time.Digital Assets goes on to explain how one can profit from Bitcoin’s volatility by trading short or long on futures contracts. It shows how to read candlestick charts and describes a number of trading styles, along with their associated trading time frames.Of course, mitigating risk is just as important as taking profits, and there are techniques given to do so using stop losses, position sizing strategies and the various types of orders that can be placed on exchanges. Hobbs also explains when to use leverage, when to enter and exit a trade, and when to take profits.The last few sections of Digital Assets examine the potential to incorporate altcoins into a crypto portfolio, explain the basics of options trading, and give guidance on how to tie all of this together into a personal investment strategy.The book has an easily accessible style, with plenty of diagrams and real-world examples to illustrate the pros, cons, and potential risks and returns of each of the various methods of investing and trading. Some of the concepts around stops losses and hedging Bitcoin options took a few reads to fully understand, but as well they might.If really digging for things to criticize, it would be the examples that use Trader A through Trader D to compare the different strategies, which was occasionally confusing. However, this was not half as confusing as it was when Hobbs chose to get creative with his character names — by the end of the options chapter, it was hard to remember who was who among Lagertha, Ragnar and Uthred.In conclusion, while it may not offer as much to those who are already pro traders, Digital Assets is pretty much essential reading for those who have been tempted to dabble in trading but never quite had the confidence. You may find that you are shorting perpetual futures while hedging with a protective call option in no time… and I might just see you there.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph."
513,"A group of Russian lobbyists led by the law firm Digital Rights Center has launched a new campaign against regulatory initiatives that it feels are impeding cryptocurrency adoption in the country.The group has created a platform designed to help resist the adoption of laws that hamper the turnover of cryptocurrencies and digital assets in Russia, Digital Rights Center announced Tuesday. Other founding members of the initiative include the Commission on Blockchain Technologies and Digital Economy, the Russianwide public organization Investment Russia and the nonprofit organization RosComSvoboda.Called the “Public initiative of the crypto community in Russia,” the campaign argues that the proposed regulations of digital currencies in Russia “do not meet the needs of the market.”“New laws complicate the use of cryptocurrencies in Russia and slow down the development of the distributed finance market,” the lobby group wrote. The activists emphasized that Russia’s existing laws and bills prohibit the use of cryptocurrencies as payment and propose major penalties and jail terms up to three years for failing to report one's crypto holdings.The group has also initiated a public petition that is directed toward major Russian regulators including the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Development, the Bank of Russia, the Federal Taxation Service and the Russian State Duma Committee on Financial Markets.Available on the petition service Change.org, the petition calls on the authorities to reconsider their approach to regulating crypto in the country. They also hope to prevent the adoption of four separate crypto-related regulatory initiatives, including Russia’s new crypto taxation bill plan. The State Duma approved the bill in the first reading in February.The new petition comes amid reports that the Russian Federal Taxation Service intends to require citizens to inform authorities if they hold cryptocurrencies. The regulator plans to enforce this requirement as part of the federal bill on crypto taxes, according to an alleged letter to Data Economy — a local autonomous nonprofit organization."
514,"“Bitcoin” had been an unfamiliar term to many individuals just a few years ago. While cryptocurrency continued to enter the mainstream, Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and other digital assets were being discussed more frequently. Recently, “Bitcoin” searches across Google hit a record high in 2020, and “Buy Crypto” searches surged for the first time at the beginning of this year, further demonstrating the mainstream interest.It's also important to note that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general have been gaining traction with the younger generations. For instance, a number of television shows for youngsters have started mentioning Bitcoin. Most recently, the popular British television series Teletubbies sent a tweet from its official account announcing that it will be minting an NFT for sale with the proceeds going to a charity.While adoption is underway, the majority of children and teens, and many adults, remain uneducated when it comes to the use of cryptocurrencies and blockchains. A large reason for this is due to the fact that financial education is not a part of the school curriculum in some countries.Vignesh Kamath, an A-level student living in Scunthorpe, England wrote a feature for Cointelegraph Magazine last year explaining this dilemma. Kamath noted that “Despite the clear necessity of these skills, school curricula in most countries lack a comprehensive approach towards financial education.”The most recent ""Young Persons’ Money Index,"" a United Kingdom-based yearly report examining the financial capability of young people, found that 83% of young people want to learn about money and finance in school, while 75% said that their financial literacy comes from their parents. The report also shows that very few students currently use Bitcoin or other digital assets as financial products.With this in mind, it is noteworthy that new platforms catered toward Generation Z are being developed to help students learn about cryptocurrency and blockchain.The cryptocurrency exchange and custodian Gemini recently partnered with Learn & Earn, an app that allows students to learn about financial literacy, while earning fiat rewards. Cameron Winklevoss, president and co-founder of Gemini, told Cointelegraph that he is excited to foster crypto education within the younger generations through this partnership:Michael Gleason, CEO of Learn & Earn, told Cointelegraph that the app was initially inspired by Junior Achievement, a nonprofit that prepares young people for success and seeks innovative ways to reach K-12 students to teach financial literacy, entrepreneurship and work readiness. Gleason explained that the project has evolved into a micro-learning platform that offers quick courses for the ""TikTok generation,"" helping students understand crypto and blockchain, while earning fiat rewards.According to Gleason, the crypto courses and in-app content are growing quickly and evolving with the space. “The course demand for blockchain-based knowledge is some of the highest we’ve seen and driven by students who are eager,” he said.Related: What is Bitcoin, and how does it work?Gemini sponsors all crypto courses, explaining what it is, the different kinds of crypto and its history. It will educate the youth on topics such as digital wallets, decentralized finance, and the growing acceptance and future for cryptocurrency.While the app takes a strong focus on crypto education, Gleason noted that the overall goal of Learn & Earn is to help students save and invest, thus learning more about finance. This is achieved by allowing United States-based K-12 students to earn money upon completion of each course. Students then invest their earnings in UTMA/UGMA-approved investment accounts to keep their portfolio diversified and growing over time, which they can access once they are 18 years old. Gleason explained:While fiat rewards are currently being offered to young learners, Gleason mentioned that an option to earn crypto within the app will soon be available. “Students may also be able to earn non-fungible tokens in the future, we are working on the vision.”In addition to Learn & Earn, crypto education is progressing in various U.S. states. Most recently, the Georgia House of Representatives passed a bill that requires financial literacy courses in high school curricula. The bill was sponsored by six State House candidates and has been sent to the State Senate for further consideration. The program mentioned in this bill includes 16 areas of financial literacy, including cryptocurrency as the final priority.Social media influencers are also doing their part to ensure crypto education for young adults. Micro-influencer Miss Teen Crypto told Cointelegraph that her interest for crypto stemmed from her father’s involvement in the space:Miss Teen Crypto realized that Bitcoin was the new store of value and started Googling questions to learn more about blockchain. “I then wondered why no one my age knew about this amazing new way of digital transactions, along with other emerging blockchain technology, which is why I created my social media accounts.”Her goal is to spread awareness and education about crypto adoption to the younger generation. She has been doing this by giving out physical seed cards — scannable educational cards with information on BTC, ETH and other cryptocurrencies — to people around Manhattan. She also has a website with helpful videos for crypto newcomers.Despite the innovation for crypto education, some have pointed out that parents may be hesitant to let their children or teenagers learn about digital assets or blockchains.For instance, Gleason mentioned that while the Learn & Earn platform is easy for students to use and interest remains high, the parent account registration has become a challenge. “Acquiring student users is easier with a partner like Junior Achievement, but the difficult part is getting parents/adults to set up the UTMA/UGMA accounts,” he explained.Related: What is cryptocurrency? A guide for beginnersMiss Teen Crypto noted that she has noticed a big change regarding parental opinions toward crypto in the past year. “Many are starting to see Bitcoin as more of an investment, whereas many I've talked to have thought of it as a scam.” She pointed to the lack of adoption as the reason behind this, adding that “many are seeing companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet, accepting Bitcoin as payment as well as many news stations covering Bitcoin.”"
515,"Bitcoin (BTC) reversed recent gains to lose 1.5% on April 6 as bulls were kept frustrated with no sign of an attack on all-time highs Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed local lows of $57,340 hitting during Tuesday after another failed attempt at tackling $60,000 resistance.Despite being a matter of thousands of dollars away from all-time highs of $61,700, BTC/USD has been unable to drive sellers away for good. While thinning out, the last band of resistance has remained in place.This slowdown in the 2020–2021 bull market has alarmed some, but professional analysts remain steadfast in their optimistic appraisals of the largest cryptocurrency.Among them is Bloomberg Intelligence, which on Tuesday predicted that the second quarter was more likely to deliver a further surge to $80,000 than a capitulatory move to $40,000.A new report reads: ""Adoption of the benchmark crypto as a global reserve asset has crossed the mainstream threshold, as we see it, and the market tide is rising. This scenario has switched the focal point of our 2021 analysis toward more-technical indicators from a wider range of fundamental and on-chain metrics in the past few years.""Bloomberg senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone, who authored the report, is well known as a Bitcoin bull, and his perspective chimes with that of various analytics resources coming out with their own reasons to be confident in the market.Continuing, he noted that in terms of a reserve asset, Bitcoin is usurping ground that used to be reserved for gold. The precious metal ""will always have a place in jewelry and coin collections,"" he argued, ""but most indicators point to an accelerating pace of Bitcoin replacing the metal as a store of value in investor portfolios.""""Bitcoin's fundamental and technical underpinnings are improving while gold's deteriorate,"" the report summarized.Meanwhile, altcoins had even more to celebrate than the average Bitcoin investor on the day, as large-cap cryptocurrencies added to strong weekly growth.Among them was Ether (ETH), fresh from new all-time highs around $2,150, and XRP, which broke the $1 barrier for the first time since 2018 before correcting. Binance Coin (BNB), the second-largest altcoin by market cap, gained 3.4% to hit $388, sealing weekly gains of over 33%.""Large Cap Altcoins are waking up,"" popular Twitter trader Rekt Capital announced.An accompanying graphic suggested that smaller altcoins would feel the benefit once larger coins had outperformed. As Cointelegraph reported, altcoins traditionally do best once Bitcoin has spent a reasonable length of time consolidating after a bull run.Bitcoin market cap dominance stood at 55.1% on the day, its lowest since May 2019."
516,"Institutions should start buying Bitcoin (BTC) again, leading analyst PlanB has said as one exchange sees a fresh $250-million withdrawal.In a tweet on Tuesday, PlanB argued that conditions were now right for buyers to continue accumulating BTC with confidence.BTC/USD had seen a lack of momentum over the weekend, culminating in a dive to near $56,000. With resistance near all-time highs of $61,700 now at its lowest since the time that level was first reached, it may now pay to be bullish.In addition, multiple on-chain indicators suggest that sellers are exhausted. This capitalizes on an existing narrative that favors hodling, not short-notice trading or selling, as the prime strategy for Bitcoin investors.“Now that all Pi-cycle, Wave, Rainbow and NUPL fans have sold their bitcoin, it is probably time for institutions to resume buying into Q2,” PlanB wrote, highlighting four indicators.Of these, the so-called “Rainbow” price chart, which categorizes spot price in terms of investor sentiment, highly favored hodling this week, as well as buying more BTC at current prices. An interesting comparison is with the top of the two previous bull markets in late 2013 and late 2017. Then, Rainbow signaled a bubble-like top forming, with the implication that hodlers should take profit. Since current readings are far from such a peak, the indicator suggests that the current price gains still have a long way to go before the bull cycle top is in.As Cointelegraph reported, PlanB’s stock-to-flow Bitcoin price models call for $100,000 and more this year, with as much as $576,000 and higher hitting during the current halving cycle ending in 2024.Meanwhile, proof that institutions are still interested may already be in.On Monday, professional client-focused exchange Gemini, saw $257 million in BTC leave its holdings in a 10-minute period. These large outflows have characterized recent months and, along with the success of instruments such as the Purpose Bitcoin ETF, hint that demand shows no sign of stopping at near $60,000 per coin.Across exchanges, reserves of BTC are still falling, down below 2.3 million as of this week.According to data from on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode corroborated by Whalemap, buyer support more broadly is continuing to cement itself at $57,000, reducing the likelihood of deeper price dips."
517,"Did you know that between 2012 and 2020, over 3,000 blockchain venture capital deals occurred across the world? Cointelegraph Research has built the most comprehensive data set of all blockchain venture capital to date. Covering over $16 billion invested by 928 different angels, VCs, incubators and corporates, the new 59-page report is the most in-depth analysis ever written on the blockchain VC industry. “The Cointelegraph Blockchain Venture Capital Report” contains exclusive interviews with the most influential VCs including Etiënne vantKruys of TRGC, Jin Kang of #Hashed, Alon Goren from the Draper Goren Holm Fund, Stephan Wong from PNYX Ventures, Camron Miraftab of Rarestone Capital, Michael Anderson of Framework Ventures, and Ryan Taylor of the Dash Investment Foundation.Read the full report here.The report is divided into three major sections including information relevant for startups, venture capitalists (general partners) and investors (limited partners). The following are highlights from the report.Projects with coins that were popular for Blockchain VC deals included: Avalanche (AVAX), Curve (CRV), DerivaDEX (DDX), Nervos Network (CKB), and Zilliqa (ZIL), just to name a few.Many blockchain VC funds have outperformed traditional VC funds. While traditional funds have had returns in the low double digits, several blockchain venture capital funds have earned 10 times that. Apart from the staggering returns, blockchain-focused VC funds have also enjoyed a low correlation with traditional asset classes.For example, Blockchain Capital’s BCAP token’s correlation with stock indexes has been in the 0.00–0.14 range. The diversification potential for investors interested in venture capital is loud and clear.VC investments in the blockchain industry came under serious economic pressure during COVID-19. Blockchain VC investments decreased by 13% between 2019 and 2020, while traditional VC investment increased by 18%. The global amount invested in blockchain VC dropped from $3.17 billion in 2019 to $2.77 billion in 2020.In 2020, the hot trend for blockchain VC deals was decentralized finance. More than 200 venture and hedge funds bet on the future of 100+ DeFi projects. Currently, over $20 billion in capital is locked into DeFi protocols.To learn more about how to get involved with DeFi, read Cointelegraph Consulting’s Definitive guide on DeFi here.For firms that are in their Series A funding round and beyond, price to sales (P/S), price to book (P/B) and price to earnings per share (P/E) are common comparative analysis multiples used to value blockchain private equity. The valuations of some private crypto companies are astronomically higher than the FANG stocks. For example, one crypto company raised capital with a P/E ratio of 110.To put this into comparison, Apple’s P/E ratio during the coronavirus was hovering around 24 but reached a maximum of 41.93 in December 2020. However, this is comparing apples to oranges to some degree. Nevertheless, VCs backing startups at multiples near record highs implies that those investees will have to generate more capital than they received — and they will have to do so in a highly volatile environment.To learn about which sectors these trendsetting blockchain VCs think will be hot in 2021, read the full report.

518,"INX Limited, a Gibraltar-based platform for trading securities and cryptocurrencies, is preparing to finish its initial public offering soon.According to a Monday announcement, April 22 will be the last day of INX’s IPO as the company expects to have listed its token on at least one public trading platform by the end of May 2021. INX plans to launch the INX Digital trading platform shortly after the IPO ends, the firm said.INX launched the IPO in August 2020, planning to raise up to $117 million in a security token offering approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. INX CEO Shy Datika said that the company “has secured its position as the first to execute an SEC-registered digital security IPO for both retail and institutional investors.” INX did not specify how much the firm has raised with its IPO so far. The company did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, INX originally expected to finish the IPO by the end of 2020, having raised a total of $10 million as of late October.Within its IPO, the firm has been accepting payments in major cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), as well as U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin USD Coin (USDC). When INX introduced the crypto payment option in September 2020, Bitcoin and Ether were trading at around $10,500 and $380, respectively. Both cryptocurrencies have seen massive growth amid a major rally on crypto markets, up more than 500% since September, trading at $58,577 and $2,099 at the time of writing, respectively.INX is finishing its IPO as major U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase prepares to go public with a direct stock listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The firm expects to launch its Class A common stock trading under the ticker symbol “COIN” on April 14."
519,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to break the $60,000 resistance level after more than a week of ranging.Whale clusters show that $57,046 and $60,045 are the crucial support and resistance areas in the short term. In other words, the probability of a strong breakout in the foreseeable future would increase substantially if Bitcoin stays above $57,046 and continues to test $60,000 resistance.Whale clusters form when high-net-worth investors buy or sell Bitcoin at a certain price and do not move their holdings thereafter.As such, a whale cluster support typically serves as a strong macro support area for Bitcoin because whales tend to buy more when BTC falls to a level where they initially bought BTC.On the flip side, a whale cluster resistance area would likely hold up as a sell area because whales are more likely to wait until their breakeven price to sell their positions.According to researchers at Whalemap, the two key resistance levels for Bitcoin in the near term are $60,045 and $61,062. On Wednesday, the researchers noted:Since then, the price of Bitcoin has been ranging and consolidating between the resistance level and the $57,000 support.Based on this trend, the researchers added that this could be the calm before the storm, anticipating a spike in Bitcoin’s volatility, which is currently at the lowest levels since November 2020. They wrote:According to the pseudonymous trader known as Byzantine General, the Bitcoin futures market is becoming extremely overheated. The derivatives market is surging while the BTC futures funding rate is consistently spiking above 0.12%.On average, the default futures funding rate of Bitcoin is 0.01%, so the market is overheated by around 12-fold. The trader said:A trader known as NekoZ stated that the technical market structure of Bitcoin on the 4-hour chart indicates that BTC could consolidate longer, but he is not bearish in the near term.The trader said:Traders generally echo the sentiment that Bitcoin could see a minor pullback to reset from the overheating derivatives market, but the macro technical structure remains optimistic."
520,"Officials in Singapore have issued a notice to would-be Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency investors, warning them of the dangers of engaging with such a volatile market.Notably, the warning comes just 48 hours after Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong had his likeness appropriated by a user on the BitClout social token platform, who used the PM’s name to sell tokens worth a near combined $10,000.On Tuesday, the chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, warned of the inherent risks involved in speculating in the cryptocurrency space, asserting that their value was not tied to any underlying fundamentals. Shanmugaratnam said retail investors should stay away.“Cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile, as their value is typically not related to any economic fundamentals. They are hence highly risky as investment products, and certainly not suitable for retail investors,” said Shanmugaratnam, as reported by BNN Bloomberg.A couple of days earlier, Singaporean Prime Minister Loong warned citizens to remain vigilant when it comes to cryptocurrency investing after tokens were minted bearing his name, likeness and social media profile.Bitcoin’s 1,000% growth in the past year has drawn out numerous government warnings such as those issued by Loong and Shanmugaratnam. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more broadly are forcing regulators to take notice as their swelling market caps raise them out of “fringe asset” status and legitimize them in the eyes of investors.Shanmugaratnam said the MAS would continue to monitor cryptocurrency developments closely and will attempt to keep up the regulatory pace as technological progress continues.“The crypto assets space is constantly evolving. MAS has been closely monitoring developments and will continue to adapt its rules as needed to ensure that regulation remains effective and commensurate with the risks posed,” said Shanmugaratnam. “Investors, on their part, should exercise extreme caution when trading cryptocurrencies,” he added."
521,"More than 10% of Bitcoin’s supply has been moved while its market capitalization has been more than a trillion dollars since March 26, indicating strong support in the middle- and upper-$50,000 price range.According to Monday’s “Week On-chain” report from on-chain analytics provider Glassnode, Bitcoin (BTC) has enjoyed a $1-trillion market capitalization for more than one week for the first time. “This is a strong vote of confidence for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency asset class as a whole,” the report said.Glassnode also noted that 1.98 million BTC have moved on-chain, while Bitcoin’s capitalization has held above $1 trillion, equal to 10.6% of the circulating supply. The report noted the mid-to-high $50,000 range has shown the strongest on-chain support since prices were roughly $11,000:Bitcoin’s market cap first broke its $1-trillion milestone on Feb. 19 but quickly dipped back below to 12-figures for the following 17 days. BTC tagged 13-figures again on March 9, but another correction dropped Bitcoin’s capitalization back to $950 billion.Bitcoin’s capitalization has now remained above $1 trillion since March 26 and is currently sitting at $1.1 trillion, according to CoinGecko.Glassnode analyzed Bitcoin’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution, or URPD, to show significant recent volumes above a $1-trillion capitalization for BTC.The report notes that Bitcoin miners have returned to “accumulation mode,” signaling further bullishness as miners are again hodling their newly minted coins for higher prices.At the time of writing, Bitcoin was changing hands for $59,030, up 1.9% over the past 24 hours."
522,"Gemini, the U.S.-based crypto exchange and custodian founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, has announced it will provide custody services for the forthcoming Bitcoin fund from Brazil’s top investment bank, BTG Pactual.An April 5 announcement indicates Gemini’s subsidiaries, Gemini Custody and Gemini Fund Solutions, will provide customized services for the fund. The post also notes a philosophical alignment between the two firms.Approved last month, BTG Pactual’s Bitcoin 20 Multi-Market Investment Fund became the first fund launched by a Brazilian investment bank that offers exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) when it went live on Monday.The fund invests 20% of its assets under management into Bitcoin, with Gemini tasked with securely storing the coins. The fund also allocates 55% of its AUM into treasury bonds, 20% into bank deposit certificates and 5% into repo operations.All of BTG Pactual’s customers can access the fund, with a minimum investment set at just one Brazilian real (roughly $0.18) and an annual administrative fee of 0.5%.According to a rough translation, BTG Pactual Asset Management’s Will Landers emphasized the bank’s desire to “democratize investment in Bitcoin” through a product that is “accessible in terms of cost” to investors.BTG Pactual has been recently extolling the virtues of digital assets, with the bank’s managing partner, Marcelo Flora, revealing the bank had begun compiling an education video series on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency last month.“In three episodes, we will tell the history of Bitcoin, institutional adoption, how to invest, how the blockchain works, and what stage of technological adoption curve it is in now,” Flora posted to LinkedIn.BTG Pactual has long been eying innovations in the crypto sector, with the firm launching real estate-backed security tokens in 2019."
523,"If this past weekend is any indication of the current bull market cycle, then an altcoin season may be well underway. Similar to previous cycles, after Bitcoin (BTC) makes a significant run-up in price and then enters a consolidation period, funds begin to migrate into large and small market cap altcoins. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that while Bitcoin traded in a range between $57,000 and $60,200 over the past week, multiple altcoins saw double-digit gains as exchange listings and protocol developments brought a new wave of enthusiasm and trading volume for select projects.Tokens in the Tron ecosystem saw a noticeable uptick in their trading volumes over the past two days, with the gambling-focused Wink token experiencing the biggest growth as it surged 325% from $0.00059 on Saturday to a new all-time high of $0.0025 on Monday.BitTorrent (BTT) also saw an influx of buying beginning on Sunday that lifted the price more than 100% from a low of $0.0067 to a new record high of $0.0136 on Monday. The price of Tron (TRX) grew by 48% during the same period, climbing from $0.0997 to its current price near $0.147.It wasn’t just Tron-based projects that caught traders’ attention over the weekend and on Monday.The India-based crypto exchange WazirX saw its native token (WRX) grow by more than 350% over the past two days, catapulting from a low of $1.47 to a new all-time high of $5.88 on Monday thanks to a record $2 billion in trading volume.Holochain (HOT), a decentralized peer-to-peer platform for decentralized applications, has seen its price rally 350% since the March 25 announcement that Holo Limited was granted a U.S. patent for its rrDHT networking innovations. Since the announcement, HOT has rallied from $0.21 to $0.31.A new listing on Upbit Global also sparked a 150% rally in the price of Stacks (STX) as it moved from $1.13 on Sunday to an intraday high of $2.85 before profit-taking dropped the price down to $2.20.According to analysis from Jarvis Labs co-founder Ben Lilly, on-chain metrics indicate a solid base of support for Bitcoin’s price, with the only headwinds coming as a result of volatility in funding rates “as soon as there is any sort of pump.”Due to this reaction, Lilly sees a possible retest of the $54,000 level to “grind away some of the FOMO” still found at that level, but he doesn’t see the price dropping any lower due to solid on-chain support at this level.Lilly said:At the time of writing, BTC is trading at a price of $59,200, with the Bitcoin dominance rate at 55.7%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

524,"The total crypto market capitalization reached the important milestone of $2 trillion on April 5. As cryptocurrencies increase in value, they are likely to attract further investments from institutional investors because they can no longer afford to neglect it. Less than three months ago, the crypto market had reached the $1 trillion in market cap for the first time ever. This rate of growth shows that investors are hugely bullish on the potential of the sector and the ones who delay their investment decisions may have to enter at much higher levels.Ark Invest founder and CEO Cathie Wood is well known for identifying disruptive technologies and the firm is backing Bitcoin (BTC) to do just that. Yassine Elmandjra, a crypto asset analyst at Ark, said Bitcoin was “100 times better” than gold, hence he believes Bitcoin will rise 10-fold from the current market capitalization of $1 trillion to match gold’s $10-trillion market cap.For Bitcoin to continue its northward journey, the institutions will have to continue pumping money into it. Purpose Bitcoin ETF, Canada’s first licensed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) launched two months ago and currently, it holds 16,462 BTC.If a Bitcoin ETF gets the approval of the regulators in the United States, it could attract huge investments, dwarfing the inflows into the Purpose Bitcoin ETF.The crypto story has widened beyond Bitcoin. Data from business analytics firm CB Insights showed crypto and blockchain technology-focused startups received $2.6 billion in funding in Q1 2021. This is way above the total funding of $2.3 billion received in 2020, indicating the growing interest in the sector.So the question on the minds of most investors is whether or not the crypto market will be able to sustain its current momentum. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin has bounced off the 20-day exponential moving average ($56,750) today, which suggests that the sentiment remains positive and the bulls are buying on every minor dip.The buyers will now try to push the price above the $60,000 to $61,825.84 overhead resistance zone. If they succeed, it could open the doors for a rally to $69,540 and then $79,566.However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will once again try to stall the rally in the resistance zone. If that happens, the possibility of a break below the 20-day EMA increases.That could result in a drop to the critical support at the 50-day simple moving average ($53,978). If the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA, the pair could drop to the next support at $50,460.02.Ether (ETH) made a new all-time high at $2,144.59 on April 2. However, the bulls could not build upon this move as the bears sold aggressively and pulled the price back below the breakout level at $2,040.77 on April 3.Since then, both the bulls and the bears have been battling it out near $2,040.77. While the bulls are attempting to flip this level into support, the bears are trying to pull the price below it and trap the bulls.The rising 20-day EMA ($1,872) and the relative strength index (RSI) above 65 suggest the bulls have the upper hand. If the buyers succeed in pushing the price above $2,144.59, the ETH/USDT pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $2,618.14.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears pull the price below $1,977, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA. A break below this level will suggest the bullish momentum has weakened and could result in a decline to the trendline.Binance Coin (BNB) cleared the $348.69 to $356.98 overhead resistance zone today and made a new all-time high. Whenever an asset class hits a new all-time high, it is a sign of strength because it shows that traders are buying at higher levels as they expect the rally to extend further.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI has risen into the overbought territory, indicating the path of least resistance is to the upside. The BNB/USDT pair could now rally to its target objective at $400 and then $430.This positive view will invalidate if the price reverses direction and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($297). Such a move will suggest that traders are aggressively booking profits at higher levels and supply exceeds demand.That could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($258) and a crack below this support may extend the decline to $220.The bears tried to trap the bulls on April 3, as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick. However, the bulls were not ready to surrender their advantage and they again pushed Polkadot (DOT) above $42.28 on April 4.There is a tough tussle between the bulls and the bears near the $42.28 level. The buyers are trying to flip this level to support and launch the next leg of the uptrend, which could reach $53.50.The upsloping 20-day EMA ($37.30) and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.This bullish view will invalidate if the bears can pull the price back below $40. If that happens, the ADA/USDT pair could drop to the moving averages and a break below the 50-day SMA ($35.34) could start a deeper correction to $26.50.Cardano (ADA) has been trading near the 20-day EMA ($1.17) for the past few days. Attempts by the bulls to start an up-move on April 2 and 3 did not find buyers at higher levels as seen from the long wick on the candlesticks.Usually, every low volatility phase is followed by a sharp increase in volatility but it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout. Therefore, it is better to wait for the breakout to happen before initiating any trades.If the bulls can push and sustain the price above $1.30, the ADA/USDT pair may challenge the stiff resistance at $1.48. This will be the third attempt to clear the overhead resistance, hence the possibility of a break above it is high. The next target objective is $2.On the other hand, if the indecision resolves to the downside, the bears will try to sink the price below $1.03 and start a deeper correction to $0.80 and then $0.70.XRP broke above the stiff overhead resistance at $0.65 today, which completed an inverse head and shoulders pattern. The altcoin picked up momentum and cleared the minor resistance at $0.75 and $0.78.The sharp pace of the rally suggests that several bears may have been caught off guard, resulting in a massive short squeeze. This opens the possibility for a rally to the pattern target at $1.11.The rising 20-day EMA ($0.57) and the RSI above 80 suggest the bulls are back in command.However, the XRP/USDT pair may not rally to the target objective in a straight dash as short-term traders may book profits after the sharp rally today. That may pull the price down to the $0.75 to $0.65 support zone.The strength of the rebound off this support zone will give a better insight into the next leg of the rally.Uniswap (UNI) rose above the 20-day EMA ($29.52) on April 2 but the bears did not allow the price to run away. They sold at higher levels and pulled the price back to the 20-day EMA on April 3.The positive sign is that the bulls have held the 20-day EMA successfully for the past three days. If the bulls can drive the price above $32.50, the UNI/USDT pair could rally to the $35.20 to $36.80 resistance zone.The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI below 56 suggests a lack of strong momentum in favor of the bulls. This could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days. The next trending move could start on a break above $36.80 or a break below $25.52.Litecoin (LTC) had broken out of the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle on April 3 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. The altcoin quickly reversed direction and dropped back into the triangle.However, the positive sign is that the buyers did not allow the price to break below the moving averages. This shows that the bulls are accumulating on dips. They will again attempt to push and sustain the price above the triangle.If they succeed, the LTC/USDT pair could rally to $230 and then to $246.96. Above this level, the pair could rise to the pattern target at $307.42.Conversely, if the price once again turns down from the resistance line, then the possibility of a break below the moving averages increases. If that happens, the pair could drop to the support line of the triangle.Chainlink (LINK) broke above the $32 resistance on April 2 but the bulls could not build upon this breakout and the bears pulled the price back into the range on April 3. This suggests the bears are aggressively defending the overhead resistance at $32.However, the strong rebound off the 20-day EMA ($29) on April 4 shows the bulls are buying the dips. The bulls will now try to thrust the price above the $32 to $33.17 overhead resistance zone.If they can achieve that, the LINK/USDT pair may retest the all-time high at $36.93. If this level is also conquered, the rally may extend to $40.On the contrary, if the price again turns down from the overhead resistance zone and plummets below the moving averages, it will suggest that the range-bound action may continue for a few more days.THETA has been stuck inside the $10.35 to $14 range for the past few days. The bears are trying to sink the price to the support of the range but the bulls have not allowed the altcoin to dip below $11.20.The 20-day EMA ($10.81) is gradually flattening out and the RSI has dropped below 61, pointing to a possible range-bound action in the next few days.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can drive the price above $12.58, the THETA/USDT pair could rally to $14. A breakout of this resistance will be the first sign that bulls have the upper hand.However, if the pair turns down from the current level and slips below $11.20, a drop to $10.35 is possible. A break below this support could intensify selling.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

525,"Shares of Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) surged on Monday after the cryptocurrency miner announced a significant increase in mining capacity in the first quarter, allowing it to up its stake in Bitcoin (BTC) by a considerable margin. MARA stock jumped 15.8% to close at $56.56, marking a new all-time high. The crypto mining stock rose by as much as 17.1% earlier in the day.By comparison, the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.7% on Monday. Meanwhile, the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund advanced 1.9%.At current values, Marathon Digital has a total market capitalization of $5.6 billion, putting it among the largest crypto proxy stocks.Marathon mined 196 BTC in the quarter ending March 31, bringing its total holdings to 5,134.2 BTC, the company announced Monday. At current values, Marathon’s Bitcoin holdings are worth nearly $302 million.In addition to mining the digital asset, Marathon purchased 4,812.66 BTC in January at an average price of $31,168.The company was able to scale up its mining operations in the first quarter after receiving 10,300 S-19 Pro ASIC miners from Bitmain. Marathon’s mining fleet now consists of 5,800 miners collectively generating 0.71 exahashes per second in hashing power.Cash on hand at the company was $212 million at the end of the first quarter. Total liquidity, which is defined as cash and BTC holdings, was worth approximately $513.9 million.As Cointelegraph recently reported, Marathon plans to divert all hashing power to its new, regulatory compliant mining pool on May 1. The mining pool has been set up to adhere to all U.S. Anti-Money Laundering guidelines and other regulators set forth by the Office of Foreign Assets Control."
526,"In the last two months, the number of cryptocurrencies with a $1 billion market cap has doubled since the last time Cointelegraph reported on the milestone. As things currently stand, there are 100 projects that have reached a $1 billion market capitalization.Unicorns are typically privately held startup companies valued at more than $1 billion, but traditional finance is increasingly applying the term to high-value cryptocurrencies that institutions are only now gaining exposure to.The entrance of institutional investors into the cryptocurrency sector over the course of 2021 has been one of the driving forces of growth for the ecosystem as a whole as multi-billion dollar companies like Tesla, Square and MicroStrategy have converted a portion of their cash reserves into Bitcoin (BTC) and other top altcoins.These are the top 8 #Bitcoin holding public companies.

Which other #cryptocurrency might become a part of company holdings? $MSTR $TSLA $GLXY $SQ $MARA $HUT $VYGR $RIOT pic.twitter.com/wqRD9qdRmbDecentralized finance (DeFi), nonfungible tokens (NFT) and oracles have been some of the hottest growth sectors of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, helping propel multiple projects to Unicorn level status, while stablecoin-related protocols have also vaulted in value as they help provide a solid foundation for the industry to grow from.On that thread, here’s an update on some of the top crypto unicorn projects, as well as an introduction to some of the newest arrivals to the billion dollar club.Nonfungible tokens took the world by storm over the past two months as celebrities, influencers, fast food restaurants and established auction houses jumped on the bandwagon to take part in the creation, sale and distribution of one-of-a-kind digital assets.Enjin Coin (ENJ) has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the rise of NFTs which helped rocket the price of ENJ to an all-time high of $3.08 on March 15 and firmly elevated the project to Unicorn status with a $2.6 billion market cap.The upcoming launch of JumpNet on April 6, will enable the zero-fee creation and distribution of ERC-1155 tokens in the Enjin ecosystem and community excitement over this launch appears to be keeping investors bullish on ENJ.Other notable NFT-related arrivals to the Unicorn club include the virtual reality platform Decentraland (MANA), which enables the purchase of digital plots of land that can be developed and monetized, and Flow (FLOW), a developer-friendly blockchain designed to be the foundation for “the next generation of games, apps, and the digital assets that power them.”The impact that decentralized finance has had on the cryptocurrency ecosystem is undeniable as much of the growth in the sector over the past two years can be attributed to DEXs like Uniswap and yield-farming platforms like Yearn.finance (YFI).High transaction costs and network congestion on the Ethereum network triggered an exodus of users and liquidity to cross-chain compatible platforms and also helped to raise several DeFi protocols built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) above the billion-dollar mark.PancakeSwap (CAKE) has been one of the shining stars of BSC, rapidly climbing up the charts during the months of February and March to hit a market cap of $2.55 billion.Data from Defi Llama shows that CAKE is now ranked as the fifth-largest DeFi platform by total value locked with $6.18 billion currently locked in the protocol.One protocol that operates on the Binance Chain and the Ethereum network is THORChain (RUNE), whose 700% price growth since January 1 has lifted the project’s total market cap to $1.95 billion.Recent optimism for the project has been centered around the launch of THORChain Multichain, which committed to genesis on April 2 and is expected to launch between the 13th and 16th of April.Platforms that offer a lower fee environment to that of Ethereum, including layer 2 solutions and separate blockchain networks, have received extra attention over the past two months due to record-breaking gas costs.As the token that powers transactions on the BSC, Binance Coin (BNB) has seen its price surge enough to vault the token into the top 3 by market capitalization, which now fluctuates around $53.55 billion.Polygon (MATIC) has also risen in stature to become one of the chosen layer 2 protocols for the Ethereum network following its pivot to become the “Polkadot on Ethereum” and help stem the tide of projects and liquidity leaving the network.With many popular unicorn-level projects already operational on the Polygon protocol, including Aave (AAVE) and SushiSwap (SUSHI), MATIC looks well-positioned to continue its gallop higher as a rising unicorn star.Stablecoins and their associated protocols received a boost early in 2021 when the U.S. Treasury's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency gave the green light for national banks to run independent nodes for distributed ledger networks.After Bitfinex and Tether settled their landmark case with the Office of the New York Attorney General, enthusiasm for stablecoin projects further increased as the market caps for Tether and USD Coin (USDC) increased by billions of dollars.One protocol with a stablecoin component that has made great strides in helping establish a stable store of wealth in countries experiencing hyperinflation like Venezuela is Reserve, whose Reserve Rights (RSR) token has increased by more than 400% in 2021.Another new entrant to the stablecoin field is TerraUSD (UST), whose market cap skyrocketed from $182 million on Jan. 1 to $1.66 billion on April 2 as its native Terra (LUNA) blockchain protocol, which specializes in the creation of fiat-pegged stablecoins to power price-stable global payments systems, has seen its price rally 3,000% since the beginning of the year.Several projects with specific use-cases and first-mover advantage have joined the unicorn herd by offering unique solutions to problems faced in both the cryptocurrency and traditional sectors.Theta (THETA) has been a stand-out performer for the blockchain industry in 2021 as the streaming video-focused platform has seen its token value swell more than 900% since early January after several high-profile announcements led to record-high trading volumes for the token.Institutional investors @Sierra_Ventures, Heuristic Capital, @TheVRFund, and @GFRFund stake over $100M in Theta to a collective Enterprise Validator Nodehttps://t.co/pfGqxaYnxsThe blockchain-based web browser and digital advertising platform Basic Attention Token (BAT) managed to achieve a unicorn-level valuation thanks to its own NFT and DeFi related announcements, with the project unveiling plans to launch a DEX aggregator and NFT wallet in its next browser.Helium (HNT), a decentralized blockchain-powered network for the Internet of Things (IoT) devices through a network of nodes (hotspots), has also recently joined the unicorn club.Running a hotspot on the Helium network gives the user a low-cost opportunity to participate in mining to help maintain network security at a fraction of what it costs to mine Bitcoin and Ethereum.This is helped create a global network of more than 25,000 hotspots and a total market cap of $1.12 billion for the HNT.Now that institutional investors are slowly gaining exposure to the cryptocurrency asset class, the number of unicorn-level projects is likely to continue to increase as traditional finance embraces the rise of DeFi and digital assets.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

527,"JPMorgan Chase expects Bitcoin (BTC) to reach $130,000, while Ark Invest anticipates the market valuation of BTC to surpass that of gold.The optimistic macro prediction from both funds revolves around the scarcity of Bitcoin, which has buoyed its popularity as a safe-haven asset.As Cointelegraph previously reported, the outlook of the U.S. dollar index is on the decline.The fear of inflation and the increasing liquidity in the financial markets is causing reserve currencies, like the dollar, to depreciate.Ark Invest, as an example, sees Bitcoin nearing $500,000 in the future, considering that the fund expects it to surpass gold by market capitalization. Currently, the market cap of Bitcoin is roughly 10% of gold.BREAKING: Ark Invest believes #Bitcoin’s market capitalization will one day “comfortably eclipse” that of gold, and exceed $10 trillionThe Winklevoss twins, who own over a billion dollars worth of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, outlined a similar thesis in the past.In the new popular essay entitled ""The Case for $500K Bitcoin,"" Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, said:Meanwhile, JPMorgan has set a more conservative target at $130,000, which is more realistic as a shorter-term target for Bitcoin, as it would put BTC's valuation at around $2.73 trillion.Holger Zschaepitz, market analyst at Welt, noted:However, Zschaepitz noted that the long-term risk-adjusted price of Bitcoin could fall in the future, which is not accurately predictable because it is difficult to forecast the trend of volatility over time.According to a pseudonymous trader known as Bitcoin Jack, the spent output profit ratio (SOPR) indicator forecasts some profit-taking could occur in the short term.The SOPR indicator gauges how much BTC in the market is in profit and, thus, vulnerable to a sell-off. The trader said:Fellow cryptocurrency trader Scott Melker emphasized that Bitcoin has performed well against the S&P 500 and the U.S. stock market, which still makes it favorable as a store of value. Melker wrote:As long as Bitcoin continues to outperform the U.S. stock market, from a risk standpoint, it would remain compelling for both retail traders and high-net-worth investors in the near to medium term."
528,"The market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies in existence surpassed $2 trillion on April 5, according to data from Goingecko, led by the impressive growth of Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and other altcoins in 2021.The cryptocurrency market as a whole has become approximately as valuable as Apple, the second-biggest company in the world after Saudi Arabia's oil giant, Aramco.The milestone also comes less than three months after the cryptocurrency market surpassed $1 trillion for the first time back on Jan. 7 when the price of Bitcoin was around $33,000. In recent months, several major catalysts have fueled both Bitcoin and Ether to rally strongly to new all-time highs.Financial institutions, like PayPal and Visa, are beginning to actively support cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin leading the cryptocurrency market's uptrend.In 2021, Bitcoin has faced several short-term corrections but has now consistently remained above $50,000 for almost a month, with low volatility compared with altcoins, preventing both ETH and the altcoin market from seeing a severe pullback.In fact, Bitcoin's volatility has dropped to the lowest level since November 2020 as BTC price has been consolidating between $55,000 and $60,000 over the past few days.In the same period, the price of ETH rallied and broke out against Bitcoin, reaching a new record high above $2,000.A pseudonymous trader known as ""Rekt Capital"" attributed the strong performance of ETH to Bitcoin's consolidation under $60,000. He wrote:Fund managers and investors in the crypto market are generally optimistic about the short- to medium-term trajectory of cryptocurrencies.Jonathan Habicht, a partner at Moonrock Capital, said:As long as the strength of the ETH/BTC pair remains intact and Bitcoin does not see a major sell-off, the cryptocurrency market's short-term outlook remains highly optimistic for April and into the summer.On April 2, Coinbase, the top United States cryptocurrency exchange, announced that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved its S-1 filing.Coinbase is expected to be listed on the Nasdaq exchange on April 14, making it a publicly traded company on the U.S. stock market. The company said:The listing of Coinbase on the U.S. stock market will likely cause the demand for cryptocurrencies to increase because it will attract the eyes of investors in the traditional financial market.Depending on the performance of the stock, it could also lead exchange tokens such as Binance Coin (BNB), FTX Token (FTT), Huobi Token (HT), SushiSwap's SUSHI, Uniswap's UNI and others to rally, mirroring the momentum of COIN.At the same time, some analysts believe that Coinbase's IPO may bring major volatility in, if not downward price pressure on, the cryptocurrency market, as the date aligns with a big BTC options expiry date.

529,"After several attempts in previous years, Grayscale has renewed its push to release a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund on American asset markets. According to a Monday roadmap, two of its funds, GBTC and ETHE, are on the short-list to become proper ETFs. However, the company has not indicated any concrete efforts, such as filing a new request with the SEC, nor has it provided meaningful timelines for these plans.Grayscale is one of the major providers of cryptocurrency exposure in traditional markets, operating several trust funds for major cryptocurrencies. These funds hold cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and many others, and issue shares that are expected to reflect the value of the underlying assets.According to Grayscale’s roadmap, each trust fund falls into four categories of development. The first is the “private placement” phase, where the funds are only available for sale and purchase in over-the-counter deals with the company.The second category is for publicly-listed shares on secondary markets, meaning that the trust funds receive a ticker symbol and become tradable by the public. Trust funds for Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) fall into this category. Finally, the most advanced trusts achieve “SEC reporting” status, committing to periodic disclosure of their balance sheets and operations to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Only the Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts are reporting to the SEC currently.The last and most coveted status is that of an ETF, a fully regulated and liquid fund. ETFs are commonly used for exposure to indexes or baskets of assets in U.S. stock markets. ETFs generally have lower management fees, achieve wider reach than trusts, and are designed to follow their net asset value very closely. Grayscale’s products are particularly weak from that aspect, as GBTC has consistently traded at a very significant premium over the value of the Bitcoin it held.The GBTC premium has recently collapsed to become a penalty, with it currently trading 10% below NAV. Loss of this premium, coupled with stiff competition from Purpose Bitcoin ETF in Canada, may have spurred Grayscale into action.The promise of a Bitcoin ETF has been one of the driving Bitcoin narratives since about 2017, when Grayscale first attempted to file for an ETF with the SEC. Regulators have consistently rejected these filings, often citing the unregulated nature of Bitcoin infrastructure as the main hurdle to overcome. Bitwise’s application for a Bitcoin ETF was one of the motivations for publishing its report on exchange volume in 2019, where it claimed that up to 90% of the reported volume was in fact non-existent. This argument was used by the company to claim that most of Bitcoin’s price formation occurred on regulated exchanges — but that did not convince regulators at the time.A stream of Bitcoin ETF filings by companies, such as VanEck, WisdomTree and SkyBridge, is continuing in 2021, with Grayscale now reentering the fold as well. Given the long history of rejections, the company hedged its ETF promise by noting that “timing will be driven by the regulatory environment.” Institutional acceptance and infrastructure have made enormous strides since Grayscale’s last attempts, though it remains unknown whether this will ultimately sway the SEC into accepting its first application."
530,"Ebang, a publicly listed company providing mining hardware for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), has officially announced the launch of its own crypto exchange.According to an announcement on Monday, qualified investors will be soon able to register and trade on Ebang’s cryptocurrency exchange dubbed Ebonex.Ebang CEO and chairman Dong Hu said: “In recent years, we have made a considerable investment in R&D talent recruiting, as well as product innovation and iteration. The launch of our cryptocurrency exchange business will not only expand the revenue sources from our cryptocurrency business but also optimize the development of our blockchain industry chain.” Ebonex supports major cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ether (ETH), as well as stablecoin Tether (USDT). Other supported coins include Litecoin (LTC), Cardano (ADA), Zcash (ZEC), Dash, Tezos (XTZ), EOS and Monero (XMR).The exchange initially launched in an invitation-only beta phase in mid-March.The announcement did not mention which jurisdictions are eligible to trade on Ebang’s new crypto exchange. Ebang did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Ebang was listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker EBON in June 2020, becoming the second Bitcoin miner manufacturer to go public on a United States stock exchange after Chinese crypto mining firm Canaan.

531,"The crypto market seems to be once again heating up, with Bitcoin (BTC) flirting with the $60,000 mark for almost a week now. However, despite its bullish outlook, the flagship crypto has failed to steer clear of the aforementioned price range with any sort of conviction, even though it did break through once, albeit for a brief period of time.Regardless, analysts, such as Filbfilb, co-founder of trading suite DecenTrader, and Willy Woo believe that with the Coinbase IPO looming large on the horizon, Bitcoin seems primed for big things in the near term, especially as the premier crypto continues to exhibit seven-day gains of over 13%.On the subject, Filbfilb recently stated: “We may see increased volatility around this time period of the 14th April. I do think that we are on the brink of a strong breakout.” He also later pointed out that the bears are still in play, hence the volatility may not just be to the upside.Similarly, Woo is of the opinion that Bitcoin will continue to rise for at least some time before the old hodlers offload their assets to pocket some decent gains. Not only that, regardless of what may happen in the future, Woo believes that Bitcoin will not be closing below the $46,400 mark anytime soon.Recently, payments giant Visa announced that it will allow its users to settle their transactions in crypto, using the USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin, which is an ERC-20 token that runs atop the Ethereum blockchain. The news has been seen by many as being yet another indicator that crypto is now firmly in the crosshairs of many mainstream players.Furthermore, just a few days ago, PayPal, too, announced that it was going to allow its customers to facilitate shopping transactions across its 30-million-strong merchant network using a host of different crypto assets including BTC, Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).Regarding whether the market seems to be heading price action-wise and where BTC may find support next, independent analyst CryptoYoda told Cointelegraph that he believes there will likely be a further acceleration and a more steep parabolic advance, which will most likely become visible in the near term, adding:Similarly, providing his take on the matter, Antoni Trenchev, CEO of crypto financial platform Nexo, believes that Bitcoin is entering the growth-side of its four-year economic cycle, especially as the global economy starts to recover from the pandemic.He added that the announcements of Visa and PayPal’s crypto integrations indicate that more upswings are incoming. Trehnchev opined: “Any bumps in the road in 2021 won’t send BTC down significantly — it will keep boomeranging its way back up to the next price stop, and I’d put that at about $75K.” He also anticipated to enter the six-figure range soon after that.Lastly, Ben Zhou, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bybit, told Cointelegraph that $73,000 is the Fibonacci level to watch if BTC cleanly vaults above $60,000. That said, he believes just a few more announcements in the vein of the Visa, PayPal, Goldman Sachs and Teletubbies news could be the impetus that the market needs to make a clean transition above the aforementioned price threshold.With so much institutional activity now happening within the space, many believe that the industry has matured so much that it has reached a point of no return, such that most people have now started to realize the technological proposition put forth by crypto rather than only recognizing its short-term profit potential.For example, Todd Crossland, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange CoinZoom, believes that mass adoption of Bitcoin and other digital assets is only just starting, adding: “Every corporation in the world is either already embracing Bitcoin, or they are researching strategies for how they can join the movement.”In his view, as more of the world’s largest companies purchase Bitcoin, as part of their treasuries, and also accept Bitcoin as part of their e-commerce solutions, there will be an increasing trend in the upward direction. “We see a very clear path for Bitcoin reaching $100,000 by the end of 2021,” Crossland opined.Related: The big $60K hodl is on: 5 things to watch in Bitcoin this weekOn the subject of whether BTC can ever scale down to extremely low price levels ever again, Cointelegraph spoke with Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer for futures and options trading platform Deribit, who pointed out that according to the options data available to him at the moment, the market seems to suggest sub-10K levels scenarios have a very slim probability of materializing. “A year-end expiry USD 12K is currently priced at a 6% probability,” he added, to further cement his point.Also, after the above-stated options expiry, as well as the Visa, PayPal and Goldman Sachs announcements, Strijers believes that the market will gradually move upward again. On a more technical note, he pointed out that according to Deribit’s implied volatility index, the amount of demand for crypto assets is rising at the moment.According to Zhou, market participants all over the world have spoken and loudly affirmed that they view Bitcoin as a tangible long-term store of value. In fact, he believes that even when there will be an eventual downturn in the current supercycle, BTC’s price is unlikely to drop below the height of its 2017 bull run of $20,000.This, in his opinion, is simply due to the fact that an increasing amount of institutional money is flowing into this space on a regular basis but also because fiat dilution has been happening all too rapidly. As a result, most currencies can no longer claim their prior values that they were able to hold back in 2017, or early 2020.To put things into perspective, since the start of the coronavirus pandemic back in March 2020, the United States Federal Reserve has printed over $3.5 trillion, issuing the money in the form of stimulus packages to families as well as in an effort to pump capital into the economy.That being said, even though the market looks to be in great shape right now, it is still anyone’s best guess as to what the future has in store for Bitcoin and other prominent altcoins. This is because this fledgling sector is still full of inherent risks — despite what the Winklevoss twins would like everyone to believe — with there still being little to no scope of accurately assessing the pitfalls involved with this space. Thus, it’s of utmost importance that users do their personal research before investing big in any project."
532,"Shark Tank and Dragon’s Den personality Kevin O’Leary is taking a stand against what he terms “blood coin,” that being Bitcoin (BTC) mined in China. The investor declared that he would only deal with “clean coin” — coins mined using renewable energy — from now on and suggested other institutions were starting to do the same.O’Leary took aim at the free-wheeling nature of Bitcoin production by pointing out that most other products in the world are manufactured according to institutional and regulatory compliance standards. O’Leary said, during an interview with CNBC:Every example listed by O’Leary is one that applies to the world’s largest Bitcoin mining region — China, where cheap coal-fuelled electricity accounts for an estimated 50%–65% of the overall Bitcoin hash rate. No one wants to buy Bitcoin that originated from China, says O’Leary, who suggested institutions were beginning to seek “virgin” coins, which can be traced back to an environmentally ethical source.“All of these issues have now come to the fore on Bitcoin. Institutions will not buy coin mined in China; coin mined using coal to burn for the electricity; coin mined in countries with sanctions on them. And all of a sudden there’s this huge demand for virgin coin with the provenance known,” said O’Leary.Eventually, the zeitgeist will come to know two different types of Bitcoin: blood coin, and clean coin, O’Leary said:O’Leary said concerned would-be investors regularly ask him about the source of Bitcoin and whether its production met contemporary western standards. The investor said that from now on, he would only be dealing with clean Bitcoin."
533,"Cryptocurrency and blockchain-related companies have already received more funding this year than in all of 2020, according to a new report.In the first quarter of 2021, 129 startups focusing on crypto and blockchain technology have received a total of $2.6 billion in funding, Bloomberg reports, citing data from business analytics firm CB Insights. Over the course of 2020, crypto and blockchain firms attracted a total of $2.3 billion in 341 deals.According to the data, 2018 is the record year in terms of funding secured in the crypto industry, with total funding amounting to $3.3 billion.According to CB Insights, the increased funding in 2021 was driven by several big rounds for firms including American crypto lending startup BlockFi, Canadian blockchain-based game maker Dapper Labs and United Kingdom-based crypto wallet provider Blockchain.com. These three companies alone have raised nearly $1.1 billion this year, with BlockFi completing a $350-million funding round in March.After raising $120 million in February, Blockchain.com secured $300 million funding in a new funding round in March, bringing the firm to a $5.2-billion valuation. Dapper Labs, the creator of the popular Ethereum-based game CryptoKitties and the nonfungible token marketplace NBA Top Shot, raised $305 million from investors, such as NBA star Michael Jordan, earlier this year.Alongside notable growth in venture capital funding in the crypto industry, crypto and blockchain companies have been also growing this year in terms of consolidation. According to Henri Arslanian, global crypto leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2021 is already on track to significantly surpass the levels of crypto mergers and acquisitions recorded in 2020."
534,"Ark Invest believes Bitcoin’s (BTC) market capitalization will one day “comfortably eclipse” that of gold’s, and exceed $10 trillion, reports the London Times.Headed up by veteran stock picker Cathie Wood, analysts at Ark believe Bitcoin’s $1-trillion value is set to rise tenfold in the coming years, as it moves from being a fringe asset to a mainstream financial tool.The value of Bitcoin has doubled since January 2021 alone, compounding 500% gains made throughout 2020. As is normally the case, Bitcoin’s rising tide lifted all of the boats in the wider cryptocurrency marina, sending many to new all-time highs in the process. With the global market cap now worth just under $2 trillion, the climb to the $10-trillion mark doesn’t seem too far away.Yassine Elmandjra, a crypto asset analyst at Ark, believes Bitcoin has the potential to surpass gold’s $10-trillion market cap:But what about the effect of regulation on the future performance of Bitcoin? Elmandjra responded to claims by United States Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen that Bitcoin was inefficient, unstable and often used for illegal activity.“I really think that it’s just outdated arguments as a function of their complete lack of education, which is a function of just their lack of interest in learning about this,” said Elmandjra."
535,"The United Kingdom Crown Prosecution Service expects to see an increase in the number of Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency-related scams in the coming years but admits they are still rather infrequent for the time being.The CPS estimates that 86% of reported fraud is now cyber-related — a situation exacerbated in the past year by the outbreak of COVID-19, which pushed more people online, reports the Financial Times.City of London police statistics show that 27,187 reports of cybercrime were made across the U.K. and Northern Ireland between 2019 and 2020. Of that figure, 5,581 involved reports relating to cryptocurrency investments, amounting to a fifth of all reported cybercrime incidents.The number of general fraud cases totaled 822,276 in the same period, suggesting that, despite the meteoric rise in the fortunes of Bitcoin and the wider crypto market, it still isn’t being readily adopted by would-be fraudsters. Just 0.6% of overall fraud cases were related to cryptocurrency, while as little as 3% related to cybercrime in general.However, the rise of Bitcoin across 2020 didn’t go unnoticed by everybody. Scams involving cryptocurrency spiked 57% in the year leading up to December 2020 — a year in which Bitcoin quintupled in value.Director of public prosecutions at the CPS QC Max Hill said promises of high investment returns were a common gambit used by fraudsters, and he expects cases involving crypto to increase. Concerning the rise of fraudulent cryptocurrency scams, Hill said:“Whilst schemes using high investment returns have been used for decades, I think we will see increasing numbers. Cases coming in are in low numbers now, but my prediction is they will increase.”Statistics show that almost half of overall fraud cases relate to check, plastic card and bank account cases. According to the City of London police, key threats for 2021 include, among other things, romance:“The highest harm threats for 2020/21 are Courier, Romance, Payment Diversion, Investment, Computer Software Service and frauds linked to Card and Online Bank Accounts.”A new economic crime court is scheduled to open in London in 2026 and will deal with fraud, economic crimes and cybercrimes in one place."
536,"Bitcoin is looking shaky at the start of a new week as $60,000 remains out of reach — could anything change in the coming days?After an average weekend that failed to deliver the breakout that many had hoped for, Bitcoin (BTC) is clinging to the mid-$50,000 range.Cointelegraph takes a look at five factors that can help shape future price performance.Stock markets were unimpressive on April 5, with many Asian markets closed for public holidays and United States futures seeing little movement.Following the Suez Canal debacle, oil was the only commodity with noticeable energy as a decision from OPEC+ countries to increase supply put pressure on prices.With a lack of momentum available, Bitcoin, therefore, had little to sustain any macro-influenced price run, and $60,000 resistance remained in place at the time of writing.One major event that crypto analysts are eagerly waiting for, however, is Coinbase’s initial public offering, set for April 14.As Cointelegraph reported, the event is a milestone for the industry but could be accompanied by selling on launch day — a practice seen with other IPOs both old and new.Elsewhere, U.S. bond yield rises remained a worry this week, with their upward trajectory coinciding with a lack of progress for safe havens more widely.“The repricing of inflation risk and U.S. rates, which will impact discount rates of future earnings and the way stocks are being valued is a source of uncertainty,” Johanna Chua, chief economist for Citigroup Global Markets, told Bloomberg.Bitcoin may be struggling for new support, but hodlers need to zoom out for the real picture.That was the mood among analysts on April 5 as BTC/USD headed lower toward $56,000.After challenging $60,000 yet again late on April 2, the weekend saw bearish moves take over, culminating in a dip to $56,500.A subsequent rebound was muted, with $57,000 forming a temporary focal point at the time of writing.“The support resistance battle is intense,” on-chain data service Whalemap added on April 4 about current behavior.For popular Twitter analyst William Clemente, however, there was little reason to be bearish on longer time frames, which have the support of a tranche of positive on-chain data.“This Bitcoin Bull Run is still far from overheated on multiple on-chain indicators,” he summarized.Clemente uploaded a comparative chart showing Bitcoin’s 2013 and 2017 price tops via the Puell Multiple, a classic metric that continues to signal that there is room for growth before a profit-taking sell-off can begin.Such an early position in the bull cycle implies that the majority of upward price performance is yet to come for Bitcoin, something that would give credence to some of the higher year-end forecasts of $288,000 and more.On the topic of miner selling, this is a habit yet to reappear this month.Despite Bitcoin lingering near all-time highs alongside record network hash rate and mining difficulty, there is no appetite to take profit on mined coins yet, data shows.Compiled by on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode, the miner net position change has signaled that miners have beenretaining their newly acquired coins over the past week.In contrast, 2021 has been broadly marked by sell-offs, particularly in January as Bitcoin hit $40,000 for the first time. Sales have come to a halt since, however, regardless of continued — albeit slower — price gains.“Still not selling, still accumulating, clear trend,” quantitative analyst Lex Moskovski commented on the Glassnode numbers.In tandem with miners come exchanges, which continue to see their BTC balances decrease. Traders, then, are no more interested in selling at near $60,000 than anyone else.Conspicuously bullish this month are institutions — and they are putting their money where their mouth is, the latest figures say.With open interest in Bitcoin futures markets near all-time highs, institution-grade products continue to see huge demand — albeit if the price is right.As such, the first licensed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Canada, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF, keeps adding BTC in step with its assets under management (AUM).As of April 5, Purpose held 16,462 BTC and $22.1 billion Canadian dollars ($17.56 billion U.S. dollars) in AUM, having only launched its ETF two months ago.As Cointelegraph reported, the pressure is likely on the U.S. to follow Canada in allowing an ETF onto the market, with such a product set to receive multiples of what Purpose has been able to draw from institutions in its home jurisdiction.All this, however, could be coming at the expense of stalwart institutional player Grayscale and its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).In a battle over fees, GBTC may be losing interest to the more economical Purpose, which is one of multiple Bitcoin offerings undercutting the company on its management costs to clients.In a classic sign that the mantra of “the longer the perspective, the better” remains best for Bitcoiners, the popular Stock-to-Flow price forecasting model remains right on track for $288,000 and higher.As noted on April 4 by its creator, quant analyst PlanB, the model’s “bull/bear recognition signal” is casually repeating its movements from 2013 and 2017.An accompanying chart showed BTC/USD spot price following its predicted trajectory, with no sign that the model was being invalidated by short-term rumination below $60,000.The incarnation of Stock-to-Flow that was used was the Stock-to-Flow Cross-Asset Model (S2FX), an updated version that places Bitcoin within the context of other macro assets and tracks its transformation into a new standard.“My favorite chart for Situational Awareness,” PlanB wrote in comments.S2FX calls for a $288,000 price tag by the end of 2021, this forming an average price in the current halving cycle, which will complete in roughly April 2024. The price peak before then, by contrast, could be double the average, or $576,000, PlanB has said."
537,"Historical trends act as a gauge for traders to assess the possibilities for the future. April has been a bullish month for Bitcoin (BTC) with eight monthly closes in the green and only two instances of negative returns. Danny Scott, the CEO of the Bitcoin exchange CoinCorner, said that Bitcoin could rally to $83,000 if it emulates its average April return of 51% as it had over the past 10 years.This could be one of the reasons why miners have started holding their positions instead of selling at the current levels. Lex Moskoviski, the CIO at Moskoviski Capital, recently highlighted that miners had hoarded 4,380 Bitcoin on April 2 and 4,494 Bitcoin on April 3.While Bitcoin remains the undisputed leader, a positive is that some mainstream companies have started to explore opportunities in different sectors of the crypto sector.Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke indicated that his company was exploring ways to integrate with decentralized finance. On April 3, Lutke tweeted a question to the DeFi community asking for ideas on what role the company could play in the space. If something concrete comes of this it could give a big boost to the entire crypto ecosystem.Let’s study the charts of top-5 cryptocurrencies that may outperform the other major cryptocurrencies in the short term.Bitcoin’s repeated failure to break above the $60,000 level in the past few days could have attracted profit-booking from short-term traders. That resulted in a drop to the 20-day exponential moving average ($56,518) today.The moderating of the slope of the moving averages and the failure of the relative strength index (RSI) to rise above the downtrend line shows that bears are aggressively defending the $60,000 to $61,825.84 resistance zone.If the bulls can thrust the price above this zone, it could trap the bears, resulting in a possible short squeeze. That could boost momentum, launching the BTC/USDT pair toward the target objective at $69,540 and then $79,566.On the other hand, if the bulls again fail to clear the hurdle at $60,000, then the possibility of a break below the 20-day EMA increases. The pair could then retest the 50-day simple moving average ($53,771). This is an important support to watch out for because a break below it will indicate a possible change in the short-term trend.The 4-hour chart shows the formation of a possible inverted head and shoulders pattern that will complete on a breakout and close above $60,000. This bullish setup has a pattern target of $69,540.However, the 20-EMA has started to turn down, indicating the bears are trying to gain the upper hand. If the price turns down from the 20-EMA, the pair could extend its decline to $54,700. A break below this level could open the doors for a decline to $50,460.02.The range-bound action in Ether (ETH) resolved to the upside on April 2 and the price surged to a new all-time high at $2,144.59. However, the bulls could not sustain the higher levels as the price again dipped back below the breakout level at $2,040.77.The bulls are currently attempting to push the price back above the $2,040.77 to $2,144.59 overhead resistance zone. If they succeed, the ETH/USDT pair could pick up momentum and start its journey to $2,618.14.The upsloping 20-day EMA ($1,849) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate the bulls have the upper hand.However, if the price turns down from the overhead zone and dips below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bullish momentum has weakened. A break below the 50-day SMA ($1,751) could keep the pair range-bound between $1,289 and $2,040.77.The 4-hour chart shows the pullback in the pair has found support at the 20-EMA, which suggests the uptrend is intact. However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will again try to stall the current rally in the $2,093.45 to $2,144.59 overhead resistance zone.If they succeed, the pair may again drop to the 20-EMA. A break below this support will be the first indication that supply exceeds demand.On the contrary, if the bulls can sustain the rebound and catapult the price above the resistance zone, the uptrend may resume.Binance Coin (BNB) broke out to a new all-time high on April 2 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels and the price dipped back below $348.69. This suggests that the bears tried to trap the aggressive bulls.However, the bulls did not allow the price to break below the $315 support. This is a positive sign as it indicates that bulls are accumulating on every minor dip and are not waiting for a deeper correction to buy.If the bulls can thrust the price above the all-time high at $356.98, the BNB/USDT pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $400 and then $430. The rising moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and slides below $315, it will suggest that the bullish momentum is weakening.The 4-hour chart shows the bears are aggressively defending the overhead resistance zone between $348.69 and $356.98. They had even pulled the price below the 20-EMA but could not break the $315 support.The bulls will now make one more attempt to push the price above $356.98 and if they succeed, the pair could pick up momentum.On the other hand, even if the price turns down from the overhead resistance zone but stays above $315, it will indicate strength. The bears could gain the upper hand in the short term if the price breaks and sustains below $315.Polkadot (DOT) broke above the downtrend line on April 2 and made a new all-time high at $46.80 on April 3. However, the higher levels attracted profit-booking as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick.The bears could not build upon their advantage as the bulls purchased at lower levels and have pushed the price back above $42.28 today.The 20-day EMA ($36.57) has turned up and the RSI has risen into the overbought zone, indicating the bulls are in control.If the bulls can now drive the price above $46.80, the DOT/USDT pair could resume the uptrend and rally to the target objective at $53.50.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages.The moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive zone, indicating that the short-term trend is bullish. The strong rebound off the 20-EMA indicates that the bulls are aggressively accumulating on dips. This increases the possibility of a break above $46.80.However, if the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below the 20-EMA, it will suggest that supply exceeds demand. Such a move could pull the price down to the 50-SMA.EOS broke above the $5.60 overhead resistance on April 1 and closed at $6.25 on April 2, its highest close since June 29, 2019. This shows that the altcoin is once again generating interest among investors.The bears dragged the price back below the breakout level of $5.60 on April 3, but the positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the bears to assert their dominance. They have again pushed the price back above $5.60.If buyers can sustain the price above $5.60 for three days, it will suggest the start of a new uptrend. The EOS/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum after the bulls propel the price above $6.50. If they can do that, the pair could rally to $7.64 and then $8.69.The 20-day EMA ($4.68) has started to turn up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating the bulls have the upper hand.The 4-hour chart shows the bears attempted to trap the bulls when they pulled the price back below the 20-EMA and $5.40. However, the buyers did not give up and they successfully defended the $5.20 level.This shows the bulls are buying on dips. The 20-EMA has started to turn up and the RSI is in the positive zone, suggesting advantage to the bulls. If they can sustain the price above $5.60, the possibility of a breakout of $6.48 increases.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below $5.20, it will suggest that the breakout above $5.60 was a bull trap.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

538,"In the year since the COVID-19 pandemic first disrupted almost every aspect of our lives, many things have happened within the crypto ecosystem around the world. So, what has the past year been like for crypto in Venezuela?Even before 2020, Venezuela already had a number of businesses that accepted various cryptocurrencies as payment; however, considerably more have moved to adopt this form of payment over the past year. This includes everything from the hotel sector to famous pizza chain Pizza Hut announcing that it will accept Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Dash and other cryptocurrencies as a form of payment.Halfway through 2020, crypto exchange Cryptobuyer and payments processor Mega Soft announced that they would form an alliance to allow some 20,000 merchants that use their services to accept payments in crypto through the Cryptobuyer Pay solution developed by the exchange.Another important landmark was in September 2020 when a Bitcoin node was connected to Blockstream’s satellite network — a first for Venezuela. The result of a joint effort between Cryptobuyer and crypto education provider AnibalCripto, the node was launched despite the logistical limitations imposed by COVID-19-related lockdown measures. Likewise, those responsible for the node announced that this was the first step toward building a mesh network that would be able to process Bitcoin transactions without the need for an internet connection.Despite the ongoing economic crisis in Venezuela, the crypto mining industry has been growing. According to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, Venezuela contributes the most to the Bitcoin hash rate out of any nation in Latin America, which means that there is a substantial amount of computing power being generated in the country.However, Venezuela introduced a new piece of legislation in September 2020 targeted at the country’s mining industry. In addition to the creation of an obligatory registry and the establishment of new taxes for those who work in mining-related sectors, the new law introduced the controversial “Pool de Minería Digital Nacional” (National Digital Mining Pool). Under this new requirement, it will be obligatory for miners to contribute their hashing power to a new, state-backed mining pool.Overall, there is still no real clarity regarding the mining pool, which means that the way in which the law will be enforced is not really known, and it has not yet been revealed exactly how Venezuelan miners will have to participate.Although it may seem paradoxical to see such a level of support for cryptocurrencies from a government that is often seen as being quite restrictive of its citizens and their freedoms, the past year has seen several crypto experiments, including plans to allow Venezuelans to pay for passports with Bitcoin using payments processor BTCPayServer.However, even though the administration of President Nicolás Maduro did not end up implementing the passport plan, its vision for the use of crypto did not diminish. For example, Maduro proposed an anti-sanctions bill in September 2020, seeking to use cryptocurrencies to evade the various sanctions imposed on the country and hoping to boost crypto use in various business operations.More specifically, there were reports that Maduro’s administration was using Bitcoin to facilitate trade between Iran and Turkey, two of the current main geopolitical allies of the state.Related:  A year into the pandemic: How Argentina's economy struggled while its crypto ecosystem flourishedIt was also reported in November 2020 that the Venezuelan Army decided to open the Centro de Producción de Activos Digitales del Ejército Bolivariano de Venezuela (Digital Assets Production Center of the Venezuelan Army), a center that houses ASIC mining equipment designed for proof-of-work cryptocurrencies in order to generate “unblockable” financial income, according to the military leaders who inaugurated the facility.All this progress made on the part of the Venezuelan state in the crypto ecosystem has been to seek solutions to get around the sanctions that the United States has imposed on Maduro, his cabinet and high-ranking military officials.However, U.S. authorities have declared that they are monitoring Venezuela’s cryptocurrency operations, and in June 2020, they even added its cryptocurrency superintendent — the highest authority on the regulation of the crypto ecosystem in Venezuela — to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Most Wanted List.The bullish surge of Bitcoin’s price has been coupled with the rapid devaluation of Venezuela’s fiat currency, which has resulted in a record number of bolivars being traded in for Bitcoin. In the first week of December 2020 alone, peer-to-peer exchange LocalBitcoins saw 5.85 billion bolivars exchanged on the platform. By the first week of February, this number had jumped to 8.56 billion bolivars.The complicated political and economic situation in Venezuela has led the government to consider alternative solutions. In the midst of this scenario, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, in particular, have been brought to the fore.Maduro is not the only one who sees cryptocurrency as a way out of troubled waters. One of his main opponents, Juan Guaidó — who is president of the National Assembly and recognized as Venezuela’s legitimate president by some 60 countries — has used the stablecoin USD Coin (USDC) to evade financial restrictions imposed by the Maduro administration in order to send humanitarian aid to Venezuelans.The funds used by Guaidó came from assets that were seized by U.S. authorities from the U.S.-based bank accounts of Venezuelan state companies and various members of Maduro’s administration.To understand better what it felt like on the ground within the crypto ecosystem in Venezuela, Cointelegraph en Español spoke with some of the main actors who were involved in the various events that set the tone during the past year.Jorge Farias, CEO of Cryptobuyer, opined to Cointelegraph en Español that the use and adoption of crypto as a form of payment in Venezuela is becoming a reality: “The global and local situation has made it so that thanks to the pandemic, businesses and individuals are looking for payment alternatives that do not require the interaction or physical presence of people.”Ernesto Contreras, head of business development at Dash Core Group, mentioned that Dash’s plans to expand to national chains was halted due to the spread of the pandemic. Additionally, during the lockdown period, “We saw how delivery offers grew, which work in a 100% digital environment, and several services like Dingo, Piido and others have joined in accepting Dash and cryptos.” He added further:Javier Bastardo, host of the Satoshi en Venezuela podcast, told Cointelegraph en Español that “Venezuela continues to be one of the most active p2p exchange markets.” However, he believes that the trend has not reached its peak just yet. Moreover, he believes that FOMO — the fear of missing out — is not influencing the situation as much as in 2017 and that a steady inflow of people who heard about cryptocurrencies in the past are only now opting to enter the market. He also added that another factor that has dominated the past year has been the willingness to start paying directly in crypto, which ultimately delivers a sustained level of adoption.Anibal Garrido, CEO AnibalCripto, told Cointelegraph en Español that “Venezuela has been part of important contributions to the development of the ecosystem.” He further added that:He added that the local mining law sets a precedent for other countries to evaluate and consider. He also mentioned the incorporation of crypto payments in retail chains along with the developments in providing fast, secure fiat-to-crypto exchange processes.Mariangel Garcia, community manager for Binance Spanish, believes that “Venezuelans were shaken out of our comfort zone, businesses were forced to start a digital transformation and now many users can see how options abound that before this situation did not exist.”She further told Cointelegraph en Español that this translated into the widespread adoption of Binance’s native cryptocurrencies in the country, as well as a surge in demand for its peer-to-peer platform. For Garcia, this means that “Thousands of Venezuelans have found financial freedom in our products without limitations.”She concluded by saying that: “Venezuela is the only country in Latin America with an inclusive vision towards the adoption of cryptos, which is a good start.”Jorge Farias, CEO of Cryptobuyer, sadly passed away shortly after the interview."
539,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is continuing to range between $56,000 and $60,000, as the so-called ""Kimchi premium"" is surging to yearly highs.Kimchi premium forms when Bitcoin is trading at a higher price in South Korea over other major markets like the United States.In 2017, the Kimchi premium surpassed 20%, causing Bitcoin to trade at around $24,000 in South Korea while it topped at nearly $20,000 in the U.S.Last week, on March 29, this premium resurfaced, hovering at 6%, which has since climbed to around 11%.The last time the Kimchi premium rose to an all-time high, the Bitcoin market topped and saw a violent correction almost immediately afterward. Although the premium suggests that the South Korean cryptocurrency market is showing signs of getting overheated, it is not high enough to mark a top. Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, said that the premium is worrisome, but the fundamentals of Bitcoin look strong. The difference between this time and 2017, however, is that South Korea only accounts for 1.7% of the global Bitcoin market's trading volume.As such, Ki explained that even if the South Korean market sees a pullback as a result of the rising premium, it would not have as big of an impact it had in 2017. He noted:More importantly, unlike 2017, the ongoing Bitcoin rally has been led by institutions and high-net-worth investors, as demonstrated by the huge outflows from Coinbase.But, one reason why many analysts are concerned about the overcrowded cryptocurreny exchange market in South Korea is that there is significant interest in newly-emerging crypto assets.Instead of Bitcoin and Ether (ETH), cryptocurrencies with the highest volume on Bithumb, as an example, often are new altcoins that have been in existence for a couple of months.Less than a week ago on March 29,  Ki emphasized that shorting Bitcoin is not the ideal trade as Coinbase Pro is seeing large outflows.Outflows from top exchanges typically suggest that institutional investors are buying Bitcoin and moving their holdings to self-hosted wallets.Ki said at the time:Since then, Bitcoin has rallied by around 5% and has seen a relatively stable uptrend, possibly due to the U.S. dollar showing renewed signs of weakness."
540,"Nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, are “10 times better than their physical counterparts,” according to digital art collector MetaKovan.The pseudonymous art patron, who was recently revealed to be blockchain entrepreneur Vingaresh Sundaresan, bought the NFT of Beeple’s ""Everydays: The First 5000 Days"" for $69 million earlier this year.Explaining the motives behind his purchase in an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, MetaKovan pointed out that NFTs have a number of advantages over traditional artworks: They are easy to transfer, they don’t have any storage costs and their ownership can be shared. Also, they can democratize the art world by making it more easily accessible to digital artists all over the world, regardless of their nationality and social background.MetaKovan even said that NFTs will bring crypto into the mainstream. ""A lot of people are going to get introduced to crypto by NFTs,"" he explained. The art patron dismissed concerns about the potential risks of a speculative bubble growing in the NFT market. He thinks the frenzy around NFTs serves the purpose of accelerating adoption.“If there is speculation, that’s ok, because we are making everything fast,” he said.According to MetaKovan,  the NFT market will eventually influence the price of large cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).That could happen “in a year or so, when a lot more people will be using NFTs,” MetaKovan said.Check out the full interview on our YouTube channel, and don’t forget to subscribe!"
541,"The U.S. dollar is starting to weaken once again as sellers are pushing the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) downward, which could strengthen the momentum of Bitcoin (BTC) in the near term.Alternative assets like Bitcoin and gold are priced against the dollar. Hence, when the DXY starts to drop, it often causes BTC to rally against the dollar.According to Holger Zschaepitz, a market analyst at Welt, the U.S. dollar's share of global reserves is rapidly declining as countries like Russia are pursuing a de-dollarization strategy and opting for gold.When the pandemic was declared in the first quarter of 2020, the demand for the dollar increased as investors fled to cash because it is the global reserve currency.However, due to various factors including the presidential election and the negative outlook on COVID throughout last year, the dollar struggled to outperform other currencies like the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc.Zschaepitz said:If the decline of the U.S. dollar continues, there is a strong probability that Bitcoin will continue to rally in April.Historically, April has been a strong month for Bitcoin throughout the past ten years, recording positive gains for five consecutive years since 2016.April is a good month for #Bitcoin
pic.twitter.com/3csQMSdcaAAdditionally, Danny Scott, the CEO of the Bitcoin exchange CoinCorner, said that the law of averages puts Bitcoin at $83,000 in April. He wrote:Atop the favorable macro factors for Bitcoin, Lex Moskoviski, the CIO at Moskoviski Capital, pinpointed that miners recently began ramping up their BTC holdings.On a single day, miners added 4,380 Bitcoin, which the quantitative trader and investor described as a growing trend. He said:When miners sell their holdings, Bitcoin typically sees a pullback as it can cause heavily leveraged orders in the futures market to see cascading liquidations. If miners are hoarding Bitcoin and stacking BTC with the expectations that the cryptocurrency will appreciate, it reduces the probability of a severe sell-off in the foreseeable future.In the near term, whether Bitcoin remains above the $58,000 support area remains key. If it continues to consolidate above it, the chances of it seeing a strong breakout above the $60,000 resistance level greatly increases."
542,"Life and annuity companies are increasingly dedicating part of their asset base to Bitcoin (BTC). While the top crypto has delivered the best returns over the past decade, the long-talked-about institutional herd seems to be finally making its way to the BTC market.During the bear market of 2018, Bitcoin developmental efforts from multiple stakeholders seemed to focus on improving BTC’s regulatory stance. These efforts saw the emergence of institutional-grade custody platforms among other prerequisites needed for greater participation by regulated entities.Over the last year, publicly listed firms have begun to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets, citing fiat currency debasement concerns. Significant cash influxes by major central banks to support stimulus packages enacted by governments to soften the economic blows struck by the coronavirus pandemic has market commentators fearful of rising inflation.With pension funds and insurance joining other public corporations in investing in Bitcoin, attention is now shifting to whether governments themselves will begin to invest in BTC via their sovereign wealth funds. Meanwhile, 2021 remains a bullish year for the largest asset by market capitalization with its March closeout representing the best Q1 performance in eight years.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, KiwiSaver, a $350-million retirement plan operated by New Zealand Funds Management, recently allocated 5% of its assets into Bitcoin. At the time, James Grigor, chief investment officer at NZ Funds, remarked that Bitcoin’s similarities to gold make BTC an attractive asset for life and annuity firms.According to Grigor, NZ Funds amended its offer documents back in 2020 to include cryptocurrency investments in its catalog. This move allowed the company to purchase BTC back in October when Bitcoin was trading around the $10,000 price mark.In less than six months, NZ Funds’ KiwiSaver product is now likely sitting on almost six-fold profit on its Bitcoin investment. For the NZ Funds’ executive, Bitcoin presents another set of opportunities outside the usual traditional asset route.Indeed, Bitcoin’s established history of aggressive compounding capabilities despite any price retracement seems to be catching the attention of big-money players. Hedge funds, family offices and publicly listed companies have been allocating assets to Bitcoin in recent times.Back in 2018 and 2019, Morgan Creek’s Mark Yusko and Anthony Pompliano identified pension funds and insurance as a class of institutional investors that should consider investing in Bitcoin. At the time, Pompliano predicted that pension funds would face significant challenges in meeting their future obligations if they did not aggressively pursue portfolio diversification beyond the usual investments in bonds and stocks.In February 2019, Morgan Creek announced a blockchain-focused venture fund anchored by two public pension funds in the United States, among other investors. Since then, a few other pension funds and insurance firms have executed some form of exposure to Bitcoin.As reported by Cointelegraph at the time, Massachusetts-based insurance provider MassMutual added Bitcoin to its general investment account. MassMutual reportedly bought $100 million worth of BTC from New York Digital Investment Group while also putting up a $5-million equity stake in the company.Detailing the company’s Bitcoin investment thesis, MassMutual’s Chelsea Haraty told Cointelegraph that the move was indicative of the firm’s broader strategy of capitalizing on emerging opportunities while diversifying its asset portfolio, adding:Haraty’s characterization of MassMutual’s Bitcoin outlay as “measured yet meaningful” echoes the sentiments espoused by market proponents like Yusko and Pompliano who have encouraged insurance firms and pension funds to invest in Bitcoin. Indeed, 1% is often used as an adequate proportion for BTC exposure for institutional investors.Back in January, Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of Grayscale crypto fund, remarked that pension funds were fuelling the growth of the crypto asset management firm. According to Sonnenshein, endowments and pensions were among the active investors in the firm’s Bitcoin trust.NYDIG CEO Robert Gutmann has also provided further confirmation that life and annuity companies are increasingly reevaluating their investment allocation with a view to engineering some exposure to Bitcoin.In a virtual podcast with Raoul Pal, an investment strategist and founder of Real Vision, Gutmann declared that several life-and-annuity companies were making inquiries about investing in Bitcoin. According to Gutmann, the current drive for BTC exposure for pension funds and insurance firms went beyond fears of currency debasement to concerns over the risks associated with having insufficient cover for dollar-denominated liabilities, stating:Pension funds have not been exempted by the economic stresses occasioned by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. In July 2020, Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund — touted to be the largest in the world — posted a first-quarter loss of $165 billion, roughly Bitcoin’s market capitalization at the time. The loss was indicative of the market turmoil caused by the events of March 12, 2020, known as Black Thursday.While not as heavy as the dents taken by pension funds during the global financial crisis of 2008, COVID-19 has negatively impacted the performance of many pension funds around the world. According to a report by Bloomberg back in February, the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, or OMERS — one of Canada’s largest pension funds — recorded a 2.7% asset decline on a year-on-year basis.Poor investment choices during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are reportedly to blame for Omers’ asset depreciation, with investments in markets such as legacy financial services, energy companies and other “old economy” equities failing to yield gains. Even Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett dumped bank stocks in favor of gold back in August 2020.Amid the substantial losses suffered by pension funds during the 2008 global financial crisis were calls for reforms in the private pension sector. Indeed, pension funds in countries under the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development umbrella lost an estimated $3.5 trillion due to the crisis.For OMERS and other pension funds suffering their largest losses since the 2008 crisis, the foregone opportunity of not adding any Bitcoin exposure is becoming more apparent. To put Bitcoin’s dominance over traditional assets in perspective during the COVID-19 era, BTC is up more than 650% since the World Health Organization classified the coronavirus as a pandemic in March 2020.Apart from pension funds and insurance firms, reports are emerging that sovereign wealth funds may become the next major participants in the institutional Bitcoin investment scene. According to NYDIG’s Gutmann, governments are also in talks with the company toward allocating some of their assets to BTC.While having direct exposure is likely what these talks are about, Norway’s oil fund — the government’s pension fund — holds an indirect Bitcoin investment. The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, with over $1 trillion in assets, has indirect BTC exposure via its investment in business intelligence firm MicroStrategy.During Gutmann’s podcast appearance with Pal, the Real Vision founder also revealed that Temasek — Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund — is also a Bitcoin investor. According to Pal, Temasek, with an asset base valued at about $306 billion, has been buying virgin BTC from miners.Market commentators like Pal say sovereign wealth funds will bring in a “wall of money” into the Bitcoin space. Such an influx of institutional buying power could likely fuel another parabolic advance in BTC’s price. As is the case with insurance companies and life and annuity firms, Bitcoin likely offers a suitable investment instrument to be used as a hedge against dollar-denominated liabilities."
543,"On Feb. 19, Bitcoin's (BTC) market capitalization surpassed $1 trillion for the first time. While this was an exciting moment for investors, it also concerned investors that the asset is in a bubble.Although a handful of listed companies ever achieved this feat, unlike gold, silver, and Bitcoin, stocks potentially generate earnings, which in turn can be used for buybacks, dividends, or developing additional sources of revenue.On the other hand, as Bitcoin adoption increases, those same companies will likely be forced to move some of their cash positions to non-inflatable assets, ensuring demand for gold, silver and Bitcoin.In fact, data shows that diversification between Bitcoin and traditional assets provides better risk-adjusted performance for investors, which is getting increasingly difficult for companies to ignore.Bitcoin continuing to push above the trillion-dollar mark is also easy to overlook until one compares it to the market cap of other significant global assets. To date, less than ten tradable assets have achieved this feat.As depicted above, the world's 44 most profitable companies combined generate more than $1 trillion in earnings per year. One must keep in mind that stockholders might as well reinvest their dividends into equities, but some of it might end up in Bitcoin.Corporate earnings are not the only flows that may trickle into scarce digital assets. Some analysts estimate that part of the real estate investment, especially those yielding less than inflation, will eventually migrate to riskier assets, including Bitcoin.On the other hand, current holders of lucrative real estate assets might be willing to diversify. Considering the relatively scarce assets available, stocks, commodities, and Bitcoin are likely the beneficiaries of some of this inflow.According to the above chart, the global agricultural real estate is valued at $27 trillion. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates a return on farm equity at 4.2% for 2020. Albeit very raw data, considering there are multiple uses for agricultural real estate, it is quite feasible that the sector generates over $1 trillion per year.As recently reported by Cointelegraph, there are 51.9 million individuals worldwide with $1 million or higher net worth, excluding debt. Despite representing only 1% of the adult population, they collectively hold $173.3 trillion. Even if those are unwilling to sell assets in exchange for BTC, an insignificant 0.6% annual return is enough to create $1 trillion.These numbers confirm how a $1 trillion market capitalization for Bitcoin should not be immediately considered a bubble.Maybe those Bitcoin maximalists are correct, and global assets are heavily inflated due to a lack of scarce and secure options to store wealth. In this case, which doesn't seem obvious, a global-scale asset deflation would certainly limit BTC upside potential. Unless they somehow think a cryptocurrency can extrapolate global wealth, which seems odd.Back to a more realistic worldview, the above comparison with equities, agricultural real estate, and global wealth also confirms how insignificant Ether's (ETH) current $244 billion capitalization is, let alone the remaining $610 billion in altcoins.Assuming none of the corporate profits or real estate yield will be allocated to cryptocurrencies seems unlikely. Meanwhile, a mere $100 billion annual inflow for Bitcoin is five times higher than the $20.3 billion newly-minted coins per year at the current $59,500 price.For example, $100 billion flowing into Bitcoin would only be 5% of the $1 trillion yearly corporate dividends and 5% from global wealth or agricultural real estate returns. Even though the impact on gold's $11 trillion market capitalization would be negligent, such allocations would certainly play a vital role in Bitcoin's path to becoming a multi-trillion dollar asset.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

544,"The United States government has increasingly stepped up its overwatch on crypto in recent years, although an outright ban on Bitcoin is now unlikely — at least according to Gemini CEO and co-founder Tyler Winklevoss.“I think, if we were back in 2013, this would be kind of an open question,” Winklevoss told podcaster Peter McCormack when asked about regulation and a Bitcoin (BTC) ban during a Friday episode of the What Bitcoin Did podcast:Back in 2015, the CFTC referred to BTC as a commodity in the midst of dealing with Derivabit, a BTC options trading platform. According to the CFTC, Derivabit, a product of a company called Coinflip, was not compliant with the governing body at the time.“We are a New York trust company regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services,” Winklevoss continued, referring to Gemini. “So much would have to be undone,” he said of a Bitcoin ban, adding:The crypto space as it is known today began in 2009 with the inception of Bitcoin. Since then, the asset has given birth to an entire ecosystem, with mainstream players becoming involved in various capacities. Regulatory talk has also continued moving forward in terms of providing and enforcing guidelines as they relate to crypto.Winklevoss additionally mentioned regulators as stakeholders. They have the well-being of companies and consumers in mind, but some also may hold BTC and see it as valuable. He also noted the trend of crypto industry leaders finding their way into government positions.“I think it’s like such a strong amount of people who believe in this in the U.S. that I think it’s like next to 0% chance that that sort of gets rolled back for whatever reason,” he said, adding:He also pointed out that stopping Bitcoin would essentially require putting significant restrictions on the internet as a whole, which would affect other economic aspects.Speaking of crypto leaders finding their way to government positions, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network recently chose a former Chainalysis exec as its incoming acting director."
545,"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, a new Marvel Cinematic Universe show on the Disney+ streaming platform, incorporated a Bitcoin (BTC) bounty into its newest episode. In episode three, “Power Broker,” one of the characters receives a text message that reads: “Selby dead. ₿1K BOUNTY for her killers.” The reference, which drops around the narrative's halfway mark, is timely given Bitcoin's ongoing bull market. At the time of publication, 1,000 BTC equals approximately $58.8 million USD.Reddit user Okitraz1986 spotted the Bitcoin reference, and posted their findings (as well as a screenshot) on Reddit’s r/Bitcoin forum on Friday, saying:Unfortunately, the story still shows Bitcoin being used in an underworld-esque manner, instead of as an asset for public investment — which would arguably be a more apt use case, if not quite so thematic. Over the years, Bitcoin has found it difficult to shake its reputed connections to nefarious activity, despite increasing legitimacy as a store of value similar to gold.In late 2020, another TV show, Shameless, also included Bitcoin and Ethereum references in one episode."
546,"According to a recent research note by JPMorgan, institutional investors have withdrawn about $20 billion from their gold investments since mid-October and during the same time frame, institutional inflows into Bitcoin (BTC) have increased by $7 billion. The bank said, “any such crowding out of gold as an 'alternative' currency implies big upside for Bitcoin over the long term.""JPMorgan believes that Bitcoin’s declining volatility could increase adoption from institutional investors. If that happens, the value of the private investments in Bitcoin may mirror that of gold and this gives Bitcoin an upside target of $130,000 in the long term, added the bank.In other news, billionaire investor Mark Cuban said his crypto portfolio consists of 30% Ether (ETH) because he believes it is the closest thing to being a true currency. Cuban said the remainder of his crypto portfolio consists of 60% Bitcoin and 10% in other crypto investments.CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju recently highlighted that 400,000 Ether had left Coinbase, a sign that institutional investors may have started accumulating the top altcoin.The increased adoption of cryptocurrencies by legacy financial institutions and investors is a positive sign but will this newsflow act as a tailwind and boost the price of the top-10 cryptocurrencies?Let’s analyze the charts to find out.Bitcoin formed a Doji candlestick pattern on March 31 and April 1, which suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. However, the positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground. The bulls are again trying to push the price above the $60,000 resistance.A strong breakout above the $60,000 to $61,825.84 overhead resistance zone will suggest that bulls are back in the driver’s seat. That could signal the start of the next leg of the uptrend, which has a target objective at $69,279 and then $79,566.Traders can keep an eye on the relative strength index because a break above the downtrend line will indicate a pick-up in momentum.Contrary to this assumption, if the price once again reverses direction from the overhead resistance zone, the BTC/USDT pair could drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($53,362). A break below this critical support could attract profit-booking from short-term traders and that could pull the price down to $50,460.02 and then $43,006.77.Ether broke out of the symmetrical triangle on March 31 and has continued its journey higher. Today, the bulls have pushed the biggest altcoin above the all-time high at $2,040.77.The 20-day exponential moving average ($1,798) has turned up and the RSI is near the overbought territory, indicating advantage to the bulls.If the buyers can sustain the price above $2,040.77, the ETH/USDT pair could start the next leg of the up-move. The pattern target of the breakout from the triangle is $2,618.14.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level, a drop to the 20-day EMA is possible. A strong bounce off it will signal strength and the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend.This bullish view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below the trendline. Such a move could pull the price down to $1,289.After some hesitation on March 31, Binance Coin (BNB) broke above the $315 resistance on April 1 and has followed it up with a breakout above the all-time high at $348.69 today. If the bulls can sustain the breakout, the altcoin could rally to $400 and then $430.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought territory suggest that bulls are in command.However, if the bulls fail to defend the price above $348.69, the BNB/USDT pair could drop to $315. If the bulls can flip this level into support, it will increase the possibility of the resumption of the uptrend.This bullish view will invalidate if the pair turns down and breaks below the moving averages. Such a move will suggest that the current breakout was a bull trap.Cardano (ADA) has been stuck in a tight range for the past few days but the positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the 20-day EMA ($1.17). This suggests a lack of buying but does not show an urgency among traders to dump their positions.The bulls may now attempt to push the price above $1.30. If they succeed, the ADA/USDT pair could rally to $1.48. This is an important resistance because the price had turned down from it on Feb. 27 and March 18.If that happens once again, the pair could extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. However, if the bulls propel the price above $1.48, the pair could resume its uptrend that may reach $2. This bullish view will invalidate on a break and close below $1.03.Polkadot (DOT) had turned down from the downtrend line on April 1 but the bulls did not give up much ground. This shows that traders did not close their positions in a hurry. The buyers have pushed the price above the downtrend line today.The 20-day EMA ($35.06) has started to turn up and the RSI is in the positive zone, indicating advantage to the bulls. If the buyers can sustain the price above the downtrend line, the DOT/USDT pair could challenge the all-time high at $42.28.A breakout and close above $42.28 could resume the uptrend with the next possible move to $53.50. This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level or the all-time high and slips below the moving averages. That could pull the price down to $26.50.After hesitating near $0.60 for the past few days, the bulls are currently attempting to propel XRP to the $0.65 overhead resistance. This level is likely to act as a stiff resistance because the price has turned down from it on five previous occasions.However, the rising 20-day EMA ($0.53) and the RSI above 65 suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the bulls can push and sustain the price above $0.65, the XRP/USDT pair could rally to $0.78 and then $1.This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages. Such a move will indicate that traders are selling on rallies. That could keep the pair range-bound between $0.42 and $0.65 for a few more days.Uniswap (UNI) has been stuck between both the moving averages for the past few days. The bears could not sink and sustain the price below the 50-day SMA ($27.59) on March 31 and the bulls could not sustain the price above the 20-day EMA ($29.13) on April 1.The flat 20-day EMA and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.This neutral view could tilt in favor of the bulls if they propel and sustain the price above $30.31 today. If that happens, the UNI/USDT pair could start to move up toward the $35.20 overhead resistance.On the other hand, if the price turns down and breaks below $25.50, the pair could witness increased selling pressure, which may pull the price down to $18.Litecoin (LTC) recovered sharply from its intraday low on March 31 and broke above the 50-day SMA ($197) on April 1. The bulls will now try to push the price above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle.If they manage to do that, the LTC/USDT pair could rally to $230 and then to $246.96. The pattern target of the breakout from the triangle is $307.42. However, the marginally rising 20-day EMA ($193) and the RSI at the downtrend line suggest a weak bullish momentum.If the price turns down from the resistance line, the pair may extend its stay inside the triangle for a few more days. The bears will gain the upper hand on a break below the trendline of the triangle.Chainlink (LINK) reversed course from $26.18 on March 31 and rose above the downtrend line of the descending triangle. This move invalidates the bearish setup and the bulls will now try to propel the price above the overhead resistance at $32.If they succeed, the LINK/USDT pair could start its march toward the all-time high at $36.93. The 20-day EMA ($28.45) has started to turn up and the RSI has risen above 59, indicating a minor advantage to the bulls.However, if the bulls fail to propel the price above $32, then the pair could drop to the moving averages. If the price rebounds off the moving averages, it will indicate that traders are buying on minor dips. The bulls will then make one more attempt to push the price above $32.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance and breaks below the moving averages, then the pair could remain stuck inside the $24 to $32 range for a few more days.THETA is currently range-bound in an uptrend. The price action of the past few days has formed a symmetrical triangle, which usually acts as a continuation pattern.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is at 63, indicating the path of least resistance is to the upside.If the bulls can propel the price above the triangle, the THETA/USDT pair could rally to the all-time high at $14.96 and then to the pattern target at $17.85.This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below the triangle. Such a move will increase the possibility of a break below the critical support at $10.35, signaling a deeper correction.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

547,"With more than 35 million customers, $21 billion in revenues and $3.8 trillion in discretionary managed assets, Fidelity Investments is one of the largest investment management companies in the world. It may need all its heft to break the losing streak of crypto-fund sponsors that have gone up against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.As reported, Fidelity filed with the SEC on March 24 a preliminary registration statement on behalf of its Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust — an exchange-traded fund that would track the performance of Bitcoin as measured by its Fidelity Bitcoin Index. This followed similar SEC filings this year from WisdomTree, CBOE/VanEck, NYDIG Asset Management, Valkyrie Digital Assets and SkyBridge Capital.A Fidelity Bitcoin fund would be an event of some historic importance. According to Nik Bhatia, author of the book Layered Money: From Gold and Dollars to Bitcoin and Central Bank Digital Currencies and adjunct professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California, this would be bigger than Elon Musk buying $1.5 billion in Bitcoin (BTC) for Tesla’s corporate treasury, more significant than PayPal allowing its users to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrency, and greater than Coinbase’s upcoming initial public offering.“It would bring the final stamp of legitimacy to Bitcoin,” Bhatia told Cointelegraph, and it could happen relatively soon. “I imagine that [CEO] Abby Johnson and Fidelity have filed, knowing they will get approved, and I now think it’s probably less than 12 months away.”Nigel Green, founder and CEO of deVere Group — an independent financial advisory organization — told Cointelegraph, that if the SEC approves Fidelity’s BTC plans, it would mean “another major step into the mainstream for cryptocurrencies. It will also, inevitably, prompt more institutional investors into the already burgeoning cryptoverse.”Not all are sure, though. “The Fidelity name is important, but it may not be big enough to overcome the other hurdles,” Georges Ugeux, adjunct lecturer in law at Columbia University Law School, told Cointelegraph. Among those hindrances are the crypto funds’ lack of diversification, illiquidity and, at least in the short term, the fact that the agency still doesn’t have a confirmed chairman.Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds — a crypto index fund provider — told Cointelegraph: “We have seen many ETFs being rejected by the SEC citing manipulation and market size as concerns.” Still, the cryptocurrency space has grown significantly over recent years and matured into an emerging new asset class. “If one keeps knocking on the door, it will eventually open.”There are reasons, however, why approval of Bitcoin ETFs are unlikely in the immediate future, Michael Venuto, co-founder and chief investment officer of Toroso Investments, told Cointelegraph. “The SEC role is investor protection. Approving an ETF of Bitcoin could be seen as an endorsement that may run counter to more powerful forces within our government.” More clarity is still needed “at the federal, fiscal, tax and other regulatory levels” before the agency will approve a BTC fund, he said.Regulators are worried about, among other things, concentration risk — i.e., the possibility of “amplified losses” because holdings aren’t sufficiently diversified — a risk that may be particularly pronounced with a Bitcoin fund. In its S-1 filing, Fidelity itself acknowledged that:With equity funds, the SEC doesn’t want any single stock to comprise more than 25% of an ETF’s basket size as measured by market capitalization, Ugeux told Cointelegraph. Bitcoin isn’t an equity, of course — it’s more like a commodity, at least according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and recent statements by senior SEC officials — but a Fidelity BTC would appear to really stretch the SEC’s concentration rules.Another possible concern is liquidity, added Ugeux. ETF sponsors are supposed to be continuously purchasing and selling the fund’s underlying assets — to protect the sponsor so it isn’t holding too much itself — but here again, a Bitcoin fund can be problematic because its underlying assets are not (relatively) liquid securities.Fidelity acknowledged in its filing its ability to sell Bitcoin could be affected by limited trading volume, lack of a market maker, or legal restrictions — indeed, a “governmental authority may suspend or restrict trading in Bitcoin altogether.” The filing added: “Bitcoin is a new asset with a very limited trading history. Therefore, the markets for bitcoin may be less liquid and more volatile than other markets for more established products.”Still, these problems could be surmountable. “It seems a question of when — not if — the SEC will approve a Bitcoin ETF,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, in a public statement that he shared with Cointelegraph. Additionally, when approval does come, he said that:As noted, some half dozen firms have filed with the U.S. SEC for crypto ETFs this year. Could any of them beat Fidelity to the punch, and if so, would they have anything close to the impact of a Fidelity ETF?“I don’t think Fidelity has an advantage in getting approved,” Venuto told Cointelegraph. “The only one with a slight advantage is VanEck since they were the first of the current class to file for a 19b-4 rule change” — which made it easier to list ETFs.Felix Shipkevich, an attorney specializing in cryptocurrency-related legal and regulatory matters at Shipkevich PLLC, told Cointelegraph: “All of the ETF Bitcoin applicants are game-changers” — i.e., not just Fidelity. Even with the regulatory ambiguity in the cryptocurrency space, “I have yet to see an ETF application from anything less than a first-tier financial services firm.”Related: Bitcoin ETF may come to US, but not all crypto investors think it’s neededEven if approval is eventually given, it may not happen so fast. Hester Peirce, a commissioner at the SEC and sometimes referred to as “Crypto Mom” for her support of cryptocurrencies, addressed the matter of ETFs in a recent speech, and “she did not give the impression that one [i.e., approval] would come through immediately,” said Ugeux. Approval(s) may take additional time, too, because Gary Gensler still hasn’t officially been confirmed as SEC chairman almost two months after his nomination, he added.From Peirce’s speech, one might even conclude that the SEC had dug itself into a bit of a hole because it had delayed BTC fund approval for so long. Not only has the SEC’s “reluctance to permit traditional investment vehicles to hold Bitcoin or Bitcoin futures has contributed to investors seeking more expensive, less convenient, or less direct substitutes,” she said, “but it also has heightened the stakes of any regulatory approval for a mainstream retail product we might one day grant.”The waiting has “magnified the first-approved advantage” for any Bitcoin ETF, and should the agency allow one now, investors might think the SEC is giving its “blessing” to that particular product — which would be the wrong inference to take, Peirce added.Whatever the circumstances — whether alone or as part of a group, whether sooner or later — “an ETF launched by one of the biggest mutual funds in the world definitely makes a statement,” said Neo regarding the Fidelity filing.He continued: “It emphasizes the maturity and acceptance in Bitcoin” and would bring more institutional investors to the cryptoverse but also retail investors “with a low-cost, flexible alternative to efficiently diversify their portfolio into digital assets.”“Staggeringly,” Green told Cointelegraph, “there are still some ‘experts’ who claim that digital currencies are not the future of money. The move by this investment giant to launch a Bitcoin ETF further underscores that cryptocurrency cynics are on the wrong side of history.”"
548,"Bitcoin (BTC) is primed for a price breakout after beating out volatility, but April may still produce a surprise sell-off.In his latest market update on Friday, Filbfilb, co-founder of trading suite DecenTrader, said that he now expects upside to take over on BTC/USD.Bitcoin has recovered from its flash crash earlier in the week and briefly hit $60,000 overnight on Friday. With seven-day gains still at 13%, there are plenty of reasons to be bullish in the short term now that consolidation looks set to conclude, Filbfilb argues.“With the weekend looming amidst a buoyant week; it’s difficult not to be optimistic,” he summarized.A comparison worth noting is what happened to Bitcoin when it originally broke through $20,000 resistance. A pattern of sudden breakouts following a protracted period of consolidation and regression could end up characterizing $60,000 as well.“A few weeks ago I shared this similar price action/market structure as what was seen around the $20k level, which had a correction back to c.50k before a violent breakout,” Filbfilb continued.This breakout nonetheless faces challenges in the coming weeks. Coinbase, fully prepared for its initial public offering on April 14, may unwittingly spark downward price pressure.As was the case this week with London-based Deliveroo, the debut of an IPO often results in selling at first, with the implications for Bitcoin being clear.“We may see increased volatility around this time period of the 14th April and should pay particular attention to the time from here to options expiry at the end of the month,” Filbfilb concluded.The end-of-month options expiry may also spook spot price temporarily — this having been very much in evidence at the end of March when expiring options hit a record $6 billion. In the end, however, the actual event itself had no impact on BTC’s performance.“Lots more bull market to come,” statistician Willy Woo forecast.Woo quoted on-chain analytics service Glassnode’s active BTC supply data, which likewise suggests that Bitcoin can rise more before old hodlers sell for profit, causing a cycle top.Regardless of Coinbase’s IPO impact on the market this month, the analyst doesn’t see Bitcoin closing below $46,400 anytime soon. He said: "
549,"Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, returned to an all-time high on Friday when the spot price for each unit of ETH exceeded $2,000.Meanwhile, the ominous specter of Ethereum’s unwieldy transaction fees made itself felt once more, as the cost of using the blockchain rose 77% across the past few days, in line with a 31% increase to the ETH coin price.Ether recorded green candles for eight of the past nine days, as the coin price rose from a recent bottom of $1,530 on March 26 to the $2,009 valuation witnessed at the time of publication.Transaction fees summarily jumped 77% across the same time period, as the average cost of transacting on Ethereum rose from $12.96 to $22.97, according to data from Bitinfocharts.com.Average fee figures often paint an inaccurate picture of the fees being paid most often on-chain due to high-value outliers. The median transaction fee, which gives a clearer indication of the fees being paid most frequently, also rose during the past week, climbing 91% from $6.66 to $12.74.Few disagree that in the online world of dollar donations and sub-cent tips, the kind of costs incurred on popular chains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, where the average fee is currently around $8.50, are not really fit for purpose.With this in mind, developers have put forward EIP-1559, an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that will overhaul the way fees are calculated on the blockchain. When the upgrade is implemented this coming July, transaction fees will be dynamically adjusted algorithmically. A deflationary aspect will be introduced to Ethereum’s tokenomics at the same time, with a portion of the network fees set to be burned out of existence after each transaction.In the longer term, Ethereum is scheduled to move to a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, which will see the current proof-of-work system abandoned completely. In PoS blockchains, coin holders stake coins to secure the network in return for passive income, as opposed to miners contributing computing power in pursuit of block rewards. The new consensus algorithm is being implemented as part of Ethereum’s ongoing upgrade to Eth2."

The sustained higher levels mean that Bitcoin has effectively canceled out the flash crash from earlier this week, while still continuing to trade in a defined corridor.For popular trader Crypto Ed, the outlook was for $60,000 to disappear as resistance based on fading selling pressure on exchanges. Higher than $70,000, however, may have to wait longer.""I mentioned BTC target $73k and ETH $2300,"" he wrote on Friday.Others are more optimistic, with short-term estimates including $68,000 and $73,000 and 2021 targets exceeding $288,000.""The ~$57,500 area rejected BTC in February.

551,"The cryptocurrency space may be helping to spawn its own competitors after a representative of the People’s Bank of China said Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent surge had caused renewed interest in the nation’s digital yuan project.The digital yuan is China’s central bank digital currency, and like all CBDCs its foundational principles are completely antithetical to those of the cryptocurrency space.Core crypto concepts of decentralization and autonomy are dispensed with in favor of centralization and oversight, in an effort by government authorities to more easily control the flow of money. The digital yuan is also expected to be central to China’s smart city ambitions, which would see entire cities made cashless in the coming years.But the PBoC believes the “very strong” interest that the digital yuan is receiving is a result of Bitcoin’s recent ascension to new all-time highs, despite cryptocurrency still being banned in China.PBoC research bureau director Wang Xin said interest in the digital yuan was driven in part by the ambitions of other countries to follow suit, and also by Bitcoin’s price hike. According to CNBC’s mandarin translation of his comments, Xin said:China has run numerous pilot tests of the digital yuan in the past couple of years, with its experimentation extending to biometric hardware wallets, on-street ATMs, national lottery draws, and more."
552,"Former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Jay Clayton has stated that Bitcoin has not been classified as a security for a long time.But speaking on CNBC’s Squawk Box on March 31, Clayton warned that its status as a non-security still does not protect it from the imposition of new regulations, which, he warned, could be coming soon.""Where digital assets land at the end of the day--will be driven in part by regulation both domestic and international, and I expect that regulation will come in this area both directly and indirectly,"" says Former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton on #bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/voWcgCFqOHHost Andrew Ross Sorkin pointed out that under Clayton’s watch, the SEC did not take a position on Bitcoin regulation. Clayton responded that was because the asset was declared not to be a security before he even took up his position as the head of the regulatory body.Clayton has remained in the industry following his departure from the SEC in December 2020 and currently advises One River Asset Management on cryptocurrencies.Although he professes not to have any special insights into what new laws are coming from his time heading up the SEC, he believes the regulatory environment is due for a shake up.Clayton’s comments come just a week after billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio warned that the U.S. may ban Bitcoin outright just as they did with gold in the 1930s.His comments about Bitcoin’s status as a non-security are also interesting in light of Ripple’s appeals to the SEC for documents from the agency to determine how exactly it came to the conclusion that Bitcoin and Ethereum were not securities.The company and its backers have repeatedly argued that XRP is not a security however the SEC believes it is markedly different due to being morcentralized. Former SEC attorney Marc Powers told Cointelegraph that the agency is executing significant overreach in its case against Ripple and its executives."
553,"For the first time, shares in Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust traded at a discount compared to spot BTC for an entire month.Rafael Schultze-Kraft, the CTO of on-chain analytics provider Glassnode, shared the observation to Twitter on April 1, noting shares in the institutional fund manager’s Bitcoin Trust had traded at a notional discount of -6% on average during March.He noted the discount in Grayscale’s BTC shares has coincided with the launch of the Purpose Bitcoin ETF in Canada — which has accumulated 16,000 BTC worth roughly $940 million since launching in late February.3/ The drop in $GTBC premium coincides with the launch of the Purpose #Bitcoin ETF – which could've drawn investment away from GBTC.

The ETF has accumulated more than 16k BTC in over a month. (Still dwarfed by Grayscale's 654k BTC holdings).

Chart: https://t.co/o0AtdTEQsD pic.twitter.com/AGINo51TMyGlassnode’s CTO is not alone in speculating the launch of North America’s first Bitcoin ETF may be siphoning institution away from Grayscale, with Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz tweeting:Two Bitcoin and crypto ETFs were also approved by Brazil’s Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month.Schultze-Kraft noted the Trust’s Bitcoin holdings have been flat over recent weeks, stating this was: “Not surprising, as subscribing to create new $GBTC shares makes little sense as long as existing shares are trading at a discount.”Grayscale allows accredited investors to create baskets of shares that represent BTC or other digital assets by depositing fiat. Grayscale then deposits a corresponding quantity of crypto into its trusts, with investors facing a six-month lock-up period after which they can sell their shares using over-the-counter, or OTC, markets.With Grayscale’s shares historically trading at a premium over the spot crypto markets, many institutional investors have invested in the Trust as an arbitrage play, speculating the sizable spread would offset the 10% holding and interest fees associated with the six-month lock-up.Grayscale currently boasts $45.6 billion in assets under management across its 13 Trusts, following the launch of five new Trusts last month. Its new Decentraland (MANA) Trust represents $17.4 million, followed by Livepeer (LPT) with $12.3 million, Filecoin (FIL) with $8.5 million, Basic Attention Token (BAT) with $3.7 million, and Chainlink (LINK) with $3.5 million.While all of Grayscale’s newly supported assets have seen significant gains over recent weeks, Filecoin’s performance has topped the list with a 105% gain this past week according to CoinMarketCap."

He explained that “smart contracts and the fact that they're decentralized"" means ""there's no one in charge right there, the governance is completely different. That's what changed the game.”In fact he compared the development of Ethereum's smart contracts to the internet boom in the late ’90s and early 2000s:Despite Cuban’s bullishness on Ethereum, he revealed his portfolio has double the amount of Bitcoin to Ethereum with “60 percent Bitcoin, 30 percent Ethereum and 10 percent the rest.”The Mavs owner doesn’t draw comparisons with Bitcoin to the internet boom, as he views it primarily as a store of value. He believes Bitcoin is a better investment alternative to gold:The billionaire who stated  I’d rather have bananas” than Bitcoin in September 2019, has completely changed his tune since then. However, he may have been more involved than those comments suggest, after he tweeted in early January this year that: “I still have crypto from the early days of Coinbase.

These three exchanges have a predominantly Chinese user base and represent a large part of the Tier One trading volume for major pairs. On Thursday afternoon, Huobi trading volumes of FIL were more than three times that of BTC as the price reached a 7-day increase of 170%.Filecoin has had strong success in capturing the attention of Chinese investors, including large investment groups such as Fenbushi Capital, SNZ Capital and Neo’s EcoFund. These three were part of a group that backed the $23 million Filecoin Ecosystem Fund, announced on March 25. The Filecoin Ecosystem Fund is intended to support projects and help development on the network. It could also give backers early access to new projects, which is a lucrative model for VCs in an increasingly crowded investment space. It remains to be seen which of these two consequences are a bigger priority for the funds involved.On March 28, OKEx produced a video explaining the concepts behind Filecoin, which received around 600 shares and 3400 likes on Weibo. This shows a high level of attention from the Chinese retail audience, a demographic that is tough to obtain and hard to preserve over longer time-frames.Beijing-based BlockCreateArt hosted a major NFT art exhibition on March 26 supported by auction house Christie’s, Digital Finance Group and mining rig producer Bitmain.

557,"South Korean prosecutors have finally sold a Bitcoin (BTC) haul they confiscated from a criminal in 2017 and it’s worth $10.5 million more than it was at the time of the arrest. The cash has reportedly been deposited in the coffers of the country’s national treasury.According to reports coming out of the Suwon District Prosecutors Office, this is the first time confiscated Bitcoin has been sold by authorities, and the first time the coins in question have moved since being put into cold storage in 2017.Originally worth $238,000 at the time of the confiscation, the coins were recently sold for a sum of $10.8 million, marking a 4,400% increase in value in four years. Based on that percentage growth, we can assume that Bitcoin was priced at around $1,300 when the arrest was made, close to April 2017.With no specific cryptocurrency laws or regulations in place at the time, authorities left the coins in cold storage. In late March, the South Korean government enacted widespread crypto-specific laws for the first time, putting more pressure on exchanges and virtual asset service providers to use real-name trading accounts and to report their activities to Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit. Prosecutors reportedly sold the coins as soon as the laws were put into place on March 25.South Korea’s determination to regulate the cryptocurrency space stems from revelations regarding crypto’s use by tax evaders, and the evergreen concerns surrounding money-laundering. In January 2022, new laws will come into force that levy a 20% capital gains tax on profits made from cryptocurrency trading.The National Tax Service of South Korea claimed the number of cryptocurrency investors rose 25% in the past year, resulting in an 800% increase to overall trade volume."

The last year to surpass this was also 2013 when the price was under $100, with a Q1 performance of 539%.Anticipation for the next few months is already building. Q2 is traditionally the strongest time of the year for Bitcoin with only two years seeing negative returns, both less than 10%. The target to beat is from 2019, which delivered 159% gains, and is the best Q2 since 2013.Simply studying raw returns data thus fuels a sense that Bitcoin is performing exactly as expected in the year after a block subsidy halving, traditionally its strongest in each four-year halving cycle.Comparing this cycle to previous ones — and 2021 to 2013 and 2017 — meanwhile shows that regardless of all-time highs, Bitcoin has actually done nothing out of the ordinary.Uploading the latest version of a chart showing price movements after each halving, quant analyst PlanB put to rest concerns that BTC/USD has gained too quickly in recent months.""Bitcoin currently in between 2013 and 2017 tracks,"" he summarized to Twitter followers.As Cointelegraph reported, PlanB's stock-to-flow price models call for an average price of either $100,000 or $288,000 this cycle, with the former now likely too conservative as a top."

564,"Bitcoin has just closed six consecutive monthly green candles for the first time since April 2013. Should history repeat, Bitcoin may enjoy further parabolic gains this year.In April 2013, Bitcoin closed at roughly $140 after posting six green monthly candles. While the markets would retrace to less than $100 over the next two months, Bitcoin would then surge 700% over the following six months and tag prices above $1,000 for the first time.Bitcoin posted a similar pattern in the lead up to its parabolic bull run in 2017, with the markets posting five consecutive green monthly candles heading into September. While September saw BTC post range-bound consolidation, Bitcoin surged into new all-time highs in October to rallied from $5,000 to almost $20,000 by the end of the year.According to Bloomberg strategist, Mike McGlone, Bitcoin could be trading for more than $400,000 by 2022, should the markets follow the trends previously witnessed during 2013 and 2017. McGlone recently claimed that Bitcoin is ""well on its way to becoming a global digital reserve asset.""Veteran trader and market analyst, Peter Brandt, is also bullish on Bitcoin, predicting BTC could gain a further 250% to break above $200,000. ""I think we're in that midpoint pause where in 2017 Bitcoin swirled around for a month or two before we saw the final move up,"" he said.However, past trends do not guarantee future performance and the history of green candles is a little murky. Despite Bitcoin posting five green monthly candles in a row during late 2015, the early weeks of 2016 saw BTC crash by 20% before producing several months of tightening consolidation.  Similarly, the five consecutive months of bullish momentum that kicked of 2019 was followed by a protracted downtrend, with BTC having fallen more than 60% from its 2019 highs amid the ""Black Thursday"" crash of March 2020. Bitcoin did not reclaim its 2019 price-highs until December 2020."
565,"Following in the footsteps of Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs has announced plans to allow its wealth management clients to trade in cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. In an interview with CNBC, Mary Rich, the global head of digital assets for Goldman Sachs private wealth management division, said that the rollout may happen sometime in the second quarter of 2021.Bitcoin adoption by two of the world’s preeminent investment banks is likely to force other banks to walk down the crypto path sooner than later. The arrival of fresh money from the clients of these legacy institutions may further increase demand and boost prices higher.In response to a question about Bitcoin’s (BTC) future value, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell told Bloomberg that one Bitcoin, which currently buys a Tesla Model 3, will buy a Lamborghini by the end of the year and a Bugatti by 2023.Another bullish voice was that of Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz who said in an interview with CNBC that Bitcoin “is on an inevitable path to having the same market cap and then a higher market cap as gold.”However, not everyone is bullish on Bitcoin. Boris Schlossberg, the managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, told CNBC said that Bitcoin was “very, very close to perhaps an intermediate-term top here.”Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the trend and the path of least resistance.Bitcoin has been sustaining above the descending channel since breaking out of it on March 29, which is a positive sign. However, the bears have not given up yet as they are aggressively defending the $60,000 level.The price had turned down from $59,789 today, but an encouraging sign is that the bulls purchased the dip and did not allow the BTC/USDT pair to re-enter the channel. The bulls will now make one more attempt to rise above the all-time high at $61,825.84.If they succeed, the pair could resume the uptrend and start its northward march toward the first target at $69,279 and then $79,566. The upsloping moving averages suggest the bulls have the upper hand.However, the relative strength index (RSI) has been showing a negative divergence for the past few days. If the indicator turns down sharply from the downtrend line, it will suggest that the new uptrend may have to wait for a few days.The bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages. On the contrary, if the RSI rises above the downtrend line, it will indicate that the momentum has picked up, enhancing the prospects of a rally.Ether (ETH) has been knocking on the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle. A tight consolidation near a resistance increases the possibility of a break above it. The 20-day exponential moving average ($1,743) has turned up and the RSI is in the positive zone, indicating advantage to the bulls.If the buyers can drive the price above the triangle, the ETH/USDT pair could retest the all-time high. If the bulls clear this hurdle, the pair could then start its rally toward the pattern target at $2,618.14.However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will mount a stiff resistance at $2,040.77. If the price turns down from this overhead resistance but does not re-enter the triangle, then it will suggest that bulls are buying on dips. If that happens, the pair may have a good possibility of breaking above $2,040.77.On the other hand, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above the triangle, it will suggest that traders are squaring up their positions at higher levels. That could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days. The first sign of weakness will be when the price dips below the trendline.The bulls are trying to propel Binance Coin (BNB) above $315. Although the price turned down from the overhead resistance today, the long tail on the candlestick suggests the bulls are buying on every minor dip.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory, suggesting the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the bulls can drive the price above $315, the BNB/USDT pair could rally to $348.69.A breakout and close above the all-time high could start the next leg of the uptrend that could reach $430. This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level and plummets below the 20-day EMA ($265).Cardano (ADA) has been sustaining above the 20-day EMA ($1.16) for the past few days but the bulls have not been able to push the price above $1.30. This suggests a lack of demand at higher levels.The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI is just above the midpoint, suggesting a balance between supply and demand. The bears will now try to sink the price below the moving averages.If they do that, the ADA/USDT pair could drop to the $1.03 support. A break below this support will suggest the start of a deeper correction to $0.80.Conversely, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA and the bulls push the price above $1.30, the pair could rally to $1.48.After a minor hesitation near the 20-day EMA ($34.35), Polkadot (DOT) has broken above the moving averages today. This shows strong demand at higher levels. The bulls will now try to push the price above the downtrend line.If they succeed, the DOT/USDT pair could retest the all-time high at $42.28. If the momentum can conquer this resistance, the pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $53.50.However, if the price turns down from the downtrend line, it will suggest that bears are active at higher levels. That could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days. The flat moving averages and the RSI above 58 suggest a minor advantage to the bulls.XRP once again turned down from near the $0.60 overhead resistance. However, the positive sign is that the bulls have purchased the dip to the 20-day EMA ($0.51) as seen from the long tail on today’s candlestick.The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. The bulls are now likely to make one more attempt to push the price above $0.60.If they succeed, a rally to $0.65 is possible. This level may act as a stiff resistance, but if the bulls can thrust the price above it, the XRP/USDT pair could pick up momentum. This bullish view will invalidate if the price dips below the moving averages.Uniswap’s (UNI) rebound off the 50-day simple moving average ($27.26) on March 26 has not been able to clear the 20-day EMA ($29.12) hurdle. This shows that the sentiment has changed from buy on dips to sell on rallies.If the bears now sink the price below the $25.50 support, the UNI/USDT pair could enter a corrective phase that could pull the price down to $20 and then to $18.The marginally downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a minor advantage to the bears.This negative view will invalidate if the price turns up from the current level and rises above the 20-day EMA. Such a move could extend the stay of the pair inside the range for a few more days.THETA turned down from $13.95 on March 29, which indicates the bears are aggressively defending the $14 to $14.96 resistance zone. The bears will now try to sink the altcoin to the 20-day EMA ($10.27).In an uptrend, the bulls generally buy the dips to the 20-day EMA as it offers an attractive risk to reward ratio. Therefore, if the THETA/USDT pair rebounds off this support with strength, it will suggest the sentiment remains bullish and traders are buying on dips.That could keep the pair range-bound between $10.35 and $14 for a few more days. On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest a possible change in sentiment. The pair could then drop to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $8.88.Litecoin’s (LTC) relief rally seems to have hit a wall at the 50-day SMA ($196) as the bulls have not been able to sustain the price above it. The bears will now try to sink the price to the trendline of the triangle.If the price rebounds off the trendline, it will indicate that the bulls continue to buy on dips. That could keep the LTC/USDT pair trading inside the triangle for a few more days.The flat moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.This neutral view will invalidate after the price either breaks above or below the triangle. That could signal the possible start of a trending move.Chainlink (LINK) broke above the 20-day EMA ($27.79) on March 29 and 30 but could not climb the 50-day SMA ($29). Although the price turned down today, the bulls bought the dip as seen from the long tail on the candlestick.The bulls may now make one more attempt to push the price above the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the LINK/USDT pair could rise to $32. A break above this resistance will suggest advantage to the bulls.On the contrary, if the price again turns down from the 50-day SMA, then a drop to $24 is likely. This is an important support to keep an eye on because if it cracks, the pair will complete a descending triangle pattern, which could signal a possible trend reversal. Such a move could open the doors for a decline to $14.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

566,"Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz believes Bitcoin (BTC) is on track to meet or exceed gold’s market capitalization amid a rapid wave of retail and institutional adoption of the digital asset. In an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box, Novogratz said cryptocurrency “adoption’s happening much faster than I predicted,” adding that “it’s shocking to me how fast people are moving into the system.”Novogratz, who has been involved in Bitcoin since 2013 when the digital currency was valued at around $100, explained that his previous BTC price target of $60,000 was too conservative. The initial target was based on Bitcoin achieving roughly 10% of gold’s market capitalization.“At the beginning of the year, I thought $60,000 was my target because that would have been 10% of gold,” he said. “But I told myself and our investors that once it gets to 10% we’re all going to say it’s going to 20%, and then when it gets to 20% it’s going to go to 50% and then 100%.”Bitcoin’s emergence as “digital gold” has strengthened Novogratz’s conviction that the cryptocurrency will eventually reach or exceed bullion’s market value:Current estimates place the total market capitalization of gold at roughly $10.7 trillion. Bitcoin, by contrast, has a total market value of $1.1 trillion.Bitcoin appears to be outshining gold in the battle of the safe havens, with some prominent analysts claiming that BTC is taking market share away from the yellow metal. In December 2020, JPMorgan Chase strategists said Bitcoin's ascendance would serve as a headwind for bullion in the short term. One Bitcoin is currently worth 34.49 ounces of gold. This time last year, the ratio was around 4.19 ounces."
567,"Bitcoin (BTC) and some altcoins will soon be available to Goldman Sachs clients, according to a new media report.Released by CNBC on Wednesday, comments from an interview with Mary Rich, global head of digital assets for the bank's private wealth management division, confirmed the bank's plans to offer crypto assets to investors.The move will make Goldman the second major lender to open up the world of cryptocurrency to its clients, and it comes weeks after a pioneering move by Morgan Stanley.″We are working closely with teams across the firm to explore ways to offer thoughtful and appropriate access to the ecosystem for private wealth clients, and that is something we expect to offer in the near-term,” CNBC quoted Rich as saying.Morgan Stanley's rollout is due to launch in April, with Goldman's occurring later in the second quarter. Both banks have the potential to bring large amounts of new capital into the Bitcoin ecosystem via participation in crypto-focused funds.Continuing, Rich highlighted demand as a driving force behind Goldman's decision.“There’s a contingent of clients who are looking to this asset as a hedge against inflation, and the macro backdrop over the past year has certainly played into that,” she added.Like many major banks, Goldman has changed its tune on Bitcoin this year, going from a solid skeptic to embracing the phenomenon — noticeably in contrast with central banks including the United States Federal Reserve.""Eventually they will have to offer bitcoin services to everyone,"" Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano commented.Bitcoin price action reacted warmly to the news, passing $58,000 once more after Wednesday produced a flash crash of more than $2,000 in mere minutes.As Cointelegraph reported, analysts remain less concerned about the lack of momentum, pointing to solid fundamentals and the need to shake out overleveraged positions before grinding toward all-time highs. $68,000 and $73,000 are points of interest for a potential breakout."
568,"A scam cryptocurrency app on Apple’s app distribution service App Store has reportedly stolen $600,000 Bitcoin (BTC) from one iOS user.Cryptocurrency holder Phillipe Christodoulou fell victim to a scam app on the App Store, losing nearly all his life savings to a fake crypto wallet application, The Washington Post reports Tuesday.Christodoulou went on the App Store last month to search for a mobile Trezor app to check his Bitcoin balance via phone. Unaware that Trezor does not currently provide an iOS app, Christodoulou downloaded a doppelgänger Trezor application that boasted close to five stars, giving the impression that it was indeed an official app. After entering his seed phrase, Christodoulou said that his savings of 17.1 BTC were stolen.Christodoulou said that Apple, which collects 15% to 30% commissions on sales, should be held responsible for this situation. “They betrayed the trust that I had in them. Apple doesn’t deserve to get away with this,” he stated. According to the Washington Post, Christodoulou filed a report with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Following notification from Trezor, Apple removed the fake Trezor app several times, but it kept appearing on the App Store days later.The crypto community is somewhat divided on whether Apple should be blamed for the accident. “This is a f*cking nightmare. Scammed by a fake Trezor app in the ‘curated and safe’ Apple App Store,” crypto investor Scott Melker said on Twitter. Jameson Lopp, co-founder of crypto custody platform Casa said, “Stop entering seed phrases into software. Only enter seeds into dedicated Bitcoin hardware devices.”Fake cryptocurrency wallet and trading apps have appeared on the App Store before. United Kingdom-based crypto intelligence company Coinfirm said that five people have reported having their crypto stolen by a fake Trezor app on iOS, with total losses estimated at $1.6 million. Trezor spokesperson Kristyna Mazankova told Cointelegraph that the firm has been fighting against fraudulent apps for years now. “We have had an internal process on reporting phishing sites and apps since mid-2019,” she said, stating that Trezor has already reported three doppelgänger Trezor apps to Apple in  2021.“It takes days before the apps are removed and we never get any response from either Apple or Google, so it is difficult for us to know, for how long exactly are these apps on and how many people get tricked,” Mazankova stated.  Trezor is planning to introduce a mobile app for iOS in the fourth quarter of 2021.Apple did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment."
569,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell over $2,000 in five minutes on March 31 as a wave of volatility disrupted an otherwise calm market.Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed a nightmare for long traders unfold on Wednesday, with BTC/USD suddenly dropping from $59,350 to $57,000.At the time of writing, the losses were still mounting after the pair hit lows of $56,713 on Bitstamp. ""Exactly Bitcoin,"" said trader Michaël van de Poppe, reacting to what has become a familiar event on short time frames for Bitcoin.Previously, upside had been the focus for day traders as news from PayPal spawned a run-up to just below $60,000.Those betting on a continuation of the bull run lost big on Wednesday, however, as the downturn liquidated long positions worth $600 million amid a 24-hour total wipeout of $1 billion.For quantitative analyst PlanB, the demise of the positions was nonetheless beneficial, helping to rid the market of unwanted leverage and ensure more organic future rises. As Cointelegraph reported, similar events have occurred with both long and short positions in recent months.""Beautiful stop loss hunting .. again,"" PlanB commented on Twitter.Meanwhile, indicators showed reason to believe that further price increases for Bitcoin would need some work.Funding rates across derivatives platforms were higher on the day, reaching as high as 0.375% on Huobi, a classic sign that downward pressure is incoming.The longer-term picture remains more than positive, with analysts pointing to $68,000 and $73,000 as the next hurdles to watch."
570,"Coin Metrics co-founder Nic Carter has produced a well-researched rebuttal to some of the key claims suggesting power-hungry Bitcoin mining is causing an environmental disaster.In an in-depth article called Noahbjectivity on Bitcoin mining penned on March 30, the Castle Island Ventures Partner responds to claims by Bloomberg columnist Noah Smith in a March 24 article titled Bitcoin miners are on a path to self-destruction.The first claim Carter took aim at was that Bitcoin is unique among assets in that a rising price entails a greater energy draw. Carter stated that gold has the exact same trait in that higher prices result in increased mining and energy consumption.Secondly, there was a claim by Smith that Bitcoin mining hogs local power resources depriving regular customers of electricity. However, according to figures produced by Carter, mining is concentrated in areas where there is actually an excess of unused energy.Within China, the vast majority of mining occurs in four provinces: Xinjiang, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, and Yunnan. Between them they accounted for 63% of the global Bitcoin hashrate from Q4 2019 to Q2 2020. These areas use a combination of coal, solar, wind, and hydropower and they all have a relatively low population density and an overabundance of energy.Carter calls this surplus energy that will never make it to the grid ‘nonviral’ and delved deep into the figures to reveal that in previous years China has curtailed or sequestered 100 TWh on average worth of hydro, solar, and wind energy, collectively. Curtailing is a process that refers to removing  excess energy from the grid or public consumption often to maintain price levels.Bitcoin mining has been estimated to consume between 89 TWh/year and 138 TWh, according to data from the Digiconomist and Cambridge University.If Bitcoin mining, which is relatively portable, is concentrated in areas where electricity is unused (and thus cheap) this complicates arguments that simply total up the power consumption.For example Alex de Vries, founder of Digiconomist, wrote in a recent article:The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) estimates Bitcoin’s annual electricity consumption is currently somewhere between that of Sweden and Malaysia.In Smith’s original article he argued that Bitcoin developers needed to adopt an alternative to Proof-of-Work, citing Proof-of-Stake as a viable candidate. Ethereum is moving to Proof of Stake with Eth2, which is estimated to use 99.98% less electricity.Carter doesn’t believe that Proof of Stake can compete in terms of security and decentralization however:"
571,"Appearing on Bloomberg, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell explained why he believes dollar-based long-term price predictions for Bitcoin are flawed, emphasizing the inflationary nature of fiat currencies.Responding to a question asking Powell for end of year price predictions, Kraken’s CEO said: “I think I said Bitcoin is going to infinity and that’s kind of hard to comprehend because I’m measuring it in terms of dollars.”Offering alternative measures for valuing Bitcoin, Powell speculated the value of Bitcoin may increase from its current 'price' or one BTC per Tesla Model 3 to “one Bitcoin per Lambo” by the end of the year, and to “one Bitcoin per Bugatti” by 2023. Powell added:While Bitcoin spent much of 2019 and the first half of 2020 trading for the price of a secondhand 2010 Honda Civic, one Bitcoin could have purchased a brand new Civic when the price broke into new all-time highs at the end of year.When asked about Ethereum, Powell emphasized the importance of the booming non-fungible token sector, stating: “All of the NFT activity is really driving up the use of Ethereum.”Powell also highlighted uncertainty surrounding when the Eth2 overhaul will be completed and noted that deposits to Ethereum’s staking contract are currently removing Ether from supply.On the topic of altcoins, Powell pointed to the buzz surrounding Polkadot, alluding to perceptions the network may comprise “the next Ethereum” due to scaling and fee issues.“There are a lot of other coins that are being launched on top of this network, and I think you’ll see a lot of things that were on Ethereum be ported over to Polkadot,” he said, noting the “lower transaction fees” associated with Polkadot.Polkadot seeks to offer greater speed and efficiency than other crypto networks by processing transactions using a “parachain” architecture where multiple sharded chains operate in parallel. While parachains are yet to launch on Polkadot’s mainnet, the ecosystem's Acala Network, became the first project to secure a parachain slot on Polkadot’s Rococo testnet last week.Although sharding is on the Eth2 roadmap, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin revealed earlier this month its developers are currently prioritizing the chain merge between Ethereum and Eth2. Buterin also expressed confidence that layer-two rollups will scale the network sufficiently over the short term while sharding is not a developmental priority. Optimism's rollups mainnet has since been delayed until July."
572,"Major U.S.-based mining firm Marathon Digital Holdings has announced the launch of what it describes as the first North American Bitcoin mining pool that is “fully compliant with U.S. regulations.”According to a March 30 announcement, the pool adheres to U.S. anti-money laundering guidelines and rules set out by the Office of Foreign Asset Control, or OFAC. Marathon will ensure the transactions processed by its pool meet regulatory standards by using technology exclusively licensed by DMG Blockchain allowing transfers to be filtered.The firm will begin diverting 100% of its current hash power to the new pool from May 1. Marathon’s new pool also plans to begin accepting hash power pooled from other U.S.-based miners from June 1. By 2022, Marathon expects to have deployed 103,120 miners to direct 10.37 exahashes per second, or EH/s, to the mining pool — equal to roughly 6.4% of the Bitcoin network’s current combined hash rate.By avoiding transactions executed by individuals on the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List, Marathon claims its operations will be entirely regulatory compliant.The announcement does not specify how DMG’s technology identifies whether transactions have been issued by individuals blacklisted by the Treasury Department.Merrick Okamoto, Marathon’s chairman and CEO, asserted that despite the recent surge in institutional interest surrounding Bitcoin, a lack of regulatory assurances has deterred many firms from participating in Bitcoin mining:“While we appreciate some miners’ appetite for processing transactions indiscriminately, it is our belief that as a publicly listed company based in the United States, and as one focused on enabling more institutional adoption of Bitcoin, it is our responsibility to follow U.S. regulations,” he added.Despite the apparent reluctance of institutions to participate in Bitcoin mining, analysts believe some U.S. investors have been speculating on the stocks of major mining firms as a way to access regulated exposure to the BTC markets.Last week, Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin mining stocks had outperformed BTC by 455% on average over the past 12 months, gaining roughly 5,000% over the same period that Bitcoin rallied 900%.Fundstrat’s vice president of digital asset strategy, Leeor Shimron, speculated: “Until a Bitcoin ETF is approved, investors may view public mining companies as one of the only ways to get exposure to Bitcoin.”"
573,"March 30 could become a historical day that will be remembered by Bitcoin (BTC) fans for a long time. Besides marking a 17% recovery from the $50,300 bottom on March 25, PayPal officially confirmed that it will support crypto payments for U.S. customers. Moreover, CME Group announced that its Micro Bitcoin futures contracts will launch on May 3 with the contract size starting at 0.1 BTC each. Additional bullish news came as Morning Brew, a daily business newsletter with 2.5 million subscribers, finally dropped gold and is now exhibiting Bitcoin price in its markets section alongside the S&P 500, Nasdaq, Dow, 10-Year Treasury and JPMorgan stock.March 30 also marks 3 weeks of BTC price having a daily candle close above $50,000. Thus, as the market indicates a healthy consolidation period, traders should closely monitor the levels of leverage being used by investors. Historically, crashes tend to occur when buyers are excessively optimistic and any sharp price movement larger than 8% tends to trigger larger cascading liquidations.The open interest on Bitcoin futures shows the size of the current longs and shorts and whenever this number increases substantially, it means investors have a larger risk exposure. Thus, it shows increasing market interest in the asset but this also comes at the cost of potentially sizable liquidations.The above chart shows a 105% increase in futures open interest over the last two months. Meanwhile, the current $22.6 billion indicator remains only 2% below its all-time high.Even though Bitcoin’s price surge can explain part of this hike, it also reflects renewed confidence as longs have been liquidated on $7.4 billion between March 14 and March 24.To understand how bullish or bearish professional traders are leaning, one should analyze the futures basis rate. Basis is also frequently referred to as the futures premium and it measures the difference between longer-term futures contracts and the current spot market levels.A 10% to 20% annualized premium (basis) is interpreted as neutral, or a situation known as contango. This price difference is caused by sellers demanding more money to withhold settlement longer.On March 13, BTC markets entered an excessive-leverage situation as the basis rate neared 35%. Being optimistic, especially during a bullish market, should not be deemed worrisome. However, as the price dropped 11% following the $61,800 all-time high, these ultra-leveraged buyers had their positions terminated.This time around, the basis rate hovers around 29%, which is reasonably high but the figure could adjust itself over the next couple of days. These leveraged buyers might increase their margins or buy BTC on regular spot exchanges to subsequently reduce their futures position.Although longs seem to be excessively leveraged, there are currently no signs of potential market stress that hint at a negative outcome if BTC price drops to $53,000. As most of the recent open interest increase happened in early-March, the long’s average price is likely not much higher than this.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

574,"Two Trezor executives have taken part in a live ask-me-anything session on Cointelegraph — revealing how their suite of crypto hardware wallets are set to evolve in the future.Head of development Tomas Susanka and head of product Matej Zak said one of their biggest priorities is ensuring that technical hurdles are removed for Bitcoin beginners — meaning that it’s never been easier to keep digital assets safe.During the broadcast, they proudly showed off the Model T, which supports more than 1,000 cryptocurrencies. An intuitive touch screen offers an interface that’s not dissimilar to a mobile phone — offering a high degree of familiarity.Susanka explained that Trezor is introducing Trezor Suite — a completely new wallet interface. The software is currently available as a public beta as a desktop and browser app and in time will be available on Android and iOS devices.“The most important thing is that people use hardware wallets and that you don’t keep cryptocurrencies on exchanges”, he told Cointelegraph’s Rachel Wolfson. “We’re building a whole ecosystem — we’re trying to push the usability even more to lure in all beginners and make it friendly for anyone.”Crucially, the app enables beginners to buy and exchange crypto directly — as well as send and receive digital assets.“I believe if you are able to use internet banking, I’m pretty sure you can use Trezor Suite,” Susanka said.Zak added that Trezor is determined to spur adoption of cryptocurrencies, and this involves building an in-depth, accessible knowledge base directly in its apps — meaning that information about a coin’s specific features is never more than a tap away.Trezor’s head of product went on to say that a newcomer can easily buy Bitcoin for the first time in under five minutes, with one crucial point of difference: They will be the only person who owns the private keys that provide access to the blockchain, where funds are stored.“Other apps are popular, but if you purchase the Bitcoin there, you ‘bought’ it. But if that company goes bust tomorrow, then you lost the funds for sure — there’s no way to recover them.”Security is a vital tenet of the Trezor Model T, and one of the features championed by Susanka was the Shamir Backup, which enables users to take an extra step to keeping their keys secure.“You can have three sets of 20 words, or you can have for example five sets of 20 words. You define the threshold and the number of shares — the default that Trezor recommends is three out of five. That means we give you five shares of 20 words. You give one set to your mom, one set to your girlfriend … and keep the remaining ones for yourself. You need three of those sets to combine together to get back to your cryptocurrencies,” he explained.This helps ensure that there’s a safeguard in place if a device is lost — and even if you accidentally run it over with your car. It can also help address concerns about inheritance.A range of features are also designed to appeal to “hardcore” users who have plenty of experience with crypto and seek privacy when completing transactions.During the live AMA, viewers asked a plethora of questions about what’s in the pipeline for the future.Both executives made clear that they focus on embracing new developments in the industry when it’s clear that they are here to stay, rather than a passing craze.

575,"As the Bitcoin (BTC) price edges closer to $59,000, its value relative to gold is approaching new all-time highs, possibly hinting at the emergence of a new preferred store of value.Measured against gold, Bitcoin’s price reached 34.94 ounces on Tuesday. The BTC-gold comparative peaked at 35.35 ounces on March 13 as Bitcoin surged past $61,000.Bitcoin’s value relative to gold has more than doubled over the past three months and has grown nearly sevenfold since October 2020.Gold futures, meanwhile, plunged below $1,700 a troy ounce Tuesday on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The price bottomed at $1,676.50, marking a new three-week low. Since peaking above $2,050 a troy ounce in August 2020, bullion has corrected nearly 18%.2020 was a big year for gold, as the yellow metal set new all-time highs in every major currency before toppling $2,000 per U.S. dollar for the first time. Bullion ended the year with a gain of around 22%. Still, that paled in comparison with Bitcoin’s 265% yearly return.With the recent $1.9 stimulus package fueling inflation fears, assets like gold and Bitcoin should, in theory, perform well as investors hedge their bets against the declining dollar. However, the recent rise in bond yields may have taken some of the shine away from gold.Others, even some prominent analysts like Bloomberg’s Mke McGlone, believe gold is losing ground to Bitcoin in the battle of the safe-havens. Earlier this month, McGlone tweeted:Digital #Gold Pushing Aside the Old Guard -
Gold will always have a place in jewelry and coin collections, but most indicators point to an accelerating pace of #Bitcoin replacing the metal as a store of value in investor portfolios. pic.twitter.com/RR0CCWmksFEven JPMorgan, an organization long critical of Bitcoin, has claimed that the digital currency will consume a portion of gold's market share. ""The adoption of bitcoin by institutional investors has only begun, while for gold, its adoption by institutional investors is very advanced,"" JPMorgan strategists led by Nikolas Panigirtzoglou said in a December 2020 report. ""If this medium to longer-term thesis proves right, the price of gold would suffer from a structural headwind over the coming years.”Bitcoin’s digital gold narrative continues to strengthen post-halving. The quadrennial deflationary event, which last occurred in May 2020, reduces the amount of new Bitcoin that enters circulation after each block is mined."
576,"Bitcoin (BTC) has produced phenomenal returns most years, but when it comes to maximizing them, it's best just to buy and hodl.That was the conclusion from new data circulating on social media this week, which casts serious doubt on the merits of following investment advice from mainstream media.Under the microscope was CNBC, which in 2017 offered viewers an investment portfolio made up of 30% Bitcoin and 70% altcoins.Four years later, those who invested $10,000 at the time now have around $52,300. Had they just bought and hodled Bitcoin, however, they would have over $140,000.""The 30% #BTC allocation is responsible for 75% of the return,"" Twitter account StatsBTC, which uploaded the numbers, noted in comments.CNBC's portfolio came courtesy of well-known pundit Brian Kelly, months before it hit then all-time highs of $20,000. Altcoins also saw peaks, months later in early 2018, with most only to crash and never recover.Subsequently, the network gained an unenviable reputation for acting as a buy signal for investors — ironically by telling them not to invest in Bitcoin. The same fate has since befallen the likes of gold bug Peter Schiff.As Cointelegraph reported, fellow host Jim Cramer, on the other hand, has embraced Bitcoin thanks to persuasion from Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano. His investment, thought to be around $500,000, has made Cramer ""a ton of money,"" he said earlier this month.Meanwhile, even a longer-term HODL strategy will have suffered from exposure to altcoins at the expense of its Bitcoin presence.According to Bob Simon, owner of the StatsBTC account, $100 divided equally between Bitcoin, Litecoin, XRP, Dogecoin and Peercoin in March 2014 would now be worth $6,000. A Bitcoin-only punt, by contrast, would sell for $12,130.""An equally weighted basket of the top 5 cryptocurrencies has underperformed Bitcoin by over 50% over the past 7 years,"" he summarized.Analysts still believe that this coming summer will produce huge gains for altcoins, with one arguing that a peak price ""Alt Season 2.0"" has already begun."
577,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) saw a correction in the run-up to the record options expiry last Friday. However, nothing happened despite some expecting a massive move on the same day. The actual correction occurred before the event. On the day itself, Bitcoin’s price has bottomed out and began to rally.The ongoing rally above $59,000 is being fueled by bullish news from Visa and PayPal as both are getting into Bitcoin and cryptocurrency payments. Put differently, the market is very much in the middle of the bull cycle and any correction is a blessing to traders and investors.As the chart above shows, the critical support area between $49,500 and $51,000 was just tested last week. Since the support held, another higher low was made, resulting in renewed upward momentum, which is playing out this wee.The entire structure since September is massively bullish when the market broke above $12,000 and started to accelerate. The previous higher low was made at $42,000, which then became the critical support area to hold. As Bitcoin’s price didn’t even need such a heavy correction this time around, the recent low at $49,500-$51,000 can be classified as the new higher low.Therefore, the next points of interest can be made through the Fibonacci extension, where $73,000 and $92,000 become the next points of interest if Bitcoin’s price breaks above the current all-time high at around $61,000.The total market capitalization shows a similar support test as the $1.5 trillion levels were critical to hold.Since the total market cap of crypto survived that correction, more upside is very likely as the all-time high regions will be tested.If further strength is being demonstrated, the next points of interest for the total market cap can be found at $2.2 trillion, which is also confirmed by the Fibonacci extension.The dominance chart of Bitcoin shows a critical breaker for more downside. If the dominance drops below 60%, an assumption can be made that a sharp drop will occur toward 50%.That’s not unlikely to happen since the summer period is often very favorable for altcoins. 2020 saw big rallies during this period, and investors remember the summer of 2017.History may certainly repeat once more as many altcoin charts are looking bullish for breakouts against Bitcoin. Therefore, for alt season to happen, the price of Bitcoin must be relatively stable or slowly grind upward, which is currently the case.The 4-hour chart of Bitcoin shows a clear uptrend since its recent bottom at $50,000.However, several critical support levels are being established during this rebound. Right now, the important area to hold is $56,000. As long as that region maintains support, more upside is likely for the market. This puts new all-time highs and potentially $73,000 on the table.On the upside, the critical area to break is shown by the red box, specifically $59,000-$60,000. Until then, altcoins will probably continue to gain momentum, and even if Bitcoin makes new all-time highs, altcoins will most likely follow suit.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

578,"The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or CME, has unveiled plans to launch a new Bitcoin (BTC) derivatives product that will enable traders to speculate on fractional units of the flagship digital currency.CME Group’s Micro Bitcoin futures contract, which is set to launch May 3 pending regulatory approval, will be worth 0.1 BTC. The smaller contract size provides market participants with an additional tool to hedge their Bitcoin price risk, CME said Tuesday. CME’s current Bitcoin contract unit is 5 BTC.Tim McCourt, CME Group’s global head of equity index and alternative investment products, explained:CME launched its Bitcoin futures contract in December 2017. The Chicago Board Options Exchange, Its larger crosstown rival, was the first to introduce the derivatives contract during the same month but has since abandoned Bitcoin futures altogether.CME has noted a steady uptick in crypto derivatives trading since the first Bitcoin futures contract launched more than three years ago. As Cointelegraph previously reported, average daily trade volumes for CME Bitcoin futures jumped 57% in January. Interest is likely to accelerate as the Bitcoin bull market brings new investors into the fold.There’s also evidence that the broader crypto derivatives market is heating up. In December 2020, crypto derivatives trades were valued at more than $1.3 trillion, accounting for 55% of the overall market, according to CoinMarketCap."
579,"Another day of gains for Bitcoin (BTC) has seen the price of the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization go beyond the $1.1 trillion mark — $1.105 trillion to be precise.This market capitalization growth now means that Bitcoin’s market size has surpassed Canada’s M1 money supply which stands at $1.104 trillion, according to data from CEIC.At the present figure, Bitcoin’s market capitalization is also greater than the M1 money supply of the Australian dollar, which currently stands at $1.079 trillion.By exceeding Australia and Canada, Bitcoin's market capitalization is once again large enough to make BTC appear in the top 10 “stock of narrow money” rankings.M1, or narrow money, refers to the total supply of physical currency in circulation as well as traveler's checks and other forms of demand deposits held by non-banking institutions, public firms and private sector organizations among others.Bitcoin’s climb to the top 10 of the global M1 money supply charts offers yet another indication of the pace of BTC’s growth as a currency. Back in November 2017, Bitcoin was only ranked 32nd in terms of narrow money supply.The BTC market capitalization surpassing Australia and Canada’s M1 money supply means the U.S. dollar value of every mined Bitcoin thus far is sufficient to replace the current currency circulation in either country, with a few Satoshis left over.Spain and Italy are the only two nations above Bitcoin whose M1 money supply figures are below the $2 trillion mark.At the current Bitcoin total supply of about 18.67 million BTC, the asset price will have to reach $90,600 to leapfrog both Spain and Italy on the M1 money supply log.Bitcoin is currently trading above the $59,000 mark, with PayPal recently announcing the launch of crypto payment support for U.S. customers. The largest crypto by market capitalization is up more than 100% year-to-date."
580,"A Scottish music school will begin accepting cryptocurrency for tuition payments following demand from students, it was announced this week. The Morningside School of Music in Edinburgh said it was responding to suggestions from adult pupils in the school, many of whom now work in the city’s burgeoning fintech sector.Morningside’s director, Linda Boyd, said the school had previously used cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) to make business purchases and could see the utility in accepting it as a form of payment. She said, “We sometimes use things like Bitcoin to pay for goods for the school, so we know how fast and easy it is and want our music students to be able to do the same.”Boyd said the school’s decision to accept cryptocurrency was an example of a small business following the recent example set by large businesses, adding that it simply represented a viable alternative payment method.“Some larger companies across the world are already doing this, so it’s just a matter of time before smaller businesses like ours start doing the same. It’s just about giving our customers another way of paying and making life easier for them.”Boyd referenced the capital city’s growing fintech industry, noting that many requests for the school to accept cryptocurrency came from people working in that industry.“Edinburgh’s got a big fintech industry and many of our pupils work or study in that sector, so for them this is a perfectly natural way to pay,” Boyd said.The financial technology industry has been on an upward trajectory in Edinburgh since 2019. FinTech Scotland, which operates in conjunction with Edinburgh University, was recently awarded a 22.5 million euro ($30.9 million) grant to establish a Global Open Finance Centre of Excellence in the city, in recognition of its status as a prominent national fintech cluster.Boyd said cryptocurrency payments for a range of goods and services would become commonplace in the near future.“Cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually become a routine way for people to pay for services of all descriptions,” she said."
581,"Online payments giant PayPal will start to accept cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange at its millions of global merchants, the firm’s president and CEO revealed on Tuesday ahead of a formal announcement.News broke regarding PayPal’s rumored decision to accept cryptocurrencies early on March 30. Later in the day, the firm’s CEO, Dan Schulman, confirmed to Reuters that the rumors were true and that an official statement would be released imminently.The new system is expected to feature a crypto checkout service where users can pay for goods and services at approved vendors using their stored coins. The system will reportedly see merchants receive equivalent funds directly in fiat currency after coins are subject to a quick transfer at the time of sale.The checkout service is expected to be available for all four of PayPal’s supported cryptocurrencies upon launch, consisting of Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Customers who pay with cryptocurrencies will incur no transaction fees on purchases, and only one coin can be used per purchase.“We think it is a transitional point where cryptocurrencies move from being predominantly an asset class that you buy, hold and or sell to now becoming a legitimate funding source to make transactions in the real world at millions of merchants,” said Schulman, regarding the launch.In October 2020, when PayPal’s intention to wade into the crypto space was first announced, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz called it “the shot heard around the world” in regards to how Wall Street would receive the news. PayPal continued to make inroads into the industry in early March, when it acquired digital assets security firm Curv in a deal thought to be worth $200 million.The PayPal news comes just 24 hours after Visa announced that it would pilot a new payments system using stablecoins on the Ethereum blockchain. The pilot will see participating merchants agree to settle customers’ fiat transactions using the USDC stablecoin."
582,"Bitcoin (BTC) neared $60,000 on March 30 after PayPal confirmed that it had formally launched  cryptocurrency payments.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and Tradingview showed BTC/USD hitting a ten-day high on Tuesday as details appeared in the mainstream press.According an exclusive report from Reuters, PayPal is set to release a formal announcement later on the day in which it will unveil its long-awaited cryptocurrency payment feature for U.S. customers.The company caused a stir last year when it confirmed its venture into crypto, with the rollout ultimately set to extend to all users and 29 million merchants.“This is the first time you can seamlessly use cryptocurrencies in the same way as a credit card or a debit card inside your PayPal wallet,” President and CEO Dan Schulman told Reuters.While PayPal will not focus solely on Bitcoin, BTC price action reacted favorably to the reports, passing February's prior all-time high of $58,300 to manage $59,200 at the time of writing.A look at orderbook data from Binance showed sellers still lined up between current spot price and historic highs of $61,700.Continuing, PayPal referenced a watershed moment for cryptocurrencies in general, with Schulman describing them as a ""legitimate funding source.""“We think it is a transitional point where cryptocurrencies move from being predominantly an asset class that you buy, hold and or sell to now becoming a legitimate funding source to make transactions in the real world at millions of merchants,” he added.Long a skeptic, PayPal's official line now chimes with some of Bitcoin's most forward proponents. Among the most bullish long-term forecasts this week was that from statistician Willy Woo, who in an interview said that a single Bitcoin would ultimately become worth ""millions of dollars.""""There's no way that Bitcoin's going to stop at the market cap of gold, which is $10 trillion; it's going to go a lot higher, which means that we're going to be going into the millions of dollars per coin,"" he told Real Vision's Laura Shin.Also featuring was veteran trader Peter Brandt, who in a now widely-circulated comment said that he had completely changed his perspective on Bitcoin. ""My mindset has changed... from bitcoin as a trade to bitcoin as a measure of wealth,"" he said."
583,"Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the Russian State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, believes that the country’s not-yet-launched digital currency is the “highest form of money.”In a Monday interview with state media RT, Aksakov expressed optimism about Russia’s upcoming central bank digital currency, or CBDC, predicting that a digital ruble will become an integral part of national settlements in two or three years.Aksakov said that the Bank of Russia expects to finalize a digital ruble prototype by the end of 2021, and plans to issue a development roadmap in the near future. “The digital ruble is the highest form of money at this stage,” he declared, elaborating that “In fact, it is the same ruble, but in the digital form.”A major critic of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Aksakov stressed that a digital ruble poses minimal risk compared with cryptocurrencies, as it would be issued by the Central Bank of Russia.Aksakov also said that Russia will gradually move away from the U.S. dollar for settlements in the near future. He noted that a number of countries like China, India and Russia have been taking measures to enlarge their presence in the global economy. However, it is still too early for a complete withdrawal from the dollar at this point, Aksakov said.The Bank of Russia officially announced its CBDC plans in late 2020, issuing a consultation paper on the development of a digital ruble in October 2020. Despite the Association of Russian Banks warning about the fraud and security risks of proposed digital ruble models in January, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Russia Alexey Zabotkin said that the bank aims to start piloting the CBDC in early 2022."
584,"On March 29, the Iowa House of Representatives passed a bill that seeks to legally recognize transactions and registrations made via blockchain smart contracts. The bill — SF541 — gained Senate approval earlier in the month.Under the auspices of the new bill, smart contracts would be given the same legal status as regular contracts, while distributed-ledger technology would be viewed as a reliable electronic store of record. Regarding smart contracts, the bill states:“The bill provides that a contract shall not be denied legal effect or enforceability solely because the contract is a smart contract or contains a smart contract provision.”The bill states that any registration of rights or ownership would not be invalidated by its broadcast on a blockchain network unless the transaction was related specifically to the transfer of the rights in question.“A person who, in engaging in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, uses distributed ledger technology to secure information that the person owns or has the right to use retains the same rights of ownership or use with respect to such information as before the person secured the information using distributed ledger technology,” states the bill, with the added qualifier, “unless in connection with a transaction with terms that expressly provide for the transfer of rights of ownership or use with respect to such information.”The bill gained the approval of the House without contest on March 29, with representatives voting 94-0. Earlier in the month, the bill made it through the Senate with similar ease, as it passed with a vote of 47-0.Democratic Representative Steve Hansen suggested the implementation of the bill would eventually lead to broader regulation of cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin (BTC), reports Iowa daily newspaper The Gazette. Republican Representative Jeff Shipley said the bill was more concerned with laying down definitions than regulations for the time being, adding that he thought Bitcoin would also fall under the scope of those definitions."
585,"Research from on-chain analytics provider Glassnode has found that roughly three-quarters of circulating Bitcoin last moved on the blockchain when prices were below $10,800, suggesting most market participants are long-term holders.Glassnode’s March 29 ‘Week on Chain’ report found that 25.43% of circulating BTC last traded between the prices of $10,800 and $58,800. With Bitcoin trading for $10,800 just six months ago, the data suggests one-in-four circulating BTC last changed hands during either Q2 2020 or Q1 2021.The report notes the number of long-term Bitcoin bulls continues to increase, with many coins that have remained dormant since early in the current market cycle now being classified by Glassnode as long-term holdings, or LTH — coins that have not moved on-chain for at least 155 days.As a result, the number of coins being classified as entering into “illiquid supply” has surged in 2021. The Illiquid Supply Change metric has shown that the 30-day change in supply is moving from a liquid or readily traded state into an illiquid state representing HODLed coins.The report observed that accumulation rates exceeding 130k BTC per month has been consistently maintained throughout this bull market.Glassnode’s Coin Days Destroyed metric, or CDD, also points to increasing hodling among long-term investors, with CDD suggesting seasoned investors are again realizing gains at a rate comparable to 2020 after a surge of profit-taking between November through January.“The take home message here is that investors and traders have continued to buy into BTC, throughout this bull market,” said Glassnode.Bitcoin’s “Hodlwave” metric, which visually breaks down Bitcoin’s supply based on when coins last moved on-chain, shows a spike in both long-term hodling and short-term circulation amid the current market conditions.According to Unchained Capital’s Hodlwaves, two-thirds of Bitccoin’s supply has changed hands in the six months, roughly half of which last moved during January or February. Approximately 5% of BTC’s supply was active during the past seven days.At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading up 4% over the past 24 hours at $57,500 according to CoinGecko."
586,"E-commerce merchants can now transact in nearly 40 cryptocurrencies through global payment platform Nuvei. According to the announcement, merchants partnered with the payment provider can use an array of cryptocurrencies to send and receive payments across 200 countries, including top assets Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), lesser known cryptos such as Reddcoin and Bitcoin Gold, and even hyper-volatile coins like Dogecoin (DOGE).Nuvei’s customers can even use Ripple (XRP), despite the asset’s recent legal woes and subsequent delistings from major exchanges.Commenting on the launch, Nuvei’s CEO and chairman, Philip Fayer, described the firm’s support for crypto assets as “empower[ing] our clients, large and small, with frictionless payment experiences and a greater opportunity to partake in a global marketplace.”The announcement also asserts crypto asset transactions will provide “enhanced security, privacy, and integrity” to Nuvei’s users when compared to traditional fiat methods of payment. However, multiple crypto assets supported by Nuvei have previously been the subject of 51% attacks.In the final quarter of 2020, Nuvei processed almost $14 billion from merchants, with the company handling $43 billion over the entirety of 2020.Nuvei’s announcement comes as competition between traditional payment providers entering the crypto sector is heating.On March 29, Visa announced a pilot program allowing all its partners to use the Ethereum blockchain to settle transactions made in fiat. The solution utilizes the USDC stablecoin to clear transactions.Late last year, Paypal announced that it will start offering cryptocurrency services to its users including the ability for them to purchase and trade them.On March 22, U.S.-based online shopping app Buyaladdin announced it will start accepting BTC and ETH across multiple shopping malls in South Korea."
587,"On Monday Visa announced that it had launched a pilot program with Crypto.com to enable its partners to settle fiat transactions by sending USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin to Visa’s Ethereum address at Anchorage digital bank. This step by Visa shows that legacy finance companies are increasing their adoption of cryptocurrencies.According to a PwC report reviewed by Bloomberg, crypto mergers and acquisitions soared to $1.1 billion in 2020 compared to $481 million in 2019. The increase in these deals is likely to surpass the 2020 numbers on every single metric with the arrival of large investors and institutional players according to PwC global crypto leader Henri Arslanian.Several investors who had previously been critical of cryptocurrencies are gradually taking the plunge. The latest to join is the Norwegian billionaire investor Øystein Stray Spetalen, who went from a Bitcoin (BTC) basher to a crypto adopter within one month. Spetalen recently announced that he has joined the board of Norway's top domestic crypto exchange MiraiEx and also purchased an undisclosed amount of Bitcoin.The arrival of new investors has increased the demand whereas the HODLers sitting tight with their holdings has reduced the supply. Could this result in the resumption of the uptrend? Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin has broken out of the resistance line of the descending channel. If the bulls can sustain the price above the channel, it enhances the prospects of a retest of the all-time high at $61,825.84.The 20-day exponential moving average ($55,090) has started to turn up and the relative strength index (RSI) has risen above 59, indicating the bulls have the upper hand. A breakout and close above $61,825.84 could open the doors for a rally to $69,279 and then $79,566.However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They are likely to pose a stiff challenge at $61,825.84. If the BTC/USD pair turns down from this level but stays above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the sentiment remains bullish as traders are buying the dips.A break below the 50-day simple moving average ($52,376) will be the first sign that bears are making a comeback.Ether (ETH) continues to trade inside the symmetrical triangle, which usually acts as a continuation pattern. The bulls have pushed the price above the moving averages today, indicating strong buying at lower levels.The buyers will now try to push the price above the downtrend line of the triangle. If they manage to do that, the ETH/USD pair could move up to $2,040.77 and then to the pattern target at $2,618.14.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the downtrend line, the pair could extend its stay inside the triangle for a few more days.The indicators are giving a mixed signal. While the flat moving averages suggest a few more days of range-bound action inside the triangle, the RSI above 57 suggests the momentum is picking up in favor of the bulls.The bulls pushed Binance Coin (BNB) above the downtrend line on March 27. The 20-day EMA ($256) has started to turn up and the RSI is in the positive territory, suggesting the bulls are trying to gain the upper hand.There is a minor resistance at $280 but the bulls are likely to push the price above it. If they do that, the BNB/USD pair could rise to $309.50 where the bears may mount a stiff resistance. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair may spend a few more days in consolidation.Conversely, if the bulls can thrust the price above $309.50, a retest of the all-time high at $348.69 is possible. A breakout of this resistance will suggest the resumption of the uptrend, which has a target objective at $430.Cardano (ADA) continues to consolidate in the $1.03 to $1.48 range. The bulls have been sustaining the price above the 20-day EMA ($1.15) for the past three days, which is a positive sign.The 20-day EMA is rising gradually and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating a minor advantage to the bulls. If the bulls can propel the price above $1.30, the ADA/USD pair could rally to $1.48. A breakout of this resistance could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $2.This positive view will be negated if the price turns down and breaks below the $1.03 support. Such a move could open the doors for a decline to $0.80.Polkadot’s (DOT) rebound off the $26.50 support has risen above the 20-day EMA ($34) today. This suggests the bulls have overpowered the bears and will now try to push the price to the downtrend line.If the bulls can drive the price above the downtrend line, the DOT/USD pair may retest the all-time high at $42.28. A breakout of this resistance could open the doors for a rally to $53.50.On the other hand, if the price turns down from the downtrend line, the pair could remain stuck inside the $26.50 to $40 range for a few more days. A break and close below $26.50 could start a deeper correction.XRP formed an inside day candlestick pattern on March 27 and a Doji candlestick formation on March 28, both indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. Today, the bulls are trying to resolve the uncertainty in their favor.If the bulls can propel the price above $0.58, the XRP/USD pair could rally to $0.65. There is a minor resistance at $0.60 but that is likely to be crossed. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 61 suggest the bulls have the advantage.The pair is likely to pick up momentum after breaking above the $0.65 resistance. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the moving averages, a drop to $0.42 is possible.The bulls faced a stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($29.31) on March 27 and 28 but the positive thing was that they did not allow the price to dip below the 50-day SMA ($26.91). Today, the bulls are again trying to push Uniswap (UNI) above the 20-day EMA.If the buyers can sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the recent break below $27.97 on March 24 was a bear trap. The UNI/USD pair could then gradually move up to the overhead resistance at $35.20.A breakout of the $35.20 to $36.80 overhead resistance zone could start the next leg of the uptrend. Alternatively, a break below $25.52 may indicate the start of a deeper correction. Until then, volatile range-bound trading is likely to continue.THETA is consolidating between $14.96 and 10.35. In an uptrend, when the correction stalls at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, it shows that traders are not rushing to the exit but are buying on dips.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the bulls can drive the price above $14.96, the THETA/USD pair may start its journey toward $19.On the contrary, if the price turns down from $14.96, the pair may extend its stay inside the range. The bears will have to sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($9.81) to gain the upper hand.Litecoin (LTC) broke below the symmetrical triangle on March 24 but the bears could not capitalize on this advantage. The bulls pushed the price back into the triangle on March 26 and this could have trapped several aggressive bears.After defending the trendline of the triangle on March 27 and 28, the bulls have pushed the price above the 20-day EMA ($190.68) today. The price could now move up to the resistance line of the triangle where the bulls are likely to face stiff resistance from the bears.If the price turns down from the resistance line, the LTC/USD pair could extend its stay inside the triangle for a few more days.However, if the bulls drive the price above the triangle, the pair may rally to $246.96 and then to the pattern target at $309. This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down and plummets below $168.Chainlink (LINK) remains stuck in a range between $24 and $32. The rebound off the support of the range has reached the 50-day SMA ($29) where the bears may offer some resistance.The flat moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint do not project a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. The indicators suggest the continuation of the range-bound action for a few more days.If the LINK/USD pair turns down from the 50-day SMA, the bears will make another attempt to sink the price below $24. If they succeed, the pair may drop to $20.11 and then to $18.On the other hand, if the bulls can drive the price above the moving averages, the pair may rally to $32.

588,"The open interest on Bitcoin (BTC) Dec. 31 call options between $100,000 and $300,000 reached an impressive 6,700 contracts, which is currently worth $385 million. These derivatives give the buyer the right to acquire Bitcoin for a fixed price, while the seller is obliged to honor the price.One might think that this is a great way to leverage a long position, but it comes at a cost and is usually quite high. For this right, the buyer pays an upfront fee (premium) to the call option seller. For example, the $100,000 call option is currently trading at 0.164 BTC, equivalent to $9,480.For this reason, option traders seldomly buy these options by themselves. Therefore, longer-expiry derivatives usually involve multiple strike prices or calendar months.Shown above is an actual trade arranged by Paradigm, an institutional investor-focused over-the-counter trading desk. In this trade, a total of 37 BTC December $100,000 and $140,000 calls have been traded between two of their clients.Unfortunately, there's no way to know which side the market maker was, but considering the risks involved, one can assume the client was looking for a bullish position.By selling the $140,000 call option and simultaneously buying the more expensive $100,000 call, this client paid a $138,000 upfront premium. This amount represents their max loss, which takes place at $100,000 price on Dec. 31.The red line on the above simulation shows the net outcome at expiry, measured in BTC. Meanwhile, the green line displays the theoretical net return on June 30.Thus, this client needs Bitcoin to trade at $65,600 or higher on June 30 to recoup their investment. This number is significantly lower than the $107,150 required for the break-even if this ""call spread"" strategy buyer holds until the December expiry.This phenomenon is caused by the $100,000 call option price appreciation being larger than the $140,000. While a Bitcoin price increase to $65,600 is quite relevant for a $100,000 option with six months left, it is not so much for the $140,000 one.Countless strategies can be achieved by trading ultra-bullish call options, although the buyer doesn't need to wait for the expiry date to lock in profits. Thus, if Bitcoin happens to increase by 30% in a couple of months, it makes sense for this call spread holder to unwind their position.As shown in the example above, if Bitcoin reaches $75,000 in June, the buyer can lock in a $23,000 net profit by closing the position.While it's exciting to see exchanges offering massive $100,000–$300,000 expiries, these figures should not be taken as precise analysis-backed price estimates.Professional traders use these instruments to conduct bullish but controlled investment strategies.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
589,"Capital flows into cryptocurrency investment products rose again last week, though the pace of growth has slowed since the start of the year, possibly marking a local top in institutional demand. Net inflows totaled $21 million for the week ending March 27, according to CoinShares, a European digital asset manager. That was the lowest level since October 2020 when Bitcoin (BTC) was trading sub-$14,000.Coupled with low investment volumes, investor appetite for crypto assets appears to have waned. The decline coincided with the lackluster price performance of major assets like Bitcoin and Ether (ETH), which have been unable to test new highs in recent weeks. Daily trade volumes for digital asset products fell to $788 million last week, compared with $900 million for the whole of 2021.CoinShares noted that profit-taking was also in play, as investors sitting on large unrealized gains decided to take some off the table.“We have recently witnessed a significant reduction in inflows and in some cases outflows, for the larger and longer established pre-2016 investment products,” the asset manager said, adding:Although Bitcoin investment products generated nearly half of the total weekly inflows, on a market capitalization-adjusted basis, Ether products were the most popular. Inflows into ETH investment funds rose by $5.4 million last week.Total inflows increased for 21Shares and the Purpose exchange-traded fund but declined for CoinShares and virtually flatlined for Grayscale.Despite the modest pullback in inflows, institutional investors remain a driving force behind the cryptocurrency bull market. As CoinShares reported last week, crypto assets held by institutional investment managers have topped $57 billion. And while Bitcoin and Ether continue to trade below all-time highs, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization rose to near-record levels on Monday. The total crypto market cap peaked just north of $1.83 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap."
590,"Bitcoin (BTC) now accounts for less than 60% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, heralding the arrival of ""alt season 2.0.""In a tweet on March 29, analyst Filbfilb, co-founder of trading suite Decentrader, announced that conditions were finally right for a fresh altcoin surge as their total market capitalization is hitting new highs of nearly $750 billion.Highlighting the current BTC/USD spot price, the combined altcoin market cap in U.S. dollars and Bitcoin's market cap dominance, Filbfilb summarized the market in what will be music to the ears of altcoin traders everywhere.""Alt szn,"" he commented, conjuring a common nickname for the phenomenon of altcoins rising when Bitcoin cools or consolidates after a price surge of its own.""Alt season"" has been a full three years in the making. As Cointelegraph reported, expectations of a broad altcoin resurgence have long been high but ultimately left unfulfilled.  Now, however, with Bitcoin consolidating after hitting all-time highs of $61,700, circumstances appear to have played into traders' hands.At the time of writing, Bitcoin's market cap dominance was 59.4%, its lowest since late October 2020.The latest catalyst is arguably Visa, which on Monday announced that it would support stablecoin USD Coin (USDC) for settlement, thus leveraging the Ethereum blockchain. ETH/USD saw a modest 4.8% uptick in response, with the market cap share of Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin, still in decline versus January.Zooming out, the foundations are nonetheless being laid for what Cointelegraph analyst Michaël van de Poppe expects will be a ""very bullish"" summer for altcoins, particularly as the market capitalization has been breaking new highs, nearing $750 billion.""Ethereum is going to surprise everyone massively,"" he wrote about the Visa decision.Previous price forecasts for ETH/USD have included $5,000 and even $10,000 as a mid-term estimate.""Altcoins look great,"" fellow analyst Scott Melker added.For Bitcoin, meanwhile, signs of a bullish comeback remained muted Monday after markets hit the buffers at February's all-time highs of $58,300.Intraday activity was nonetheless strong, with the pair up by over 4% in the past 24 hours.Among market participants, talk thus turned to whether last week's bounce off $50,000 represented a definitive price floor in the ongoing consolidation period.""It could very well be that the BTC bottom is in,"" popular Twitter account Rekt Capital estimated on Monday.As of publication time, BTC/USD circled $58,000, showing resilience in what is the start of its final resistance block before entering uncharted price territory once again."
591,"The ""Kimchi premium"" is back. Bitcoin (BTC) is trading more than 6% higher across major South Korean crypto exchanges as of March 29.Data from CryptoQuant shows that the premium in the South Korean market was nonexistent for many months and, in fact, dropped to around -6% in early February when BTC dipped below $30,000.The so-called Kimchi premium forms when the price of Bitcoin trades higher on South Korean exchanges than other markets.The return of this premium is a bullish sign suggesting that demand for Bitcoin in South Korea is likely outpacing supply.Although South Korea does not account for a majority share of the global Bitcoin market, it remains one of the major exchange markets by daily volume.On CoinMarketCap, as an example, Bithumb is listed as the seventh-largest exchange in the world by daily trading volume, registering $1.3 billion in Bitcoin traded over the past 24 hours. The premium was especially high during past bull cycles, particularly in 2017 when BTC was trading well over 20% higher on South Korean exchanges compared with Coinbase and other large exchanges.The Kimchi premium shows two major trends. First, it shows that the overall market sentiment in South Korea remains healthy. Second, it indicates that more buyers are entering the market.Market sentiment in Korea is not bad. $BTC sellers are not Koreans obviously. https://t.co/4UIneKZKuuThe premium was already rebounding during the past several weeks before Visa announced that it will process transactions using USD Coin (USDC) on the Ethereum blockchain.When the news was announced, both Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) rose by around 5% within three hours, leading to a strong recovery in the cryptocurrency market. The announcement may add more momentum to the rapid pace of institutional adoption so far this year and the possibility of a broader Bitcoin rally. ""I smell crypto mass adoption here,"" Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, reacted to the news. According to the pseudonymous trader known as ""Rekt Capital,"" if Bitcoin breaks above $59,000, a new all-time high becomes highly probable.The trader noted:Fellow trader ""CryptoCapo,"" meanwhile, said that this momentum can potentially take Bitcoin to new highs and above, possibly to even $80,000. He said:"
592,"Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) have hit another milestone in terms of accumulation by exchanges.According to market data provider CryptoQuant, stablecoin holdings on global crypto exchanges soared to a new all-time high on March 28, exceeding $10 billion.Cryptocurrency exchanges are now holding nearly 16% of the total market value of all stablecoins, with stablecoin market capitalization amounting to $63 billion at the time of writing, according to data from CoinGecko. The total trading volume of all stablecoins is estimated at about $88 billion.According to CryptoQuant data, volumes of stablecoin holdings on exchanges have been repeatedly seeing all-time highs this year, surging more than 100% in two months. As previously reported, stablecoin inflows are often seen as a short-term indicator of bullish action for Bitcoin (BTC), suggesting that sidelined capital is moving back into BTC.Coupled with growing stablecoin accumulations, some other metrics like CryptoQuant’s All Exchange Stablecoin Ratio could potentially point toward another upward move in crypto markets. Technical analyst Crypto Seer noted on March 27 that the metric had reached its lowest level since November 2020.“Each time this ratio has gone so low is marked by periods of significant strength for $BTC. The significant reduction in on exchange supply for BTC can be noticed here,” he said. The metric indicates BTC reserves divided by all stablecoin reserves held on exchanges, pointing to potential selling pressure.The latest stablecoin market milestone comes as payment giant Visa is officially piloting its first settlement transaction in USD Coin on the Ethereum blockchain. USD Coin is the second-largest stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, following Tether.“I smell crypto mass adoption here,” CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said about Visa’s move into USDC. Ju told Cointelegraph that the new spike in stablecoin holdings on exchanges could be a result of more United States investors entering the market:According to CryptoQuant, USDC holdings on crypto exchanges now amount to over $2.2 billion, while its market cap is around $11 billion. "
593,"The consolidation of cryptocurrency-related companies surged massively in 2020, hitting a new record in deal activity, according to a new report by professional services network PwC.The total volume of mergers and acquisitions in the crypto industry more than doubled from $481 million in 2019 to $1.1 billion in2020, PwC said in a Monday market overview, as seen by Bloomberg.The average deal size in crypto surged from $19 million in 2019 to nearly $53 million, with crypto fundraising increasing 33% in overall value in 2020. Countries in the EMEA region saw a notable spike in the number of deals, while the Americas recorded a threefold growth in deal value.Following new highs last year, deal activity in the crypto industry is likely to continue growing in 2021. PwC global crypto leader Henri Arslanian said that 2021 is “already on track to significantly surpass it from every single metric” as institutional players and high-profile investors are moving into the industry.Alongside greater consolidation in crypto, PwC also predicted that the industry will become more institutionalized. The survey reportedly cited major gains in the crypto market — with Bitcoin hitting its all-time high of over $61,000 in mid-March — as well as the growing adoption of central bank digital currencies, stablecoins, decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens, also known as NFTs.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, major global cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, FTX and Coinbase made the top three acquisitions in the crypto industry in 2020."
594,"The majority of Bitcoin (BTC) is mined outside of the United States using “dirty energy,” Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has claimed.Suarez discussed the environmental implications of Bitcoin mining in a March 26 episode of the Unconfirmed podcast with cryptocurrency journalist Laura Shin. The mayor said that the U.S. should mine more Bitcoin for to national security reasons.“A part of the problem with Bitcoin is 90% of it is not done in the United States. 90% of it is done in countries that have dirty energy. So that’s the reason why it’s considered to be a dirty activity,” Suarez stated. The official argued that the U.S. would improve this situation by providing its renewable clean energy supply to Bitcoin mining centers and data centers. “We get nuclear power, so we have clean energy. A clean energy supply that’s essentially unlimited,” he said.Miami could set up a Bitcoin mining hub as part of this national security/environmental conservation goal, Suarez said, adding:Suarez is known as a major proponent of the crypto industry in the U.S., backing multiple crypto initiatives in Miami, including proposals allowing Miami residents to pay taxes and receive salaries in Bitcoin.Bitcoin’s energy consumption rate has been growing massively this year amid Bitcoin hitting new historical price levels, renewing arguments over the cryptocurrency’s environmental issues. In mid-March, Bank of America analysts argued that Bitcoin is an environmentally disastrous asset, claiming that the carbon footprint of owning one BTC is equivalent to owning 60 cars.According to data from Digiconomist’s Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, Bitcoin's energy consumption rate hit another historic high on March 28, with anestimated annual consumption reaching 89.9 TWh."
595,"Within the same month, Norwegian billionaire investor Øystein Stray Spetalen has gone from dismissing Bitcoin (BTC) as a ""nonsense currency"" to revealing that he has joined the board of Norway's top domestic crypto exchange MiraiEx.Spetalen's former position was that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin should be ""immediately"" banned by the Norwegian and European authorities due to the destructive effect that mining them has on the environment. In a pre-recorded interview screened at the DNB Invest conference on March 18, he said:Yet by March 26, in an interview with Norwegian newspaper Finansavisen, Spetalen had changed his tune. “When the facts change, I change,” he said, “I met the MiraiEx founders Thuc and Øyvind the day after the podcast was recorded, early in March, and I realized that I had been wrong.”Norwegian cryptocurrency exchange and custodian MiraiEx had just raised 5 million kroner ($580,000) in late 2020 to further expand its operations. Aside from investing in a successful local exchange and joining its board, Spetalen has also apparently now bought Bitcoin, although in a lesser quantity than fellow Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Røkke has. Disclosing his unspecified investment in the top cryptocurrency, Spetalen said:Røkke serves as chairman of the $6 billion industrial holding company Aker ASA, which set up a dedicated unit for investing in projects and companies in the Bitcoin ecosystem in early March of this year. The unit has been initially capitalized with 500 million kroner (~$58.6 million) and plans to keep all its liquid investable assets in Bitcoin.It has also recently been revealed that the $1 trillion Norwegian Government Pension Fund, also known as the Oil Fund and the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, indirectly owns almost 600 Bitcoin through its investment holdings."
596,"Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week in all-too-familiar territory with all-time highs just out of reach.After a positive weekend, the largest cryptocurrency has avoided a deeper price dip than that seen last week, and $50,000 has stuck as support. What next?Cointelegraph takes a look at five factors which may shape Bitcoin price action in the coming days.Monday will form an interesting open for U.S. equities as fears mount over the impact of Friday’s $20 billion worth of block trades.Originating from major players Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the surprise appearance of the orders targeting mostly tech stocks has caused a headache for traders. This will now play out once the market opens on Wall St. on Monday.“Traders everywhere know the story and will be glued to their screens,” portfolio manager Sharif Farha told Bloomberg.Volatility in stocks implies a knock-on effect for Bitcoin, but the ultimate extent of that depends on movements which at the time of writing remain unknown.“The markets could start trading in a friendly manner at the beginning of the week,” Andreas Lipkow, a strategist at German bank Comdirect added.Other macro factors include declining oil prices, though this is nevertheless not as pressing for BTC hawks as stocks. An Opec+ meeting later this week, combined with the potential resolution of the crisis in the Suez Canal, are pushing prices down as expectations of a supply increase rise.For Bitcoin spot markets, at least earlier on Monday, it’s a tale of consolidation.Saturday and Sunday brought some welcome relief for traders who had watched BTC/USD descend to lows, which at one point tapped $50,000 itself.Deeper dives were avoided, however, and liquidity at $46,000 was left untouched in favor of a return to familiar resistance beginning at around $56,000.At the time of writing, that was exactly where Bitcoin was, still unable to tackle what has become a broad sea of sellers all the way up to current all-time highs of $61,700.“Bitcoin scenario is playing out so far, in which the crucial resistance fails to break in one-go. Either way, that's not bad,” Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe summarized on Sunday.This wait-and-see attitude has characterized the mood among analysts following the all-time highs. The consequences of a supply shock in the form of draining exchange reserves and a lack of selling from strong hodlers, they argue, have yet to be felt.April’s price performance will “depend” just as much on retail investors as the institutional crowd, according to on-chain analytics service Glassnode.In its latest research published last week, Glassnode highlighted an unusual disparity between U.S. consumer spending and disposable income generated by coronavirus lockdowns.While normally tightly bound, the onset of lockdowns saw the two measures of retail investor purchasing power diverge — there was more money, thanks to stimulus checks among other factors, but nowhere to spend it.Now, with reopening creeping into multiple states, the balance is primed to be redressed as pent-up consumer demand becomes a major narrative.“Many households now have an extra buffer of income to spend, due to new stimulus checks and decreased spending during lockdowns,” co-founders Yann Allemann Jan Happel tweeted.An accompanying blog post argues that the most recent stimulus checks, worth $1,400, have yet to make their presence felt in the economy.“The recent stimulus package was much larger than the one in January, yet global markets have felt little effects of it in the global markets so far,” Glassnode said.Unconfirmed reports meanwhile suggest that the next round of checks may come sooner than thought.Bitcoin technical indicators remain overwhelmingly bullish on longer timeframes.The latest one to be highlighted is the relative strength index (RSI), which is now entering its “peak” phase which traditionally accompanies price highs.Quant analyst PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow series of Bitcoin price models, showed how RSI fluctuates relative to the point in Bitcoin’s halving cycles — four-yearly periods between reductions in the block subsidies paid to miners.With the year after a halving normally the best in terms of price gains, RSI is indicating that 2021 will be no different to 2013 or 2017.“Bitcoin monthly RSI is not even 95. In 2011, 2013 and 2017 bull markets we had at least 3 months above 95. Still early,” he summarized over the weekend.Stock-to-flow meanwhile demands a $100,000 or $288,000 average BTC/USD price this halving cycle, depending on the exact model used.In terms of investor sentiment, the weekend’s price rise had a welcome muted effect on the chances of an instant sell-off.That’s according to a classic measure of the market, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index.A scale between 0 and 100, Fear & Greed charts how the market is feeling about Bitcoin price action, and infers whether recent activity means that it is due for a bounce off lows or a sell-off from highs.The trip to previous all-time highs of $58,300 in February sparked warning signs from the Index, which circled all-time highs alongside BTC/USD. The comedown saw its score slashed from 94/100 to 38/100 by March 1, only to return to the mid-70s days later.At the time of writing, the Index measures 72/100, classified as “greed” among investors, but still with much room for leeway before entering sell-off territory, denoted as “extreme greed.”"
597,"In trading, selling a position is as important as buying it at the right time. Therefore, the big question that could be troubling traders is whether or not Bitcoin (BTC) price will enter a bearish phase or will the bull run continue after this week's pullback.PlanB, the creator of the popular Bitcoin stock-to-flow model, recently tweeted that the crypto bull run has only started and is “nowhere near the end of it.”PlanB is not the only voice that is hugely bullish on Bitcoin. Mike McGlone, the senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, believes that if previous behavior is considered, Bitcoin’s 2021 peak could be nearer to $400,000.One of the main reasons that could be drawing institutional investors to cryptocurrencies is the possible debasing of the U.S. dollar. In an interview with Bloomberg, Soros Fund Management chief information officer Dawn Fitzpatrick said the 25% increase in the U.S. money supply over the past 12 months has ensured that Bitcoin no longer remains a fringe asset.The fund recently participated in the $200 million funding round held by NYDIG and also invested in crypto accounting firm Lukka. This shows that institutional investors are broadening their perspective and are looking at investing opportunities other than Bitcoin.Let’s study the charts of top-5 cryptocurrencies that may resume their uptrend in the short term.Bitcoin is currently in a corrective phase and trading inside a descending channel. The strong rebound off the 50-day simple moving average ($52,000) on March 26 shows the bulls continue to accumulate at lower levels.The bears may mount stiff resistance near the resistance line of the channel but if the bulls can push the price above it, the BTC/USDT pair could once again challenge the $60,000 to $61,825.84 resistance zone.A breakout of this zone could signal the start of the next leg of the uptrend that has a target objective at $71,112.06. The 20-day exponential moving average ($54,820) has started to turn up and the relative strength index (RSI) is sustaining in the positive zone, suggesting that the bulls are trying to assert their supremacy.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the resistance line of the channel, the bears will try to sink the pair below the 50-day SMA. If they succeed, the pair may drop to the support line and a break below it could start a deeper correction to $43,006.77.The 4-hour chart shows the relief rally is facing stiff resistance near $56,500. If the price turns down from the current level, it could drop to the 20-EMA and then to $54,000.A strong bounce off this support could eventually form an inverse head and shoulders pattern that will complete on a breakout and close above $56,618. This setup has a target objective at $63,339.98.On the contrary, a break below $54,000 will suggest weakness and a lack of buyers at higher levels.Klaytn (KLAY) has been in a strong uptrend since mid-February. The altcoin recently completed a minor correction as the bulls purchased the dip to the 20-day EMA ($2.76) on March 26, suggesting the sentiment remains positive.The bulls are currently attempting to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above the all-time high at $3.50. If they succeed, the KLAY/USD pair could rally to $4.86. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.This view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest a possible change in sentiment. The first support is at $2.58 and a break below this level could start a deeper correction.The 4-hour chart shows the moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI has jumped into the overbought zone, suggesting that bulls have the upper hand. The momentum could pick up further if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the overhead resistance at $3.50.Even if the price turns down from $3.50 but finds support at the 20-EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment remains bullish. A strong rebound off this support will increase the possibility of the resumption of the uptrend.Conversely, a break below the moving averages could pull the price down to the critical support at $2.60.VeChain (VET) is in a strong uptrend. The altcoin bounced off the 20-day EMA ($0.078) on March 25, indicating the sentiment is positive and the bulls view the dips as a buying opportunity.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought territory, suggesting the path to least resistance is to the upside. The long wick on the March 27 candlestick shows the bears are trying to defend the overhead resistance at $0.098.However, the bulls have not allowed the bears to establish their supremacy. If the buyers can drive the price above $0.098, the VET/USDT pair could resume the uptrend. The next target level on the upside is $0.136.This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and breaks the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($0.059).The 4-hour chart shows the bears are defending the $0.095 level while the bulls are buying on dips to the moving averages. If the bulls can thrust the price above $0.095, it will complete an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which has a target objective at $0.114.Conversely, if the bears sink and sustain the price below the moving averages, a drop to $0.076 is possible. A break below this support could signal the start of a deeper correction.Solana (SOL) had formed a bearish descending triangle pattern, which would have completed on a break and close below $11.90. However, that did not happen. The bulls aggressively purchased the dip to the $11.90 support on 26 March and pushed the price above the downtrend line on March 27, invalidating the bearish setup.The failure of a bearish pattern is a bullish sign because it traps several aggressive bears who initiate short positions in anticipation of the completion of the pattern. When the pattern invalidates, the bears rush to cover their positions resulting in a short squeeze.Sustained buying from the bulls has propelled the price to a new all-time high today. If the bulls can sustain the price above $18.20, the SOL/USDT pair may rally to $24.84.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the current level, a drop to the 20-day EMA ($14.60) is possible. A strong rebound off this support will suggest accumulation by the bulls at lower levels and may enhance the prospects of the resumption of the uptrend.The 4-hour chart shows a sharp rally from $12.30 to a high at $19.26. This has pushed the RSI into overbought territory, suggesting the pair could be vulnerable to a pullback in the short term.If the bulls can sustain the price above $18.20, it will suggest the resistance has flipped into support and the uptrend may resume.This bullish view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below the 20-EMA. Such a move could keep the pair range-bound for a few days.Kusama (KSM) is in a strong uptrend. The recent dip to the 20-day EMA ($381) on March 25 was purchased aggressively, as seen from the long tail on the day’s candlestick. This shows strong demand on every minor dip as traders expect the rally to extend further.The KSM/USDT pair rose to a new all-time high on March 27 but the bulls are facing stiff resistance at higher levels as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick. The pair has formed an inside day candlestick pattern today, indicating indecision among traders.If the bulls can push and sustain the price above $505.33, the pair could extend its up-move to $583.The pair has not broken and stayed below the 20-day EMA since Jan. 14. Therefore, traders can watch this level carefully because a break and close below it will suggest that the bullish momentum has weakened.The 4-hour chart shows the bears are aggressively defending the $490 to $505.33 resistance zone as the price has repeatedly turned down from it. However, the positive thing is that the bulls have not given up much ground. A breakout and close above $505.33 could signal the resumption of the uptrend.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the moving averages, it will suggest profit-booking by traders. That could pull the price down to $370 where buyers may again step in.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

598,"Long-time Bitcoin (BTC) HODLers are refraining from selling their holdings, on-chain data from Glassnode shows.According to Glassnode’s ""BTC Percent Supply Last Active 2+ Years"" indicator, Bitcoin that was last moved well over two years ago reached a three-month low to 45.364%.This trend indicates that Bitcoin HODLers who bought around the top of the last bull cycle in 2018 and before are showing deeper conviction as BTC consolidates above $55,000. Interestingly, the spike during December 2020 suggests that many may have sold at a breakeven of around $20,000, or the previous all-time high in late 2017.  Bitcoin typically tops or sees a severe correction when long-time holders begin to sell rapidly.In previous bull cycles, the sell-off from HODLers taking profit on their positions led to swift 50% drops, leading the entire cryptocurrency market to pullback intensely within short periods.This trend coincides with the fact that HODLers are not selling a significant amount of BTC, indicating that the top could still be faraway from being reached.Bitcoin stabilizing at around $55,000 is highly optimistic because of two main reasons. First, BTC has maintained a strong market structure despite some headwinds. Second, BTC consolidating closely under an all-time high is technically a positive sign.In the past two weeks, Bitcoin faced major threats that could have catalyzed a serious short-term downturn.Namely, the U.S. Treasury yields surged. This often causes tech stocks to drop-off, which negatively affects all risk-on markets.Atop this, as CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju explained, miners are holding a lot of Bitcoin that they have not sold in recent months. In fact, the amount of BTC moved by miners was significantly less compared to previous pullbacks this year. This may suggest that miners are likely expecting higher prices down the road.On March 17, Ki also noted three other factors based on on-chain trends that could contribute to a stagnating uptrend for Bitcoin. He wrote at the time:Despite the above-mentioned risks, Bitcoin has performed relatively well, avoiding a drop below $50,000.Well-known pseudonymous traders, including ""Rekt Capital,"" have said that in the next couple days, there could be sufficient confirmation that a Bitcoin bottom could form.It is difficult to predict when the exact bottom would form, but if BTC remains above $55,000 for a few days and prints a ""higher low"" formation, the trader said a new rally could occur. He wrote:Therefore, as long as the price of Bitcoin holds above $55,000 in the near term, the higher low formation would be intact as the market enters April, a historically bullish month that hasn't closed in the red since 2015."
599,"It is not known if Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin (BTC) alone, if they had help from others, or whether they themself are just a pseudonym for a developer collective. However, after the launch of Bitcoin on Jan. 9, 2009, Nakamoto worked to improve the software by receiving feedback and opinions from several collaborators.Among them is Dustin D. Trammell, one of the first cypherpunks to download the official version of Bitcoin and mine the cryptocurrency. Trammell is a computer security research scientist and a specialist in virtual security. In addition to talking to Satoshi and suggesting improvements to Bitcoin, he also received some Bitcoin from the creator themselves.Cointelegraph Brasil talked to Trammell about the early days of Bitcoin, after the virtual currency hit a new valuation record above $61,000. Here’s what the early adopter thinks about the future of cryptocurrency.Cointelegraph: Before Bitcoin, what was the atmosphere and how did you come to learn about BTC?Dustin Trammell: I’m not really sure... My introduction to digital currencies was literally when Satoshi published the Bitcoin white paper to the mailing list. Prior to that, most of my experience with alternative currencies was of the metals-backed physical kind, like the Liberty Dollar.I was mostly following the cryptography mailing list as a casual interest in cryptography from my career in information security, and was mostly focused on things like new algorithms, attacks on and weaknesses in algorithms.I immediately began submitting bugs and asking questions, which led to the emails that I published via my blog. I remember being on the SourceForge list, as I wanted to keep up with development, but I don’t think I ever posted to it. I was subscribed to the Bitcoin-Development and Bitcoin-List lists, although it looks from my email history like I didn’t subscribe until 2013/2014. I don’t recall being in the IRC channel or the original forum. I joined BitcoinTalk after it was created.CT: How was mining at that time? Was it something of a “study” or did you already think that Bitcoin could be a currency as it is today?DT: Mining was incredibly easy, although I did not realize for the first few days that you had to go into the settings and specifically turn mining on. Once I did that, I was off to the races… So, there were a few days at the very beginning when I was running the software but not mining yet. Back then, you could easily mine with commodity CPUs and you could generate a block of 50 anywhere from a few times a day to one every few days, depending on your processing power.I used to run other ""spare processing power"" programs on my computers like SETI@home, so I thought I could spare some computers to mine Bitcoin and participate in the network with my spare processing power.Back then, I mostly sent Bitcoin to myself, consolidating coins into a single wallet from the various computers that I was mining on. I don’t recall sending any to anyone else until years later, when they were finally worth more than $0. Satoshi only sent me coins once using my IP address.Coins were always sent by Bitcoin address on the blockchain, but to send by IP, the client would connect to that IP and then request a Bitcoin address from it to send to, and then send to that address on-chain. Satoshi’s client connected directly to mine in this way, and my client just gave it the next available address from its address pool.I actually stopped mining at some point and forgot about Bitcoin for a year or two, and was blissfully ignorant of what was happening with the project. During that time, the value appreciated from $0 to around $9. I started paying attention again when the news story about Bitcoin being used on the Silk Road came out. This is probably when I joined the other email lists.CT: Do you think Satoshi had already worked on creating an e-cash before Bitcoin?DT: Not sure, but probably not. It seems that they had pulled together many different technologies and concepts to create Bitcoin. I’m not sure you could have that kind of clarity and lack of bias if you had specifically been working on digital currencies prior. I think you might have needed an outside perspective.In hindsight, Satoshi didn’t seem to be trying to solve a technical problem, but rather a social problem. A systemic problem with the legacy financial system. At the time though, they were very focused on the technology, so some of the philosophical points may have been overlooked or downplayed by those not paying close enough attention.CT: Do you think Bitcoin has found the “formula” to achieve its value, or has it just become an investment asset that will be accumulated by the same “bankers” and governments that the cypherpunks once fought?DT: Yes, today I truly believe that Bitcoin has the potential to become the world’s next global reserve asset. It has already conquered the internet; altcoins on exchanges are almost universally traded against Bitcoin in ALT/BTC pairs.It has the rock-solid monetary policy and proven network effect to continue driving its value to the moon against other non-scarce assets. The new financial system that is being built on top of Bitcoin is going to completely outperform the legacy systems, that there’s literally no choice but for Bitcoin to supplant them. This is Finance 2.0.They’ll have to buy from existing holders, and most of us have no intention of selling to them. That will drive the price in fiat currencies parabolic. The first central bank to print fiat to buy Bitcoin wins.CT: Did you imagine that one day there would be this whole industry around Bitcoin?DT: Yes, I saw the potential for Bitcoin to become very big, and there was some discussion at the time around scaling and what layer-two solutions might look like, but this has grown far beyond my early expectations.I wish I still had most of the Bitcoin I mined. I had a lot. I gave a lot of it away to promote Bitcoin. I bought a lot of Casascius coins and Bitbills, and gave them out at hacker and computer security conventions, renaissance fairs, parties, left them as tips at restaurants, etc. I gave it literally to anyone that would take Bitcoin.I also bought a lot of things with Bitcoin, from real estate and a car to Bitcoin miners to random electronics. I own one of the Bitcoin nerd merit badges that cost me... 1 BTC. They would still cost 1 BTC if they weren’t sold out.I hold a little ETH because I occasionally like to do things on the Ethereum network, such as play Decentraland, and following and participating in this whole NFT/crypto art movement is somewhat interesting. But I don’t hold it as an investment, or as money, because it has no stable, predictable monetary policy. I only hold enough of it to accomplish what I want to do on the network.I think “DeFi” [decentralized finance] has a long way to go to work out the bugs and security issues with digital ledger contract systems. For now, I’ll stick to the original decentralized-finance project, Bitcoin.CT: What about Satoshi — do you think they still have access to Bitcoin and continue to work on cryptocurrency development, or did they really abandon everything?DT: I have no idea. My best guess is that Satoshi burned those keys early on to prevent themselves from being tempted to reveal themselves later, or lost them... Or Satoshi is dead. There are multiple plausible Satoshi candidates that are now no longer with us. Satoshi certainly isn’t Craig Wright though.CT: Looking at what Bitcoin was in 2009 and what it is today, what is the future of the main cryptocurrency in the market?DT: I believe it will continue to grow and evolve, from the speculative asset and store of value that it has now become, to later the global reserve asset, to a unit of account, and finally to actual currency.We’re getting there with the floodgates of institutional money opening up and layer-two solutions like Bitcoin Lightning and Liquid coming online, but it’ll still take a while. That said, it’ll probably happen sooner than we expect. “Gradually, then suddenly…”"
600,"It is estimated that Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of BTC, will become the world's richest person if the price of Bitcoin (BTC) hits approximately $182,000.As of March 2021, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is the richest person on earth with a net worth of $181.6 billion.Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is a close second at $163.7 billion, owning more than 20% of the electric car maker.Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, released the Bitcoin whitepaper in October 2008 under a public MIT license.On Jan. 3, 2009, Bitcoin's first block, known as the ""genesis block,"" was mined. This marked the launch of the Bitcoin network, which kickstarted the cryptocurrency and blockchain movement. Albeit the exact figures remain unclear, from January to July 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto is estimated to have mined over 1 million BTC. This means that at current Bitcoin prices, it is estimated that Satoshi Nakamoto is worth roughly $54 billion.In other words, if the price of Bitcoin hits $182,000, this would put Nakamoto's net worth at around $182 billion, which is higher than the current net worth of Bezos.In 2010, Sergio Demian Lerner, a prominent cryptocurrency researcher, published a research paper estimating the BTC holdings of Satoshi Nakamoto. By analyzing the early blocks that Satoshi mined, Lerner estimated that 1 million BTC is likely owned by Satoshi. He wrote:While there are many price models that predict the price of Bitcoin to reach anywhere between $200,000 to $1 million, the most well-known model is the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model.The S2F model forecasts the price of Bitcoin to hit $100,000 to a ""conservative"" $288,000 by the end of 2021, using a formula based on the relationship between the value of Bitcoin versus the existing supply (stock) and the amount of newly mined BTC entering the market (flow).In November 2020, PlanB, the creator of the S2F model, said:If Bitcoin rises to as high as $288,000 as per the S2F model, Satoshi's fortune would be worth around $288 billion, which should put the creator far out in front of Bezos and Musk. Meanwhile, some other Bitcoin price predictions have been even higher for the current bull cycle. For instance, Bloomberg predicted that BTC could reach as high as $400,000 if it becomes a ""risk-off"" reserve asset.However, the identity of Satoshi remains a mystery and it isn't known whether the person(s) is even alive today. Industry experts have suggested the likes of Hal Finney, Adam Back, and Paul Le Roux as potential candidates, as well as others presuming that it could have been a group of individuals. "
601,"Bitcoin’s price seems to have stalled below $60,000 after attaining new all-time highs earlier in March. PlanB, a crypto analyst active on Twitter, thinks Bitcoin (BTC) may still have a lot of room to gallup however. “IMO we are only ~4 months into the bull market and nowhere near the end of it,” PlanB tweeted on Friday. “Bitcoin is just getting started,” he added, showing Bitcoin’s current path on one of his Stock-to-Flow charts. Multiple Stock-to-Flow models exist for Bitcoin which show Bitcoin’s price path in line with its halving events and supply over time.YouTuber and derivatives trader Tone Vays also carries a bullish macro view, although he thinks a dip lower for Bitcoin is not out of the question.“Bitcoin is consolidating but I remain bullish in this market,” Vays told Cointelegraph. “While it is still possible for bitcoin to make a lower low for the month in the $48k range, I believe we will go up to above $70k before June,” he added.After trading past $61,000 this month, Bitcoin retraced down near $50,000. For the most part, the drop occurred over roughly two weeks, with some relief bounces mixed in, rather than in a straight, single-day $10,000 shot downward. Based on TradingView data, BTC holds a price of $54,550 at time of publication, looking back on a day of overall upward price action.Meanwhile, other crypto assets continue to make headlines in the price category as well."
602,"New opportunities arise during each Bitcoin bull run. The current ebullience has been driven by an influx of institutional investors, along with major payment providers like PayPal and Mastercard. Why are they here to begin with? Crypto media companies have been taking advantage of the vast, outspoken audience that's been developed by a few organizations on the frontline, educating millions of early adopters on the trillion-dollar crypto market.Joon Ian Wong, co-president of the Association of Cryptocurrency Journalists and Researchers — a nonprofit organization that advocates for quality journalism and research on cryptocurrencies and blockchains — told Cointelegraph that bull runs build new audiences:He further noted that existing crypto media outlets have doubled down and grown, as each bull run creates a stronger, more robust ecosystem. According to independent analytics, Cointelegraph's audience alone has more than doubled to over 20 million views per month since the end of 2020.A number of new crypto media outlets have been created during the 2020–2021 Bitcoin (BTC) bull run. Blockworks — the financial media brand behind the successful The Pomp Podcast — recently launched a crypto-focused news site to help professional investors understand Bitcoin and digital currencies.Jason Yanowitz, co-founder of Blockworks, told Cointelegraph that in March 2020, the company’s month-over-month revenue dropped 80%. Yanowitz noted that this was a “frightening time” for the Brooklyn-based firm, which was launched in 2018:Yanowitz explained that he and his team worked on these problems daily from April to December 2020, building out the new Blockworks website. “Bitcoin has become more relevant than ever. It's time we had a media site that ties Bitcoin and crypto into the global macro conversation — that's Blockworks,” he remarked.In contrast to Blockworks, Ran Neuner, host of CNBC’s Crypto Trader show, told Cointelegraph that he recently launched the world’s first livestreaming crypto station — a platform clearly oriented more to the growing retail and semi-pro audience. According to Neuner, a livestreaming crypto information platform hadn’t existed until now. He found this to be problematic, stating:As a result, Neuner launched Crypto Banter on YouTube, which he describes as a “combination of Bloomberg and CNBC” — a credible yet fun source for crypto information. In addition, Neuner mentioned there is a Friday show called “Big Banter,” which allows listeners to call in and chat directly with Neuner and his guests. “This is the future of media and certainly the future of crypto media,” he remarked.Neuner made an important point regarding interactivity. Deloitte's 2021 media and entertainment industry outlook report notes that streaming platforms today should focus on customers’ needs first. “To improve retention, they should address customers’ challenges and preferences through content windowing, tiered pricing, tailored services, and social experiences.”“Social experiences” resonated with Neuner. He explained that he previously tried a CNBC show on YouTube, but the audience did not respond well to a television show on a non-TV platform. “Our audience wants short, hard hitting, interactive content where they can comment and discuss topics with us on the show.”He further suggested that in launching “CoinDesk TV,” the venerable brand made a mistake by trying to develop a serious television feel for a crypto audience. CoinDesk TV, which is rumored to have cost the company over $5 million to launch, incorporates “TV-inspired programming, with 24 straight hours of live streamed shows, with guests and hosts in locales ranging from New York to South Korea, to the U.K. and Spain” according to a recent article.While it’s hard to predict the success of a newly launched platform, Neuner noted that the crypto target market is different. “They don’t respond well to untelevised mediums. Our approach is much more informal and fun, yet credible and curated.”In addition to new publications and platforms, established crypto media publications have taken new measures to prepare for future growth.Crypto Briefing, a news and research publication formed during the 2017–2018 bull run, which also spawned Decrypt and The Block, recently appointed Mitchell Moos, the former editor-in-chief, as the company’s chief executive officer. Moos told Cointelegraph that this transition is similar to Cointelegraph’s decision to appoint former editor-in-chief Jay Cassano to CEO. “We're following the lead of Cointelegraph on this one. Jay Cassano started out in the newsroom and now he's heading up the publication.”According to Moos, distrust toward media companies appears to be at an all-time high. A recent yearlong study from Pew Research Center reaffirms this, showing that 75% of U.S. adults say it’s possible to improve the level of confidence Americans have in news media. Moos explained:Moos further noted that Crypto Briefing was planning to make this transition, regardless of the current Bitcoin bull market. “At a certain point, the founder is not necessarily the best person to take a business from its startup phase to maturity,” he remarked.While Crypto Briefing restructured, other publications introduced new features to further engage with readers. For example, Decrypt recently launched its own token for readers. According to a Decrypt article, the concept behind Decrypt Token (DCPT) is simple: “You earn DCPT for reading Decrypt articles, sharing them with a friend, and reacting to them, all inside our mobile app. Soon, readers who've amassed enough tokens can redeem them for digital rewards.”As Decrypt has taken a rewards-for-engagement approach, Cointelegraph has moved toward an additional revenue stream with Cointelegraph Markets Pro, a platform designed in conjunction with The TIE — a leading quantitative and social data firm — to bring professional crypto market intelligence to every investor. During the first month, over 1,400 subscribers signed up on the platform to enhance their market research.It’s also notable that one of the world’s most referenced price-tracking sites for crypto, CoinMarketCap — which was launched in 2013 — now includes a full-fledged content platform. Known as “Alexandria,” this outlet was created in the fall of 2020, right before the current bull run began.Molly Jane Zuckerman, content manager for CoinMarketCap, told Cointelegraph that Alexandria’s target audience is newcomers to the crypto space:Zuckerman explained that Alexandria was created to retain and keep beginners interested in cryptocurrencies, beyond just the prices. “Our Bitcoin price page has a huge amount of information, but we wanted to add that extra layer — knowing Bitcoin’s price is cool, but it’s infinitely cooler if you also know who Satoshi Nakamoto is,” she remarked.Although new crypto media platforms have formed and growth for established publications is underway, a number of challenges exist.Wong explained that crypto media faces the same challenges as any vertical, with one exception: It’s more difficult to maintain independence and editorial integrity. Wong stated:Editor-in-chief of Cointelegraph Jon Rice disagrees with Wong's assessment. ""The narrative that crypto media journalists are greedy, self-serving shills is lazy and antiquated, and it's really only advanced by people outside the industry."" “The opacity of the sector is more a function of its complexity, particularly for mainstream journalists who don't spend their lives ingesting the intricacies of DeFi and NFTs, and who instead are forced to write in generalizations about innovations they — quite understandably — don't entirely comprehend,” continued Rice. “As Arthur C. Clarke noted, ‘Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,’ and as a species, we're generally skeptical of wizardry and witchcraft.”For sites like CoinMarketCap, which are known for price-tracking, the challenge has been getting readers to move from the site’s homepage to Alexandria. “One of our biggest problems is actually how powerful CoinMarketCap is — nobody wants to get off our homepage,” Zuckerman remarked.Zuckerman explained that the site is experimenting with different distribution strategies to make sure the content is seen and getting traction. One of the strategies to ensure that this is getting prominent people in the crypto space to author works for Alexandria. “It’s a cliche, but the crypto space moves so quickly that we have to be on our toes to make sure we have the educational content to cover everything as it happens, and working with authors that are the ones making it happen is a good way to do so.”Finally, a major concern facing every media outlet is retaining customers. This can especially be challenging for new, livestreaming platforms, like Neuner’s Crypto Banter. Neuner, however, explained that the show hasn’t had a problem retaining customers, claiming that he's seen 30% to 50% growth per month in terms of subscribers. “If you have the right format and a product that doesn't exist yet, then the audience will come.""Despite these challenges, Wong believes that the future of cryptocurrency-focused publications looks bright. “There are very few verticals in media today that are as lucrative, with such high potential, as crypto media,” said Wong.Quotes in this article taken from previously published sources have been lightly edited."
603,"Glassnode data shows Bitcoin (BTC) exchange reserves on Coinbase have dropped by about $8 billion. This indicates that institutional investors are locking away their purchases in cold storage for the long term instead of booking profits. HODLing by institutions is a huge positive as it will continue to reduce Bitcoin's available supply, which may boost prices even if demand begins to diminish.The news flow suggests no slowdown in institutional adoption. New Zealand Wealth Funds Management revealed that its product KiwiSaver Growth Strategy allocated 5% of its assets to Bitcoin in October 2020.According to the firm’s chief investment officer James Grigor, the first Bitcoin purchase took place when Bitcoin was at $10,000. This means that when Bitcoin hit an all-time high at $61,825.44, the firm was sitting on a 518% profit. Grigor also added that Bitcoin could feature in more KiwiSaver schemes within the next five years. In a recent podcast with Raoul Pal, New York Digital Investment Group CEO Robert Gutmann said the firm has been receiving inquiries from sovereign wealth funds about possible Bitcoin investments. Pal disclosed that Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Temasek had been buying virgin Bitcoin from miners.More investors may arrive if the United States Securities and Exchange Commission approves a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. The latest to seek approval to launch a Bitcoin ETF is Fidelity Investments. This shows that legacy financial firms are aggressively adding support to Bitcoin.The arrival of all kinds of investors into the crypto space is a positive sign. While that may be bullish for the long term, let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the short-term trend.The bulls had pushed Bitcoin above the 20-day exponential moving average ($54,426) on March 24, but they could not sustain the higher levels, as seen from the long wick and the negative close on the daily candlestick.The BTC/USD pair dipped to the 50-day simple moving average ($51,282) on March 25, which is an important support to watch out for because the bears have not achieved a close below it since Oct. 9 of last year.If the bulls can sustain the current rebound and push the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may rise to the downtrend line. The bears are likely to mount a stiff hurdle at this level.If the price turns down from the downtrend line, the bears will make another attempt to sink the pair below the 50-day SMA. If that happens, the pair may witness increased selling pressure from short-term traders, resulting in a drop to $46,000 and then $43,006.77.Alternatively, if the bulls can drive the price above the downtrend line, the pair may rise to the all-time high at $61,825.84. A breakout of this resistance will suggest the resumption of the next leg of the uptrend.Ether (ETH) has been trading below the moving averages for the past three days, signaling weakness. The bulls are attempting a relief rally today but the pullback may face selling by the bears at the 20-day EMA ($1,711).If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will try to sink the ETH/USD pair to $1,500 and then $1,289. The marginally downsloping 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) just below the midpoint suggest a minor advantage to the bears.However, if the bulls can push the price above the moving averages, the pair may rally to the downtrend line. A breakout of this line will open the doors for a retest of the all-time high at $2,040.77. If the price turns down from the downtrend line, the pair may form a symmetrical triangle.Binance Coin (BNB) slipped below the 20-day EMA ($251) on March 24 and bears continued their selling on March 25, but they could not break the 50-day SMA ($216) support. This attracted buying from the bulls who are currently trying to push the price back above the 20-day EMA.The flat moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. If the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair could rise to $309.50.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the downtrend line, the bears will once again try to break the 50-day SMA support. If they succeed, the pair may drop to the critical support at $189.Cardano (ADA) repeatedly turned down from the 20-day EMA ($1.14) for the past three days, but the bears could not break the $1.03 support. This suggests accumulation by the bulls at lower levels.The bulls have pushed the price above the 20-day EMA today. If they can sustain the higher levels, the ADA/USD pair may gradually move up to $1.48. The bears are again likely to pose a stiff challenge at this resistance.The 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is just above the midpoint suggesting a possible range-bound action for a few days. This neutral view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below $1.03. That could signal the start of a deeper correction to $0.80.Polkadot (DOT) broke below the symmetrical triangle and the 50-day SMA ($32.55) on March 24, indicating the bears have overpowered the bulls. Usually, after the price breaks below an important level, it tends to retest the level. In this case, the price may rise to the breakdown point, which is close to the 20-day EMA ($34.26).If the price turns down from this resistance, it will suggest the sentiment has turned negative and traders are selling on rallies. The bears will then try to sink the price below $26.50. If they can pull it off, the DOT/USD pair could extend its decline to the pattern target at $18.22.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest strong buying at lower levels and a possible consolidation for a few days.XRP dropped below the $0.50 support and the moving averages on March 24. However, the positive thing was that the lower levels attracted strong buying from traders and the price snapped back above the $0.50 level on March 25.The RSI bounced off the midpoint and the moving averages are sloping up, indicating the sentiment has turned positive and traders view dips as a buying opportunity. If the bulls can drive the price above $0.60, the XRP/USD pair may rally to $0.65 and then $0.78.On the contrary, if the price again turns down from $0.60, it will indicate a lack of demand at higher levels. That could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days.Uniswap (UNI) plunged below the support of the $27.97 to $35.20 range on March 24. However, the bears could not sink the price below the 50-day SMA ($26.38), which shows the bulls are defending this level.The UNI/USD pair has bounced off the 50-day SMA and the bulls will now try to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($29.62). If they succeed, the price may once again rise to the $35.20 to $36.80 overhead resistance zone.On the other hand, if the pair turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will once again try to sink the price below the 50-day SMA. If that happens, the pair may drop to $20.74. The 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a minor advantage to the bears.THETA is currently consolidating in a strong uptrend. The bulls purchased the dip to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $10.31 on March 25. This shows the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying the dips.If bulls can thrust the price above the $13 to $14.96 zone, the THETA/USD pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $19. The rising moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.Conversely, if the bears successfully defend the overhead resistance zone, the pair may remain range-bound between $10.31 and $14.96 for a few days. A break below $10.31 could extend the decline to the 20-day EMA ($8.74).Litecoin (LTC) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($191) on March 24 and broke below the trendline of the symmetrical triangle. This is a negative sign as it suggests that the triangle is acting as a reversal pattern.The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative zone suggest the bears have the upper hand. If the price again turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will try to extend the correction to $152.94 and then to $120.However, the bulls are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to push the price back above the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, it will show aggressive buying at lower levels and may keep the LTC/USD pair inside the triangle for a few more days.Chainlink (LINK) plummeted below the minor support at $26.28 on March 24 and reached the important support at $24. Although the bulls have held this support for the past two days, the rebound lacks strength, indicating a lack of confidence among buyers that the correction may be over.The 20-day EMA ($27.97) has started to turn down and the RSI has dipped into the negative territory, suggesting that bears have the upper hand. A break below $24 could intensify selling that may drag the LINK/USD pair to $20.11.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest strong buying at lower levels and could keep the pair range-bound between $24 and $32 for a few days.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

605,"Bitcoin (BTC) still gets criticized for being too volatile, but one Bloomberg analyst believes that it conversely is becoming a ""risk-off"" choice for investors.In a tweet on March 25, Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, said that this year marked a watershed moment for the largest cryptocurrency.McGlone uploaded a chart of the BTC/USD average price and the Bitcoin Liquid Index, a price ticker specially created for institutional use.""Well on its way to becoming a global digital reserve asset, a maturation leap in 2021 may be transitioning Bitcoin toward a risk-off asset, in our view,"" he wrote.A potential price peak this year, with previous behavior as context, could be as much as $400,000 per coin, the chart shows. This dwarfs other estimates, such as that of stock-to-flow, which calls for an average of $288,000 between now and 2024.While McGlone did not provide exact details of the factors behind Bloomberg's view, the idea of Bitcoin reducing, rather than increasing portfolio risk is the talking point of the year among corporates. New reports of treasury allocations to BTC appear frequently, with appetite unfazed by price action.""My mission right now is to fix the balance sheets of the world,"" Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, one of the largest Bitcoin treasury investors, said in an interview with TIME this week.Saylor kickstarted a trend among public companies last summer, which has seen over $52 billion converted to BTC on a cost basis, now worth over $73 billion, according to monitoring resource Bitcoin Treasuries.Ahead of Morgan Stanley becoming the first major bank to open up access to Bitcoin funds for high net worth investors next week, however, naysayers continue to peddle familiar arguments against exposure.""Morgan Stanley limiting crypto access to 2.5% of high net worth individual accounts, that have over $2 million in assets and have been active for over six months, shows that the bank realizes Bitcoin is very risky and wants to limit legal liability from investors who lose money,"" gold bug Peter Schiff recently claimed.Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell likened Bitcoin to a ""substitute"" for gold, to Schiff's displeasure, but added that it did not pose a risk to the dollar or to financial stability.As Cointelegraph reported, average returns for BTC/USD have topped 200% every year since the cryptocurrency's inception."
606,"Brian Brooks, former acting comptroller of the currency of the United States Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, has claimed that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) have some backing, while the U.S. dollar may not have any.Brooks gave his remarks in a CNBC Squawk Box interview with Joseph Kernen to unpack recent Bitcoin-related remarks by the U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. Earlier this week, Powell argued that cryptos like Bitcoin are “essentially a substitute for gold” but at the same time they are “not backed by anything.”CNBC host Kernen pointed out that gold has historically been seen as a store of value, expressing confusion over Powell’s comments, stating. “He just said it’s like gold but not a store of value. Does he not think that gold is a store of value?”In response, Brooks said that there are many reasons why people have flocked to Bitcoin over the past year, including the Fed dramatically increasing the dollar supply. “So when you do that, it means that the dollar is at least a 40% less good store of value than it was a year ago. And that is one of the reasons people opt to Bitcoin,” he stated.In reference to the United States abandoning the gold standard under President Richard Nixon in 1971, Brooks said:“The point I really wanna make is the dollar may not actually be backed by anything [...] But cryptocurrencies actually are backed by something. They’re backed by underlying networks, and what you’re buying when you buy a crypto token — whatever it is Bitcoin or anything else — you’re buying a piece of a financial network built to transact all kinds of stuff.” Brooks stated that the increasing number of network applications over the past few years is the main reason that the crypto industry is worth almost a $2 trillion today. “I believe in the wisdom of crowds. I think that crowds are telling you that these networks are where finances are going in the future. I wanna be part of that,” he concluded.U.S. authorities have been actively investigating the concept of a digital dollar. On Monday, Powell said that the Fed would not proceed with the digital dollar without support from Congress."
607,"The Coinbase direct stock listing could be a rite of passage for the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry, and the announcement on March 20 by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission of a $6.5-million fine against Coinbase for “wash trading” and filing misleading information probably won’t do more than postpone by a few weeks the distinction of being the first crypto-native corporation to be listed on a major U.S. stock exchange.But questions surround Coinbase’s upcoming debut on the Nasdaq exchange: Is the crypto exchange really worth the $100 billion — as suggested by a pre-IPO public auction? Is its timing propitious? Are the firm’s revenues too dependent on the market price of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH)? And are its profit margins really sustainable — is this really an industry breakthrough event, and if so, which crypto enterprise might be next to test Wall Street’s waters?But first, what is one to make of charges of improper reporting of exchange volume and “self-trading” that were settled with the CFTC? Could they scuttle the listing?“The CFTC announcement should not really derail investor interest with the Coinbase direct listing,” Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at forex trading company Oanda, told Cointelegraph, mainly because “mainstream acceptance has arrived for cryptocurrencies.” Any fines will have only a short-term effect in his view. Indeed, they might even, in a way, reassure potential investors, providing further confirmation that the space is regulated, Moya told Cointelegraph.Kavita Gupta, founding managing partner at Delta Growth Fund LP & Fintech.TV and visiting scholar and lecturer at Stanford University, appeared to agree. “As an investor, I would read it as a positive sign that Coinbase is clearing up any possible issues before going public and would play fair to regulatory bodies and the public investors,” she told Cointelegraph.On the other hand, the fine could impede the listing process, suggested David Trainer, CEO of investment research firm New Constructs, though the fine is relatively small, suggesting that the illegal activity may be seen as relatively inconsequential — “so it might not pose much of an issue in the grander scheme.” That said, “an issue with trading integrity for an exchange is serious — no matter how big or small,” he commented to Cointelegraph.“The fine is just a slap on the wrist for Coinbase,” declared Bobby Ong, co-founder and chief operating officer of crypto data aggregator CoinGecko, told Cointelegraph, adding: “It was cited as a risk factor in the Coinbase S-1 filing, and this settlement removes one risk factor.”Back in December, Moya told Cointelegraph that Coinbase’s initial public offering was “perfectly timed” given Bitcoin’s growing investment appeal. Has anything changed?Not really. “Institutional and retail interest is still in the early stages of mainstream acceptance, and this is the peak time for a bullish perspective with cryptocurrencies,” answered Moya, adding further: “Eventually, over the next few years, governments will clamp down on Bitcoin and push their respective digital coins, and that could lead to concerns that the Bitcoin party is over. [...] The pressure is on for Coinbase to go public.”“It’s a great time for Coinbase to test waters,” commented Gupta. IPOs and the special purpose acquisition company IPO markets are still sizzling; cryptocurrencies have soared in recent months; there’s enormous liquidity; “and demand in the market for tech companies creates the best time for Coinbase to ring the bell.”But, how much would Coinbase be worth as a publicly owned company? As noted, one pre-IPO valuation put the company as high as $100 billion — is that realistic?Vladimir Vishnevskiy, director and co-founder of Swiss wealth management firm St. Gotthard Fund Management AG, told Cointelegraph that the $100-billion valuation could be justified given the potential of the digital asset sector and “the impact it could potentially have on our lives in the future.” Moreover:Moya, too, was optimistic, though not quite ready to swallow $100 billion. “Coinbase’s market value will probably settle around the $80 billion–$90 billion range, but that could easily change with whatever is the next 20% move for Bitcoin.”Trainer, by comparison, was skeptical. “A more realistic valuation is probably closer to a 10%–25% of the current valuation,” Trainer told Cointelegraph. “Others have gone so far astray because they lack a reliable fundamental perspective to give them a sense of value according to the underlying economics of the business and its long-term competitive position.”Along these lines, New Constructs analyst Kyle Guske wrote recently regarding the $100-million tag that “the expected valuation implies the company will become the largest exchange in the world by revenue” — something that’s unlikely, given the rising competition in the cryptocurrency exchange sector and the non-sustainability of Coinbase’s current market share and revenue margins, in his view.Coinbase’s current ratio of transaction revenue to volume is 0.57%, for example, 57 times higher than margins at Nasdaq and Intercontinental Exchange — both with ratios of 0.01%. Guske wrote:Coinbase’s offering would be the Nasdaq’s first direct stock listing, where a company sells shares directly to the public, without using investment banks as intermediaries as with traditional IPOs. Investors would be able to sell their Coinbase’s shares immediately after purchase, too, without the usual lockup period. Some have suggested that a direct listing was also consistent with the crypto ethos of cutting out the intermediary.Vishnevskiy called the direct approach a “smart move,” adding that it could be popular with retail investors, particularly in light of the GameStop saga. He agreed, too, that it is in line with the anti-establishment sentiment often expressed within the cryptoverse, saying:“Direct listings are the much fairer way to distribute shares,” commented Trainer, while Moya, for his part, said Coinbase had no choice but to opt for a direct listing because a traditional IPO would have delayed going public until closer to the end of the year. He added: “The retail interest for Coinbase’s direct listing will be very strong, and yes, sticking it to the middleman provides some traders with a bit of added satisfaction.”Will a successful Coinbase offering spur other blockchain and cryptocurrency companies to go public? “After the Coinbase IPO, there will be a rush of other crypto companies looking to go public either via IPO or SPAC to tap on the frothy valuation offered by the public markets,” said Ong.Vishnevskiy, too, expected others in the industry to follow with IPOs, though they could find Coinbase’s offering “a difficult one to emulate,” adding: “There are just not many other companies in the industry yet with the same pedigree and history as Coinbase, which is exactly why so many investors want to be part of it.”Who might be next? “I could certainly see Kraken being a contender for a listing this year, however, whether they could command a similar multiple in terms of valuation will be a big question,” said Vishnevskiy, while Moya answered:Are there other possible obstacles to a successful Coinbase debut as a public company? Vishnevskiy expected the Coinbase listing to be over-subscribed. “The number of shares being offered is not that significant, and I expect high demand from both institutional and retail investors.” The only potential roadblock ahead, he said, would be a decline in general market conditions: “Markets over the past month have been choppy, and if the mood does turn sour in April, it could dampen risk appetite slightly.” Ong added: “It is always risky in the weeks leading up to an IPO,” but he didn’t see any significant roadblocks leading up to Coinbase’s listing.Still, the crypto exchange has been dogged by service outages periodically through its history, a complaint that was raised again this week in a New York Times article: “The company sometimes still struggles to address basic customer service complaints,” said the paper, and quoted attorney David Silver that if Coinbase wants to be “the Goldman Sachs of crypto,” then it “needs to maintain quality customer support.”Meanwhile, Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com trading, noted in a client letter at the time of Coinbase’s S-1 SEC filing that the firm’s earnings are inextricably tied to crypto prices. Indeed, most of Coinbase’s net revenue is from transactions in just two crypto assets: Bitcoin and Ether — and the volatility of those cryptocurrencies could make Coinbase’s earnings soar or plummet accordingly.Indeed, the company itself acknowledged in its filing: “If demand for these crypto assets declines and is not replaced by new demand for crypto assets, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.”Gupta, too, acknowledged that Coinbase had exposure to crypto, and “crypto price volatility impacts their business” in terms of revenues, liquidity and other areas, but she viewed this as another positive connected to the direct listing, as it might guide other crypto-native firms looking to follow in the exchange’s footsteps:Overall, should this still be viewed as a significant event for the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry — one that could spur more crypto adoption and/or blockchain technology innovation?The Coinbase Nasdaq listing “will be a watershed moment for the entire blockchain and cryptocurrency industry,” said Ong. It has already shown Wall Street how large the crypto industry is, “and they have certainly woken up to the potential opportunities in this industry.”Any offering of Coinbase’s projected size will “inevitably motivate more people and firms to try and get a piece of the action,” said Trainer, and “can only help to propel the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry further.”Speaking as an investor — indeed, one playing now in the SPAC IPO market — Gupta stated that “Coinbase will be the torchbearer for the whole blockchain community in the public market,” adding: “If you look at [crypto] exchanges across the world from Israel to India to Singapore, every exchange pitch is [based on the claim] that ‘it is the Coinbase’ of its region.”According to Gupta: “Companies like CoinShares have already tested the water in more friendly European market exchanges,” while in the U.S., mining firm Bitfury’s SPAC IPOs have been oversubscribed. Events like these signal “great timing for Coinbase,” whose technology and revenue exceed many other IPO candidates in the United States.Overall, a Coinbase Nasdaq listing would “put cryptos at the heart of Wall Street,” Wilson told Cointelegraph. Blockchain and cryptocurrency firms would no longer be outsiders looking in — rather, they would now be “part of the club.”"
608,"Soros Fund Management chief information officer Dawn Fitzpatrick said Bitcoin (BTC) may once have been considered a fringe asset, but the inflation of the United States dollar has changed that.Speaking to Bloomberg, Fitzpatrick said her firm — an asset management fund created by global investor George Soros — had recently begun to take an interest in Bitcoin.“We think the whole infrastructure around crypto is really interesting, and we’ve been making some investments into that infrastructure — and we think that is at an inflection point,” said Fitzpatrick.That inflection point is coming as a result of fiat inflation, which has seen the U.S. dollar money supply increase by 25% in the past year alone. Fitzpatrick said:Soros Fund made two investments in crypto-focused projects this month alone. The first was as part of a $200 million funding round held by NYDIG, while the second was an investment in crypto accounting firm, Lukka, which raised $53 million on March 25.The fund’s faith in Bitcoin and its related technologies appears to be equally matched by its distaste for more fiat inflation, of which Fitzpatrick says there is a real fear:Fitzpatrick briefly mentioned central bank digital currencies, particularly in relation to China, which she says is moving strategically to become the first mover in CBDC technology. However, even if China is the first to launch a centrally issued digital currency, Fitzpatrick doesn’t think its effect on Bitcoin would be too destabilizing in the long run.“They want that to be used around the world, and it is a potential threat to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,” said Fitzpatrick, adding, “I think it is a real threat, but I think it will be temporary. I don’t think it will be successful in permanently destabilizing Bitcoin.” "

At that time, a GBTC share cost around $11.17, equating to a positive premium of around 12% over spot price.

The firm recently acquired a 320-acre plot of land in Texas, which it plans to use to expand its mining operations with an additional 200-megawatts of electrical power, also derived from renewable energy sources.Chief Executive of Argo, Peter Wall, said making Bitcoin more green was a major priority, and urged other Bitcoin mining companies to follow suit:Bitcoin’s energy usage rose to match the yearly consumption of the country of Chile last month, a fact that critics and skeptics are quick to point out. However, few think to level the same criticisms at a technology like the internet, which already uses more energy than Bitcoin, and like cryptocurrencies, has yet to expand to anything close to global usage.“[DMG’s] focus on eco-friendly Bitcoin mining has the opportunity to drive transformations in how the Bitcoin mining community acts towards a climate-conscious future. DMG's ongoing commitment to clean energy-based capital deployment is a key industry development,” said chief executive of DMG Dan Reitzik."
612,"A social crypto trading platform connects professional traders with new investors — creating a win-win situation.Learning about cryptocurrencies can be a steep learning curve, and according to Tycoon, mastering the art of trading well is also difficult and time consuming.The platform aims to improve accessibility into this flourishing space through the use of API technology — meaning that a trader who is starting out can connect to a more experienced professional and copy their moves in real time.Tycoon says this approach can help newcomers accelerate their educational journey, all while potentially making the process much more rewarding than it may have been.Over the years, social media has enabled us to connect with like-minded individuals who share the same interests we do. It’s also served as a powerful educational tool — allowing us to pick up fascinating facts and encounter jaw-dropping videos as we scroll through news feeds over our morning coffees.Recently, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have been popping up on the feeds of millions of people — helping them to gain an understanding of their role in society, and what the future may hold. Tycoon’s ambition is to enable anyone who has an interest in cryptocurrencies to get involved with some expert help along the way — even if they don’t have the time or patience to pick up crucial trading skills.The use of an Application Programming Interface means that a professional trader can allow their account to be followed by other investors who have been impressed by their performance. From there, the trader’s moves can be copied almost instantaneously.Tycoon stresses that it never handles anyone’s funds directly, and crypto belonging to traders and followers alike will remain on centralized exchanges that are protected by strong passwords, two-factor authentication and a myriad of other security measures. The platform has already been integrated with Binance.To incentivize professional traders to get involved, Tycoon uses a model that ensures they will receive part of any gains accrued by their followers. The social crypto trading platform also receives a commission for connecting the two parties.Tycoon has now created a new token called TYC. Supply is capped at 140 million, and it serves as the platform’s native cryptocurrency. Followers who use TYC have the potential to reduce the commission they pay on profits generated.A crowdsale for TYC is ending on March 31, and Tycoon’s CEO Serdar Bisi says the token is due to be listed on top crypto exchanges in April.At present, professional traders are being given the chance to join Tycoon, connect their API and build up their performance statistics — metrics that followers will be able to scrutinize when they’re deciding which accounts they want to copy.The follow functionality is gradually being unveiled, and Tycoon’s platform is set to go fully public by June at the latest. It has been in development for more than three years, and it is already fully operational.Tycoon’s launch comes as the bull market rumbles on — with PayPal launching its own crypto service, publicly listed companies such as MicroStrategy and Tesla buying into Bitcoin, and large banks starting to offer crypto investments to their wealthy clients.In time, the platform hopes to help newcomers get a headstart in their crypto trading journey — enabling them to learn by doing. Trading books offer a great way to hone skills and understand technical terms, but getting the chance to see a professional in action is a powerful way of seeing the theory turned into practice.Disclaimer.

613,"With Coinbase’s highly anticipated direct listing IPO expected to take place next month, options traders appear to be betting that Bitcoin will once again soar to new all-time highs in the coming weeks.On March 24, the founders of crypto analytics firm Glassnode tweeted data suggesting that options traders on peer-to-peer crypto derivatives exchange, Deribit, are loading up on contracts set to expire on April 30 with a strike price of $80,000.Contracts worth a notional value of 4,000 BTC have been purchased targeting the price-point in total, more than any other strike-price by at least 50%.This Friday $6 billion in options contracts are set to expire. #Bitcoin price expectations for April are high with lots of investors placing their new bets on $80k. pic.twitter.com/xRipoAaD1FShould the price be less than $80,000 at the end of April, the contracts will expire worthless, indicating high conviction that the Bitcoin markets are still a long way from topping out among derivatives traders.However, according to crypto derivatives data aggregator Skew, probability estimates based on market data for the April 30 contract suggests there is just a 6.19% chance of BTC prices being above $80,000 when the positions mature.Significant volume has also converged around the contracts with a strike price of $120,000, meaning some traders believe the Bitcoin price will more than double over the next five weeks. Skew estimates it is only 2.15% likely Bitcoin will reach $100,000 by the April 30 expiry date. However, with many options traders building positions across multiple contracts bearing divergent strike prices, some of the traders betting on $80,000 or $120,000 may not expect prices to get that high.Skew’s data shows that contracts for April 30 are currently the third-most-popular among options traders, with open interest currently equating to a notional value of 38,700 BTC.June 21 contracts rank second with 42,300 BTC worth of notional open interest, while 117,900 BTC worth of contracts or $6 billion in notional value is set to expire on March 26.Despite the entrance of institutional derivatives exchange Chicago Mercantile Exchange into the Bitcoin options sector in January 2020, Deribit still dominates options trade volume.Skew estimates 91% of BTC options contracts traded in the past 24 hours changed hands on Deribit, followed by Bit.com with 5%, OKEx with 2%, and CME and LedgerX with roughly 1% each."
614,"On March 25, concerns surrounding the record-breaking $6.1 billion (BTC) options expiry this Friday sparked an overnight sell-off that dropped Bitcoin price to $50,400.The downturn was not a surprise for many traders and some called for a possible test of the $47,000 support level. Despite Bitcoin's loss of bullish momentum, several derivatives indicators, including a bullish futures premium and a neutral skew, suggest that the price may not drop below $50,000.While technical indicators paint a mixed picture of Bitcoin's short-term price action, the asset retains strong fundamentals today media reported that sovereign wealth funds have begun inquiring about opening positions in BTC. This points to growing global adoption for BTC and the cryptocurrency sector as a whole as new Ether (ETH) trusts are also being established to serve institutional investors.Glassnode co-founder and CTO Rafael Schultze-Kraft recently highlighted a possible dip lower based on low realized price distribution between $51,100 and $54,000.Not much #Bitcoin realized between here and $51k.

615,"KiwiSaver Growth Strategy, a $350 million retirement plan operated by New Zealand Wealth Funds Management, has reportedly allocated 5% of its assets to Bitcoin (BTC), underscoring the steady stream of institutional investors entering the digital asset space.Bitcoin’s striking similarities to gold were cited as one of the biggest reasons for entering the trade, according to James Grigor, the chief investment officer at New Zealand Funds Management.“If you are happy to invest in gold, you can’t really discount bitcoin,” he told Stuff, a New Zealand news agency, adding that BTC will be featured in more KiwiSaver products over the next five years.Grigor explained that his firm purchased Bitcoin for the first time in October when it was valued at $10,000. To execute the trade, New Zealand Fund Management had to change its offer documents to allow for cryptocurrency investments.Bitcoin's price peaked north of $61,000 earlier this month, which would give KiwiSaver a 6x return in just five months. Although Bitcoin's price has moderated over the past week, the pension fund is sitting on hefty BTC profits. Grigor explained that KiwiSaver is “majority built up through traditional asset classes,” but noted that “other opportunities present themselves.” In the case of Bitcoin, it’s an asset class that could help “give people the best retirement they can get” through its aggressive compounding.While hedge funds and family offices have been steadily embracing Bitcoin, pension funds are perhaps the slowest to adopt the digital asset class. The growth of institutional onramps could help accelerate the adoption narrative.In the United States, Grayscale has noted that pension funds are already getting in on digital assets. “The sizes of allocations they are making are growing rapidly as well,” said Michael Sonnenshein, Grayscale’s CEO."
616,"Cathie Wood, the founder and CEO of Ark Invest, is cautioning investors not to sell or transact their Bitcoin (BTC) until the United States Internal Revenue Agency, or IRS, introduces more sensible tax policies on digital assets.In a webcast hosted by Cboe, Wood said transacting with BTC could lead to massive tax liabilities.""The IRS has something to say about this, so if you have huge gains in your Bitcoin, I don't think I would bear much in the way of transactions until we get maybe some changes on the tax front,” Wood said, according to Markets Insider.Using Bitcoin for transactions and selling it for profit have become attractive options for long-term holders. The flagship cryptocurrency recently spiked above $61,000 en route to new all-time highs. And while the BTC price has corrected sharply from its recent peak, it’s still up 80% on the year.Bitcoin holders in the United States are also now able to use their BTC to buy Tesla automobiles. At current values, a basic Tesla Model 3 could be bought for around 0.72 BTC.But whether you sell Bitcoin for profit or use it to buy a Tesla vehicle, it’s considered a taxable event – at least, in the United States. That’s because the IRS treats Bitcoin as property rather than currency. Until that changes, it may be counterintuitive to transact in the cryptocurrency.Although Wood’s comments were specifically aimed at people sitting on huge profits, the vast majority of buyers have made money on their Bitcoin. By November 2020, it was estimated that around 98% of BTC addresses were in the black.Luckily, Bitcoin investors hodling large, unrealized profits don't have to sell their coins to reap the benefits of their gains. Platforms like BlockFi allow users to borrow fiat money against their BTC holdings and pay it back over time. This means users never incur capital gains and don't have to give up their Bitcoin to access liquid cash. "
617,"Earlier this week, Cointelegraph reported the importance of the upcoming $6.1 billion Bitcoin (BTC) options expiry on March 26. The article made clear that bulls were in control if one excluded the put (sell) options below $47,000, which is likely the case as BTC currently hovers above $50,000.As the expiry date draws closer, it's less likely that traders will be willing to pay for the right to sell BTC at $47,000. The same could be said for the ultra-bullish call (buy) options at $60,000 and above. Therefore, the $6.1 billion total open interest is heavily inflated by worthless options.Could there be something hidden in BTC options that is causing current pressure on price pressure? To determine this, one needs to analyze how these calls and puts stack below $50,000.The total open interest slightly increased over the past ten days to 105,000 BTC options. Now that BTC price dropped to $51,500, these are now worth $5.4 billion. As previously mentioned, this is not a fair assessment to make if one excludes the neutral-to-bearish puts below $45,000, which are effectively worthless right now. This data means there are only 11,100 BTC contracts left.This number translates to a mere $572 million put options open interest, or 20% outstanding. The neutral-to-bullish call options focusing on the $20,000 to $56,000 range result in 20,850 BTC, or $1.07 billion at the current BTC price. This number is almost double that of the competing put options and still leaves bulls in complete control of Friday's expiry.If Bitcoin price somehow drops to $45,000 at 8:00 UTC on March 26, these 11,100 put options would create further downward pressure. On the other hand, this would be virtually balanced by the 11,050 neutral-to-bullish call options from $20,000 to $44,000. The amount of call (buy) options effectively exercised will match the put (sell) options, creating no imbalance.Therefore, if the media or analysts are pinpointing $45,000 as a game-changer for short sellers to take control of the options expiry, they're wrong about it. Undoubtedly some of these call options could have been used in various strategies, thus providing a market-neutral positioning for its holder.The same rationale could be argued by those holding the neutral-to-bearish put options. Not necessarily because its buyers are cheering for lower Bitcoin prices, but rather the result of holders having also bought futures contracts or sold put options at a slightly higher strike.The human mind needs narratives, but the market doesn't always work that way. There have been at least three other fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) events over the past week.Some of the top ones that come to mind include Ray Dalio's: ""good probability of a U.S. Bitcoin ban"" and remarks from Amundi Deputy Chief Investment Officer Vincent Mortier, who suggested that cryptocurrency regulation could cause a ""brutal price correction."" Another supposedly bearish announcement was issued on March 22 when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that ""Bitcoin is too volatile to be money"" and ""is backed by nothing."" Statements like these usually play some role in curbing investor expectations, but no one can really know what drives each market participant to trade at each price level.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

618,"The biggest-ever Bitcoin options expiry is due on March 26. Over $6 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) options will expire across exchanges on Friday, with a majority of these options being on Deribit. This will be a record expiry in terms of the value and number of options — a total of 100,400 Bitcoin options will expire. The previous record was set in January when nearly $4 billion worth of options expired, representing 36% of the open interest at the time.The enormous upcoming expiry comes on the back of rapid growth in open interest in the Bitcoin options market. The OI of Bitcoin has seen more than 147% growth since the beginning of the year. The total OI across the top five crypto derivatives exchanges is currently $14.01 billion, up from $5.67 billion on Jan. 1.The size of the options market is increasing both in volume and open interest. As a result, the influence that this market has on the spot markets is also increasing. It’s well known that the derivatives market is an important tool for the spot market’s price discovery. For example, in the traditional financial markets, the size of the derivatives market is several times the size of the spot markets for assets like gold, equities, etc.However, the opposite is the case for Bitcoin: The size of the BTC spot market is several times larger than its derivatives market. But still, investors look to the futures markets for price discovery at various stages and look to the options market to gauge the sentiment that prevails. Regarding this, Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX — a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange — told Cointelegraph:This change started in 2018 once options volumes started growing, bringing in more investors who wanted to hedge their bets in the futures and spot markets. Cointelegraph further discussed the influence of the options markets with Shaun Fernando, head of risk and product strategy at cryptocurrency derivatives exchange Deribit. He said:The expiry will not lead to all options trading at once, as some of the strike prices seem highly unrealistic. The options market is usually an all-or-nothing game; on expiry, they either have a value or are deemed entirely worthless. They become worthless when the underlying asset trades above the call strike price or below the put strike price.To elaborate, “call” options are contracts that allow the option holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price within a specific time period. In contrast, put options are contracts that give the option holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a specific time. That predetermined price is called the strike price.Over the past week, Bitcoin has seen bearish price movements. It has gone from trading in the $60,000 range on March 19 to the $50,000 range on March 25. This drop has led investors to question the real value of Bitcoin and wonder if the bull market is coming to an end soon.But this $6 billion expiry could lead to a change in this sentiment. Bankman-Fried further explained that more options writers are comfortable selling the downside than writing the upside, saying:To gauge the impact of the expiry, it’s beneficial to exclude the neutral-to-bearish put options that would be active below $47,000 and the call options with a strike price above $66,000, as both seem to be highly improbable scenarios. This leaves a $668 million imbalance in favor of bullish call options, which could dominate the sentiment post-expiry.While analyzing the historical price action of Bitcoin when options expire, Twitter user James Viggiano shared an interesting observation that the price generally seems to rise after an expiry. The same is observed for every monthly expiry event from October 2020 through February.Even though an options expiry of over $6 billion seems enormous for the Bitcoin markets, it is important to note that nearly 43% of these options are already worthless due to BTC’s current price range. Thus, in reality, the options expiry will be worth way less than what is set to expire.Robbie Liu, market analyst at OKEx Insights — the research team at cryptocurrency exchange OKEx — told Cointelegraph: “Major options expiries are often accompanied by an increase in spot volatility and the same goes for futures.”The max pain price for this options expiry currently stands at $44,000. The max pain price is the strike price at which there are the most puts and calls. Thus, this is the price where the maximum number of market participants will face financial losses. The max pain theory implies that an options' price will gravitate toward the max pain price as expiry nears. Fernando further explained what the max pain price means for this specific expiry event:Another important aspect to note is that the one-month realized volatility is currently at the lowest level of 2021, and implied volatility levels are at the lowest since December 2020. Lower implied volatility suggests there are lower premiums, thus making options cheaper for investors to trade-in.The larger the total options OI for a certain asset, the bigger the impact it will have on the price of the underlying asset. The max pain price being at a low $44,000 puts some bearish sentiment in the market — this is a concern for bulls in the long term. Liu opined further regarding what the markets can expect after this historic options expiry:Bitcoin continued to see more institutional adoption after Tesla began accepting Bitcoin from U.S. customers as payment for its products. This led to another “Elon candle” in the market, pushing up the price by $3,000 — but it subsided the very next day. Tesla even publicly snubbed Bitcoin’s hard fork Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which led to the token reaching new lows in the market.However, this options expiry could remove the downward pressure that currently exists in the market and turn the markets bullish again, as the options market is indicative of the markets still being skewed toward the bulls."
619,"State-owned investment funds are reportedly making inquiries into buying Bitcoin (BTC).According to Robert Gutmann, CEO of New York Digital Investment Group, the firm has been having conversations with sovereign wealth funds about possible Bitcoin investments.Gutmann made this known while appearing at a virtual podcast with investment strategist and founder of Real Vision Raoul Pal.Pal also confirmed Gutmann’s revelation, stating that Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Temasek was indeed a Bitcoin investor.According to Pal, Temasek which holds about $306 billion in assets under management, has been buying virgin Bitcoin from miners.Tweeting on Thursday, Pal characterized the imminent entry of sovereign wealth funds into the Bitcoin space as a “wall of money.”TemesekIndeed, since publicly-listed firms like MicroStrategy and Tesla began holding BTC on their balance sheets, there has been speculation about whether governments would follow suit.Drawing parallels between the appeal of Bitcoin for public firms and sovereign wealth funds, Gutmann touched on the desire of institutional investors to hedge their dollar-denominated liabilities.According to Gutmann, investors are re-evaluating their portfolios, adding:Back in August 2020, upon announcing its first Bitcoin purchase, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor touched on the long-term value of BTC vis-à-vis the depreciating value of cash over time.Earlier in March, Russ Koesterich, portfolio manager at BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund characterized gold’s status as an inflation hedge as being exaggerated.Bitcoin is currently down 8% over the last 24 hours in what is likely an upside price dislocation given the significant decline in the volume of Bitcoin held on exchanges. Despite the current drop, BTC is still up about 78% year-to-date."
620,"Bitcoin (BTC) is showing tenacity above $50,000 on March 25. The 10% drop over the last 24 hours happened despite Tesla allowing customers to buy vehicles using BTC in addition to CEO Elon Musk affirming that it will not be converted to fiat currency.On March 22, the United States Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, stated that Bitcoin was too volatile, ""backed by nothing,"" and more of an asset for speculation. Curiously, on that same day, BTC lost its $56,000 support, which became a resistance.Traders worry that the pump might have been news-driven, while the downtrend movement shall prevail. Although this is possible, derivatives indicators aren't leaning bearish, and any decent correction will likely meet strong support at $50,000.Part of the uncertainty investors might have derived from the record $6.1 billion options expiry on March 26. Nevertheless, 84% of the neutral-to-bearish put options are already deemed worthless as BTC price soared above $50,000.Moreover, CME holds $980 million futures contracts set to expire on the same day. Although buyers (longs) and sellers (shorts) are matched at all times, some traders worry that BTC prices could be pressured by futures traders looking to roll over their positions into April and May.Unlike perpetual futures, those fixed-calendar CME contracts have a set expiry date. Thus, to maintain a long position, one must buy the April or May futures while simultaneously selling the March contract.Thus, to better assess whales and arbitrage desks influence on the market, one should closely monitor derivatives indicators.By measuring the expense gap between futures and the regular spot market, a trader can gauge the level of bullishness in the market.The three-month futures usually trade with a 10% to 20% versus regular spot exchanges to justify locking the funds instead of immediately cashing out. Whenever this indicator fades or turns negative, known as ""backwardation, it indicates that the market is bearish.The above chart shows that the indicator recently bottomed at 17% on March 25 while BTC tested the $50,000 support. This is extremely bullish as it signals leveraged buyers remained optimistic and unwilling to reduce their positions.Whenever the basis reaches 35% or higher, it indicates extreme buyers' leverage, but that's clearly not the case right now.When analyzing options, the 25% delta skew is the single-most relevant gauge. This indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options side-by-side. Some analysts point to the put-to-call ratio, but this metric fails to exclude worthless options such as a right to sell BTC at $45,000.Thus, delta skew offers a less polluted number and will turn negative when the put options premium is higher than similar risk call options. Such a positive skew translates to a higher cost of downside protection, indicating optimism.The opposite holds when market makers are bearish, causing the 25% delta skew indicator to gain positive ground.Over the past five weeks, the skew indicator remained flat, indicating no optimism or pessimism from whales and option market makers. A skew indicator between negative 10 and positive 10 is deemed neutral, meaning a balanced risk assessment.As futures and options provide mixed sentiment, one should also monitor the perpetual futures funding rate. Such a fee is charged every eight hours to ensure derivatives exchanges hold no risk imbalances. Wherever it turns positive, it means buyers (longs) are the ones paying the carry cost due to larger leverage use.The current 0.04% average is relatively neutral, equivalent to 0.8% per week. Although longs are the ones facing such fees, it is far from being considered costly. Such data indicates that retail traders are not creating an arbitrage opportunity causing fixed-calendar futures to trade at a premium.Overall, derivatives indicators are healthy considering BTC is down 16% from the $61,800 all-time high on March 13. Such data leaves room for further buying activity, so traders shouldn't consider the current as anything out of the ordinary.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
621,"Microsoft has been sending mixed signals when it comes to its true intentions regarding Bitcoin (BTC) as well as the cryptocurrency market in general. On one hand, Microsoft president Brad Smith gave an interview earlier this year, claiming that the multinational was not even the least bit interested in dabbling in Bitcoin, stating that Tesla’s move to invest $1.5 billion had not changed anything for the company.However, just a couple of days ago, the tech giant seemed to showcase a change of heart by reportedly releasing a poll online asking its customers how they would like to pay for their purchases in the Xbox Games Store in the future, with one of the most prominent options on the list being Bitcoin.This development also comes right after Smith stating that fintech firms have no business issuing private digital currencies, arguing that central banks are there to look after the “common good” of the masses and thus should be the ones who are in command of the world’s money supply streams.If Bitcoin does get accepted as a means of payment in the Xbox Games Store, it would not be the first time that Microsoft would have dabbled in crypto because as far back as 2014, the company has been accepting Bitcoin to fund its accounts, allowing United States-based users to acquire a whole host of content from their Windows Store — including Xbox gaming titles.That being said, the firm’s crypto foray came to a standstill in 2018 when the market as a whole was on the receiving end of insane bearish pressure, causing the value of most cryptocurrencies to tumble to relative lows. However, earlier this year, Microsoft once again decided to allow Bitcoin payments, albeit only for its MS Store.On March 24, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that his company would be accepting Bitcoin as payment for its cars, leading many from the social media world to come forth and declare that crypto had finally gone mainstream. However, even if so, it’s definitely not clear-cut that BTC will become a mainstream means of payment if other large companies, like Microsoft, which have questioned crypto in the past, would allow crypto as a payment method.On the subject, Joe Zhou, founder and CEO of FirstBlood — a blockchain-based esports platform — told Cointelegraph that, by and large, this development seems to be positive on paper, especially as it stands to help increase crypto adoption across the global digital landscape, adding:Zhou further opined that if Microsoft does decide to enable crypto payments, it could potentially lay the perfect groundwork for the marriage of the gaming and crypto communities, especially since he believes that gamers in the 18–35 age bracket are the ones who are most likely to hodl digital currencies in the future.Lastly, in his view, apps such as Cash App and PayPal that allow users to buy and hold crypto will further help in merging the two worlds, allowing for even greater adoption within the gaming community. “I would be most curious about how Microsoft’s treasury department is going to handle their crypto revenues. Will they liquidate for fiat? Or are they going to hold them like Tesla and MicroStrategy,” he addedThough there are many who believe that Microsoft’s interest in incorporating crypto into its existing payment framework is a sign for big things to come in the future, Andrew Colosimo, co-founder of Xaya — a blockchain gaming and digital asset management platform — told Cointelegraph that although the development itself is a positive signal, he’s not entirely sure if it will have a major immediate impact on Bitcoin, adding:That being said, he did concede that if just one major player like Microsoft was to start taking BTC as payment, it could set in motion a ripple effect, causing other console operators to potentially follow suit.Similarly, Hatem Hachana, chief operating officer of Utopia Genesis Foundation — a blockchain-based platform for the tokenization of music rights, assets and royalties — believes that most gamers are already familiar with the concept of in-game purchases at this point, so simply adding a crypto payment option will not make that big of a difference even though it stands to draw some more mainstream adoption.He added: “If Microsoft adopts, Sony and Nintendo will for sure follow this path. Just looking at the whole space, everybody is adapting, moving forward and integrating crypto.”It seems quite likely that Microsoft may be seeing a new trend around crypto, especially with the nonfungible token market — a space that has been soaring recently. To put things into perspective, the digital collectibles market has seen its value rise substantially over the last few months, with an increasing number of celebrities cashing in on the trend of digitizing their works.Related: NFT ‘art revolution’: Beeple on his 5,040-day labor of loveFor example, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s first-ever tweet has been recently sold in the form of an NFT for a sum of $2.9 million. Similarly, Mike Winkelmann — the artist known as Beeple — has recently sold one of his works via auction house Christie’s for a whopping $69 million, making him one of the most valued artists in the world today.Thus, it stands to reason that Microsoft may once again be looking to explore this ever-evolving space and potentially expose its extensive customer base — with the number of people who own an Xbox One console touted to be around 48.69 million — to the digital asset market. In the end, if BTC comes back onto the platform as a payments method, it would mark it as a moment of redemption for the cryptocurrency, suggesting that it could stay there for a while longer than before."
622,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell to its lowest level since March 8 on Thursday as U.S. dollar strength added to selling pressure near $60,000.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and Tradingview showed BTC/USD testing $50,000 for the first time since sealing the level as support earlier this month.After seeing rejection at $60,000, Bitcoin had struggled to maintain higher levels through the week, and an overnight sell-off finally saw mid-$50,000 support evaporate. The largest cryptocurrency shed almost 10% on the day, with buyers nonetheless keeping it out of the $40,000-$50,000 corridor at the time of writing. The weakness came in tandem with news from the United States Federal Reserve, which focused on a potential pullback of monetary intervention. The economy, Chair Jerome Powell said, had rebounded better than expected.""As we make substantial further progress toward our goals, we’ll gradually roll back the amount of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities we’ve bought,” he told NPR quoted by CNBC.The dollar took its cue for an uptick, with the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) hitting its highest score since Nov. 23 on the day.As Cointelegraph reported, despite somewhat breaking down this year, DXY and BTC/USD performance tends to be inversely correlated.On spot markets, traders were broadly unfazed by the pullback. Significant support remained at $46,000 and higher, which some had previously said would save Bitcoin from deeper losses in the event of a bearish pullback.Their advice, therefore, was to use the current climate as a buying opportunity. ""While people are shouting at the markets for this correction, you could also derive potential entry zones,"" Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe told Twitter followers.Fellow trader Scott Melker suggested that the market was ""pushing into"" oversold territory, which could signal a more permanent reversal incoming.Institutional sentiment meanwhile remained solidly bullish after Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal revealed that one Singapore sovereign wealth fund had been buying BTC from miners since 2018.In an interview with Pal, NYDIG, which provides access to Bitcoin through various funds, also confirmed that it had been in discussions with multiple unnamed sovereign wealth entities."
623,"The pressure of trying to sell Bitcoin (BTC) at a price top is proving too much for some couples.A Reddit post revealed that a man’s wife left him after he refused to sell his Bitcoin holdings when the price hit $60,000, and instead loaded up on more BTC during the recent dip.In a post titled “My wife is leaving because Bitcoin,” user u/Parking_Meater said his wife packed her bags and went to live with her sister after she caught him converting more cash into Bitcoin. The Reddit user wrote:The trading accumen of the poster’s wife is unknown, however her instinct to sell when Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $61,321 on March 13 would have prevented a 15% loss, given the coin’s trajectory since then.But at the same time, if the husband bought the dip when Bitcoin struck a two-week low of $52,182 early on Thursday morning (UTC) —which aligns with the timing of his post — he would have ridden the bounce to 2.2% gains by the time of publication.But u/Parking_Meater doesn’t seem too concerned either way. His post ended with a look to the future, in which he naturally sees himself using sportscars as leverage in a well-known courtship ritual."
624,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has been in retreat, down 20% since the recent all-time high at $62,000 in mid-March. As crypto markets are frequently volatile, this may very well be another normal pullback within the current bull cycle. Corrections are needed to generate strength for further upward momentum as markets can’t go up in a straight line. Additionally, a record $6 billion expiration of options is expected on March 26, which often brings some volatility. It is also quite common for the market's momentum to shift momentum once the options expiration date comes and goes.The 4-hour chart shows an apparent downtrend since the recent all-time high at $62,000 with bearish support/resistance flips. Regardless, Bitcoin’s price has rejected the critical resistance zone at $56,500 in the latest rally after Tesla announced it has started accepting (and holding) BTC in the United States for its vehicles. As that price level couldn’t break for more upside, renewed tests of the $53,000 support zone were inevitable.Given that the $53,000 support zone has been tested multiple times in recent weeks, it became likely that this level may not hold this time around. Therefore, the price collapsed on March 25 and dropped to as low as $51,500. Hence, Bitcoin’s price must now regain the $53,200-$53,800 area to revive any bullish momentum in the near term. If that doesn’t happen, it’s likely to see more downside to the next support zone between $49,500 and $51,500.The daily chart for BTC/USD still paints a bullish outlook showing consistent higher lows and higher highs. In that perspective, a correction to as low as $44,000 would still mean that the bullish construction remains valid.In that regard, Bitcoin’s price currently has massive support between $49,500 and $51,500 and is unlikely to fall further.Additionally, the bearish divergence isn’t confirmed until the market starts to make lower lows and lower highs below $44,000, as previously stated.The U.S. Dollar is showing strength once again as the yields are also running up substantially. So it's not surprising to see risk assets falling, namely commodities and cryptocurrencies as well.A rebounding USD is typically bearish for crypto markets, particularly in the short term. But this latest uptick in the dollar is likely temporary because it's entering strong resistance. Moreover, the structure still shows lower lows and lower highs, meaning that a trend reversal should be expected relatively soon.Thus, if the dollar's momentum is halted, more upside for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market becomes likely.The 4-hour chart for Bitcoin shows a downtrend, in which a retest of the $53,200-$53,800 region will likely be rejected. Therefore, more downside is the most likely scenario in this current price construction in the near term.The green zone shown in the chart above is the area to watch for a potential bullish divergence or immediate bounce. If such a move occurs, the ideal scenario for the bulls would then be to establish a higher low.Once such a higher low is established, Bitcoin’s price will be primed to continue climbing with the next points of interest at $68,000 and $82,000.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
625,"Controversial Bitcoin (BTC) spin-off Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has hit new all-time lows against its parent after Tesla publicly rejected using it for payments.In a series of tweets on March 24, CEO and ""Technoking"" Elon Musk confirmed that U.S. customers could now buy a Tesla using BTC — but his company shunned ""fork products"" such as BCH.Bitcoin Cash spun off from the Bitcoin blockchain in August 2017 and has since remained a controversial entity within cryptocurrency. Proponents claim supremacy over Bitcoin thanks to BCH fees being far lower while transactions also tend to take less time to clear and require fewer resources.The narrative has taken various forms over the years, with advocacy ranging from passive to belligerent as BCH/BTC continues to plug new lows. On Wednesday, BCH holders received less than 1% of a Bitcoin — 0.089 BTC — per 1 BCH for the first time.Tesla's Bitcoin acceptance move appeared to drive the downturn. Support documentation originally singled out BCH and fellow Bitcoin Cash hard fork Bitcoin SV (BSV) as being unsuitable for payment.""You may not make purchases with us using any other digital asset, including Bitcoin fork products, such as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV,"" the company stated.The phrasing jarred with BCH holders, who frequently tout the altcoin as being the ""real"" Bitcoin. Among them was entrepreneur Kim Dotcom, who took Musk to task about the snub.""Try and buy a Soda with Bitcoin,"" he tweeted indignantly.Tesla had already removed the content, simply warning buyers not to send any other cryptocurrency to a BTC address other than Bitcoin itself. This was not enough to extinguish the heated debate, however, as rival supporters sparred over what is a perennial source of anguish.""Satoshi didn't envision Bitcoin as a new class of bank controlled by the same corrupt power structures as our current financial system,"" Dotcom continued.Musk responded with characteristic nonchalance, saying Dotcom had a ""fair point"" regarding transaction fees while also taking note of a proposal to accept Dogecoin (DOGE).Bitcoiners argue that BCH is all but worthless versus Bitcoin despite its lower fees. This is due to the latter surviving multiple tests of its blockchain while still maintaining an unblemished 12-year history of Proof-of-Work.BCH, by contrast, has yet to do the same, and with its hash rate steadily falling against BTC, its cheap usage costs increasingly come at the expense of both security and usefulness as a store-of-value.As Cointelegraph reported, so-called ""Layer 2"" solutions such as the Lightning Network, while criticized by Dotcom, are designed to move the majority of BTC transactions off-chain, reducing fees and transaction times to near zero.BCH meanwhile faces other problems, its declining price pushing it out of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap this year."
626,"An Indian cryptocurrency ban would have grave implications for the future of the country’s economy, and would result in currency devaluation “of the worst form,” says blockchain entrepreneur and HashCash CEO Raj Chowdhury.Chowdhury, also the managing director of the United States-based PayBito cryptocurrency exchange, said India’s rejection of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies would be the equivalent of rejecting the U.S. dollar. Without regulating and eventually adopting cryptocurrency as a reserve currency, Chowdhury believes India’s economy would suffer in the long term.“Maintaining Cryptocurrency reserves are as important as maintaining dollar reserves. By banning crypto, India will end up with the lowest reserve of the most important currency the world has ever seen. This would eventually lead to a currency devaluation of the worst form,” he said.The fate of cryptocurrencies in India looked ominous after an anonymous official leaked information regarding an upcoming ban to Bloomberg in February. Crypto holders were expected to be given a three to six-month window to transfer their funds back into fiat.However, recent noises coming out of the Indian Finance Ministry suggested the situation wasn’t quite so clear-cut. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said reports of a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies had been overstated, and that discussions were ongoing with regulators inside the Reserve Bank of India. Sitharaman added that any upcoming regulations wouldn’t be as severe as previously depicted.Chowdhury welcomes regulations and taxation of cryptocurrencies if it means related business and enterprise can flourish within the country. The alternative is to deprive Indian startups who have already gained a global foothold of the opportunity to grow, Chowdhury said.“What India needs is acceptance of crypto with the imposition of taxation and regulations, that will earn revenue and benefit the huge number of investors and Indian startup companies who have gone global within a short period, rather than depriving the people of their choice of investment by adopting a naive approach towards the crypto,” he said.Amid the back and forth, the Reserve Bank of India continues to push forward toward the issuance of a central bank digital currency. As with all sovereign states, India’s apparent determination to launch a blockchain-based digital rupee suggests its issues with cryptocurrency aren’t related to the underlying technology, but only who gets to control it.Chowdhury believes a measured approach can be taken to distinguish between blockchain as a technology, and cryptocurrency as an asset class.“These are two distinct and diverse threads that may be accepted independent of each other. While blockchain is a technology, cryptocurrency is an asset class. It should not be difficult to implement the two in their respective domains,” he said.Despite what many fear to be a regulatory ticking time bomb in India, global cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase recently announced that it would move some of its IT services to India, as the company edges closer to its upcoming IPO."
627,"Chicago-based exchange holding company Cboe markets — an early pioneer of regulated Bitcoin futures trading in the United States — plans to build out more futures products within the crypto sector in future. In a new interview with BNN Bloomberg on March 25, CEO Ed Tilly said that the company's not always straightforward journey until now by no means dampened its commitment. Having been the first North American exchange to list Bitcoin (BTC) futures back in Dec. 2017, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, or CBOE, later ended the product in 2019, faced with stiff competition from popular BTC futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or CME. This notwithstanding, Tilly said:Another frustration has been U.S. regulators' reluctance to give the green light to a Bitcoin exchange-traded-fund, or ETF, with Cboe already having unsuccessful attempts to list one. After a recent, withdrawn proposal, Cboe's BZX exchange is now waiting on the Securities and Exchange Commission's initial decision on its latest March filing to list the VanEck Bitcoin ETF. Tilly told reporters the company is “very keen to move along approval” for the VanEck product.VanEck has meanwhile fallen out of favor with former partner SolidX over the Bitcoin ETF filing, with the latter filing a lawsuit accusing VanEck of plagiarizing its work in its earlier ETF application this January."
628,"As Bitcoin markets begin to form another daily red candle, its market capitalization has dropped back below $1 trillion once again.The third major correction in the current bull market is deepening and prices are already down 12.5% from their all-time high of $60,100 on March 13.According to CoinGecko, the BTC market capitalization is currently $980 billion, having dropped $140 billion over the past seven days since last Thursday, March 18.The move comes just a few days after analyst Willy Woo predicted that its total capitalization would not fall back below these levels again.The BTC market cap first surpassed a trillion dollars on Feb. 19 but did not remain there long, falling back below it after just four days. The second time it topped ten figures was on March 9, and it remained above the milestone level until today’s slump.The total market capitalization for the entire crypto ecosystem is currently $1.65 trillion according to CoinGecko. It has fallen by 9.8%, or $180 billion since Monday, March 22.Profit taking could be a big factor in this pullback, as suggested by analyst Josh Rager who stated that unrealized profits are not realized until they are in the bank.In reference to MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor whose firm has been buying a lot of Bitcoin this year, he added:As reported by Cointelegraph, there have been a number of signals that the pullback could continue. Analytics provider Glassnode used the risk reserve metric, which assesses the confidence of long-term holders relative to the price of Bitcoin, to suggest conditions are similar to the second half or later stages of a bull market.CryptoQuant, meanwhile, analyzed BTC flows to and from exchanges to predict that it would take some time to get another leg up in terms of demand/supply.At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading down 3.6% on the day at $52,350 as the FUD begins to seep back into the ecosystem."
629,"As the Bitcoin correction deepens, the fear, uncertainty, and doubt has returned, with billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio adding a whole bunch more of it.In an interview with Yahoo Finance’s editor-in-chief on March 24, the founder of the $150 billion hedge fund Bridgewater Associates stated that there is a “good probability” that the U.S. government could ban Bitcoin just as it did with gold ownership in the 1930s.That happened because government leaders at the time did not want gold to compete with fiat money and credit as a store of wealth, Dalio added.The billionaire hedge fund manager and philanthropist, who called Bitcoin “one hell of an invention” and compared it to gold in January, pointed out that India’s government is already trying to ban Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading in general. He added that he is not an expert but asserted that it can be tracked and the government can work out who is dealing with it.However, there was a little light at the end of Dalio’s gloomy outlook when he acknowledged BTC has stood the test of time as an asset class.On March 16, Dalio stated that the U.S. government could target those ditching the dollar for Bitcoin as it becomes “inhospitable to capitalism” in preparation for “shocking” tax changes to tackle the national debt crisis.The comments come as Bitcoin’s correction continues to deepen as signs that the bull market is entering its latter stages have emerged on-chain. BTC has corrected by 13.5% from its all-time high of $60,100, to current prices of around $52,000."
630,"Fidelity Investments, the $4.9 trillion asset manager, has filed paperwork with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, to list a new Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund. The Wise Origin Bitocin Trust was filed with the SEC on Wednesday, according to a Form S-1 Registration Statement that appeared on the regulator’s website. The ETF aims to track the digital currency’s daily performance using the Fidelity Bitcoin Index PR, an index that’s derived from several price feeds.From the prospectus:The fund is incorporated in Delaware, with Fidelity Digital Asset Services listed as the custodian.Fidelity says investors can access the fund through a traditional brokerage account without the “potential barriers to entry or risks involved with holding or transferring bitcoin directly.” Like other proposed Bitcoin ETFs, the Fidelity Trust is intended to provide more institutional pathways to cryptocurrencies.Speculation about a U.S. Bitcoin ETF has been rampant since the 2017 bull market. So far, lawmakers at the SEC have struck down every proposal to securitize Bitcoin in an ETF over concerns of extreme volatility and price manipulation. Proponents of the flagship cryptocurrency believe the tide could be changing now that Bitcoin has matured as an asset class.Last week, Goldman Sachs filed for a new ETF that includes the option to add BTC exposure. The Autocallable Contingent Coupon Coupon ETF-Linked Notes “may have exposure to cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, indirectly through an investment in a grantor trust,” the prospectus read. North of the border, Canadian regulators have so far approved two Bitcoin ETFs. The Purpose Bitcoin ETF, which was launched in mid-February, generated $100 million in volume during its first few hours of trading.Fidelity was among the first major institutions to embrace cryptocurrencies. The firm began mining Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) in 2014, the same year Abigail Johnson became the company's president and CEO."
631,"On March 24, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that U.S. buyers are now able to purchase Tesla vehicles with Bitcoin (BTC). Musk also tweeted that Tesla will not convert BTC payments into fiat but will add to its existing treasury of about 48,000 Bitcoin. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives expects Bitcoin to account for less than 5% of Tesla transactions, but the percentage could move up as crypto adoption increases. The analyst said the move by Tesla could be a defining moment for Bitcoin from a transactional point of view.This week, CNBC host Jim Cramer thanked Anthony Pompliano on the Pomp Podcast for convincing him to invest $500,000 in Bitcoin (BTC) in September 2020. Cramer said his Bitcoin investment has made him ""a ton of money.""However, during the same period, Cramer said his gold investment “let him down.” Due to this, Cramer altered his age-old advice of allocating 10% of the portfolio to gold. He now recommends investors put 5% of their portfolio allocation in gold and 5% in Bitcoin.With positive news flow acting as a tailwind, could Bitcoin and major altcoins resume their uptrend? Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin broke and closed below the pennant and the 20-day exponential moving average ($55,212) on March 22. However, the bears could not take advantage of the weakness and sink the price to the 50-day simple moving average ($50,752). This suggests a lack of sellers at lower levels.The bulls have bought the dip aggressively and pushed the price back above the 20-day EMA today. The next hurdle is the downtrend line. If the buyers can drive the price above this resistance, the BTC/USD pair may retest the all-time high at $61,825.84.A breakout and close above this level will open the doors for a rally to $72,112 and then $74,512.78.However, the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight. They will try to stall the current relief rally at the downtrend line. If the price turns down from this resistance, the bears will once again try to sink the pair below the 50-day SMA. If they manage to do that, the pair could drop to $43,006.77.After failing to rebound off the 20-day EMA ($1,742) for a few days, Ether (ETH) succumbed to selling pressure and plummeted below the moving averages on March 22. The bulls are currently trying to push the price back above the moving averages.If the buyers are successful in their endeavor, the ETH/USD pair may again try to reach the all-time high at $2,040.77. A breakout and close above this resistance could resume the uptrend, which has a target objective at $2,614.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the moving averages, it will suggest that the sentiment has turned negative and traders are selling on rallies to the 20-day EMA.If the price turns down and breaks below $1,647, the pair could extend its decline to $1,500 and then $1,289.Binance Coin (BNB) is trading inside a wide range between $189 and $309.50. The bulls are attempting to keep the price above the 20-day EMA ($254.66). If they can propel the price above $280, the altcoin may rally to $309.50. A breakout of this resistance could signal an advantage to the bulls.On the other hand, if the price turns down from $280, it will suggest traders are booking profits on rallies. The bears will then try to capitalize on this weakness and sink the price below the 20-day EMA.If they do that, the BNB/USD pair could gradually correct to $220 and then to $189. A break below this support could start a deeper correction.Right now, the flat moving average and the RSI above 55 signal a balance between supply and demand, resulting in a few more days of consolidation.Cardano (ADA) broke below the 20-day EMA ($1.14) and the price dipped close to the $1.03 support on March 22. The bulls bought the dip and are currently attempting to push the price back above the 20-day EMA.If they manage to do that, the ADA/USD pair may start its journey toward the resistance of the range at $1.48. The flat 20-day EMA and the RSI just above the midpoint also suggest a few days of consolidation.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and slides below $1.03, it could attract further selling from the bears. That could result in a drop to $0.80 and then $0.70.The failure to sustain Polkadot (DOT) above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle on March 20 could have trapped the aggressive bulls, which led to a correction and the price dipped to the support line of the triangle on March 23.The strong rebound off the support line shows the bulls are accumulating on dips. They will now once again try to propel the price above the triangle. If they can sustain the breakout, the DOT/USD pair could move up to $40.10 and then $42.28. A breakout and close above this resistance could start the next leg of the uptrend that could reach $55.Conversely, if the price again turns down from the overhead resistance, the pair may extend its stay inside the range. The price has reached close to the apex of the triangle. Usually, when this happens, the setup is invalidated.The flat 20-day EMA ($35.39) and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a few days of range-bound action.The long wick on XRP’s March 22 and 23 candlestick suggests that traders are booking profits at higher levels. However, the positive thing is that the bulls continue to buy on every minor dip.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 63 suggest that bulls have the upper hand. If they can push the price above $0.60, the XRP/USD pair may challenge the stiff resistance at $0.65. A breakout and close above this level could attract further buying, pushing the price to $0.78 and then $1.This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages. Such a move could pull the price down to $0.42.Uniswap (UNI) broke above the $35.20 overhead resistance on March 22 but the bulls could not sustain the breakout. The bulls again tried to clear the hurdle on March 23 but met with heavy selling pressure at higher levels. That dragged the price back into the $27.97 to $35.20 range.The 20-day EMA ($30.41) is flattening out and the RSI is just above the midpoint, suggesting the range-bound action may extend for a few more days. The longer the time spent in a range, the stronger will be the eventual breakout from it.A breakout and close above $35.20 could start the next leg of the uptrend that may drive the UNI/USD pair to $42.43 and then $46. On the contrary, a break and close below $27.97 may start a deeper correction to $20.74.THETA is in a strong uptrend but the long wick on the March 23 candlestick showed profit-booking at higher levels. However, that did not deter the bulls from pushing the altcoin to a new all-time high again today.The failure to sustain the higher levels has formed a shooting star candlestick pattern today. This increases the possibility of a correction or a consolidation in the next few days. The RSI above 90 also shows the THETA/USD pair is overbought in the short term and may cool down.The first support on the downside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $10.31. If the pair rebounds off this support, it will suggest the trend remains strong as the bulls are not waiting for a deeper correction to buy. Conversely, a break below $10.31 could sink the pair to the 20-day EMA ($8).Litecoin (LTC) formed a Doji candlestick pattern on March 23, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. This uncertainty has resolved to the upside today and the bulls are attempting to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($196).If they succeed, the price could rally to $208.10 and then to the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle. A breakout and close above this resistance will suggest that bulls may be back in command. The LTC/USD pair could then rally to $246.96 and then $300.Alternatively, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the bears will once again try to sink the pair below the triangle. If they manage to do that, the selling could intensify, which may pull the price down to $152.94 and then $120.Chainlink (LINK) plunged below the moving averages and the trendline of the ascending triangle on March 22. However, the failure of the bears to capitalize on the weakness and sink the price to $24 indicates a lack of sellers at lower levels.The bulls are attempting to push the price back above the moving averages, but they are likely to face stiff resistance from the bears.If the price turns down from the moving averages and breaks the $26.20 support, the LINK/USD pair could drop to $24 and then to $20.11. The 20-day EMA ($28.63) has started to turn down and the RSI is in the negative territory, which suggests the bears are attempting to gain the upper hand.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls push the price above the moving averages, the pair could rally to $32. A breakout of this resistance could result in an up-move to $36.93.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

632,"In the month since Cointelegraph Markets Pro launched, bringing professional crypto market intelligence to every investor, the platform has helped hundreds of early subscribers to better understand the opportunities and threats inherent in the world of crypto investing and trading.In this brief round-up, we wanted to draw attention to some of the highlights since the platform went live, including a critical look at a variety of back-tested strategies that the Markets Pro team has been tracking.Cointelegraph Markets Pro consists of two unique research features, in addition to a wide variety of market performance metrics and access to a vibrant community of crypto enthusiasts on Discord.The VORTECS™ Score is derived from an algorithm that examines multiple different variables (including sentiment, tweet volume, price volatility and trading volume) and compares those with historically similar marketscapes. The algorithm is capable of parsing through millions of historical data points each day, comparing what’s going on right now with prior conditions for the 140-plus assets currently tracked.A high VORTECS™ Score suggests that current market conditions — across all of those variables — are similar to conditions in the past where the asset has seen appreciation over the next several days. And the higher the score, the more consistent the behavior of the asset’s price in the past.History doesn't repeat... but apparently, it often rhymes. The VORTECS™ Score was created to provide every crypto market participant with the kind of quantitative analysis that has previously only been available to major institutional investors.NewsQuakes™ are alerts on events that have historically had a significant impact on an asset's price over the following 24 hours. Our research has found that exchange listings, staking announcements and partnership announcements have had the most consistently positive impact.NewsQuakes™ are built on top of The TIE’s proprietary SigDev technology — the fastest, most comprehensive feed for tracking real-time market-moving news in the cryptocurrency space. SigDev is used by major hedge funds, over-the-counter desks, market makers and other institutional market participants to gain an edge. NewsQuakes™ are delivered both in-browser and via Discord alerts direct to mobile devices.In addition to institutions, news outlets like Cointelegraph (and our largest media competitor) use The TIE’s SigDev platform to identify critical breaking news stories from primary sources.Among the most notable NewsQuakes™ are new exchange listings. For example, the average Coinbase listing in 2020 (from the time it was announced to the day the asset was available for trading) generated a 50.4% return.Some notable NewsQuakes™ over the past month include this alert on Ocean Protocol after the announcement that OCEAN would be listed on Kraken. The first red circle illustrates when the alert was sent to community members in the private Markets Pro Discord channelAnother example of the NewsQuakes™ system delivering news at a critical time can be seen in this chart, showing the rapid escalation in the price of MATIC following the announcement of its integration with Binance staking.Cointelegraph Markets Pro tracks the performance of 42 different trading strategies on an hourly basis, both cumulatively since the launch of the algorithm on Jan. 5 and for a rolling week.Strategies are divided into two camps: time-based and score-based.In each case, Markets Pro tracks the performance of the score vs. the U.S. dollar, as well as vs. holding Bitcoin and vs. holding an evenly weighted basket of the top 100 altcoins to ensure that testing accounts for wider market movements. A full testing methodology is available.Time-based strategiesTime-based strategies involve tracking the performance of a crypto asset from the moment its VORTECS™ Score crosses a key threshold until a specific time period has elapsed. For example, Buy 80/Hold 168 hours or Buy 90/Hold 24 hours.Of the 20 time-based strategies tracked by Markets Pro, all 20 have beaten simply holding Bitcoin, and 19 have beaten both the altcoin basket and Bitcoin since Jan. 5.The most successful of these strategies has been the Buy 90/Sell 168 strategy, which has returned 1,497.9% in that period, compared with 72.4% for Bitcoin and 325.7% for altcoins.The least successful has been the Buy 90/Sell 48 hours strategy, which returned 150.4%.The average return of all tested strategies was 510%.Score-based strategiesScored-based strategies involve tracking the performance of a crypto asset from the moment its VORTECS™ Score crosses a key threshold until it reaches another key threshold. For example, Buy 80/Sell 75 or Buy 90/Sell 65.Of the 22 score-based strategies tracked by Markets Pro, 21 have beaten simply holding Bitcoin, and 15 have beaten both the altcoin basket and Bitcoin since Jan. 5.The most successful of these strategies has been the Buy 80/Sell 65 score, which has returned 759.7% in that period, compared with 72.4% for Bitcoin and 325.7% for altcoins.The least successful has been the Buy 85/Sell 75 strategy, which returned 13.6% — and was the only strategy that failed to beat Bitcoin’s return over this period.The average return of all tested strategies was 368.3%.Cointelegraph Markets Pro is available exclusively to subscribers on a monthly basis at $99 per month, or annually with two free months included.

633,"Bitcoin (BTC) institutional investment firm NYDIG has staged an abrupt price cut for investors using it to gain exposure to BTC price action.In a press release on March 24, the company confirmed that effective immediately, its access fee had been reduced to 0.3%.The move comes just days after NYDIG's FS Select NYDIG Bitcoin Fund became one of three products selected by Morgan Stanley to be offered to its wealthy institutional clients.A potentially timely maneuver, the fee reduction may have consequences for competitors, notably the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), management fees for which currently cost clients 2%.""NYDIG's new pricing structure is 50-75% lower than comparable passive bitcoin access products available to investors and, critically, 0.30% represents the true total expense ratio of the fund, including a Big-4 audit and legal, custody, and accounting fees,"" the press release claimsAs Cointelegraph reported, competition from newcomers forms one explanation as to why GBTC's premium — how much extra clients pay for Bitcoin exposure on top of the net asset value price — has fallen into record negative territory this year.At one point, the premium offered a 15% discount to spot price for shares in GBTC. As of March 16, the most recent date for which data is available, it had recovered to around -5.3%.Continuing, NYDIG executives built on the sense of anticipation, which CEO Robby Gutmann had established in a recent interview. Prior to the Morgan Stanley announcement, Gutmann had revealed that the coming weeks would see a slew of ""game-changing"" adoption moves from the institutional sphere.""Expenses matter, and this will not be our last fee reduction,"" founder and executive chairman Ross Stevens commented in the release. Gold has seen further slights from investors this week, as CNBC host Jim Cramer conceded that the precious metal's performance had ""disappointed"" him. Bitcoin, on the other hand, had made him ""a ton of money,"" he said."
634,"Bitcoin rewards app, Lolli, has announced the close of its pre-series A fundraising round after raising $5 million.The round saw investment from a diverse array of participants, including Seven Seven Six — the venture capital firm co-founded by Reddit executive chairman Alexis Ohanian — Serena Williams’ Serena Ventures, management company Night Media, and various social media influencers.The funds will be allocated towards developing Lolli’s mobile application, scaling to support a growing user base, and international expansion.Launched in 2018, Lolli has teamed up with more than 1,000 merchants including Priceline and Macy’s to provide their customers with the opportunity to receive rewards in the form of BTC when shopping online.Ohanian described Lolli’s business model as facilitating “a unique chance to engage with an entirely new Bitcoin user base” and drive mainstream adoption:Serena Williams emphasized her excitement for Lolli, characterizing the platform as “leading the way for Bitcoin adoption:Alex Adelman, Lolli’s CEO and co-founder, stated: “We’re thrilled to be working with Seven Seven Six, Serena Ventures, and a fantastic team of investors in creating the easiest way for people to earn Bitcoin when they shop. This is an exciting time and opportunity to accelerate adoption and increase accessibility to bitcoin.”Lolli’s latest raise follows a $3 million seed round that was led by PathFinder and saw participation from Digital Currency Group, and Bain Capital in May 2020.In December, crypto lending platform BlockFi announced plans to team up with Visa to offer a credit card that rewards users with BTC."
635,"London-based cryptocurrency and fintech firm Wirex has announced that it will no longer take on new U.K.-based customers following discussions with the jurisdictional regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.The decision to temporarily halt U.K. sign-ups was apparently voluntary, according to a press release posted by Wirex on March 24, however, it did follow hot on the heels of “constructive dialogue” with the FCA.From March 25 onwards, U.K. residents will no longer be allowed to sign up for Wirex’s services. Moving forward, Wirex will dedicate attention and resources to strengthening its 5AMLD (Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive) compliance protocols in line with the latest guidelines laid down by the FCA, the firm announced.The FCA announced its intention to ban all cryptocurrency derivatives trading in October 2020. By January the ban had gone into effect, and its impact was soon felt as cryptocurrency derivatices exchanges began to close down services for U.K. customers.Wirex co-founder and CEO Pavel Mateev said the FCA had made suggestions on how the firm could update its operational procedures:New U.K. residents who try to sign up will be added to a waiting list for the time being, the firm stated. Wirex claims to have 3.5 million registered users around the world, and offers access to over 150 different currencies, both crypto and fiat, through its app and Mastercard-powered debit card."
636,"London-based cryptocurrency services provider Blockchain.com has raised $300 million in a new investment round that valued the firm at $5.2 billion — up from a $3 billion valuation just one month ago.The investment round was led by DST Global, Lightspeed Venture Partners and VY Capital, and is the crypto industry's third-largest capital raise to date. The sum is equal to that raised in a single round by Bakkt in March 2020, trailing only behind BlockFi's $350 million earlier this year and Bitmain Technologies' $400 million back in 2018.Just one month ago, Blockchain.com raised $120 million at a subsequently reported valuation of $3 billion. The Wall Street Journal notes that while capital raising in the crypto space declined from a total of $4.5 billion in 2018 to $2.7 billion by 2020, this year has already seen three of the si largest-ever capital raises in the industry's history.Blockchain.com plans to use the fresh funds to recruit more employees and support its institutional business. According to CEO Peter Smith:Smith added that if the current Bitcoin (BTC) price boom continues, he expects Blockchain.com's profit for 2021 would hit an all-time high in the “mid-nine digits.” Its business has already reportedly over double since just the start of this year. According to Smith, the company has 31 million verified users across 200 countries and 70 million registered digital wallets. It has meanwhile raised a total of $1.5 billion since its founding back in 2011.Smith also hinted that the company is “carefully considering its public-market options,” with a watchful eye on the outcome of Coinbase's much-anticipated initial public offering, or IPO, later this year. Coinbase had an estimated pre-IPO valuation of around $100 billion by early March and aspires to sell up to 115 million shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange, according to its recent filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission."
637,"Michael Derbin, head of Fidelity Institutional, thinks that many wealth managers and financial advisors still lack the requisite in-depth knowledge when it comes to digital assets.Whereas some wealth managers are by now “sophisticated” and “comfortable” with cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology, he said, many others lag behind. In an interview at Reuters Digital Asset Week, Derbin noted:Fidelity Institutional is a division of Fidelity Investments, whose $9.8 trillion in client assets (as of the end of 2020) make it one of the world's top investment managers. It has also been one of the first to take cryptocurrencies seriously, launching a subsidiary focused on the new asset class back in fall 2018. While the knowledge gap remains among financial managers, Derbin stressed that demand for digital assets among larger investors has increased. Tesla and Bank of New York Mellon are just two of the latest household names to venture into the crypto space, during the course of a historic bull season for Bitcoin (BTC). Over the past year, the top cryptocurrency has soared in value by over seven-fold and was trading as high as $61,200 earlier this month.Back in October 2020, Fidelity Digital Assets published a report forecasting that heightened institutional interest could expand Bitcoin’s market capitalization by hundreds of billions of dollars in the near future, and argued that portfolio managers could significantly increase their returns by allocating a portion of their holdings to Bitcoin."
638,"Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin believes NFTs can be applied to socially relevant causes such as charities and funding public goods, but not while the technology is still viewed as a “casino that largely benefits already-wealthy celebrities.”The author of the Ethereum whitepaper said there was little social value in helping celebrities like Elon Musk add another $1 million to their bank balance by selling NFTs. But he does believe that with support and coordination, non-fungible tokens could have a significant impact on other areas of society.In a blog post titled “The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy,” Buterin said public attention and resources are often allocated to whatever most people perceive to have legitimacy — a game theory term which he defines as:In short, people act in a coordinated fashion if they perceive that everyone else will do the same, and especially if it benefits them personally. The NFT market, which has seen half a billion dollars in volume in the last few months alone, is also swayed by the ever-changing forces of mass public perception.“Which NFTs people find attractive to buy, and which ones they do not, is a question of legitimacy,” said Buterin.“If everyone agrees that one NFT is interesting and another NFT is lame, then people will strongly prefer buying the first, because it would have both higher value for bragging rights and personal pride in holding it, and because it could be resold for more because everyone else is thinking in the same way,” he added.The influence and pull exacted by celebrities such as Elon Musk is potentially enormous. The Tesla CEO has been credited with moving the Bitcoin (BTC) and wider cryptocurrency market on numerous occasions, both positively and negatively. The attention brought to NFTs by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was commendable, said Buterin, referring to the social media chief’s decision to auction off his “first tweet” NFT to charity for $2.9 million.But, if the focus remains on such people then the potential for NFTs to have any real social impact could be lost, claims Ethereum’s co-founder:Buterin suggested two potential ways to help make NFTs more “legitimate” as a method of acting as a funding mechanism for causes which in some way promoted a social good.Buterin said a decentralized autonomous organization could be set up which, with the collective approval of its decentralized governance community, would “sanction” certain NFTs if it was guaranteed that a portion of the sales revenue would be passed on to charitable causes.Another way would be to work with social media platforms to integrate NFT displays into users’ profiles, allowing them to show off the thing they invested their money into. In combination with the first idea, wrote Buterin, this approach could work to “nudge users toward NFTs that contribute to valuable social causes.”"
639,"Bitcoin (BTC) recovered above $56,000 on March 24 after a new ""Elon candle"" put a familiar spring in the step of bulls.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and Tradingview showed BTC/USD gaining 3.3% over several hours during Wednesday on news that Tesla will accept — and keep — payments in Bitcoin.As with the company's initial announcement of a treasury allocation last month, the news immediately translated into spot price gains, as the gloom of this week's price action lifted. Analysts were thus interested in whether Tesla would spark a new phase in Bitcoin's bull market or whether the rally would be confined to lower timeframes.For popular Twitter account Rekt Capital, support lay at $53,000 as before, with resistance potentially kicking in around a zone with $58,000 as its top.""Bitcoin is currently rallying towards the red area, forming a bullish Morning Star candlestick formation from the blue support area,"" comments accompanying a chart showing the two levels read.Previously, Rekt Capital argued that despite recent losses, it was ""too early"" to class Bitcoin as forming a falling wedge pattern. At press time, BTC/USD focused on an area above $56,000 after gains slowed as the resistance area hit. “Tesla's decision to both accept payment for its cars in bitcoin and hold that bitcoin on its balance sheet rather than convert it to dollars will likely build more momentum for the cryptoasset,"" Simon Peters, cryptoasset analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro, added in emailed comments.Others meanwhile pointed to this Friday's upcoming options expiry event, the largest ever. At $6 billion, the expiry event dwarfs the previous record from January, after which Bitcoin increased by 80% in weeks.Tesla CEO and ""Technoking"" Elon Musk, Three Arrows Capital CEO Zhu Su argued, had perfect timing in announcing acceptance just days beforehand.""Elon astutely aware of Bitcoin options expiry dynamics,"" he tweeted.Options expiries tend to exert downward pressure on the Bitcoin price, and a surprise uptick would potentially liquidate a large number of bears. Musk is a well-known fan of such moves, championing the actions of Reddit users during the GameStop debacle earlier this year."
640,"Bitcoin (BTC) shouldn't have a problem reaching $100,000 during the current cycle thanks to impressive behavior from hodlers.In their latest newsletter shared with Cointelegraph Markets, analysts from trading suite Decentrader sought to allay fears that Bitcoin's bull run is running out of steam.Backing their optimism, they said, is data showing that more and more investors are hodling BTC for the long term — one year or more. Taken from the popular ""HODL Wave"" indicator, this suggests that there is less desire to sell Bitcoin at short notice at a certain price, providing a solid foundation for further growth.""The 1Yr+ HODL Wave suggests that Bitcoin should comfortably reach the $100,000 level during this cycle,"" Decentrader summarized.HODL Waves tracks the proportion of the existing Bitcoin according to when it was last used in a transaction. Previously, Cointelegraph noted that those who bought BTC during the 2017 bull run had largely held onto their position despite realizing significant gains.As Cointelegraph reported on Monday, roughly 36% of the circulating Bitcoin supply is currently made up of ""younger"" coins which have moved at some point in the past six months.Exchange data further reinforces the pro-hodl mindset among investors, as overall reserves continue to plummet in March despite BTC/USD making a new all-time high.Even miners appear to be increasingly interested in keeping their BTC rewards, as evidenced by figures from on-chain analytics service Glassnode showing net miner positions turning positive this month. Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, described their behavior as ""onlyrational.""""Strong holders are increasing their positions. Another sharp increase of #Bitcoin in the illiquid wallets,"" quant analyst Lex Moskovski commented on another Glassnode chart. Elon Musk, CEO and ""Technoking"" of Tesla, became the most recent high-profile hodler when he announced on Wednesday that the carmaker would offer products for BTC and not convert the revenue to fiat.According to Bitcointreasuries.org, Tesla currently holds an estimated 48,000 BTC, a number that should grow as people exchange their Bitcoin for the company's electric vehicles.

The electric car company’s CEO and “Technoking” said the firm would operate Bitcoin nodes directly, and would hold on to the Bitcoin it accumulates without converting it to fiat.You can now buy a Tesla with BitcoinTesla first signaled its intention to start accepting Bitcoin for products in early February, following its purchase of $1.5 billion worth of the digital asset, an SEC filing showed. The option to buy a Tesla using BTC will only be extended to U.S-based customers for the time being.Elon Musk’s insistence that the Bitcoin earned through the sale of the firm’s vehicles won’t be converted to fiat suggests it is not just being utilized as a transactional medium, but also an investment tool.Tesla is using only internal & open source software & operates Bitcoin nodes directly.

Bitcoin paid to Tesla will be retained as Bitcoin, not converted to fiat currency.By running its own dedicated Bitcoin nodes, Tesla will join a global network of peer-to-peer operators who host and synchronize the Bitcoin blockchain.Visitors to Tesla's website from a U.S.-based IP address will now see a new Bitcoin payment widget added to the site's checkout options. The impact of Tesla's acceptance of Bitcoin may have been felt on the cryptocurrency market early on Wednesday. Coinciding with the breaking of the news, the dollar value of Bitcoin jumped 2.9% from $54,056 to $55,630.Tesla's Bitcoin terms and conditions do state that Bitcoin is the only digital asset that Tesla accepts as payment for its products at this time. ""You may not make purchases with us using any other digital asset, including Bitcoin fork products, such as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV. Our Bitcoin digital wallet is not configured to detect or receive digital assets other than Bitcoin,"" state the terms."
642,"On March 23 bears managed to push the price of Bitcoin (BTC) below the $54,000 support level as various on-chain data suggests that whale wallets have begun slowing down purchases and are transferring the risk to retail investors. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that the downtrend that began on March 22 and continued into Tuesday s the price retested the $54,000 support level for the second time this week.Data from Coinshares indicates that BTC remains the chosen asset for institutional investors while the sector as a whole continues to see significant growth as $57 billion in assets is currently being managed by institutions.While inexperienced traders and those new to the cryptocurrency space might view the recent downturn as a sign of a bearish reversal, Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe sees the pullback as a bullish development for Bitcoin.To me, this looks like a healthy correction for #Bitcoin.

As long as $49-51K holds, I'm assuming we'll see continuation towards $68K.

Still expecting a massive surge on #altcoins to happen from April onwards. pic.twitter.com/WxaYQZ7IrEData from CryptoQuant, an on-chain data provider, shows that a total of 14,600 BTC left Coinbase in the early hours of March 23. Traders typically view BTC outflows as a bullish development since the perception of a supply shortage is a popular bullish narrative among crypto pundits.While there is no way to confirm that the outflows were the result of whale accumulations, analysis from Whalemap shows that there has been heavy accumulation at the $55,000 level, but the researchers cautioned that should the current support level fail, the next strong support level is found at $47,438.The analysts at Jarvis Labs took a slightly different viewpoint and suggested that traders look at more than just the general exchange flows to understand BTC's day-to-day movements.According to Jarvis Labs co-founder Ben Lilly, “it's important to see what wallet is active within the general flows.""Jarvis Labs tracks one wallet which they refer to as ""Pablo"" and analysis shows that the wallet has historically been tied to bearish price action in Bitcoin price.  The last time Pablo moved BTC occurred during the sharp market correction in late February.More recently, the Jarvis team noted that Pablo began shuffling around 15,000 BTC on March 4, indicating that a potential price dump was ahead. The dump came on March 14 as Bitcoin climbed above $60,000 and looked to make a run for a new all-time high.Lilly said:Despite Bitcoin's bearish price action, a handful of altcoins were able rallly to new highs. As reported by Cointelegraph, the 'Coinbase effect' boosted Ankr (ANKR), Curve DAO Token (CRV) and Storj (STORJ) price from 50% to 100% and trading is expected to commence on Coinbase Pro starting on March 25.Theta (THETA) and Theta Fuel (TFUEL) also continued their relentless climb higher on Tuesday after it was revealed that Sierra Ventures, Heuristic Capital, The VR Fund and GFR Fund had “staked more than $100M in THETA to a collective Enterprise Validator Node.”Following the announcement, Theta surged 40% to a new all-time high of $14.21 and TFUEL rallied 30% to a new record high of $0.53.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.69 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 59.8%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

643,"Bitcoin's (BTC) upcoming March 26 options expiry might become the largest ever, with $6.1 billion open interest on the line. With less than 4 days ahead of the settlement date, pro investors will have already set up strategies for the next month.As BTC price has already surged 72.7% since February, most traders are skeptical of another rally taking place over the next couple of weeks. Nevertheless, the $55,000 support has shown strength and is a signal that the uptrend is intact.Whales and arbitrage desks are somehow optimistic, as reflected by the futures contracts premium and top traders' long-to-short ratio. The excitement seems more restrained as opposed to mid-March, when the futures premium reached 35% annualized.Options strategies provide excellent opportunities for traders who have a fixed-range target for an asset. Using leveraged futures contracts also allows traders to leverage the position, although the stop loss decreases the trade's viability.On the other hand, a trader can create a slightly bullish strategy using multiple put (sell) options. The front spread with puts allows gains with no upfront cost other than the margin requirements for a negative price swing. The same pattern can be used in both bullish and bearish circumstances, depending on the investor's expectations.It's important to remember that options have a set expiry date; therefore, the price increase must happen during the defined period.The Bitcoin calendar options below are for the April 30 expiry, but this strategy can also be used on Ether (ETH) options or a different time frame. Although the costs will vary, its general efficiency should not be affected.The suggested slightly bullish strategy consists of buying 0.9 BTC worth of $76,000 put options while simultaneously selling 2.05 of $64,000 puts. To finalize the trade, one should buy 1.31 BTC worth of $48,000 put options.It is worth noting that derivatives exchanges price these contracts in BTC terms. Thus, the displayed profit and loss above are shown in satoshis (1/100,000,000 BTC) at the expiry date.While this put option gives the buyer the right to sell an asset at a predetermined price, the contract seller is committing to buy it. Therefore, put options can also be used for neutral-to-bullish strategies.As the estimate above shows, any outcome between $54,600 (down 4.3% from the current $57,050) and $76,000 (up 33.2%) yields a net gain. For example, a 10% price increase to $62,750 results in a $9,350 net gain, or BTC 0.149. Meanwhile, this strategy's maximum loss is $7,600 if BTC trades at $48,000 (down 15.9%) on April 30.This front spread with put options produces a potential $10,770 gain at $64,000, which is 2.85x more than the loss if BTC price drops 10% to $51,350 on the expiry date.The multiple options strategy trade provides a better risk-reward for bullish traders seeking exposure to BTC's price increase. Moreover, there is no upfront fee apart from the 0.157 BTC margin requirements to cover potential losses.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

644,"CNBC host Jim Cramer has revealed he made ""a ton of money"" on Bitcoin (BTC) but gold ""let him down.""In an episode of the Pomp Podcast released March 22, Cramer thanked host Anthony Pompliano for inspiring him to invest $500,000 in BTC.""Here's what's going on: you made me a ton of money,"" he began.Cramer is well known as a mainstream media finance pundit, and is also familiar to Bitcoiners after a previous Pomp Podcast appearance in September 2020. His latest outing, however, puts him in pole position among CNBC presenters when it comes to being bullish on Bitcoin.Continuing, he said that unlike with his experience with buying gold and stocks, Bitcoin actually delivered.""It happened just as you said,"" he told Pompliano. Turning to gold, Cramer updated advice that he claimed to have espoused for almost 30 years. Instead of allocating 10% of one's portfolio to the precious metal, he revealed for the first time that this should now be 5% gold and 5% Bitcoin.""When I got not schooled but taught by Pomp, I said, 'What am I doing not protecting myself in what I've been saying to people could be hyperinflation?'"" he recalled.While he did not state exactly how much money he had made from his initial investment of around $500,000, the timing suggests that his stash is now worth approximately $2.4 million.Earlier this week, even Fed Chair Jerome Powell described Bitcoin as a ""substitute for gold"" while stating that it did not challenge the U.S. dollar.Cramer is still a somewhat small-volume hodler compared to many Bitcoin investors who entered at much lower prices. As Cointelegraph reported, however, these whales have become increasingly weak-handed in recent times, selling into every major price rise this year. The results continue to be seen in the form of spurts and lengthy consolidations for BTC/USD, a pattern which itself has sparked familiar accusations of volatility and unreliability from naysayers.Proponents nonetheless cite on-chain data as evidence that the upside is not yet over, with popular estimates for the average price in 2021 running as high as $288,000.If nothing else, that would make Cramer's hoard worth around $12 million."
645,"Bitcoin’s price has seen massive gains in recent months, accelerating from $11,000 to nearly $62,000. However, such impressive rallies also include relatively calm periods of price action.These periods are consolidative and are needed for the market to find a new floor. In bull markets, bullish continuation is likely after these periods of ranging before another leg up can happen. Currently, Bitcoin’s (BTC) price seems to be in such a period just over a week after hitting all-time highs above $61,000. The four-hour chart for BTC/USD shows a clear downtrend since its recent all-time high in mid-March. This happened after a breakthrough past $58,000. However, this move showed weakness, as there wasn’t any sign of new buyers stepping in for more upside.In other words, a bullish strength would be demonstrated with an increase in volume, which didn’t happen. Therefore, a correction back to $50,000 is a very normal, healthy occurrence for this market.Moreover, the chart shows a short-term downtrend in which lower highs and lower lows are being constructed. In this regard, Bitcoin’s price landed in the $53,000 support zone, which can be classified as the critical support zone to hold.If this $53,000 support doesn’t hold, a further correction toward $49,000 to $50,800 is inevitable, and the markets are going to see more blood.On the other hand, if the $53,000 area holds, Bitcoin’s price has to break through the $56,200 area to generate strength once again. In that regard, the $56,200 area can be considered the critical resistance zone to break at the moment.Nevertheless, even if $56,200 breaks, there are still other resistances remaining overhead before Bitcoin’s price can aim for new all-time highs.The daily chart for Bitcoin shows an apparent bullish cycle that’s constantly making higher highs and higher lows. Traders and investors should always zoom out to avoid any confusion regarding the overall trend. Simply put, the price action of Bitcoin is still bullish.Therefore, a correction to the $50,000 area would still be very normal, if not expected, as the $50,000 area is a massive support zone.Even if Bitcoin’s price corrects further to the $44,000 area, the bullish construction is still valid, as these sideways ranges have been happening quite often since breaking the 2017 all-time high.As long as Bitcoin stays above $44,000, and preferably $50,000, the bearish divergence will become invalid, as history has shown multiple examples of this.The chart construction after the halving of May 2020 looks identical to the recent price action of Bitcoin. In that sense, a failed breakout doesn’t guarantee that a bear market is imminent.Bulls should be patient, as a new floor may be established for Bitcoin’s price. After this compression and construction, a new impulse wave can happen once again, as seen in August 2020. In that period, Bitcoin’s price accelerated from $9,500 to $12,000.The chart above shows the invalidation of the bearish divergence, as new lower lows did not occur. The current price action could be painting a similar picture, in which a bottom has to be made between $44,000 and $50,000 to avoid new lower lows. If that happens, Bitcoin’s price will invalidate the bearish divergences and the bull market will continue.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

646,"The South Korean branch of global cryptocurrency exchange OKEx is shutting down operations next month, OKEx Korea officially announced Tuesday.Users will have to withdraw their Korean won and crypto holdings by April 7. After that date, the exchange “will not be held liable for any losses arising from failure to withdrawal by the customer,” OKEx Korea stated.OKEx Korea will accept withdrawal applications on a 24/7 basis until 6:00 p.m. local time on April 7. Requests for withdrawals will not be honored if they are less than a predetermined minimum amount.The announcement comes shortly after OKEx Korea temporarily halted withdrawals on March 15 due to maintenance issues.The company did not specify its reason for closing in the announcement. OKEx Korea did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.The abrupt closure of OKEx Korea comes ahead of a new regulatory regime for cryptocurrencies and related service providers that will enter into force on March 25. According to the Act on Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Transactions, local virtual asset business operators like crypto exchanges will be required to report user info to the Financial Intelligence Unit under the Financial Services Commission.VASPs will have to set up real-name verification for deposits and withdrawals with an approved South Korean bank. In order to report, each local VASP must apply for certification with the Information Security Management System.The South Korean branch of the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, also shut operations in the country in early 2021. The company attributed the move to declining liquidity and low trading volumes of its major trading pairs.According to data from CoinMarketCap, OKEx Korea’s daily trading volume amounts to $1.8 million at publishing time, compared to $6 billion on the global exchange."
647,"Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to its lowest in two weeks on March 23 amid fears that bulls were running out of appetite to buy.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and Tradingview showed BTC/USD hitting local lows of $53,125 on Bitstamp overnight.The latest hit to the 2021 bull run this month, Tuesday’s dip brought the prospect of a $50,000 test ever closer, with buyer support on exchanges looking increasingly shaky.Data from Binance’s orderbook confirmed support at $53,000, but should this crumble, only definitive demand at $46,000 remains to halt the retracement.“Expecting the previous lows in BTC to be taken out before we can see a significant bounce,” trader Crypto Ed summarized, forecasting an upcoming move below $53,000.“This bull-run isn't over yet. I'm ready to buy the dip,” Ki Young Ju, CEO of on-chain analytics service CryptoQuant, argued, striking a more upbeat tone.Ki referred to high selling pressure on spot exchanges keeping upside in check, but was representative of the broader mood among traders on the day, who overwhelmingly classed recent price action as a standard consolidatory move rather than capitulation.In their favor was hodler behavior, which saw more BTC taken off exchanges in recent days than at any point in the past six weeks.As Cointelegraph reported, however, other on-chain metrics suggest that Bitcoin could be at least half way through its latest bull run, with only the top formation segment left.Not every trader was meanwhile prepared for the extent of the overnight drop, as demonstrated by the $1.38 billion in liquidated longs over the past 24 hours out of $1.7 billion in total.2021 has become notorious for those betting on price direction across cryptocurrencies, with leveraged traders in particular contributing to a huge amount in liquidiations, data from Bybt confirms."
648,"The privacy-centric web browser Brave will soon integrate a dedicated Binance Smart Chain, or BSC, wallet, according to a recent announcement. This allows the browser’s users to open up to BSC’s ecosystem of decentralized finance, or DeFi, products.Although Brave can already be configured to jump onto BSC manually, the addition of a preconfigured wallet is expected to simplify the process, requiring no special apps, wallets or additional tinkering.In the meantime, the token at the center of the Brave browser, Basic Attention Token (BAT), has been made compatible with BSC in the form of Wrapped BAT (WBAT). Wrapping is the process where a blockchain ecosystem uses special tokens to facilitate the compatibility of different assets on another blockchain ecosystem. The most common example may be Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, where Bitcoin uses these tokens to be compatible with the processes of Ethereum, expanding its use.“Our hope is that BAT and Brave will take crypto mainstream and to make DeFi user-friendly for the mass market,” said the CEO and co-founder of Brave, Brendan Eich.Brave reportedly has over 25 million active monthly users, and over 7 million daily active users. The browser emerged as an alternative to mainstream browsers by offering increased privacy, less tracking and the ability to opt-in to the advertisements of a user’s choosing.BSC ecosystem coordinator Xiaoguang Zhang echoed Eich’s sentiments that the integration of BSC into Brave would further inspire DeFi and crypto adoption.“With this strategic integration between the Brave browser and Binance Smart Chain, we will introduce seamless UX together for crypto users to access DeFi and Dapps in BSC and other blockchains, which will dramatically inspire mass adoption and inclusive finance,” said Zhang.Like many altcoins, the value of BAT surged to a new all-time high in 2021. Between January and March alone, BAT gained 515% against the U.S dollar, climbing from around $0.20 to $1.27 by the time of publication."
649,"Prominent Indian entrepreneur and government advisor Nandan Nilekani has spoken in favor of cryptocurrencies as the government reportedly mulls a ban on private digital assets. Nilekani joined a Clubhouse session with angel investor Balaji Srinivasan to discuss the state of crypto in India, local business news publication Moneycontrol reported Monday. Nilekani is a co-founder of major Indian tech company Infosys and the founding architect of the national biometric ID system, Aadhaar. He is also the chairman of a special Indian committee assessing digital payments in India and an advisor to several government agencies and the Reserve Bank of India.During the session, Nilekani stood up for the freedom to use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) in the country, arguing that Indians should be allowed to have crypto as an asset class. The billionaire entrepreneur reportedly noted crypto's use as a store of value, outlining its promising potential:Nilekani said that Indian regulators need to help the country’s micro, small and medium enterprises access capital through crypto.Regarding stablecoins and the digital rupee, he said, “I am not sure we need a private stable coin or if a digital rupee will be good enough. We need to look at how it will help Indians, how MSMEs can access capital using bitcoins. No amount of tech is going to sway anyone’s view.” Nilekani’s remarks come amid increasing uncertainty and doubt in India regarding the legal status of crypto. Anonymous sources reportedly representing Indian government officials have been disseminating reports on an upcoming crypto ban since early 2021.However, Indian Minister of Finance Nirmala Sitharaman has claimed multiple times that the ministry does not plan to prohibit Indians from using Bitcoin.

650,"Analytics provider Glassnode is reporting that current on-chain indicators suggest the Bitcoin bull market may be entering into its later stages.In its March 22 Week on Chain report, on-chain analytics provider Glassnode noted a decline in the number of Bitcoin whales despite consistent accumulation from wallets holding 1 BTC or less since March 2018.Whale addresses holding over 100 BTC have been relatively flat by comparison, with the group currently holding 62.6% of the supply — an increase of just 0.87% over the past 12 months.Drawing on its “Reserve Risk” metric — which is used to assess the confidence of long-term holders relative to the price of Bitcoin, Glassnode asserts a BTC “wealth transfer” from long-term holders to new buyers is currently ongoing.The report stated that bull markets generally follow a similar wealth transfer path over three distinct phases, which can be used to estimate what stage the current cycle is in. Peak hodl phases are inflection points where the largest proportion of long-term holder, or LTH, owned coins are in profit.Glassnode is not alone in speculating the end of the bull season may be looming, with Chinese mining pool BTC.TOP CEO Jiang Zhuoer speculating the bull market could be over as soon as September. Speaking to local media on March 21, he cited a general economic recovery amid COVID-19 vaccine rollouts and a likely waning interest in crypto assets should the recent trend of large corporations such as Tesla and MicroStrategy adding Bitcoin to their treasury reserves cease to continue as likely catalysts for a market reversal.Investment manager Timothy Peterson also noted the recent decline in whales, stating: “such moves are often but not always associated with bear markets.” Peterson speculated that Bitcoin’s price could drop as low as $25,000."
651,"According to digital asset investment manager CoinShares, institutional demand in the United States has declined slightly, while European funds are still buying.According to Coinshares’ Monday ""Fund Flows Weekly"" report, combined flows into institutional crypto products totaled $99 million for the week ending March 20.The data indicates a significant decline in institutional demand, with inflows down 59% from the previous week, which recorded $242 million.However, the researchers noted that the assets under management figure for the top institutional investment products reached a record high of $57 billion.The report added that  while demand has declined in the U.S., institutions located in Europe and Canada continued buying last week.Daily volumes for Bitcoin (BTC)-related products have also declined by around 35% to $713 million per day versus $1.1 billion per day on average for 2021. However, trading volumes remain steady at $11.8 billion per day.Following strong Ether (ETH) inflows in February, institutions appear to have again set their sights on Bitcoin, with $85 million entering BTC funds compared with just $8 million for ETH-based products last week.

652,"Bitcoin (BTC) bulls faced strong headwinds on March 22 that quickly dampened any attempt at a breakout above the $58,000 level despite comments from United States Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell which called the top cryptocurrency a “substitute for gold.”Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView show that traders made several attempts to push BTC above $58,000 over the past two days only to be rejected, with Monday’s failure resulting in a pullback to the $54,000 support level.On-chain analysis shows that while BTC price struggles to climb back above $60,000, whale wallets have been in accumulation mode over the past 30 days indicating that some of the wealthiest Bitcoin holders still see more upside for the current bull market.The macro picture for the cryptocurrency sector continues to improve as the globally recognized TIME magazine revealed that it is looking for a CFO who is comfortable with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as the publication has begun exploring the creation of one-of-a-kind non-fungible tokens based on some of its most iconic covers.Now that blockchain technology has evolved to the point where it can handle processes like video and music streaming, platforms with a first-mover advantage in those sectors have seen their prices breakout over the past few months as mainstream audiences are increasingly exposed to the cryptocurrency ecosystem.Theta (THETA) and Theta Fuel (TFUEL) have taken the lead when it comes to blockchain-based video streaming with the dual token system enjoying astronomical growth in 2021 that continues to push its price to new all-time highs.Audius (AUDIO), a music streaming platform, has also rallied strongly over the past month as its price increased from $0.356 on Feb. 28 to a new all-time high at $2.05 on March 16.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for AUDIO on March 1, prior to the recent price rise.The VORTECS™ score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ score for AUDIO was in the green late in February and hit a high of 68 on March 1, roughly 24-hours before the price began to increase by 400% over the next two weeks.Following the price peak on March 16, AUDIO price and its VORTECS™ score experienced a pullback that lasted several days. The VORTECS™ score then turned green again and reached a high of 71 on March 20, roughly 15 hours before its recent price rise.Other notable altcoin performances on March 22 include Augur (REP), which has seen its price increase 30% to a multi-year high of $39.30, and XRP, which spiked 20% to an intraday high at $0.60 as members of the XRP army look to get the token relisted on exchanges that suspended services in response to th actions from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.746 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 59.8%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

653,"Futures contracts trading has grown immensely over the past year, and proof of this comes from the total rise in open interest. Open interest is the total number of outstanding contracts, and the figure has risen from $3.9 billion to the current $21.5 billion in six months, a 450% increase.Sometimes traders assume that a high or low funding rate and soaring open interest indicate a bullish market, but as Cointelegraph has explained before, this is not the case. This article will take a quick look at the funding rate and how traders interpret the metric when trading perpetual futures contracts.Perpetual contracts have an embedded rate usually charged every eight hours to ensure there are no exchange risk imbalances. Even though both buyers' and sellers' open interest is matched at all times, their leverage can vary.When longs are demanding more leverage, they will be the ones paying the fee. Therefore, this situation is interpreted as bullish. The opposite holds when shorts are using more leverage, thus causing a negative funding rate.Whenever traders use high levels of leverage, analysts point to the risks of cascading liquidations. Although this holds true, this situation can unfold for weeks, and sometimes deleverage happens by itself. Therefore, such an indicator should not be used to predict local tops, as data will show.Bull markets usually cause positive funding rates when buyers get overly excited. Still, this situation creates a perfect storm for short-sellers, as a 5% price correction will forcefully liquidate longs using 20x leverage. These orders could pressure the price, causing a 10% drop and subsequently trigger a cascade of liquidations.For this reason, pundits and analysts often pinpoint excessive funding rates as the leading cause for cascading liquidations when the market turns red, even though the funding rate can remain unusually high during bull runs.Take notice of how the funding rate was at 0.15% and higher per eight-hour session during February when a local top was not formed. This rate is equivalent to 3.2% per week and is somewhat burdensome for traders holding long positions. Thus, trying to time market peaks using this metric will seldomly yield good results.On the other hand, BTC price bottoms on Jan. 27 and Feb. 28 took place in periods when the funding rate was low. These moments show traders were unwilling to leverage longs, and it proves that there is a lack of confidence on their part.While this indicator might help determine whether a local bottom was formed, it certainly should not be used by itself, as the funding rate will usually dissipate after any strong price correction.Moreover, sustained periods of high funding will attract arbitrage traders who will sell the perpetual futures while simultaneously buying the monthly contracts. Therefore, this metric should be used carefully.To confirm investors' distrust in opening longs, one should monitor the monthly contracts premium, known as ""basis."" Unlike the perpetual contract, those fixed-calendar futures do not have a funding rate. Therefore their price will vastly differ from regular spot exchanges.By measuring the expense gap between futures and the regular spot market, a trader can gauge the level of bullishness in the market. Whenever there's excessive buyers optimism, the three-month futures contract will trade at a 20% or higher annualized premium (basis).On the other hand, when the indicator marks a local bottom, it usually means that traders' confidence is gaining momentum. Therefore, in a scenario where the perpetual contracts funding rate is low, there is a better 'confirmation' from buyers who deploy low leverage use.By combining the perpetual contracts funding rate with the monthly contract basis, a trader will have a better read of market sentiment. Similar to the popular ""fear and greed"" indicator, traders should be buying when others show disbelief.This scenario will usually occur when the funding rate is below 0.05% per eight hours and the three-month futures basis bottoms, as indicated on the above chart.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

654,"The Turkish lira lost 15% of its value and dipped close to its all-time low after Turkey's President Erdogan fired central bank governor Naci Agbal. This resulted in a massive spike in Bitcoin (BTC) searches in Turkey as investors sought to protect their wealth from devaluation. This is just another example that shows how investors may be treating Bitcoin as a possible substitute for fiat currencies.In other news, United States Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell has a different view. While speaking at an event hosted by the Bank for International Settlements, Powell said that Bitcoin is more of a speculative asset and could act as a substitute for gold but its volatility and decentralization make it difficult to use as money.However, on-chain data paints a different picture. Glassnode data shows that only about 36% of Bitcoin’s supply has moved in the past six months, indicating that the current price has not tempted long-term Bitcoin investors to part with their holdings.With supply shrinking and demand increasing due to the arrival of institutional investors, Bitcoin remains in a sweet spot. Demand for BTC could receive an additional boost if any of the recently submitted Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications are approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.The fundamental sentiment remains positive for the crypto sector but do the technicals also project a bullish picture? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin has formed a pennant pattern which is usually a setup for continuation. The bulls continue to buy the dip to the 20-day exponential moving average ($55,470) as seen from the long tail on the March 21 candlestick but the buyers are struggling to sustain at the higher levels.If the price turns up from the current level and rises above the pennant, it could signal the resumption of the uptrend. The all-time high at $61,825.84 may offer resistance but if the bulls can overcome it the BTC/USD pair could rally to $72,112 and then to $74,512..The moving averages are sloping up marginally and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive territory, indicating that bulls hold a slight edge.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the pennant, it will invalidate the bullish setup, which could result in a quick drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($49,981) as the short-term traders hurry to close their positions.Ether (ETH) has been holding above the 20-day EMA ($1,764) for the past few days, but the failure of the bulls to achieve a strong rebound off this level suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.If the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA ($1,716), the ETH/USD pair could drop to $1,500. Such a move will suggest that the pair may remain range-bound between $1,289 and $2,040 for a few more days.On the contrary, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the $1,942 to $2,040 overhead resistance zone, the pair may start the next leg of the uptrend that could reach $2,614.Binance Coin (BNB) formed a Doji candlestick pattern for the past three days, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. But the only positive sign was that the price did not dip below the 20-day EMA ($255).The bulls are currently trying to expand the volatility by pushing the price above the $280 overhead resistance. If they manage to do that, the BNB/USD pair could rally to $309. A breakout and close above this resistance will complete an ascending triangle pattern that has a target objective at $429.The gradually upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 56 suggest a minor advantage to the bulls. However, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance and slides below the trendline of the triangle, it will invalidate the bullish setup. That could pull the price down to $189.Cardano (ADA) broke and closed below the $1.23 support on March 20, which suggests a lack of demand. The bulls are attempting to defend the 20-day EMA ($1.16) but the lack of a strong rebound off it increases the likelihood of a break below it.If that happens, the ADA/USD pair could drop to $1.03, which is a critical support to watch out for because the 50-day SMA ($0.99) is also just below it. If the price rebounds off this level, the pair could extend its range-bound action for a few more days.The flat 20-day EMA and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. The next trending move could start on a break above $1.48 or a break below $1.03.Polkadot (DOT) broke above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle on March 20 but the long wick on the candlestick suggests the bears are selling on rallies. However, the bulls held the 20-day EMA ($35.74) on March 21 and will now again attempt to push the price above the triangle.If they manage to do that, the DOT/USD pair could retest the all-time high and if that level is conquered, the uptrend could reach the pattern target at $55. The RSI has risen above the downtrend line and the moving averages are gradually sloping up, which shows the momentum is turning in favor of the bulls.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level or the $40 to $42.28 overhead resistance zone, the bears will try to sink the pair below the support line of the triangle. If they succeed, the pair could start a deeper correction.XRP has shown signs of life after a long time. The altcoin soared above the $0.50 resistance on March 20, which shows the bulls have overpowered the bears. The bears tried to sink the price back below $0.50 on March 21 but failed.This has attracted further buying today, which has pushed the XRP/USD pair towards the overhead resistance at $0.65. If the bulls can drive the price above this level, the pair is likely to pick up momentum and rally to $0.78 and then to $1.The moving averages have turned up and the RSI has risen close to the overbought territory, indicating the bulls are in command. This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages.Uniswap (UNI) is currently consolidating in an uptrend. The bulls attempted to thrust the price above the overhead resistance at $35.20 on March 20 but did not succeed. However, a positive is that the buyers did not allow the price to even dip to the 20-day EMA ($30.48).This suggests the bulls are buying on every minor dip. They are likely to make one more attempt to ascend the $35.20 resistance. If they manage to do that, the UNI/USD pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $42.43 and then $46.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 64 also indicate an advantage to the bulls. This positive view will invalidate if the price again turns down from $35.20 and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days.Litecoin (LTC) broke and closed below the 20-day EMA ($198.52) on March 21. The bears have continued their selling today and are attempting to sink the price below the 50-day SMA ($190.85).If they succeed, the price could drop to the trendline of the triangle. This is an important support to keep an eye on because if it breaks, the LTC/USD pair could drop to $152.94 and then $120.On the other hand, if the price rises from the current levels, the bulls will try to push it to the resistance line of the triangle. A breakout and close above the triangle could result in a retest of $246.96 and then $300.Chainlink (LINK) continues to trade inside the ascending triangle but the bulls are struggling to push the price above the $32 overhead resistance. The long wick on the March 20 candlestick shows the bears are defending this resistance aggressively.However, a minor positive is that the bulls are not allowing the price to break below the moving averages. This suggests the bulls are accumulating at lower levels. This period of indecision is unlikely to continue for long.If the price turns up and breaks above $32, the ascending triangle will complete and that has a pattern target at $43.20. Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the trendline of the triangle, the bullish setup will invalidate. That could pull the price down to $24 and then to $20.1111.The strong up-move of the past few days has propelled THETA into the top-10 ranking cryptocurrencies by market capitalization after Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was nudged from its spot. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI has risen above 86 indicating the bulls are in command.The first target objective on the upside is a rally to $11.54 where the bears may mount a stiff resistance. However, if the momentum can push the price above $11.54, the THETA/USD pair could rally to $13.19.It is important to note that vertical rallies usually do not have longevity. Therefore, the pair could enter a few days of consolidation or a minor correction to digest the recent gains.A shallow correction or a tight consolidation will suggest the trend remains strong and it will enhance the prospects of the uptrend resuming. A sharp correction, breaking below the $8 support may indicate the bears could be making a comeback.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

655,"While Bitcoin (BTC) is too volatile to be money and is ""backed by nothing,"" it could be a ""substitute for gold,"" said the chair of the United States Federal Reserve.Speaking at an event hosted by the Bank for International Settlements, or BIS, on Monday, Jerome Powell delivered frank comments in response to a question on cryptocurrency.When asked whether he thought Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies posed a threat to financial stability, Powell wheeled out familiar arguments that have long come from legacy finance figures.""Crypto assets — we call them 'crypto assets' — they're highly volatile — see Bitcoin — and therefore not really useful as a store of value, and they're not backed by anything,"" he said.Powell's words provide some of the most direct Fed opinions on Bitcoin to go public in recent times and build on a perspective offered in 2019. They also come weeks after incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen made clear her misgivings about decentralized cryptocurrencies.As with Yellen, Powell appeared to spark a burst of negative market sentiment, with BTC/USD dropping almost $1,000 following his response.For all their disagreements, however, both Powell and Bitcoin's biggest proponents thus agree on the cryptocurrency's status as a new form of gold.The verdict could hit home hard for gold bugs hostile to Bitcoin, notably Peter Schiff, who continues to claim that fate is on his side when it comes to generational stores of value.Together with BIS general manager Augustin Carstens and Jens Weidmann, president of the German Federal Bank, Powell also looked at stablecoins as they relate to the ongoing trend of central bank digital currencies, CBDCs.Here, the talk was less unsual, with the speakers repeating known stances involving the separation of private stablecoins and bank-operated CBDCs. ""To the extent a stablecoin is backed by sovereign currencies of leading nations, that's certainly an improvement over crypto assets, I would say,"" Powell continued.Fiat currencies, he said, are ""issued with the benefit of the public in mind,"" while emphasizing that stablecoins will not serve as the basis for the global financial system in the future."
656,"Major South Korean internet company Naver has reportedly begun negotiations to acquire a stake in the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Bithumb.Naver has discussed a potential equity stake acquisition with major Bithumb stakeholder Vidente, local publication the Maeil Business Newspaper reported Monday, citing several unnamed sources.Naver is the provider of South Korea’s largest search engine and Line messenger, and is reportedly seeking to expand its platform’s presence in the country’s fintech market. The internet giant is reportedly planning to add Bitcoin (BTC) as a payment option on its payment services Naver Pay as well as Line Pay in Japan and the United States.As reported, there are at least 10 firms seeking a stake in Bithumb including major U.S. investment banks like Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, payment giant Visa, as well as the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance. According to a report by The Korea Times, Deutsche Bank is also among potential investors.Bithumb has been the subject of multiple reports and rumors regarding a potential acquisition deal over the past several years. The South Korean crypto giant has reportedly been negotiating the sale with foreign companies since at least 2019, following alleged difficulties with payments in Bithumb’s previous acquisition deals. Gaming conglomerate Nexon denied reports that it was acquiring a stake in the exchange.Naver did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment."
657,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating between the $55,000 to $59,000 range, establishing the mid-$50,000 region as a support area. This trend coincides with strengthening on-chain fundamentals, such as whale and address activity.Since the Bitcoin rally began to accelerate in November 2020, the seven-day average active address has increased in tandem. A pseudonymous trader known as ""Crypto Birb"" pointed out:It shows that on-chain trends have been supplementing both short and long-term Bitcoin price cycles.According to the data from Santiment, big Bitcoin whales have been mostly accumulating Bitcoin as over 35,000 BTC has left exchanges in the past 30 days. The latest outflows have also pushed down exchanges' BTC reserves to the lowest levels since early March before BTC hit new all-time highs above $60,000. The Santiment team wrote:The chart shows that 1,000 BTC to 10,000 BTC addresses have been selling, but analysts from Whalemap said that this range is a difficult range to analyze.This range could include exchange addresses, which are not tagged by most on-chain data gathering platforms, so ideally, it would be more accurate to compare 100 BTC to 1,000 BTC, and then 10,000+ BTC holding addresses.Whalemap analysts told Cointelegraph:Additionally, researchers at Glassnode found that during bull markets, old coins move more frequently.As long-time holders move to sell, it puts significant selling pressure on Bitcoin. However, in the current phase of the cycle, the frequency of old BTC moving is much lower than 50%, or where BTC topped out in previous cycles.Glassnode researchers explained:Considering that big whales have been accumulating Bitcoin as the cryptocurrency consolidates between $55,000 and $59,000, the bull trend remains intact despite the rising U.S. 10-year Treasury yields.As Cointelegraph reported, when the 10-year Treasury yield begins rising, the risk-on markets typically take a hit, particularly in the near term.In the past two weeks, as an example, U.S. tech stocks saw a steep pullback, which coincided with Bitcoin stagnating under $60,000.However, given that on-chain data remains optimistic for Bitcoin, as long as the $55,000 support area remains defended, the bullish market structure would raise the probability of a larger rally."
658,"Google searches for Bitcoin (BTC) emanating from Turkey exploded in the past 24 hours, after the value of the Turkish lira dropped 14% following the firing of a central bank governor.According to data from Google Trends, the number of searches for Bitcoin spiked 566% in the hours immediately following news of the lira’s demise.The lira’s value dropped 14% in a flash dip after Turkey's President Erdogan fired the governor of the country’s central bank. Former governor Naci Agbal had been credited with pulling the lira out of historic lows, partly by raising interest rates to fight inflation. His abrupt removal was said to have shocked domestic and foreign investors, reports BBC News.The Turkish lira regained a fifth of its value against the U.S. dollar since the beginning of 2021 alone. The recent 14% plunge was triggered by concerns that the progress made by Naci Agbal could be undone by the appointment of the new governor, Şahap Kavcıoğlu, a banker and politician who is said to oppose the use of high interest rates to fight inflation.The uptick in the number of Bitcoin searches by Turkish citizens is an all-time high to date, representing almost double the number of searches recorded during the bull run of 2017–2018.It’s not just Turkish citizens who are taking a refreshed look at cryptocurrencies. At the beginning of March, Turkey’s Ministry of Treasury and Finance announced that it would work with the central bank in conjunction with regulatory bodies in order to lay down clear guidelines concerning the use of crypto.“We share the rising concerns about crypto with the rest of the world. The developments (on crypto around the world) and the state of crypto in Turkey are closely monitored by our ministry,” announced the ministry at the time."
659,"Tech giant Microsoft seems to be considering introducing Bitcoin (BTC) payments to its Xbox gaming console online store.According to a Sunday Reddit post on r/XboxSeriesX, Microsoft has put out a survey asking Xbox users about their preferred payment options at its online store.“Which of these other payment methods would you like to use on Xbox?,” the purported survey asks, listing Bitcoin as one of the potential payment methods. The same photo has also been circulating across several other subreddits including r/Ethtrader and r/Bitcoin.Microsoft is now asking Xbox users about #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/TjuY18L5WhOne Xbox user said that the survey is available “if you participate in the Xbox Insider program for beta testing OS updates.”Microsoft did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.Back in 2014, Microsoft started accepting Bitcoin to fund Microsoft accounts, allowing United States-based users to purchase content from Windows, including Xbox games. After briefly halting the payment option, Microsoft resumed Bitcoin payments for its MS Store in January. Cryptocurrency-based payments are not currently supported on the Xbox online store. While it may be open to accepting Bitcoin as payment, Microsoft has no plans to make a bigger move into crypto like Tesla. President Brad Smith said that the firm did not have any cryptocurrency diversification plans following Tesla’s $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin."
660,"Bitcoin (BTC) sees a cautious start to the week as macro markets dither and Turkey’s currency loses 15% of its value overnight.After a disappointing weekend that featured a rejection at $60,000, Bitcoin has yet to impress traders, who are expecting sideways action in the coming days.Cointelegraph takes a look at five factors that could influence how Bitcoin price action evolves as a new week gets underway.The picture across equities is one of hesitancy on Monday as concerns over bond yields remain and coronavirus bites.It has become a familiar picture for many, Asian markets opened with modest movement. A rise in economic activity will likely fuel bond worries with 10-year Treasury yields already at 1.7% in the United States after gaining rapidly in recent weeks.Taking a different tone, China revealed that it had more money to spend in financial easing, something which officials claim will reduce risk, rather than add to it.“This will not only provide positive incentives for economic players, but also help create an environment less likely to spawn financial risks,” Yi Gang, Governor of China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), said at the weekend.At the same time, multiple jurisdictions are seeing a return to or continuation of coronavirus lockdown, amid anger at the lack of progress in lifting restrictions on individual freedoms despite vaccine rollouts and the onset of spring.Separately, turmoil for Turkey saw its national currency, the lira, shed 15% as soon as trading opened. The embattled economy did not benefit from a dip in sentiment after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan fired yet another central bank chief.“Turkey picks worst time to fire central banker,” market commentator Holger Zschaepitz responded.Two days of disappointment has greeted Bitcoin traders as last weekend’s rally failed to see a repeat performance.While analysts tipped BTC/USD for a breakout at some point over Saturday and Sunday, no such luck was had, as the pair saw a firm rejection close to $60,000.The result, which took some by surprise, was a dip below $56,000 before a modest recovery to $57,700 on Bitstamp at the time of writing.In his latest market comments, Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe was unperturbed by the events, as Bitcoin merely continued moving within a familiar corridor.“Bitcoin is so far, so good and that's great,” he told Twitter followers.Fellow Netherlands-based analyst and trader Crypto Ed confirmed a further light dip and rebound pattern overnight, with BTC/USD avoiding his scenario of a drop to under $52,000.In an additional summary, Scott Melker likewise identified ranging behavior, summarizing price action as “still not much happening.”Order book data from Binance highlighted the extent of the consolidation active on Bitcoin, with support and resistance closing in at $56,000 and $59,000, respectively, on Monday.Investors may be thirsty for fresh Bitcoin all-time highs, but two network fundamentals are already at or almost hitting new territory of their own.At the time of writing, both hash rate and difficulty were firmly bullish — the former within 4% of all-time highs and the latter riding higher than ever.A classic precursor to price upside, hash rate and mining difficulty underscore the strength and longevity of the current bull run. Hash rate provides an estimate of the computing power dedicated to processing transactions, while difficulty is an expression of the competition among miners for block subsidies.At the latest automated readjustment on March 19, difficulty increased by 1.95%, marking a return further into uncharted territory after the previous adjustment ended up negative.As Cointelegraph reported, such adjustments are an essential, if not most important economic feature of the Bitcoin network, allowing it to adapt to changing miner activity and maintain security.“What critics refer to about Bitcoin being ‘speculative’ is that it provides no organic yield and never will, seeing it as ‘greater fool’ price appreciation,” popular Twitter account Parabolic Trav wrote about the phenomenon earlier this month.Other on-chain indicators nonetheless paint a mixed picture of where exactly Bitcoin is in its bull cycle and how much price upside remains.In terms of investor sentiment, however, there remains plenty of leeway, as longtime hodlers have still not been moved to sell en masse even at $60,000.As analytics service Glassnode noted over the weekend, the proportion of coins belonging to older investors has not yet decreased in line with previous bull cycle tops, implying that there is longer to go before 2021 tops out.At around $53,000, Bitcoin became a $1 trillion market cap asset — but this was still not sufficient incentive to awaken coins long held in storage.“This is pretty solid price validation; $1T is already strongly supported by investors,” statistician Willy Woo commented on Glassnode data.Last week, meanwhile, Cointelegraph reported even more bullish prognoses from stock-to-flow price model creator PlanB, who forecast BTC/USD not stopping at $100,000 and continuing to an average of $288,000 this year.It’s not just well-known names favoring continuation. According to data from exchanges, the average hodler is bracing for the long haul and not planning to sell.Compiled by on-chain resource CryptoQuant, inflows and outflows to major trading platforms are heavily skewed in favor of withdrawals, implying a lack of desire to sell or trade at short notice.In fact, the weekend saw the largest outflows from exchanges since early March, just before Bitcoin hit current all-time highs of $61,700.Last week, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju included the lack of exchange inflows among factors balancing some other, less impressive, indicator readings as part of the overall market picture. Bitcoin, he said, will likely take “some time” to beat its $61,700 record.“I think BTC would take some time to get another leg up in terms of demand/supply,” he summarized."
661,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) liquid supply continues to shrink, with only 36% of circulating BTC being moved on-chain in the past six months.According to data shared by on-chain crypto data aggregator Glassnode on March 21, the peak of the 2017 bull market saw 50% of Bitcoin’s supply circulating within the preceeding six months.In bull markets old coins tend to move more. This increases the relative supply of younger coins in the network.

At previous $BTC tops, around 50% of the #Bitcoin supply was younger than 6 months.

We are currently significantly below this level (36%).https://t.co/D40RJ5FlAA pic.twitter.com/OIOnnChpk0The data shows that few long-term investors are tempted to sell their BTC at current price levels, suggesting Bitcoin’s whales are hodling for higher prices and the current bull-trend could have much further to go.Comparing the age of BTC moved on-chain may offer some insight into market sentiment. When prices hit new peaks, it is natural that older coins will be sold for profit, but that trend appears to be decreasing — suggesting that investors would rather hold on to their assets.The current supply of BTC is 18.66 million, or 88.85% of the 21 million limit. It has also been reported that around a fifth of all BTC has been lost or stolen, suggesting the actual circulating supply of Bitcoin could be considerably lower, bolstering the scarcity of the asset.Glassnode data shared by popular crypto analyst Willy Woo on the same day also noted significant on-chain activity while Bitcoin’s market capitalization has been above $1 trillion, with 7.3% of the supply of BTC changing hands while the asset has boasted a 13-figure capitalization.The data, which illustrates UTXO Realized Price Distribution, or URPD, tracks Bitcoin’s unspent transaction outputs at different prices. Woo stated:“URPD is a lens into price discovery by showing the price when coins last moved assuming they were bought by investors,” he added.However, Woo noted that on-chain coin movements do not always indicate active trading, with exchanges regularly shifting their digital assets internally."
662,"Despite the top publicly listed Bitcoin (BTC) mining firms operating at losses, their share prices have dramatically outperformed BTC over the past 12 months.Appearing on CNBC, Fundstrat’s vice president of digital asset strategy, Leeor Shimron, shared his analysis into the market performance of the four largest publicly traded mining firms: Marathon Digital Holdings, Riot Blockchain, Hive Blockchain and Hut 8 — each of which represents a market capitalization of more than $1 billion.Over the past 12 months, Shimron found the average return for shares in the mining firms to have been 5,000%, while BTC has gained 900% over the same period. Unsurprisingly, the stocks were found to have a “high positive correlation” with BTC.The researcher concluded that for every 1% price move in BTC, Bitcoin mining shares move by 2.5% on average. However, the observation applies to both upward and downward price moves, meaning mining stocks are likely to plummet with more than twice the aggression of BTC during bearish market conditions.“They’ll probably be hit hard as Bitcoin draws down,” Shimron noted.He further attributed the wild volatility in miner stocks to the lack of regulated crypto investment products in the United States, speculating that “Until a Bitcoin ETF is approved, investors may view public mining companies as one of the only ways to get exposure to Bitcoin.”Noting that Coinbase’s shares are “trading at a roughly $100 billion valuation in the private markets,” Shimron added that “Clearly there is investor appetite to gain exposure to operators within the crypto space, and miners are just another segment within that.”Shimron also noted that supply chain disruptions amid the coronavirus pandemic were beneficial to the four largest mining firms — which were able to stock up on next-generation hardware, such as Bitmain’s Antminer S19 series.“They've made a huge capital investment and operate at a loss to position themselves for the current bull run,” he said, adding:"
663,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been facing stiff resistance near the $60,000 level for the past few days. This suggests that market participants are cautious at these levels and a positive trigger may be needed to drive the price higher and start the next leg of the uptrend.One of the developments that could be bullish for Bitcoin is that Brazil followed in the footsteps of Canada and gave the green light for the launch of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. The ETF will be managed by QR Asset Management and is expected to start trading in Q2 2021.The Bitcoin ETFs launched by various countries are likely to put pressure on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to approve a Bitcoin ETF because if they do not do that, institutional investors may use the alternatives available in neighboring countries.Although Bitcoin is showing some fragility near $60,000, Cointelegraph contributor Marcel Pechman analyzed derivatives data from various exchanges to show that top traders are still adding long positions near $57,000.Bitcoin seems to be consolidating its recent gains before starting the next trending move. But there are several cryptocurrencies that are in an uptrend and may continue their march north. Let’s study the charts of top-5 cryptocurrencies that could remain bullish in the short term.Bitcoin is in an uptrend and the bulls continue to buy the dips to the 20-day exponential moving average ($55,282). The long tail on today’s candlestick also shows that the bulls used the dips to accumulate.The bulls will now try to propel the price above the $60,000 to $61,825 resistance. If they succeed, the BTC/USD pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $72,112.Another possibility is that the price again turns down from the overhead resistance and the pair remains stuck in a tight range. If that happens, the next breakout is likely to result in a strong trending move.The only bearish development visible on the chart is the negative divergence on the relative strength indicator (RSI). This bearish prediction could come into play after the price breaks and sustains below the 20-day EMA.If that happens, the pair could drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($49,497), which is a critical support to keep an eye on. A break below this level could challenge the $43,006 support.The 4-hour chart shows the formation of a symmetrical triangle, which usually acts as a continuation pattern. The price has bounced off the support line of the triangle, indicating that the bulls are defending this support.If the bulls can propel the price above the moving averages, the pair could again attempt to rise above the resistance line of the triangle. If that happens, a move to the all-time high at $61,825 is possible. A breakout and close above this resistance could resume the up-move.Alternatively, if the price turns down from the moving averages, the bears will try to sink the price below the triangle. If they manage to do that, the pair could drop to $53,288 and then $44,752.Uniswap (UNI) is currently consolidating between $27.97 and $35.20. The bulls attempted to resume the uptrend on March 20 but the long wick on the candlestick and a close in the red suggests profit-booking near $35.20.However, there hasn’t been any follow-up selling today. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive zone, which suggests the path of least resistance is to the upside.If the bulls can propel the price above $35.20, the UNI/USD pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that could take it to $42.43 and then $46.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($30), the pair could drop to $27.97. This is an important support to watch out for because if it cracks, traders may rush to the exit and that could result in a deeper correction to the 50-day SMA ($25.39) and then $22.The moving averages on the 4-hour chart have flattened out and the RSI is just above the midpoint. This suggests a balance between supply and demand.If the price dips below the moving averages, a drop to $27.97 is possible. A bounce off this support could extend the stay of the pair inside the range.The next trending move could start after the bulls push the price above $35.20 or the bears sink the pair below $27.97. Until then, the price may oscillate between the support and resistance levels of the range.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro turned positive as the signal for LUNA rose above 70 on March 18, indicating a positive outlook when the price was still undecided about the next move fr $18.17.The VORTECS™ score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.The chart above shows the VORTECS™ score climbed steadily from 62 to 76 on March 18, well before the price picked up momentum on March 19.Since then, the VORTECS™ score has remained bullish and has not fallen below 65. Meanwhile, LUNA continued to move up and reached $22.32 on March 21 in tandem with the VORTECS™ score, which hit 77.LUNA is in a strong uptrend as it continues to make record highs on a daily basis. The bears attempted to stall the uptrend on March 17 but could not keep the price down for more than a day, which suggests strong buying on every minor dip.The long wick on the March 19 candlestick also shows profit-booking at higher levels, but the bulls again bought the dip and have pushed the price to a new all-time high today. This suggests the trend remains intact.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is above 84, indicating that bulls are in control. The next target objective on the upside is $27.46.However, vertical rallies are rarely sustainable. Therefore, traders may wait for a correction or a consolidation to initiate fresh positions rather than chase the price higher. A break below $18.51 could result in a drop to the 20-day EMA ($14.79).A strong rebound off this support will suggest the sentiment remains bullish as traders are buying the dips. But a break below the 20-day EMA could signal the start of a deeper correction.The 4-hour chart shows the LUNA/USD pair is in a strong uptrend. The bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the 20-EMA during the most recent leg of the uptrend, which is a positive sign.Therefore, traders should keep a close eye on the 20-day EMA because a break below it will be the first sign that the momentum may be ebbing. The next support on the downside is the 50-SMA. A break below $17 could suggest that the bears have the upper hand.THETA has been in a strong uptrend for the past few days. The token rose to a new all-time high at $8.97 on March 19 but witnessed profit-booking at higher levels as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick.However, the shallow correction on March 20 showed that traders were buying the dips and not rushing to the exit. During strong uptrends, the pullbacks are generally short-lived.The bulls have again pushed the price to a new all-time high today, which shows the resumption of the uptrend. The THETA/USD pair could rally to $10.35 and then to $12.35. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest the bulls are in command.This bullish view will invalidate if the bears sell at higher levels and pull the price back below $7.99. If that happens, it will suggest the current breakout was a bull trap.The 4-hour chart shows the price bounced off the breakout level at $7.999 and the bulls did not allow the pair to drop below the 20-EMA. The bears attempted to stall the up-move at the downtrend line but failed.Strong buying by the bulls has pushed the price above the downtrend line and the $9 overhead resistance. This suggests the next leg of the uptrend may have begun.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA, it will signal that the momentum has weakened. A break below the 50-SMA will suggest that the bears are attempting to make a comeback.Filecoin’s FIL token is in a strong uptrend. After its sharp rally on March 16 and 17, short-term traders seem to have booked profits, which has resulted in a minor correction on March 18. However, the shallow pullback is a positive sign as it shows that the majority of the traders are not rushing to the exit.The bulls are attempting to keep the FIL/USD pair above $73.79, which is just below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $75.74. If the bulls succeed, the pair could again rise to $96.66.A breakout and close above this resistance could start the next leg of the uptrend, which could reach $128.55.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below $73.79, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($59.95). A strong rebound off this support will indicate that the trend remains positive but a break below it will suggest a short-term top may be in place.The rebound off the $73.79 support indicates strong demand at lower levels. However, the bears are not relenting as they are aggressively defending the $86 level. If the bears sink the price below the 20-EMA, the pair could again drop to $73.79. A break below this level will suggest advantage to the bears.Alternatively, if the pair rebounds off $73.79, it may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. The flattening 20-EMA and the gradually weakening RSI also point to a possible consolidation. A break above $86 could signal resumption of the uptrend.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

664,"Throughout the middle of March, many Americans received stimulus checks from the government, and while the payments — $1,400 for every U.S. citizen earning less than $80,000 annually — will be a blessing for millions in desperate economic straits as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, it has raised again the specter of inflation. And as with many other things, this too has a Bitcoin (BTC) angle.On March 15, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz proposed on NBC’s Squawk Box a new role for Bitcoin in light of recent stimulus measures — as “a report card for how citizens think the government is doing managing their finances.” If people believe that U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen et. al. can safely land this “giant supertanker” that is fiscal and monetary stimulus, said Novogratz, then “people will stop moving into Bitcoin.” But for now, “we’re in uncharted territories in how much money we’re printing, and Bitcoin is a report card on that.”Podcaster Preston Pysh urged something similar a few days earlier in response to the news that the U.S. House of Representatives had passed the $1.9-trillion COVID relief package: “Think of #Bitcoin like a manipulation gauge.”What is one to make of this? A new and exciting use case for the world’s first cryptocurrency — i.e., as a sort of a feedback tool for monetary policymakers? Or just another fantasy of Bitcoin maximalists?David Yermack, a professor of finance at New York University’s Leonard N. Stern School of Business, rejected the notion that BTC could serve as a “report card” for governments, telling Cointelegraph: “There’s no evidence that Bitcoin provides a hedge against movements in sovereign currency.” He added that “when one looks at large samples for research purposes, evidence has been very hard to find in a statistically rigorous sense.”Bitcoin is much too imprecise of a measure, others say. If inflation rises 2.4% over the course of the year, as the Federal Reserve recently forecast, will BTC’s price also rise 2.4% — or some constant multiple thereof? Or conversely, if the Fed tightens up the money supply, tamping down inflation, will BTC’s price also fall in step? BTC basically has to be highly correlated with the inflation rate to be useful as a feedback tool, and that seems unlikely.“The surge of liquidity from the Fed has fueled gains in virtually all major asset classes, with some pure speculative plays such as Bitcoin benefiting even more,” Eswar Prasad, a professor of economics at Cornell University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told Cointelegraph, adding:Novogratz mustered some support for his hypothesis, however — on Twitter at any rate. On Feb. 28, he took an informal survey, asking: “Is $BTC a report card on monetary and fiscal policy?” When the 3,000-plus votes were tallied, 70.8% answered “yes,” and 29.2% replied “no.”Nik Bhatia, author of the book Layered Money: From Gold and Dollars to Bitcoin and Central Bank Digital Currencies and adjunct professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California, told Cointelegraph that one has to separate fiscal stimulus from monetary stimulus.According to him, In the short term, there is clearly a positive relationship between fiscal stimulus and the price of Bitcoin. When people have new stimulus checks in their pockets, they are more likely to buy Bitcoin, which will increase the price of BTC. Indeed, a recent Mizuho Securities survey said U.S. stimulus checks could raise the market cap of Bitcoin by as much as 3% — though this survey had a small sample size.In any event, It’s more difficult to show the connection between monetary stimulus and BTC, continued Bhatia. In the long term, most Bitcoinists probably believe that there is a positive correlation between monetary stimulus and BTC — that is, people alarmed by stimulus-created inflation will seek a haven in BTC, “but it is impossible to prove.” In Bhatia’s view, the reason that BTC’s price is rising now — and will continue to do so — is the cryptocurrency’s “growing dominance in the international monetary system,” he told Cointelegraph.While some say Bitcoin may not have any immediate future in this one specific use case — as a gauge for monetary policy — it still has other related use cases, including “insurance against unhinged monetary policy and outright wealth segregation in some countries,” as Ark Investment Management’s Cathie Wood said recently at a Bloomberg event.Wood added that BTC was gaining increasing recognition from institutions as an investment asset class, and it might even replace bonds in the traditional 60/40 stocks/bonds model portfolio, a view echoed by podcaster Graham Stephan, who anticipated a new model portfolio along the lines of 70% invested in stocks, 15% in bonds and 15% in BTC someday.Scott Freeman, co-founder and partner of JST Capital, told Cointelegraph: “We do see that there are more traditional investors who view BTC as a hedge against undisciplined monetary policy. We’ve seen that this has already driven demand in third-world countries, and we expect this to be a self-fulfilling prophecy as more people buy into this thesis.”But this is different from a report card or a manipulation gauge that attaches a number or a grade to a government’s performance. BTC is still too volatile and thinly traded to be useful for that at present, Freeman opined, adding:It’s worth remembering, too, as Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of Arca, told Cointelegraph, that since the United States embraced an “aggressive monetary policy” in 2009, investors have been looking for ways to hedge against inflation. They’ve tried buying gold, and also shorting treasuries and/or European government bonds. “None of the traditional methods have worked,” said Dorman, adding: “Bitcoin has been the only winner for the past decade.”Recent government stimulus measures probably strengthen the argument for Bitcoin, Dorman continued, but BTC has made little impact upon policymakers due to its “small size and limited touch size.” But the times are changing. This past week, Deutsche Bank analysts declared that Bitcoin had grown “too important to ignore,” and with so many different types of investors gravitating to BTC now — banks, brokerages, insurance companies, hedge funds, corporate treasurers, individuals — Dorman said:But if BTC isn’t yet a gauge or feedback loop, what is? How is one to recognize if governments are losing their grip? There’s always the traditional inflation indexes, such as the Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index — ie., the official measures — Mauro F. Guillén, Zandman professor of international management at the Wharton School, told Cointelegraph, where “anything above 3%–4% starts to be a problem.” He added:In short, given that Bitcoin is only 12 years old, volatile and owned by only 1.3% of the world’s population (perhaps), expecting that it can become a report card on government monetary policy seems premature.BTC today is a promising store of value, a growing investment asset class, and one day, it may have other uses, including as a medium of exchange and/or unit of account, but those future use cases will emerge organically and probably can’t be forced."
665,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $56,000 on March 21 after repeated rejections by the $60,000 resistance level throughout the past four days.Despite getting closer to cleanly breaching past the key technical level, Bitcoin has been showing weakness in the $59,000 to $60,500 range.There are three major reasons behind the stagnation: the rise in Treasury yields, bearish movements on Bitfinex, and the struggle of the risk-on market.When the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rises, the appetite for risk-on assets tends to drop because investors can seek safer yield-generating alternative in Treasury bonds.Although Bitcoin has not seen tight correlation with the Dow Jones, it has seen close correlation with tech-heavy indices, like the S&P 500.This suggests that the strong momentum of the U.S. Treasury bonds is leading risk-on assets to stagnate, bringing down Bitcoin's momentum in tandem, as Cointelegraph previously reported.The U.S. Treasury yields began to break out above key levels starting March 19. Since then, Bitcoin has been consolidating, struggling to rise above $60,000.Holger Zschaepitz, a market analyst at Welt, said:For Bitcoin to see a sustainable rally, it needs to see a favorable macro landscape, which would only be possible through the stabilization of U.S.Treasury yields.According to a pseudonymous Bitcoin trader and technical analyst known as ""Byzantine General,"" there has been serious selling pressure on Bitfinex.Other derivatives trading platforms, like Deribit, FTX, and BitMEX also saw decent short interest, the trader said.He wrote:The combination of an unfavorable macro landscape and the selling pressure from both whales and derivatives traders likely caused Bitcoin to consolidate under $60,000.However, in the foreseeable future, the likelihood of a relief rally could increase if the open interest of the futures market continues to unwind.The term open interest refers to the total sum of active positions in the futures market. When this declines, it means that there is generally lower trading activity concerning derivatives.Willy Woo, the prominent on-chain analyst, explained that Bitcoin has a decent chance of not going under $1 trillion market capitalization again.Woo noted that the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) indicator, which shows the realized price of all UTXOs on any given day, indicates that the $1 trillion market cap is acting as a price floor. He said:The on-chain data also indicates that while there has been short-term selling pressure, these moves are not large enough to suggest that the market is anticipating a prolonged correction."
666,"Hash rate refers to the overall computing power involved in validating transactions on the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain. As reported by Cointelegraph, more power suggests greater network security and interest in the profitability potential of mining Bitcoin.A hash rate increase is often associated with the expectation of BTC price appreciation. Analysts found evidence that both the 2013 and 2016 bull cycles were marked by a rise in mining difficulty following the hash rate increase.For instance, the 70% gains in 2021 coincided with multiple investments and large orders for mining equipment. But singling out cause and consequence is almost impossible.A few examples include Argo Blockchain buying a 320-acre land pilot in Texas to expand operations, Bitfury’s U.S. mining subsidiary going public, and the BTC.com mining pool acquisition by a Chinese lottery service.However, there have been periods of absolute dissonance, so maybe there is no direct relation between Bitcoin price and miners' installed capacity.Despite being impossible to measure precisely, the seven-day average hash rate yields better results to spot trend changes.Most likely, 2017 was an outlier when it comes to BTC price as Bitcoin entered a phase of parabolic price growth. By August, the hash rate had also tripled to 6.8 TH/s. But the theory that the hash rate can predict price was undermined when the computing power then suddenly dropped by 25% with no apparent effect on the price.On the other hand, Bitcoin’s 132% surge over the last two months of 2017 seems to have been reflected only a few months later by the hash rate as it more than doubled between December 2017 and March 2018.The second half of 2018 and 2019 provide a more interesting dataset as BTC price faced more vigorous movements and periods of stagnation. Meanwhile, the hash rate doubled from April 2018 to November 2018, peaking at 54 TH/s. Curiously, this peak preceded BTC's sharp correction to $4,000.On the other hand, both indicators bottomed in mid-December 2018, while the first half of 2019 presented a synchronized movement between BTC price and hash rate.The second half of 2019 saw completely opposite trends as the hash rate went up by 66% while BTC price plunged 38%. This time around, BTC price peaked at $10,200 in mid-February 2020, while this happened only three weeks later for the hash rate.The most recent data also presents a strong correlation between the two metrics. Moreover, the hash rate of 166 TH per the second peak on Feb. 8 seems to have been mimicked two weeks later as BTC topped near $55,000.Therefore, without a doubt, there is a strong correlation between hash rate and price, although there have been periods of six months or longer when the mining capacity continued to expand despite BTC price stagnating. The same can be said for the abrupt hash rate drops, such as the recent one in October 2020, which had no impact on BTC price. Therefore, such a metric to predict short-term price movements appears to be unreliable.  In other words, hash rate and price trends, albeit correlated, provide a slew of mixed signals that are sure to confuse any trader.But despite the apparent long-term correlation, there are other factors that should also be taken into consideration since they can have a more immediate impact on price. These include new mining hardware, regulation, seasonality, geography, and variations in energy prices across the globe.

667,"The year 2020 will go down in history as the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the way it affected the Argentine economy. But it is also true that Argentina has been dragging along economic problems for decades, with high fiscal pressure, devaluation of the national currency (the Argentine peso), restrictions on the purchase of foreign currency, etc. Beyond that, events have occurred that have to do with attempts to regulate the crypto ecosystem, in addition to those linked to private companies and the adoption of cryptocurrencies. The following is a summary of the events that marked the last year and the opinions of various people who lived it from inside the ecosystem.First quarter of 2020Second quarter of 2020Third quarter of 2020Fourth quarter of 2020Attempts at regulationThere have been two initiatives at the national level in Argentina and one at the provincial level (in the province of Misiones) that are related to attempts to regulate cryptocurrencies.In the Chamber of Deputies, a bill from Everybody's Front was formally presented with the signature of 15 national deputies. This initiative, under file 6055-D-2020, has as its summary title: Integral Regulatory Framework Applicable to Civil and Commercial Transactions and Operations of Crypto Assets.On the other hand, from the opposition, Argentine deputy Ignacio Torres of the Together for Change front also has in his hands a project on cryptocurrencies, but it has not yet been formally presented to Congress. This legislator, a representative of the district of Chubut, is holding a series of meetings and consultations on the subject with different sectors.These projects have also been the focus of controversy and criticism from various sectors of the Argentine cryptosphere.In addition, in the province of Misiones, Provincial Deputy Roque Gervasoni of the Front for the Renewal of Concord presented a project in the Chamber of Deputies. Registered under file D-55787/20, it is a bill that, in theory, also proposes to regulate the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The initiative has another peculiarity, which is that it provides for the creation of an exchange.Rodolfo Andragnes, president of Bitcoin Argentina, said:Pedro Rey Puma, OKEx community manager for Latin America, observed: “We must highlight the exposure of the two bills presented to the UIF and the Congress, although I think they need changes, and I adhere to the general dissatisfaction of the community.”Bitcoin’s price rose, and adoption grewIt was a very interesting year in terms of the price of Bitcoin (BTC), especially in its last few weeks. Bitcoin reached another historic high, something that hadn't happened since 2017. It shouldn't be forgotten either that it was a year where there was another halving, which many think was decisive for the price.Andragnes said that in Argentina, during 2020, new projects appeared, while others were consolidated. ""Not only have the exchanges seen exponential growth of users, multiplying by three or five times their volumes, but those companies that offered services such as digital certifications or developments on blockchain have also noticed growth,"" he highlighted.Ivan Tello, co-founder of Decrypto, expressed that the most important thing about 2020 in the crypto ecosystem was adoption:On the other hand, he estimated that before ""the trap"" and prohibition of buying dollars in Argentina, investors and traditional savers discovered the possibility of being able to continue buying ""virtual dollars"" in the form of the stablecoins, which in many cases are the door to the crypto world. ""Then they discover all the solutions that this new world brings to them,” he remarked. “More and more people are losing their fear of the virtual, of the intangible.”But he also highlighted ""the Halving (reduction in emission) of Bitcoin,"" saying: ""It happened in a year where all the central banks went out to issue and counterfeit their currency without any support, and it made evident the cracks in the system and how the perfect storm only favors Bitcoin to keep increasing its price.”According to Gabriel Vago, CEO of ArgenBTC, 2020 was undoubtedly the best year for the crypto ecosystem in Argentina. “The different circumstances that occurred throughout the year — between, the exchange rate gap, the quarantine lockdown and the unstoppable rise in the price of Bitcoin since March — prepared a perfect scenario for hundreds of thousands of Argentines to join the crypto world,” he highlighted.Emiliano Limia, public relations manager at Buenbit, said that the most important thing was the exponential growth of users. “The reasons behind this generalised growth are mainly related to the complex economic context the country is going through. Crypto assets gained ground as a form of savings in the context of the devaluation of the Argentine peso and restrictions on the purchase of foreign currency.”In particular, he stated that the adoption of Dai became popular: “As it is a stablecoin, which has a price linked to the U.S. dollar, many Argentines turned to acquiring it. The reason is that in Argentina, there is a maximum quota of up to 200 dollars per month, and this is combined with interest rates in low-yielding Argentine pesos and a historical preference of Argentines for the dollar. So, for new users, DAI works as a good gateway to the ecosystem. In fact, MakerDAO, the organization that created this stablecoin, assures in its official blog that DAI has become the most popular crypto in Argentina by exchange volumes, even ahead of Bitcoin, due to concerns about hyperinflation.""On the other hand, he talked about the increase in Bitcoin's price. ""It caught the attention of the press and of many people who had not yet entered the ecosystem, and who now notice that the asset is consolidating,"" he said.For economist Nicolas Litvinoff, director of Estudinero, the most important events of 2020 had to do with two things: operations and access.""On the side of fundamentals, easy access to the purchase of Bitcoin was the big news,” he said. “The access ramp benefited from the development and implementation of P2P operations but monitored and guaranteed by exchanges or multi-currency platforms. The proposals of Airtm, Uphold and now Binance — that an Argentinean can buy Bitcoin, Ethereum or other assets with a transfer in pesos and the other person can send the crypto — is a model of operation that facilitates the access to crypto assets. Peer-to-peer opens the door for millions of people to the world of crypto assets.”He added: “From the point of view of prices, the consolidation of Bitcoin as a safeguard against inflation, and the possibility of accessing stablecoins linked to the dollar as a safeguard against inflation, is good news. Beyond the price increase, Bitcoin has shown that it is an excellent refuge of value, especially for countries with a high degree of financial repression or regulation, like ours.”For Matías Part, chief operating officer of Crypto Rocket and CR Academia, there were a series of internal and external factors that helped to put cryptocurrencies on the map in a definitive way.""When the previous government regulated the exchange rate trap in September 2019, there was a great uncertainty that was immediately solved by the ecosystem,” he said. “The local exchanges already had DAI listed and the (misnamed) Crypto Dollar emerged.”“Then, with the change of government, the economic crisis deepened, making people want to support themselves as best they could by buying DAIs without restrictions and with Argentine pesos.”Rey Puma observed: “I think one of the most important things is the increased adoption of Bitcoin, DAI and USDT because of the overall growth in digital payments due to the pandemic.”“Many people opted for traditional mobile peso wallets and others started using crypto wallets or custodial apps from exchanges for the first time,” he added.For Rey Puma, another important thing that happened is that the population was to a greater extent exposed to the fact that Bitcoin can be an alternative to the peso or the dollar to safeguard value, “since in just a couple of months Bitcoin went from being worth 1 million to 3 million pesos.”This provoked a great growth in new users, and OKEX also noticed it. Rey Puma confirmed that Argentina became one of the countries with the most movement in Latin America.For Marcos Zocaro, a tax consultant, “Despite the fact that these were not very fortunate events (or measures) for the direction of the Argentine economy, the growing exchange restrictions and the depreciation of the national currency were the trigger for an adoption of cryptocurrencies as we had not seen before.”“The crypto ecosystem received new users and investors who were discovering the technology as they tried to find some way to dollarize their savings, bypassing (legally) existing restrictions,” he added. “And this boom also generated the emergence of new local crypto ventures and the arrival of important players (among which are the main exchanges worldwide).”Bitcoin halvingIn addition to highlighting many events globally, Abraham Cobos, “crypto catalyst” of Bitso, spoke of Bitcoin's halving: “On May 11, for the third time in its history, the reward for each mined block was halved. This went down from 12.5 to 6.25 Bitcoin for every block processed (every 10 minutes). When Bitcoin first appeared in 2009, its emission per block was 50 BTC, and then successively halved every 210,000 blocks for four years, resulting in 25 BTC in 2012 and 12.5 BTC in 2016.”“The halving phenomenon reminds us that Bitcoin is an extremely scarce resource and that its supply is increasingly limited,” he said.Decentralized financeDecentralized finance is an international phenomenon, and Argentina has also seen momentum and different developments in this particular sector.For Juan Manuel Domínguez, director of STO Managers, 2020 was as chaotic as it was interesting for the crypto ecosystem: “The acceleration in interest from people not directly related to the industry, ordinary people who had already heard about it at some point from a friend or family member, and are finally deciding to take the first step even at a higher rate than was the case in 2017.”In this sense, he highlighted the further development of new applications with more user-friendly interfaces that has been taking place, partly as a result of the intense growth of DeFi platforms that emerged this year. “This plays a significant role in favoring the adoption by users who are just starting out in the industry,” he said.Part stated: “After the first quarter came the boom of DeFi, with yields of between 5% and 8% per year, which ended up discouraging the FCI and fixed terms.”On the other hand, he also highlighted the price of BTC surpassing a new all-time high:A “Crypto Valley”For Alan Boryszanski, chief financial officer of Lemon Cash, one of the most outstanding milestones in the ecosystem of Argentina was the creation of what he calls “the first Crypto Valley of LATAM” in San Martin de los Andes in the province of Neuquen. It “became a pioneer city that works as a technological testing ground for companies, startups, entrepreneurs, academics and organizations,” he explained.“With more than 600 merchants that accept digital assets as a form of payment, Crypto Valley has a direct relationship with the Chamber of Commerce of the city and has the support of the local Ministry of Tourism,” he added. “In addition, it contributes to financial inclusion thanks to webinar cycles and research agreements with different universities in the country. The Crypto Valley condenses many changes that happened in 2020 as a consequence of the pandemic, the currency trap and the tax increases, which forced the massive adoption of cryptocurrencies as a value reserve.”"
668,"The seventh session of the Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development convened earlier this month with the theme “Building forward better: Towards a resilient and green Africa to achieve the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063” and to promote the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.Amina Mohammed, deputy secretary-general of the United Nations, pointed out that developing a just, fair economic model that embraces green and renewable energy, resilient infrastructure, and digitalization — while protecting natural resources by broadening partnerships for science, technology and innovation — could unleash the region’s green potential and fuel economic transformation.According to a paper titled “Harnessing Emerging Technologies: the cases of Artificial Intelligence and Nanotechnology,” which was provided by Victor Konde — scientific affairs officer at the United Nations: “The global pandemic caused by [COVID-19] has highlighted the importance of technology and innovation in developed countries. [...] Digital technologies have transformed how people work, interact and access services.” It also highlights the “interest in the role of emerging technologies in driving Africa’s transformation” and in achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.As the document states, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, or UNECA, conducted profound policy research and “provided policy advice to member States on several emerging technologies, such as blockchain, artificial intelligence and nanotechnology.” The paper continues:The internet and tech giants, such as Google and Facebook, spend billions of dollars in an attempt to get more people online in Africa despite a backlash from governments that are trying to shut down access to these services. At the same time, Vera Songwe, UN under-secretary-general and executive secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa, pointed out:Africa is the second-largest continent in the world in terms of both territory and population (roughly 1.3 billion people), and cryptocurrency is in big demand for the following reasons:During 2020, monthly cryptocurrency transfers under $10,000 in value to and from Africa — often traded person-to-person across the 816 million mobile phones in Sub-Saharan Africa alone — skyrocketed 55%, “reaching a peak of $316 million in June.” They traded with a large margin that reached up to 70% due to the small number of cryptocurrency retailers. Individual citizens and small businesses located in Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya accounted for most of this trading activity.China is the largest trading partner of many African countries. It has been investing ($45 billion in 2019, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) since the mid-2000s into Africa’s technology, communications and finance infrastructure, and blockchain technology education. Already, Egypt, Kenya, Rwanda and Eswatini have been researching central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. As a BRICS nation, South Africa is piloting one as part of Russia’s multinational digital currency initiative that will be linked with China’s mobile Digital Currency Electronic Payment system supported by its Blockchain-based Service Network.Related: Not like before: Digital currencies debut amid COVID-19In its “Nigeria Digital Economy Diagnostic Report” of 2019, the World Bank laid out the country’s digital economy potential. Only a year later, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Nigeria surpassed China and currently ranks second in the world in Bitcoin (BTC) trading, even though it lacks the regulatory framework to support the digital asset business activity.Bitcoin trading provides a source of income for an increasing number of unemployed young people in addition to a means of sending and receiving cross-border payments. For example, BTC funded the 2020 #EndSARS protests against police brutality, which were carried out by young people nationwide and spread beyond Nigerian borders, parallel to solidarity protests in different parts of the world.Recently, the Central Bank of Nigeria banned banks from servicing crypto exchanges and is incentivizing citizens until May 8 to use licensed international money transfer operators for cross-border payments. Nigeria’s securities regulator followed suit by suspending its planned regulatory framework for digital assets. This ban is expected to be in place until a well-devised concrete regulatory framework for the $1.8 trillion cryptocurrency market is developed, perhaps one that incorporates the Nigerian Technology Industry Group’s core policy suggestions of instituting Know Your Customer, Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism regulations. As the chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Abdulrasheed Bawa, explained:Related: South African president steps down as banks embrace blockchain technologyAfrica has abundant energy resources, including solar energy, as it receives more hours of bright sunshine during the course of the year than any other continent. But it lacks reliable access to modern energy, which is needed for digitalization.The continent is determined to green-energize and solarize its digitalization, as it is most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, even though it contributes minimally to CO2 emissions. With the exception of Eritrea and Libya, African countries have ratified the Paris Agreement with ambitious nationally determined contributions.According to forecasts by the International Renewable Energy Agency, “With the right policies, regulation, governance and access to financial markets, sub-Saharan Africa could meet up to 67 per cent of its energy needs [from renewables] by 2030.” And as pointed out by Songwe, it can “provide access to energy to over 70 per cent of Africans who are without access currently.”Egypt is leading regional efforts to transition to green/solar energy, with the continent experiencing a surge of growth in new solar installations, mainly driven by nine countries. In a first-of-its-kind project, Egypt recently entered into a joint venture with a Chinese company to locally manufacture sand-to-cell photovoltaic solar panels, with China having ramped up its overseas green investment to 57% under the Belt and Road Initiative, according to research from the International Institute of Green Finance.The national lockdowns and international travel bans imposed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic have accelerated green digitalization efforts across African markets, which have promoted democracy and cryptocurrencies and broken down geographic barriers to collaboration and distribution. Nigerian songwriter and singer Burna Boy, with his music, and Ghanaian artist Amoako Boafo, with his paintings, conquered the world during 2020.Accordingly, the UN has dedicated the whole year of 2021 to the creative economy, as it plays a critical role in promoting sustainable development for a green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. A sustainable green recovery plan necessitates understanding the links between climate change, health and inequality, and it requires implementing ambitious climate change policies that align with the Paris Agreement. More important than ever, these goals provide a critical framework for a green COVID-19 recovery.

669,"A report by Deutsche Bank Research said that Bitcoin (BTC) has become “too important to ignore” and may attract regulation by the end of 2021. Deutsche Bank analysts expect Bitcoin to reach a turning point in about “two or three years” when it will be clear whether Bitcoin will evolve into an asset class or not. In the short term, the report forecast Bitcoin to “remain ultra volatile.”A different report by Bank of America provided some insight into the possible reasons for Bitcoin’s volatility. Bank of America analysts estimated that Bitcoin price may rise by one percent when there is a $93 million inflow. Compared to that, gold needs about $2 billion worth of funds to move it by a single percentage point.This large disparity in the price reaction to the inflow of funds is attributed to Bitcoin holders who have not parted with their coins during the current bull run.While it is difficult to predict at what price the Bitcoin whales will book profits on their holdings, Kraken growth lead Dan Held said in a recent interview with Cointelegraph that Bitcoin could reach $1 million during the current supercycle.Held believes that the confluence of events such as the coronavirus crisis, money printing by central banks and the rising lack of trust in legacy financial firms are the triggers supporting the crypto bull run.Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine whether the uptrend will resume or is the bull run showing signs of exhaustion?Bitcoin rebounded off the 20-day exponential moving average ($54,844) on March 17 and rose above the $58,341.03 overhead resistance. But the advance to $60,102.15 witnessed profit-booking on March 18.However, the positive sign is that the bulls purchased the dip and have again pushed the price above $58,341.03. A rise above $60,102.15 could retest the all-time high at $61,825.84.The upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. A break above $61,825.84 could start the next leg of the uptrend to $72,112.Although the RSI is showing negative divergence, traders should follow the price action closely because a sharp rally from the current levels may invalidate this bearish development.If the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will be the first sign of weakness. A deeper correction could be signaled if the bears sink and sustain the BTC/USD pair below the 50-day simple moving average ($48,578).Ether (ETH) has been trading just above the 20-day EMA ($1,756) for the past three days. This is a positive sign as it shows that the bulls are accumulating on dips to the 20-day EMA.If the bulls can propel the price above $1,850, the ETH/USD pair could rise to $1,942.92 and then challenge the all-time high at $2,040.77. A breakout and close above this resistance could start the journey to $2,614.The moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory, suggesting the bulls have a slight edge.However, this positive assumption will be negated if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages. Such a move could pull the price down to $1,289 and keep the pair range-bound for a few more days.Binance Coin (BNB) has successfully held the 20-day EMA ($251) for the past four days but the bulls are struggling to push the price above $280 and challenge the overhead resistance at $309.50.However, the 20-day EMA is sloping up gradually and the RSI is in the positive zone, which shows a minor advantage to the bulls. A breakout and close above $309.50 will complete a bullish ascending triangle pattern. This setup has a target objective at $429.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the trendline of the triangle, it will suggest the bears have overpowered the bulls. That could result in a drop to $189.Cardano (ADA) turned down from the all-time high at $1.48 on March 18 as traders booked profits. However, the positive sign is that the bulls are attempting to defend the breakout level at $1.23.A strong bounce off the current level could increase the possibility of a break above the all-time high. The next target objective on the upside is $2.The rising moving averages suggest the bulls are in command, but the negative divergence on the RSI shows the momentum is weakening.If the bears can pull the price below the 20-day EMA ($1.14), it will indicate that supply exceeds demand. The trend may turn in favor of the bears if the ADA/USD pair plummets below the 50-day SMA ($0.94).Polkadot (DOT) has been sustaining above the 20-day EMA ($35) for the past two days, which is a positive sign. The bulls are currently trying to push the price above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle.If they succeed, it could resume the uptrend. The bulls may face stiff resistance at the all-time high at $42.28 but if they can thrust the price above it, the DOT/USD pair could rise to the pattern target at $55.The 20-day EMA is moving up gradually and the RSI has risen above the downtrend line, which shows the bulls are attempting to gain the upper hand. This view will invalidate if the pair turns down and breaks below the support line of the triangle.XRP has been trading in a tight range for the past few days as the bears are defending the overhead resistance at $0.50 and the bulls are buying on dips to $0.42. The flat moving averages and the RSI just above 52 suggest a balance between supply and demand.Usually, a tight range trading is followed by a trending move. In this case, if the bulls can propel the price above $0.50, the XRP/USD pair could rally to $0.65 where it is again likely to counter stiff resistance from the bears.Alternatively, if the bears sink the price below $0.42, the pair could drop to $0.36. This is a critical support to watch out for because a break below it could intensify selling and clear the path for a slide to $0.25.Uniswap (UNI) is in an uptrend and it has been holding above the 20-day EMA ($29.41) for the past few days, which shows the bulls are buying the dips to this support. If the bulls can push the price above $32, a retest of the all-time high at $34.92 is possible.A breakout and close above the all-time high could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $46. The upsloping moving averages suggest that bulls are in control but the negative divergence on the RSI warrants caution.If the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, it could signal the start of a deeper correction. The first stop could be the 50-day SMA ($24.78) and if this support also cracks, the decline may extend to $22.The bulls are attempting to keep Litecoin (LTC) above the 20-day EMA ($199.41). If they succeed, the altcoin could move up to the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle where the bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance.However, if the bulls manage to propel the price above the triangle, it will suggest a resumption of the next leg of the uptrend. The first stop could be $246.96 and if this level is crossed, the LTC/USD pair could rally to $300.The gradually upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone indicate a minor advantage to the bulls. This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below the triangle.Chainlink (LINK) once again turned down from the overhead resistance on March 18, which shows the bears are defending this level. However, the positive sign is that the bulls did not allow the price to dip below the 50-day SMA ($28.38), indicating buying at lower levels.The LINK/USD pair has formed an ascending triangle pattern that will complete on a breakout and close above $32. This setup has a target objective at $43.20.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the trendline of the triangle, it will invalidate the bullish setup. That could result in a drop to $24 and then to $20.11.The bulls and the bears are battling it out to gain the upper hand in Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Although the price had dipped below the moving averages for the past four days, the bears could not capitalize on the situation. This suggests selling dries up at lower levels.The flat moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest the BCH/USD pair could remain range-bound for a few more days.If the consolidation resolves to the downside and the price closes below $500, the pair could start a deeper correction to $440 and then to $320.Conversely, if the bulls push and sustain the price above $560, the pair may again try to rally to $631.71 and then $745.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

670,"Bitcoin (BTC) continued to face strong resistance at the $60,000 level on March 19 as bulls spent the day climbing back from an early morning drop which briefly pushed BTC into the sub-$56,500 range.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that after being rejected at the $60,000 level on March 18, the price of Bitcoin hit a low of $56,268 in the early hours on Friday before dip buyers returned to help lift the price back above $58,500.Key Bitcoin price metrics show that despite the struggles faced in order to breakout past $60,000, top-traders are growing increasingly bullish as evidenced by an uptick in leveraged long positions over the past week as the BTC trading range grew tighter.Global signs of adoption continue to emerge as the first Bitcoin ETF in Latin America was approved in Brazil, making it the fourth ETF to be approved in the western hemisphere following three recently launched ETFs in Canada.Chad Steinglass, head of trading at crypto capital markets firm CrossTower recently discussed the pressures Bitcoin faced at the $60,000 level and pointed out that the top cryptocurrency has faced “at least some resistance at every round number on the way up,” and that once a resistance level is surpassed, it then becomes support.According to Steinglass, “it will take a bit of chipping away to break through $60,000 with any kind of authority,” but the recent strength displayed by Bitcoin “in the face of stiff macro headwinds” indicates no reason for the bullish momentum to stop.Steinglass identified the $57,000 to $58,000 range as the new support level which should hold “as long as some unexpected event doesn’t derail it,” such as new lockdown measures or a significant move in US Treasuries.Steinglass said:Rising interest rates for U.S. Treasuries continue to put pressure on the global financial markets which ended Friday’s trading session mixed as traders begin to worry about the possibility of a rapid rise in inflation hindering the economic recovery and causing a “near-term shift in the Federal Reserve’s ultra-accommodative monetary policy.”The S&P 500 and Dow were unable to overcome early pressures in the market and closed the day down 0.06% and 0.71% respectively while the NASDAQ displayed early strength against the downturn and managed to close the day up 0.76%.Multiple altcoins experienced double-digit gains on Friday showing that the overall uptrend for the cryptocurrency market remains intact.Uniswap (UNI) has been the best performing top-10 coin, increasing 11.5% to a price of $33.50 while Pundi X (NPXS) saw its price explode 50% higher to an intraday high of $0.0055.The top altcoin Ether (ETH) continues to face resistance above $1,800 with data indicating that bulls may wait until the $1.15 billion worth of ETH options expire on March 26 for them to put on a new show of force.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.803 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 60.5%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

671,"The Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission, or CVM, approved two cryptocurrency ETFs this week — one 100% Bitcoin and the other composed of five cryptocurrencies, in addition to Bitcoin (BTC).For QR Asset Management, manager of the Bitcoin-only ETF, the product could accelerate the launch of a similar product in the United States, since the CVM, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, are part of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, or IOSCO.Both ETFs will be traded on the Brazil's Stock Exchange, or B3. According to Brazil Journal, two of the country's main banks, Itaú and BTG Pactual, have already stated to offer Hashdex's ETF to their customers.The QR ETF will trade on the B3 with the ticker QBTC11, while the one from Hashdex will have HASH11 as its ticker. ETF HASH11 trading is expected to start this month, while QBTC11 ETF is expected to begin in Q2 2021.In the case of QR ETF, the index used to calculate the price of Bitcoin will be the Chicago Commodities Exchange.Fernando Carvalho, CEO of QR Capital, holding company of QR Asset, sees this movement as an important milestone for innovation in the Brazilian capital market. In internal communication with Cointelegraph, he said:Hashdex's ETF will replicate the Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI), an index developed by Nasdaq and Hashdex. In September 2020, the Brazilian Hashdex got approval from the Bermuda regulator and together with Nasdaq, approved the world's first Bitcoin ETF — the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF.Beyond Brazil, the only other country to approve its own Bitcoin ETFs is Canada.NCI consists of six cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), Stellar (XLM), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Chainlink (LINK), and is rebalanced quarterly.Custody of Hashdex's assets is made by companies such as BitGo, Coinbase, Fidelity and Gemini, which are all mediated and regulated in the USA."
672,"EToro’s CEO, Yoni Assia, thinks multiple factors are at play when it comes to the crypto market's current bull run — among them, the economic situation in the United States amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.“I think there is a confluence of circumstances that’s leading for this all-time high, both in crypto, as well in the stock markets,” Assia told Cointelegraph in an interview on Thursday. “We’re seeing unprecedented monetary and fiscal sort of reactions from federal governments all around the world leading to zero interest rates, and even negative interest rates in some places.”Back in March 2020, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $4,000 as COVID-19 prevention measures made global headlines. Since then, however, the crypto market has roared upward, with Bitcoin reaching milestone prices in excess of $60,000 and an overall market capitalization of over $1 trillion.“We’re seeing an unprecedented amount of money being printed by governments all around the world — some of them in a very unique and new concept of direct stimulus checks to consumers,” Assia said. “That has definitely raised the biggest discussion in human history about the value of money — a discussion that started very passionately within the crypto space,” he added, while also mentioning Bitcoin’s scarcity.Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million coins, though not all of these have been distributed as of yet. Every 10 minutes or so, a set number of new coins from this allocation are released into the ecosystem as a reward for miners who contribute to the network. As time goes on, however, the number of coins earmarked for distribution will only go down; in the past decade, the block reward has dropped from 50 BTC to 6.5 BTC. Eventually, there will be no more coins entering circulation, despite a strong, ongoing precedent for increasing investor demand.The network's inherent scarcity is an easy enough concept for normal folks to understand, according to Assia, who further noted that folks are not blind to excessive money-printing and low interest rates in the traditional fiat markets. He also pointed out that crypto and stock purchases are now more globally available to retail buyers, spurring mass-scale involvement from people who may not previously have participated.He reasoned that these factors have also ignited “a renewed interest that hasn’t been seen before since December 2017, so since crypto rally 1.0, we haven’t seen so much interest in cryptocurrency as we are seeing right now with crypto rally 2.0 upon us."""
673,"Bitcoin (BTC) might have been ranging from $57,000 to $59,500 over the last couple of days, but the top traders at major exchanges have increased their long positions. A similar move also happened in the monthly futures contracts, as the basis rate has increased.After marking a $61,750 all-time high on March 13, Bitcoin has been trying to find new support levels. Although BTC initially held ground at $54,000, there currently seems to be decent buying activity around $57,000.While professional traders' optimism (as measured by their long-to-short exposure and the futures contracts premium) has gone down substantially, their interest seems to be picking up, and this is a bullish indicator.The top traders' long-to-short indicator is calculated using clients' consolidated positions, including spot, margin, perpetual and futures contracts. This metric provides a broader view of the professional traders' effective net position by gathering data from multiple markets.Despite the discrepancies between crypto exchange methodologies, analyzing changes over time provides valuable insight.OKEx top traders correctly played the recent BTC price movement as they bought the dip on March 15, moving to a 1.35 ratio favoring longs, which is the highest level seen in two weeks.Huobi top traders saw a similar performance, but on a smaller scale, as they increased their 0.80 ratio to 0.90. Keep in mind, that doesn't necessarily indicate those traders are bearish, as a 10% net short position has been their average over the past 30 days.Lastly, top traders at Binance reduced their longs as BTC crashed on March 15, but they have since kept their 1.21 ratio, which favors longs by 21%.Overall, the average top traders' long-to-short position went from 1.03 (flat) on Jan. 14 to the current 1.15 figure, which favors net longs. Therefore, it's clear that arbitrage desks and whales increased their longs throughout the $500 million liquidation that occurred on March 15.To assess whether professional traders effectively became optimistic, one should monitor the futures premium (also known as basis). This indicator measures the price gap between futures contract prices and the regular spot market.The three-month futures usually trade with a 6% to 20% annualized premium, as sellers demand a higher price to postpone settlement, thus creating a price difference.Take notice of how the indicator marked a 20% low on March 17, right before the BTC price pumped from $55,500 to $58,000. Since then, the basis has improved to 25%, signaling thatprofessional traders have increased their net longs.This data corroborates with the exchanges' long-to-short ratio and displays investors' confidence in Bitcoin breaking a new all-time high in the short-term.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

674,"A group of Bitcoin (BTC) mining companies have put their weight behind Standard Hashrate and its recently launched TAU Protocol, a synthetic asset platform using hash rate derivatives for its peg mechanism.Announced on Friday, the TAU project aims to create algorithmic versions of Bitcoin and other proof-of-work assets through a revisited rebase mechanism. The basic concept is similar to simple rebase coins, including the synthetic Bitcoin offered by Badger. The TAU protocol, however, adds a backstop to the value of its synthetic assets through Bitcoin derived from the mining hash rate.The TAU mechanism relies on Bitcoin Standard Hashrate Token (BTCST), Standard Hashrate’s mining power token that is designed to represent 0.1 terahashes of mining power. Normally, BTCST can be staked to receive an amount of Bitcoin equivalent to the mining hash rate it represents. The TAU protocol takes in BTCST tokens, rewarding stakers with synthetic Bitcoin while pocketing the Bitcoin reward associated with the hash rate token.The Bitcoin collected from BTCST is then used in a collateral pool that is activated whenever the synthetic asset is trading below its peg. The mechanism reduces the number of synthetic tokens in every wallet, while at the same time using its pool of BTC to purchase tokens on the open market and burn them.When the TAU algorithmic token trades above its intended peg, the protocol adjusts the synthetic difficulty parameter to create more tokens from BTCST staking, a somewhat similar mechanism to Empty Set Dollar and other coupon-based coins, which only distribute new supply to special classes of tokenholders.Standard Hashrate is backed by a group of major Bitcoin miners, including Atlas Mining, Btc.Top, Easy2Mine, Genesis Mining and Hengjia Group. The group claims to control 12% of Bitcoin hash rate. The TAU protocol and BTCST tokens only exist on Binance Smart Chain, making it one of few BSC-native original projects.The Standard Hashrate project is an attempt to bridge the world of Bitcoin mining with decentralized finance, securitizing proof-of-work rewards. According to its white paper, the project sees itself as a more transparent, more composable spin on cloud mining, with the goal of creating a two-sided market for hash rate derivatives. Tony Ma, CEO of Atlas Mining, commented on the news:"
675,"Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, or BaFin, has warned investors about the risks involved in cryptocurrency investments.In a consumer protection alert issued on its website on Friday, the regulator offered a cautionary tale about crypto involvement on the part of retail investors.As part of its statement, BaFin echoed similar admonitions espoused by several European regulators including the European Securities and Markets Authority and the European Banking Authority.According to BaFin, retail investors need to be aware of the risks of incurring 100% losses from their crypto investments.While European Union lawmakers are still working toward creating an EU-wide set of laws for digital currencies, German regulators already have some legal framework for digital assets in the country.Crypto custody providers, exchanges and other businesses can only operate in Germany under license from BaFin. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the country legalized digital securities back in December 2020.Under the somewhat clear-cut regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in Germany, some banks in the country have even sought approval to begin offering crypto custody solutions.In December 2020, 224-year-old German bank Hauck & Aufhauser announced plans to establish a cryptocurrency fund.Despite these laws, BaFin said there is no protection against losses for retail consumers in the cryptocurrency space, hence the warning.Crypto investment warnings are a popular occurrence among financial regulators across the globe, especially against the backdrop of the current bull market. Unlike mainstream finance with its qualified investor criteria, the crypto market offers easier market participation channels to “Mom and Pop” investors.In 2021 alone, regulators from South Africa to the United Kingdom, and even Thailand, have issued similar warnings. Back in February, Thailand’s finance minister criticized the current cryptocurrency speculative surge and warned of the potential for massive losses on the part of retail investors.Meanwhile, the European Commission’s Markets in Crypto Assets legislative proposal is still causing some concern among industry stakeholders.Earlier in March, the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications issued a detailed report based on surveys and engagements with crypto industry players indicating that some MiCA provisions were hostile to the growth of startups."
676,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has so far failed to make new all-time highs above $60,000 this week. After the breakout above $58,000, negative news from India along with general macroeconomic weakness and rebounding U.S. dollar appear to have halted the rally. This resulted in a pullback toward $53,000 on March 16. Such a move is normal, as bull markets typically move in waves. In other words, the market will find a new equilibrium of buyers and sellers, after which it will decide where to go next.Overall, the market has been in a significant uptrend, as Bitcoin’s price has accelerated from $11,000 to $60,000 in just six months.The four-hour chart shows apparent support at $53,000, which held once again. The subsequent continuation upward is seen on the four-hour chart of Bitcoin.This upward continuation then met the next big resistance at $58,800 to $60,000. This is the final key resistance level before the next impulse wave toward $68,000 can happen.However, Bitcoin’s price couldn’t break through this resistance zone yesterday, which has pushed it back toward its previous range. The top of this range is $58,800 to $60,000, while the bottom support area is at $54,000 to $55,000 and $53,000.The pressure will likely see a build-up resulting in a breakout to the upside as long as Bitcoin’s price stays inside this range.The daily chart for BTC/USD shows a strong uptrend, which has been the case for six months. This has been confirmed through higher lows and higher highs. As the recent low was created at $42,000, any price above this level means that the bull market is not in danger.On the other hand, the relative strength indicator (RSI) shows a bearish divergence, albeit still invalid. The bearish divergence becomes valid once previous resistance zones turn into resistances once again, and more importantly, once the price of Bitcoin starts to make lower lows.Hence, the $50,000 region is a crucial area to watch as that should become the new higher low region. However, even if $50,000 is lost, the final anchor of support can be found at $42,000 and the 21-Week MA.As long as these regions hold, the uptrend should continue. This should bring Bitcoin’s price to $68,000, as that’s the next Fibonacci level to watch.The daily chart for the total cryptocurrency market capitalization shows a similar structure to Bitcoin’s price.In this regard, the crucial support to hold is the $1.5 trillion level. As long as it holds, continuation toward $2 trillion is very likely. The next Fibonacci level is found between $2 trillion and $2.1 trillion, or almost three times higher than the previous all-time high in 2017.A possible scenario for Bitcoin’s price is further sideways action as BTC/USD compresses. To do this, the market will need to retest the aforementioned support and resistance levels of the current range.After these tests, consolidation will be completed and a new impulse wave can begin. In that regard, the $60,000 barrier may serve as resistance for some time. Thus, a retest of the $55,000 region is on the table as long as $60,000 acts as resistance. Holding the $55,000 support level will open the door to $68,000 as the next point of interest.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

677,"According to Dan Held, growth lead at Kraken, Bitcoin (BTC) is currently experiencing a supercycle that could propel it all the way to $1 million.In Held’s view, this market cycle is fundamentally different from previous ones. “This is a one in a hundred year moment,” he said, mentioning the coronavirus crisis, growing distrust in financial institutions and central bank money-printing as catalysts of the current crypto bull market.“People aren't just in it for a speculative run anymore. People are buying it because they see Bitcoin's value,” he explained.Held is also convinced that once Bitcoin reaches its full potential as digital gold, it will challenge governments’ monopoly over money.“Bitcoin undermines their entire power and authority by removing money from their ownership,” he said.At that point, governments will see crypto as a threat and crackdown on it in what Held defines as a “crypto mass extinction event.” According to Held, altcoins won’t be able to survive such an attack, as most of them are “degrading their censorship-resistance and decentralized properties in order to increase their throughput.” Bitcoin, however, was specifically designed to resist such censorship.“Satoshi built the blockchain to build Bitcoin, and he built it to be an incredibly resilient tool against governments,” Held said.Watch the full interview on our YouTube channel, and don’t forget to subscribe!"
678,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) market capitalization of $1 trillion and potential for continued growth have made the cryptocurrency “too important to ignore,” according to Deutsche Bank analysts.Deutsche Bank Research, the financial research subsidiary of global banking giant Deutsche Bank, issued a report devoted exclusively to Bitcoin, titled “The Future of Payments: Series 2 Part III. Bitcoins: Can the Tinkerbell Effect Become a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy?”In the 18-page study, Deutsche Bank Research describes the basic characteristics of Bitcoin and analyzes the key drivers of its historical price growth to a $1 trillion asset.Deutsche Bank analysts suggested that the Bitcoin price “could continue to rise” further as long as asset managers and companies continue to enter the market. The firm emphasized that central banks and governments now “understand that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are here to stay” and thus are expected to start regulating them by late 2021.Despite its rising valuation, Bitcoin's growth as an asset class could be hampered by its “still limited” tradability and liquidity, Deutsche Bank Research warned. “The real debate is whether rising valuations alone can be reason enough for bitcoin to evolve into an asset class, or whether its illiquidity is an obstacle,” the analysts stated.Bitcoin is expected to “remain ultravolatile” in the short term, Deutsche Bank analysts concluded, forecasting a turning point for Bitcoin in the next “two or three years” as a consensus about its future may emerge."
679,"SBI Crypto, the mining subsidiary of Japanese financial conglomerate SBI Holdings, has opened its mining pool to the general public. As one of the fruits of a strategic partnership between SBI and the German tech firm Northern Data AG, the pool reportedly now ranks 11th globally, according to SBI's announcement on March 19. It mines three assets, Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV), with a revenue measured in dollars per terahash per day of $0.3897, $0.3805 and $0.3519 respectively. Prior to its partnership with Northern Data AG and the Texas-based data center operator Whinstone US back in February 2020, SBI's announcement summarizes the company's mining activities to date as follows:The pool was first opened on a limited release earlier this year, and as of March 19 new users are able to request an account. By April, open signups without requesting an account will be available, with services in English, Mandarin and Japanese. While SBI notes that many of the pool's features are specifically designed for an institutional clientele, individual customers are able to use the service.SBI Holdings' multiple cryptocurrency ventures via various subsidiaries to date have included the introduction of a Bitcoin lending service through its crypto investment subsidiary SBI VC Trade and acquisition of crypto exchange TaoTao via its foreign exchange and derivatives arm. In December 2020, SBI announced a joint crypto-related project with Switzerland’s principal stock exchange SIX Swiss Exchange and has recently hinted at further crypto-related ventures in collaboration with foreign financial firms in the near future.The Japanese conglomerate has also been extensively involved with Ripple, and has been supportive of the company throughout its ongoing legal difficulties in the United States. SBI CEO Yoshitaka Kitao has previously said that Japan would be the most likely country for Ripple to relocate to if it is compelled to leave the U.S. "
680,"Gold may buy less and less Bitcoin (BTC) this year, but another measure of the cryptocurrency's strength has just hit a historic milestone.Data from on-chain analytics service Ecoinometrics shows that on March 17, the so-called Big Sats Index saw a United States McDonald's Big Mac cost less than 10,000 satoshis for the first time.The Big Sats Index measures how much a Big Mac costs based on the famous Big Mac Index from The Economist. Born in 1986, the latter originally came about as a tool to measure the strength of different fiat currencies.The Bitcoin equivalent is something of a tongue-in-cheek commentary on both fiat and food.As Saifedean Ammous argues in ""The Bitcoin Standard,"" both the trillion-dollar forex market and the rise of the nutritionally controversial burger are the results of the abandonment of the gold standard and the embrace of money with no supply limit, and the resulting desire for instant gratification at the expense of long-term prosperity.Nonetheless, the numbers speak for themselves. At around $60,000, a whole Bitcoin buys a whopping 10,402 Big Macs, says Ecoinometrics, while a single burger sets a Bitcoiner back just 9,614 satoshis.By comparison, the March 2020 cross-asset crash briefly took the cost of a Big Mac to over 100,000 satoshis. The last time that the price was 1 million satoshis, however, was in mid-2016.As Cointelegraph further reported, November 2020 was a time when 1 BTC bought just over 3,000 burgers.Big Sats is just one example which captures Bitcoin proponents' core argument that fiat currency ultimately trends to zero against Bitcoin — because fiat has no limits to its supply.The past year, thanks to the coronavirus epidemic, has born out that thesis, as governments expand the money supply of their national currencies faster than at any time outside hyperinflation.A refreshing counterpoint to the trend that came to light this week is MicroStrategy stock (MSTR), which gained rapidly in the second half of last year after CEO Michael Saylor began converting the company balance sheet to Bitcoin. Circulated on social media by Preston Pysh, host of The Investor's Podcast, it shows a peak for MSTR last month before Bitcoin's continued rise coincided with a broader sell-off among tech stocks, including those with Bitcoin exposure."
681,"The now infamous Bank of America research note slamming Bitcoin also contains research suggesting that it takes just $93 million worth of inflows to move Bitcoin’s price by one percent.“Bitcoin is extremely sensitive to increased dollar demand,” said the note authored by Bank of America strategist Francisco Blanch, featuring contributions from Philip Middleton and Savita Subramanian.The analysis found that it would take at least $2 billion worth of inflows to move the price of gold by a single percentile, while more than $2.25 billion would be needed to exert the same price impact on 20-year-plus treasury bonds.“We estimate a net inflow into Bitcoin of just $93 million would result in price appreciation of 1%,” the report concluded, adding:With Bitcoin’s nearly $1.1 trillion market cap equating to roughly 10% of gold’s, the research suggests Bitcoin is twice as volatile as gold per-dollar in-flows despite the asset existing for nearly a dozen years.The Bank of America researchers attribute the small cost needed to move the price of Bitcoin to heavy accumulation from whales diminishing the number of coins available for purchase on exchanges. “Looking at detailed blockchain records, we find that the largest addresses have not been selling in aggregate since the pandemic began,” they stated.Bank of America’s assertions appear broadly in line with findings from crypto analytics firm Glassnode, which estimated that 78% of Bitcoin’s supply was illiquid as of December 2020, leaving just 20% of circulating supply available for trade on exchanges.With the number of new entities active on the Bitcoin network spiking to unprecedented levels, an increasing number of investors are competing for a diminishing pool of BTC, resulting in demand spikes driving prices up with ease.Earlier this month, Glassnode estimated that 95% of BTC traded last moved on-chain in the last three months, further evidencing that whales are stashing away their coins for the long term. The firm’s co-founders, “Jan & Yann,” tweeted:Despite Bank of America’s finding appearing to support Glassnode’s BTC bull-case, the report took a highly negative tone regarding Bitcoin overall — slamming the crypto asset for being volatile, polluting, and an “impractical” means of payment."
682,"Regulators may see crypto's recent growth as a problem, according to Messari CEO and founder Ryan Selkis. “I’ve never been more bullish on crypto but I think everyone might be mispricing global regulatory risk,” Selkis tweeted on Thursday, adding:In the months following its drop below $4,000 in March 2020, Bitcoin (BTC) has surpassed $60,000 in price. DeFi assets have surged over the past year or so as well. Yearn.finance (YFI) went from less than $1,000, all the way up past $48,000, based on CoinMarketCap data. Nonfungible tokens, the current industry craze, may be the biggest of them all — An artist known as Beeple recently sold an NFT artwork for $69M at auction.Selkis noted his price target for taking profit on what one can assume to be Bitcoin, relative to hi regulatory concerns. “I’ve got early sell orders set for $80k,” he said in his tweet. “Selling 5% 80-100k, and another 5% $100-125k,” he said in a separate tweet as a response to one of the comments on his initial post. “Then we'll see where things go from there,” he added.During the last major crypto boom in 2017, initial coin offerings, or ICOs, were the big thing. U.S. regulatory bodies increased their governance on the sector in the years following, taking action against a number of projects. Regulation has also affected crypto in other regions in various fashions, including the European Union, with its 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive. "
683,"Bitcoin (BTC) briefly reclaimed the $60,000 level on March 18 as concerns over the strength of the equities market mounte due to rising U.S. Treasury yields. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that the price of Bitcoin began increasing in the late-night trading hours on March 17, and it briefly crossed above $60,150 before meeting overhead resistance.According to Ben Lilly, an analyst and co-founder of Jarvis Labs, momentum from stablecoin issuance has translated into good price action for BTC over the past two days. This is in contrast to the stop-and-go action in new issuance seen earlier in the month. For Lilly, this indicates that parties interested in buying Bitcoin have begun to “ramp-up” their activities as the market moves higher.Lilly highlighted the upcoming options expiry on March 26 as something that could be influencing recent moves, as “Many traders are locking in their profits that are attached to this expiry,” indicating that there may be subdued trading activity until that date passes.Lilly said:A large number of altcoins also rallied higher on Thursday, thanks to new partnerships and big-name exchange listings.Cardano’s Ada (ADA) has received increased attention over the past three days as several new exchange listings, including being added to Coinbase Pro on March 18, have helped propel the price of ADA to a new all-time high of $1.48. The jump in price also helped ADA pass Binance Coin (BNB) to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.Other notable performances on the day include Theta, which saw its price increase 18% to a new all-time high of $8.35, and Linear Finance (LINA), which saw its price rocket 175% to a new record high following the announcement that it is now available to trade on Binance.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.77 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 60.9%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and you should conduct your own research when making a decision."
684,"Cryptocurrency adoption has been penetrating the mainstream at an exponential rate. While most investors are going straight into buying the likes of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), a few skeptical investors want to invest in the cryptocurrency economy without exposure to tokens’ volatility directly. This volatility is evident in the recent all-time high Bitcoin of around $61,700 reached on March 14, before dropping to trading in the $56,000 range and then rising to around $59,000 at the time of publication. Bitcoin’s market capitalization has now surpassed that of Visa and Mastercard combined.For the overly cautious investors, JPMorgan recently announced its Cryptocurrency Exposure Basket, or CEB, a debt instrument portfolio consisting of 11 stocks. These stocks are either companies that hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset or companies in industries complementary to the cryptocurrency industry.However, the efficiency of such a basket of stocks when compared to Bitcoin remains to be seen. Ben Weiss, president and chief operating officer of CoinFlip — a company running Bitcoin ATMs — told Cointelegraph that this “strategy is viable,” adding: “JP Morgan’s cryptocurrency exposure makes sense for people who want to invest in blockchain and cryptocurrencies traditionally without the volatility of cryptocurrency.”The CEB contains an unequally weighted basket of reference stocks. It allocates 20% to MicroStrategy and 18% to Square. Both of these organizations are led by prominent Bitcoin bulls, Michael Saylor and Jack Dorsey, respectively. More importantly, both companies own Bitcoin as a treasury asset on their balance sheet.MicroStrategy is a publicly traded company that has the largest Bitcoin reserves of 91,326 BTC, valued at $5.25 billion, thus, accounting for 71% of the company’s market capitalization. In comparison, Square owns 8,027 BTC, valued at $461 million, accounting only for 0.4% of the company’s total market cap.However, Joshua Greenwald, chief risk officer at Uphold — a cryptocurrency platform — told Cointelegraph why these stocks could have an adverse impact on investors: “This may prove a dangerous way to get exposure to BTC, as pressure on management for holding large BTC positions might create additional downside leverage on a selloff.”Along with the companies directly holding Bitcoin, even firms that are related to the cryptocurrency industry in an auxiliary fashion were put in the spotlight as well due to their perceived high correlation with Bitcoin. In the CEB, Riot Blockchain and Nvidia Corporation are given allocations of 15% each. The four mentioned companies account for 68% of the debt instruments’ total allocation.Riot Blockchain is a cryptocurrency mining company whose stock has been on an absolute tear since February, showing high correlations with Bitcoin. In addition to being related to Bitcoin due to its mining operation, Riot also owns 1,175 BTC on its balance sheet, valued at around $68 million, which accounts for 1.6% of its overall market capitalization on Nasdaq.Nvidia Corporation is a graphic processing units manufacturer, which is now also used in mining proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like BTC and Ether. The rate at which PoW cryptocurrencies are mined is highly dependent on the power and functionalities of the GPUs being used.The growth of companies such as Riot and Nvidia is directly linked to Bitcoin’s growth due to their participation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This applies to all the exchanges trading Bitcoin products, to energy companies that are getting into Bitcoin mining, and even to payment platforms like PayPal that support Bitcoin.The other crypto auxiliary stocks that are a part of JPMorgan’s CEB are PayPal Holdings, Advanced Micro Devices, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Intercontinental Exchange, CME Group, Overstock.com and Silvergate Capital Corporation. All of these companies are related to crypto and Bitcoin in one way or another, right from being part of the mining and energy process to having Bitcoin products listed on their exchange, as is the case with CME and Bakkt, which is owned by ICE.However, one stock missing from this basket is the Tesla stock. On Feb. 8, Elon Musk’s company bought BTC worth $1.5 billion at the time. This move alone pushed the price of Bitcoin by $3,000 within minutes, showing the impact Musk and Tesla have on the crypto markets. In fact, the CEO’s effect on the crypto market is now famously referred to as the “Musk Effect.” Considering all this, it would be obvious to include Tesla’s stock on the CEB. But JPMorgan’s reason for excluding Tesla’s stock could be that it feels that Tesla’s stock is “dramatically overvalued.”Even Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX — a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange — mentioned to Cointelegraph how Tesla had an interesting correlation with BTC:Although JPMorgan’s CEB could be a “gateway drug” for traditional financial market investors to get into cryptocurrency, the true exposure the basket would give investors to Bitcoin seems limited, according to Weiss:In addition, the potential of high fees for working with legacy systems like those at JPMorgan could also be a concern. Greenwald opined on this: “Following good security hygiene and using a relatively simple-to-use custodial provider will likely prove more cost-effective than the annual fees of most managed solutions.”Additionally, the CEB is not the only way for retail and institutional investors alike to get exposure to Bitcoin through traditionally regulated markets. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust has established itself as a forerunning choice for institutional investors to get exposure to Bitcoin. It is in fact the largest public holder of Bitcoin in the world. It currently owns 649,130 BTC, which is currently valued at around $37 billion.Related: Bitcoin ETF may come to US, but not all crypto investors think it’s neededOn top of Grayscale, two Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have launched in the Canadian markets called Purpose ETF and Evolve ETF. Within a month of their launch, both ETFs combined to have close to a total of $1 billion as their BTC assets under management. Bankman-Fried opined further on the viability of the CEB, saying:Over and above these methods, there are other ways institutions could get exposure to Bitcoin. One major strategy apart from buying Bitcoin as a treasury asset could be to enable digital payments channels. Amazon and Facebook could be the most logical choices for this. Facebook could very well be the first major social marketplace to enable digital payments through its own stablecoin, Diem, formerly known as Libra. Diem is due to launch in 2021 and is touted to be a game-changer among crypto payments, stablecoins and even central bank digital currencies.While it is a great sign that JPMorgan is trying to get in on cryptocurrencies, the debt instrument seems like a Bitcoin ETF in sheep’s clothing with limited upside to Bitcoin as compared to holding the asset itself. Due to this, it’s highly unlikely that seasoned investors will flock to it in the long run, especially when all the Bitcoin has been mined and scarcity begins.Morgan Stanley, a competing investment bank, has taken another route to provide Bitcoin exposure to its clients. On March 17, it announced Bitcoin investing for its wealthy clients. The investment bank has an AUM of $4 trillion and will allow premium clients to invest in Bitcoin through Galaxy Digital’s Bitcoin Fund, Institutional Bitcoin Fund and FS NYDIG Select Fund. There will be an allocation cap for clients at 2.5% of their overall portfolio.This move is indicative of the fact that now is not the time to seek alternative exposure to BTC, given that it’s still at an early stage of adoption. ETFs and such pseudo-ETFs could be a solution in countries where investors are limited by restrictive regulations. Otherwise, there seems to be no real alternative to actually buying and hodling Bitcoin."
685,"Levying a progressive tax on the ultra-wealthy has been a talking point long popular with many United States Democrats, yet such a policy would have been unimaginable under a Republican administration and a split Congress.Now that the Democratic Party is back in control of both the White House and Capitol Hill, the initiative is formally on the table: On March 1, a group of Democratic lawmakers led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren introduced legislation proposing an annual tax on the households and trusts worth more than $50 million, including the value of assets such as real estate and stocks.As new bridges between traditional capital and the digital asset space emerge almost daily, high-net-worth individuals can move value to crypto with more ease than ever before. Would a prospective wealth tax, should it be codified in law, affect their willingness to do so?Marketed as the Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act, Sen. Warren’s bill proposes a 2% annual tax on the net worth of any household between $50 million and $1 billion, and a 3% tax for those worth more than $1 billion. The framers contend that the burden will only fall on the wealthiest 100,000 households in the nation, or the top 0.05% of wealth distribution.The lawmakers argue that the initiative could bring in at least $3 trillion in federal revenue over 10 years — a pool of resources that could be directed to support underfunded areas such as education, childcare and infrastructure.The proposed legislation would have to clear the U.S. Senate before it becomes law. Even though Democrats and Republicans are currently tied 50-50 in the chamber, with the Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris holding a tie-breaking vote, most bills still take at least 60 votes for approval. As Bloomberg noted, Democrats are at least hoping to append some elements of the tax to the budget bill that will be reconciled later in the year.It doesn’t come as unexpected that the initiative received immediate scolding from the political right and center, along with big business circles. In the weeks after the proposal went public, the Wall Street Journal ran several op-eds arguing that the wealth tax would bring more harm than good.One argued that a wealth tax for American millionaires and billionaires would affect the ownership landscape in the U.S. stock market: As big U.S. investors would be pressured to sell their most liquid assets at a discount, their counterparts from tax-free jurisdictions would be happy to buy in. The author of another contended that the outflow of capital from the stock market resulting from taxation of the ultra-wealthy would diminish the value of everyone’s savings.Billionaire Leon Cooperman told CNBC that while he believes that rich people should pay more taxes, Warren’s configuration of the policy “has no merit.” He added: “If the wealth tax passes, go out and buy yourself some gold because people are going to rush to find ways of hiding their wealth.”Wait, but could that gold be digital?Granted, Cooperman’s quip about using gold to hide one’s net worth is metaphorical, a reference to the kinds of assets that can be less visible to the government’s eye compared with those sitting in bank and brokerage accounts. As for the actual gold, the IRS treats precious metals as collectibles subject to long-term capital gains tax. Cryptocurrencies definitely do not belong in either of these categories, as they are neither collectibles (unless they are nonfungible tokens) nor less visible.If the goal is literally to conceal the wealth, resorting to a store of value that is automatically tracked on an open, immutable ledger doesn’t sound like a good idea. Maria Stankevich, chief business development officer at cryptocurrency exchange Exmo UK, commented to Cointelegraph: “Today massive BTC adoption is tightly connected not to the shadow money, but quite to the opposite — to its status of the transparent financial asset.” Tim Byun, global government relations officer at crypto exchange OKCoin, added:Douglas Borthwick, chief marketing officer at digital asset firm INX, said that viewing digital assets and Bitcoin (BTC) as a place to hide wealth is “rather off-base.” While U.S. tax residents can still buy Bitcoin on offshore platforms without rigorous Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering requirements in place, there are serious risks associated with delivery and custody. According to Borthwick, millionaires typically resort to other strategies:OKCoin’s Byun opined that the ultra-rich will continue to preserve their wealth “through tried and true means as they have access to the brightest lawyers, financial advisors and consultants.”Even if digital assets are no good for concealing households’ actual net worth, there could be other avenues for a hypothetical wealth tax to heighten millionaires’ interest in crypto. Here’s one:According to a January report by the tax policy nonprofit Tax Foundation, a wealth tax of 2% to 3% could erase interest earnings on safer investments like bonds and bank deposits. This could become enough of an external shock to make wealthy investors reconsider their portfolios’ structure and recalibrate them so as to give more weight to the more risky yet higher-yield assets.In other words, the hypothetical tax could embolden the rich to invest in cryptocurrencies and crypto derivatives to offset the stagnating gains from more traditional assets."
686,"Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, has failed to break out once more against Bitcoin (BTC) with BTC/USD rallying by more than 8% on March 18.There are two likely reasons why the ETH/BTC pair is failing to break through an important resistance level.First, BTC rallied strongly in a short squeeze after the majority of the market was short throughout the past few days, outperforming most alternative cryptocurrencies.Second, the overall macro landscape for the risk-on market is degrading due to the surging 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which has just hit a 14-month high of 1.75%. This could place more selling pressure on altcoins that have overall lower volume and liquidity than BTC.According to the pseudonymous trader known as ""Trader XO,"" ETH rejected at a key level on the ETH/BTC chart.The trader emphasized that ETH has to remain above the low support area at 0.029 BTC for the bullish short-term market structure to remain intact.If ETH recovers from the range lows at around $1,720 on the ETH/USD pair, then it would have a higher probability of seeing a continuation of the rally. He said:Despite the stagnation of ETH/BTC, analysts say that the fundamentals and on-chain data points of Ethereum remain highly optimistic.A pseudonymous Ethereum analyst and investor known as ""DCinvestor"" noted that the upcoming EIP-1559 proposal and the Proof-of-Staking (PoS) on Ethereum would make ETH more scarce.These two factors combined with the decreasing ETH reserves across exchanges, as Cointelegraph previously reported, generally paint an optimistic outlook for ETH in the medium term. The analyst noted:The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield's momentum is likely the main catalyst behind Bitcoin and ETH's weakening momentum in the past 12 hours, as the inverse correlation shows in the chart below.Portfolio managers and strategists have expressed concerns about the overheating bond market and its potentially negative effect on the risk-on market.Hinesh Patel, a portfolio manager at Quilter Investors, said:Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the rest of the crypto market could decouple from the risk-on market and equities. But, ideally, the U.S. Treasury yield should stabilize for the crypto market to see a sustainable uptrend in the near term."
687,"Different mining machine models and their parameters — such as computing power and energy consumption ratios — can be difficult for users to understand. Fluctuations in hash rates can also have an adverse impact on a user’s income.BitFuFu says it is the world’s first platform that offers standardized mining hash rates. We talk to the company’s independent director, Celine Lu, about how it works, how users benefit, and the key trends that are set to dominate the mining sector in 2021.1. Hello! What does crypto mining standardization involve?The energy efficiency ratios of different brands and models of mining machines currently vary. This is a critical factor that influences the miners’ electricity supply, and overall productivity.That’s why BitFuFu brought up the idea of standardizing mining hash rates — making it much simpler for consumers who are making a purchase. Now, they just need to focus on the energy efficiency ratio instead of a multitude of factors. We’ve adopted a smart algorithm that divides regular computing power into homogenous units that are easy to understand.Our models have been split into three streamlined categories: The classic 30Series, the balanced 40Series, and the more aggressive 50Series.Taking the 30Series as an example, this collection includes the S19Pro Antminer, the S19 Antminer and other mining machine models that offer about 30J/T.2. What are the benefits of this for users?A standardized hash rate is much more convenient and intuitive for users, and ensures making estimates is far easier. From here, they’ll be better equipped when choosing plans on the basis of mining performance.For the mining industry, this leads to more efficient trading and hash rate liquidity, which in turn promotes healthy industry growth. As the hash rate is standardized, it can also be distributed and exchanged between DeFi products, Bitcoin options and other derivatives, and the market's growth would be a hundredfold.3. What is the significance of Bitmain selecting BitFuFu?Bitmain's cooperation brings valuable resources to the platform and optimized economies of scale. As the largest mining company, Bitmain has a wide range of mining resources.When it comes to mining pools and mining machines, Bitman and BitFuFu will be joining forces — starting sales of next-generation equipment in order to expand the global market. The partnership will also make an important contribution to innovation.As the mining platform officially endorsed by Bitmain, BitFuFu has advantages in terms of computing power resources — including lower hash rate costs and stable operations.Of course, the long-term objective of BitFuFu is to reduce barriers to entry so more users (including retail and institutional investors) can obtain high-quality mining services.To meet this goal, BitFuFu has three key areas of focus: Acquiring users, high-quality supply chain integration based on Bitmain’s resources, and developing new business models and potential for expansion.4. What is BitFuFu’s ultimate goal for the future?In the mining sector, there are still huge opportunities — and the proliferation of expansive mining farms has risked shutting out everyday people.BitFuFu’s goal is to enhance the liquidity of hash rates and transform computing power into real revenue.Attracting more prospective users could deliver substantial benefits to the whole mining industry. 5. Why is authenticating mining so important?Authenticity is of utmost importance in not only the mining space, but also for the blockchain and cryptocurrency world in general. In particular, the cloud mining market has been volatile, and we witnessed a slew of major scams in the recent past. For us, BitFuFu and Bitmain's strategic partnership provides legitimacy with its expertise in the industry. Our hash rate schedule management framework allows users to monitor their hash rate on a third-party mining pool platform, while revenues are directly delivered to users through a mining pool.6. There’s been a lot of concern about Bitcoin’s power consumption. What is BitFuFu’s response to this?China faces dilemmas in finding a way to manage electricity supply. Specifically speaking, there is a huge surplus of electricity and the government has to find ways to minimize waste. With supply exceeding demand, local communities are unable to fully absorb the resources. In addition to that, the channels that can be used to distribute these resources are limited.Data suggests the total amount of unused hydropower, wind power and photovoltaic power in 2018 stood at 69.1 billion kWh, 27.7 billion kWh, and 5.49 billion kWh respectively. In total, it resulted in approximately 102.3 billion kWh of wasted energy. In the southwestern and northwestern regions of China, where the waste of electricity is relatively high, timely action must be taken. Local government policies are recommended to ensure spare electricity can be converted into power for mining machines.This problem is a pressing issue for the government, and it is also an opportunity for miners. With proper measures in place, it will stop natural resources from being wasted, all while providing local authorities and residents with tax revenues and wealth respectively.7. You were previously involved in BitDeer. What makes BitFuFu different?I switched to working on the wealth management platform of JD — one of China’s biggest online retailers — after I left BitDeer. Throughout that time, I've benefited immensely.In the role, I was exposed to the basic assets of various standardized wealth management products through asset securitization, risk control tools, and at the same time we have a thorough knowledge of users and the entire process of financial services. Mining products must innovate at a rapid pace. Some people who left the original core team of BitDeer approached me and said they'd like to create another platform. I was really happy for that opportunity, so I brought traditional funds into the business to collaborate with us. As an independent director I have worked to support the team since then, and I think we do an excellent job on the BitFuFu platform.8. Why would users choose BitFuFu?Users come to us because of profitability and authenticity. The return rate mainly depends on the cost of computer power, the overall mining difficulty of the entire network, and the currency’s price. The price of currencies and mining difficulty are both uncontrollable variables that are present across all platforms. For a new generation of mining machines, BitFuFu will cooperate with Bitmain in future on the cost of computational power that can better guarantee returns.Given the uncontrollable factors of the mining difficulty and price, in the future we will be cooperating with Bitmain for a new generation of mining machines that can deliver greater profitability. BitFuFu and Bitmain's strategic partnership, along with real-time monitoring on the BitFuFu website, provide users with protection and enables users to see the status of the computer power activity on the third-party mining pool platform.In short, I think that's why users prefer BitFuFu. We offer a true mining platform.9. How do you expect Bitcoin mining to evolve in the next 12 months?The creation of standardized crypto mining products is bringing creativity to conventional mining and its existing product models.On one hand, it will expand the traditional mining industry to a vast, exponential consumer market. On the other hand, standardized mining consumers have a strong appetite for new product models, and we can develop ideas accordingly from them as we continue to see market growth.Standardized hash rate mining and traditional mining will continue to coexist, while conventional mining entry barriers only increase over time. This means that the industry continues to flourish only for professional and big mining service providers. Standardized hash rate mining is expected to develop quickly. There have been a number of ground-breaking products and new consumers with different needs who have now been motivated to take part in the mining industry. Overall, it is a positive sign for us moving forward.10. Does BitFuFu have any features in the pipeline to tell us about?We now enable users to trade their hash rate resources freely — boosting liquidity in the secondary markets.We also enable other businesses to open a shop on our web platform to sell their own hash rate plans with their brand. More mining machines will be supplied in the future to mine other cryptocurrencies besides BTC soon.Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

688,"Bitcoin (BTC) is superior to gold if investors take the time to study it, says hedge fund manager Anthony Scaramucci.In an interview with CNBC on March 18, Scaramucci, who is CEO of SkyBridge Capital, reinforced his belief in Bitcoin for mainstream audiences.With Bitcoin surging in 2021, questions continue to be asked about whether the gains are coming at the expense of gold, which has failed to capitalize on risks associated with global government money printing.Comparing the two assets, Scaramucci left little doubt as to his preference, arguing that gold may have been the choice for a store of value for 4,000 years, but nothing is forever.""The world is changing — that's the final record, Joe, the world is changing,"" he told host Joe Kernen.The comments fly in the face of staunch gold bugs, notably Peter Schiff, who remains convinced that Bitcoin will fail, leaving gold as the sole choice to escape the perils of central bank economic policy.Continuing, Scaramucci stressed that Bitcoin fulfilled the role of money as technology — a central argument among Bitcoin proponents such as ""The Bitcoin Standard"" author Saifedean Ammous.""And be prudent,"" Scaramucci continued. ""You don't have to own a lot of it, but just some of it.""He also estimates that there are currently around 125 million Bitcoin users, and expects that number to reach 1 billion by 2025.SkyBridge made headlines when it launched a BTC fund in December 2020, at a time when Bitcoin's price was in the midst of one of its parabolic surges towards $30,000.Since then, the institutional trend has merely accelerated. This week, Morgan Stanley became the first major bank to offer clients exposure to Bitcoin funds.As Cointelegraph additionally reported, Robby Gutmann, CEO of fund provider NYDIG, hinted that this week would form the start of a slew of adoption announcements, which would be ""game-changing"" in nature.""Investors are getting hammered by mainstream media with the accurate narrative — bitcoin is superior to gold,"" Anthony Pompliano, co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital, responded to Scaramucci, praising his efforts."
689,"Twitter users can now send Bitcoin (BTC) with a single tweet, after digital payments app Bottlepay launched its integrated Bitcoin social media feature.Transactions between Twitter users can now apparently take place using the simple tweet template “@bottlepay send 1,000 sats to @twitteruser.” The command can be executed from directly within the Twitter app, and the Bitcoin is transferred from one user to another automatically.Bottlepay describes itself as a global payments disruptor, and raised $15 million in a seed funding round towards the end of February. The Bottlepay app can also be used with other social media platforms, such as Reddit and Discord. The beta version of the app reportedly attracted 20,000 users without marketing and processed $2.4 million worth of transactions in just over a month since launching on Feb. 10.Given the extent to which Bitcoin transaction fees exploded from 2020 into 2021, the coin’s suitability for use in a daily, social payments app could reasonably be brought into question. Bottlepay circumvents Bitcoin’s high transaction fees by using the Lightning Network, a second-layer solution that avoids network congestion by taking BTC transactions off-chain.“Bottlepay’s social Bitcoin payments are a much-needed update on the clunky, outdated payment systems available up until now, and a leap towards smoother, easier transactions,” said Bottlepay CEO Mark Webster."
690,"Cryptocurrency startup Fireblocks has raised $133 million in a Series C funding round.The investment round was led by venture capital firms Coatue, Ribbit and Stripes, with strategic investment from BNY Mellon and Silicon Valley Bank.Michael Shaulov, CEO of Fireblocks, said the cash injection will allow the company to expand the settlement infrastructure needed to onboard new customers as crypto adoption heats up:Regarding his firm’s investment in Fireblocks, Micky Malka of Ribbit Capital said, ""We are standing at the cusp of the biggest transformation that the world's financial system has ever seen,” adding that Fireblocks is at the “forefront of this revolution.”Series C funding is usually geared toward more developed projects that have already achieved a fair degree of success. These companies require additional capital to help scale their products and services into new markets or even to acquire other businesses.Fireblocks was founded in 2018 by veterans of Israeli military intelligence including Michael Shaulov, who previously co-founded a mobile security startup, Lacoon Mobile Security. The firm specializes in digital asset custody and also works on accelerating the speed of digital transactions. According to the Wall Street Journal, the latest funding round brings Fireblocks’ valuation to over $900 million, with the firm raising a total of $179 million so far.Fireblocks has been a magnet for venture capital firms looking to capitalize on the growing institutional demand for Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies. Before its Series C fundraiser, Fireblocks had already raised a cumulative $179 million from investors like Galaxy Digital, Swisscom Ventures, Paradigm, Tenaya Capital and Cyberstarts.Through Fireblocks, banks and fintech companies can connect to the cryptocurrency market by offering custody, tokenization, asset management, trading, lending and payment solutions. Since its inception three years ago, the company claims to have secured $400 billion in digital assets on behalf of its customers. Its institutional clients include Nexo, Celsius, BlockFi, Salt and Coinsquare.BNY Mellon is not the only banking institution that has been preparing to launch its own crypto custody solution. Deutsche Bank is also planning to move into the crypto custody business, along with offering trading and token issuance services.Bryan Routledge, associate professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University, claimed that crypto custody is not that different from traditional services already offered by legacy banks. Storing a public and private key pair is important, “But it’s not that difficult,” or should not be for most banks, he said.Additional reporting by Sam Bourgi."
691,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission now has 45 days to deliver an initial decision on the VanEck Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund filing having officially published the company’s submission on its website on March 15.Now, the SEC has to approve, decline or extend the review period for the Bitcoin ETF filing within the 45-day window. The SEC can extend the deliberation window up to 249 days before delivering a final decision. The public also has a three-week period to submit comments on the SEC website.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, or CBOE, filed to list the VanEck Bitcoin ETF back in January. VanEck was one of the BTC ETF hopefuls back in 2017 when several companies were looking to gain SEC approval for a Bitcoin ETF.At the time, the asset management outfit partnered with blockchain startup SolidX to file a joint Bitcoin ETF. However, the VanEck/SolidX BTC ETF was withdrawn before the SEC delivered a decision on the filing.Back in January, SolidX filed a lawsuit against VanEck, accusing the latter of plagiarizing its Bitcoin ETF. According to the details of the complaint, SolidX said VanEck acted in bad faith by going ahead to file a Bitcoin ETF based on its work.With the change in leadership at the commission following Jay Clayton’s departure back in December 2020, firms in the U.S. are trying once again for a Bitcoin ETF. Clayton’s SEC tenure saw the commission reject nine Bitcoin ETFs.The unregulated nature of the Bitcoin spot market was a popular refrain attached to each rejection. During the period, the SEC routinely pointed to this issue as a cause for concern stating that price manipulation was not difficult to achieve, hence a BTC ETF approval was off the table.Earlier in March, New York-based asset management firm WisdonTree submitted a Bitcoin ETF filing with the SEC. Meanwhile, some market commentators say BTC ETF approvals in Canada may spur the commission to reconsider its previous reticence.Indeed, the month of February saw Canadian securities regulators approve a couple of Bitcoin ETFs, becoming the first of such investment products in North America. Following the initial success of these ETFs, some firms are now looking to expand their catalog by launching Ether (ETH) ETFs."
692,"Most Americans who expect to receive the next round of relief bill stimulus checks will use the money to buy necessities and pay off debts, but some are still willing to invest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), a new poll reveals.A study conducted by Harris Poll on behalf of Yahoo Finance showed that 15% of people who received the last two rounds of stimulus checks directed some or all of the money towards investments. Of that group, around half invested in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) specifically.The trend is expected to continue when the first of the latest stimulus checks are sent out at the end of March, according to the poll results. The number of recipients who plan to invest some of their checks increases to 17% this time, while the overall number of crypto buyers remains fairly stable, at 41% of the would-be investor group.Paying for basic necessities like rent, groceries and medicine was the foremost concern for poll respondents, 62% of whom said they needed the funds to cover the cost of essential needs.A sizable segment were still able to save some of the money received from the first stimulus check (36%) and the second (33%), and the latest responses show that figure is expected to increase to 40% when the third check is issued.A willingness to experiment financially with the COVID-19 stimulus funds is found more readily in high-income households. Among respondents from households earning more than $100,000 per year, 10% invested in cryptocurrencies using their first stimulus check, and 13% with their second. That figure is expected to rise to 14% this time around. Comparatively, just 3% of households making less than $50,000 per year were able or willing to invest in cryptocurrencies.The survey was conducted among 1,052 U.S. adults in an online setting, which naturally skews the data. Another recent survey, from a much smaller sample size, suggested that around 10% of the $400 billion issued to individuals in the next round of stimulus checks could make its way into Bitcoin."
693,"The Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, or KP, has formed a federal committee to create a new cryptocurrency policy including government-backed crypto mining.As part of the new policy, the KP Crypto Advisory Committee has already decided to pilot two hydroelectric-powered crypto mining farms, a minister overseeing the policy told Reuters.The committee held its first meeting on March 17, Zia Ullah Bangash, advisor to the provincial government on science and technology announced on Twitter. “The KP Government on the directions and guidance of chief minister Mahmood Khan is taking serious steps regarding cryptocurrency and mining. We’re consulting with all stakeholders and experts for this initiative,” Bangash wrote.The KP Crypto Advisory Committee was formed in order to review and discuss “necessary steps to regulate, legalise, and necessary legislation.” Local crypto advocate and influencer Waqar Zaka apparently played a significant role in setting up the committee, claiming that he was the one who convinced the local government to launch the initiative. “I’m thankful to Waqar Zaka for his full cooperation and support to the KP government,” Bangash said.According to local reports, the KP is the first of four provinces in Pakistan to launch an advisory committee focused on crypto and mining. The province has been urging the central government to legalize crypto, going so far as to pass a resolution in December 2020 that demanded legislative action on a federal level.The State Bank of Pakistan banned crypto in the country in 2018, declaring that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) were not legal tender. Despite the years of an official ban, Pakistan residents apparently did not stop investing in crypto. “It’s really just our government that is not participating right now, people all over Pakistan are already working on this, either mining or trading in cryptocurrencies and they are earning an income from it,” Bangash said."
694,"Ryan Watkins, a senior research analyst at crypto analysis firm Messari, has speculated that Ether (ETH) could overtake Bitcoin (BTC) as the largest crypto asset once its Eth2 and proof-of-stake overhaul is complete.Appearing on YouTube show FinTech Today on March 18, Watkins noted that while he does not know “if or when” Ether will flip Bitcoin, he does believe Ether could emerge as the leading crypto asset in the future, due to Eth2, stating:Watkins also emphasized Ether’s changing underlying economics amid the Eth2 transition, highlighting expectations that Ethereum’s forthcoming burn mechanism will result in Ether being destroyed at a rate exceeding the creation of new supply.He posted the question: “If Ethereum is more secure and it [has] a stronger monetary policy, well then what is the bull case for Bitcoin in this scenario?”Watkins also noted the “massive” and “diverse” economy being built on Ethereum, suggesting the network’s booming decentralized application sector will attract new users at a greater pace than Bitcoin over time.“At a certain point, the economy of Ethereum begins to attract so much capital, both human capital and financial capital, that it is actually a force in the global economy,” he said. “The GDP of Ethereum is actually rivaling many large countries.”“People can earn livings in this economy,” he added.According to Blockchain Center’s “Flippening Index,” which uses eight metrics to measure Ethereum’s strength relative to Bitcoin, Ethereum is currently 65.6% as strong as Bitcoin — having retraced from an all-time high of 72.3% in early February.The index suggests Ethereum has already overtaken Bitcoin by node count, transaction count and total transaction fees."
