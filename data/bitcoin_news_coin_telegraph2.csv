0,"Bank of America analysts have slammed Bitcoin as ""exceptionally volatile"", ""impractical"" and an environmentally disastrous asset that's useless as a store of wealth or an inflation hedge.For good measure the report also asserted the cryptocurrency is an impractical method of payment as it can only handle 1,400 transactions per hour compared to the 236 million transactions processed by Visa.The research note — which echoes the hardline stance taken against crypto by traditional financial institutions in years past — is in stark contrast to other major banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, which have since embraced Bitcoin as an asset.Contradicting the notion that Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million will inevitably drive price growth over time, the report argues BTC’s price is driven by supply and demand — asserting that because the supply is fixed, fluctuating demand is the only thing driving the price.Lead author Francisco Blanch (a team of nine other strategists contributed to the report) also dismissed the idea that Bitcoin is a safe haven asset. “Bitcoin has also become correlated to risk assets, it is not tied to inflation, and remains exceptionally volatile, making it impractical as a store of wealth or payments mechanism,” the Bank of America researcher stated.Given many investors are mainly concerned with returns, Bitcoin's track record of appreciation as the best performing asset over the past ten years may see them dismiss such criticisms.However, perceptions about Bitcoin’s negative environmental impact may pose a threat to increasing corporate and institutional adoption, as it conflicts with the 'triple bottom line' accounting that climate conscious shareholders are increasingly focused on.BoA states that Bitcoin has a higher carbon footprint than any other human activity in terms of dollar-for-dollar inflows, with the report estimating that Bitcoin's energy usage has grown more than 200% in the past two years and is now comparable to the Netherlands, Greece and the Czech Republic.While Bitcoiners often cite figures suggesting that between 39% and 76% of Bitcoin mining uses renewable energy, BoA's report asserts that in fact three quarters of BTC mining occurs in China where more than half of electricity is produced by coal. Further, it states half of all Chinese mining occurs in Xinjiang province where 80% of power comes from coal.(This ignores the seasonal migration of miners to Sichuan to take advantage of cheap hydroelectric power during the rainy season. Coinshares estimates that it's actually miners in the Sichuan province that account for 50%-66% of global hashrate.)BoA states that rising prices drive up mining difficulty which inexorably adds to Bitcoin mining’s carbon output.BoA calculated that a $1 billion investment in Bitcoin produces the same carbon emissions as 1.2 million petrol powered cars over the course of a year — which means Tesla's $1.5 billion investment is equivalent to adding 1.8 million petrol powered cars onto the roads each year, undermining the electric car maker's environmental credentials.And retail 'wholecoiners' weren't spared from environmental blame with the analyst claiming:  ""A single Bitcoin purchase at a price of ~$50,000 has a carbon footprint of 270 tons, the equivalent of 60 ICE [petrol] cars.""Leaving no criticism alone, Blanch also noted 181 companies faced risks linked to Bitcoin around ""money laundering, corruption, bribery, fraud, and breaches of data privacy"" and that Central Bank Digital Currencies also pose tremendous long term threats to Bitcoin.It’s worth noting the BoA report mainly documents the view of a single analyst and opinions vary within large organizations. Even at the overall pro-Bitcoin Goldman Sachs, some divisions have made similar criticisms of Bitcoin, while other divisions talk up Bitcoin as the future.It’s clients may also disagree with the analysis. Bank of America’s January fund manager survey found that going 'long Bitcoin' was the 'most crowded trade' of the month.This article has been updated to note the report was produced by a team of strategists."
1,"Optimism returned across the cryptocurrency market on March 17 following a brighter economic forecast from the U.S. Federal Reserve and comments which hinted at the possibility of an interest rate hike in 2022 if employment and economic indicators continue to improve. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that Bitcoin struggled below the $57,000 level during early trading hours until the announcement from the U.S. Federal Reserve sparked a rally which took BTC to an intraday high of $58,243.Bullish momentum for the top cryptocurrency began to build after it was revealed that institutional banking giant Morgan Stanley will soon offer certain investors access to three funds that allow clients to own Bitcoin.Further validation for a continuance of the current bull market came from Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow creator PlanB, who feels that BTC “will not stop” at $100,000 and could reach an average price as high as $288,000 with its all-time high registering even higher.After subdued trading in the early hours on Wednesday, equities markets saw an uptick in activity following Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments which sparked rallies in stocks and the major indices.The S&P 500, Dow and NASDAQ finished the day up 0.29%, 0.58% and 0.40% respectively. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note also saw an increase of 1.23% to 1.641Select altcoins also moved higher after Grayscale Investments announced that it had added five new products to its lineup, offering exposure to Basic Attention Token (BAT), Chainlink (LINK), Decentraland (MANA), Filecoin (FIL) and Livepeer (LPT).ANNOUNCEMENT: 5 new products have been added to the @Grayscale line up!

2,"Betting on an $80,000 Bitcoin call options for June doesn't seem outrageous given BTC's bullish performance over the past few weeks. This was not the case a couple of months ago when BTC peaked at $42,000 on Jan. 8 and subsequently dropped to the $30,000 level. At that time, a 150% upside was needed from the $32,000 price on Jan. 26, and this seemed quite far-fetched. Therefore, the June $80,000 BTC call (buy) options traded at Deribit for $2,240, or 0.07 BTC.Less than two months later, as BTC reached $61,700 on March 13, the same call option peaked at BTC 0.15, or $9,255. That's a 3x gain in less than seven weeks. Keep in mind that despite the 93% rally to $61,700, an additional 30% upside was needed to reach the $80,000 strike.Despite the recent BTC price increase, the implied options probability (delta) currently sits at 39%. That call option price has also increased due to the BTC volatility change as sellers will request a more substantial premium for taking the risk during uncertain markets.Intense price swings, regardless of the direction, will push volatility higher, and unexpected news from major media outlets usually drives the indicator up.Take notice of how BTC volatility spiked from 4% in January to the current 5%. This event is notably bullish for call option buyers. Even if the BTC price had stayed the same, the option price would have climbed accordingly.Options pricing is also heavily dependent on how distant the expiry date is. The same $80,000 call might be deemed worthless two days ahead of maturity. Therefore, traders should not obsess too much on implied options probability (delta).Right now, the $80,000 June call option might seem far-fetched due to its 39% delta and the fact that BTC gained 43% in the last 100 days.Nevertheless, traders often consider buying 'impossible' call options with longer expiry dates, as those who were brave enough to bet on the 150% BTC price increase to $32,000 in January are probably extremely satisfied with the results.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

3,"Institutional investors have continued to pump money into cryptocurrency investment products in Q1 of this year, according to a report by CoinShares. The inflows of $4.2 billion in the first quarter have broken the previous record of $3.9 billion made in the fourth quarter of 2020.NYDIG CEO Robby Gutmann recently told listeners of the “On the Brink” podcast to brace for a slew of announcements by the firm’s strategic partners. Gutmann said the announcements could bring new levels of “Bitcoin adoption, Bitcoin availability, Bitcoin products and services within the existing traditional financial landscape.”While new products and services that may attract fresh investors are a positive sign, traders should also keep an eye on the price of Bitcoin (BTC). In a bull market, every positive development is cheered by a sharp rise in price.However, when the price stops reacting positively to favorable news, it is a sign of exhaustion. That does not guarantee a change in trend, but being watchful could safeguard traders from short-term pain.Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the next possible trending move.Bitcoin rebounded off the 20-day exponential moving average ($53,739) on March 16 but the bulls are struggling to hold on to higher levels. This suggests profit-booking by traders on minor rallies.However, if the bulls again defend the 20-day EMA, it will indicate accumulation at lower levels. That could result in a move back to the all-time high at $61,825.84. A breakout of this resistance will signal the possible start of the next leg of the up-move that may reach $72,112.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears can sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bullish momentum has weakened. The BTC/USD pair could then drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($47,451) where the bulls are likely to step in.The strength of the rebound off the 50-day SMA could provide further insights about the next possible move. A weak bounce will increase the possibility of a drop to the next support at $43,006.77. On the other hand, a strong rebound will suggest the uptrend remains intact.The bulls are struggling to hold Ether (ETH) above the 20-day EMA ($1,743). Although the long tail on the March 16 candlestick suggests demand at lower levels, the failure to build upon that recovery today indicates hesitation by the bulls at higher levels.The repeated retest of a support level, within a short duration, tends to weaken it. If the bears sink the price below the moving averages, the ETH/USD pair could gradually start its descent to $1,455 and then to the critical support at $1,289.Both moving averages are flattening out and the RSI is near the midpoint, suggesting a possible consolidation for the next few days. This neutral view will invalidate if the price bounces off the current level and breaks above the all-time high at $2,040.77.If that happens, it will enhance the prospects of the resumption of the uptrend with the next target objective at $2,614.Binance Coin (BNB) has been trading near the 20-day EMA ($247) for the past two days. However, the failure to rebound off it with strength indicates a lack of urgency among the bulls to buy at the current levels.The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI is just above the midpoint, suggesting a possible range-bound action for a few days. If that happens, the BNB/USD pair could remain stuck inside $189 and $309.50 for a few more days.The next down move could start when the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA ($179). That could result in a deeper correction to $120. Conversely, if the bulls can propel the price above $209.50, the pair may retest the all-time high at $348.69.Cardano (ADA) soared and closed above the $1.23 overhead resistance on March 16. However, the bulls are struggling to sustain the bullish momentum today, which suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.If the price dips and sustains below $1.23, it will suggest that the range-bound action may continue for a few more days.However, the 20-day EMA ($1.11) has started to turn up and the RSI is trying to rise above 60, suggesting that the bulls are attempting to gain the upper hand.If the bulls can defend the breakout level at $1.23, the ADA/USD pair could rise to $1.48. A breakout and close above this resistance could indicate the resumption of the uptrend.Polkadot (DOT) has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern. Usually, this setup acts as a continuation pattern, but in some cases, it is also known to signal a reversal of the existing trend. Therefore, it is better to wait for the price to break above or below the triangle to determine the next possible trend.The flat 20-day EMA ($34.85) and the RSI near the midpoint are not hinting at a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.If the bears can sink the price below the support line of the triangle, the DOT/USD pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($29.46) and then to $26. The pattern target of the symmetrical triangle is much lower.On the other hand, if the price turns up and breaks above the triangle, it will suggest that the bulls have overpowered the bears. That could start a rally to the pattern target at $55.XRP jumped above the $0.50 overhead resistance on March 17, but the long wick on the candlestick suggests the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. This shows that traders are closing their positions on every minor rally.The flat moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest the XRP/USD pair could remain range-bound between $0.35 and $0.50 for a few more days.If the bulls want to gain the upper hand, they will have to push and sustain the price above $0.50 overhead resistance. If that happens, the pair could rally to $0.65.Alternatively, if the bears sink the price below the $0.35 support, it could lead to panic selling. The next support on the downside is $0.25 and then $0.17.The long tail on Uniswap’s (UNI) March 16 candlestick shows the bulls are buying the dips to the 20-day EMA ($28.91). However, the long wick on today’s candlestick shows the bears are selling at higher levels. This suggests a tussle between the bulls and the bears at the 20-day EMA.The negative divergence on the RSI shows the bullish momentum has weakened. Traders may aggressively book profits if the price sustains below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($24) and then to $20.This bearish view will invalidate if the UNI/USD pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA and rises above the all-time high at $34.92. Such a move will indicate the possible resumption of the uptrend.Litecoin (LTC) is trading inside a large symmetrical triangle. The bulls are currently attempting to defend the 20-day EMA ($198) while the bears are trying to sink the price below it.If the price slips below the 20-day EMA, a drop to the 50-day SMA ($183) and then to the trendline of the triangle is possible. A break below the triangle will signal advantage to the bears and open the doors for a possible fall to $153 and then $120.Conversely, if the price rebounds off the current level, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the LTC/USD pair above the triangle. If they succeed, the pair could start its upward march.The bulls purchased the dip below the 50-day SMA ($28) on March 16 and have followed it up with a strong up-move today. If buyers can propel Chainlink (LINK) above the $32 overhead resistance, a rally to $36.93 is possible. A break above this resistance may start the next leg of the uptrend.Contrary to this assumption, if the price once again turns down from $32, it will indicate that bears are aggressively defending this level. The LINK/USD pair could then drop to the moving averages and stay range-bound between $24 and $32 for a few days.The flattish moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint also suggest a few days of consolidation. The bears could gain an upper hand if they can sink and sustain the price below $24.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has broken below both the moving averages. The bulls tried to push the price back above the 20-day EMA ($538) on March 16 but failed. Today’s inside-day candlestick pattern indicates indecision among the bulls and the bears.The 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, which shows the bears are attempting to gain the upper hand. If the bears can now sink the price below $502, the altcoin could start its journey to $440.This bearish view will be invalidated if the price turns up from the current level and rises above $560. Such a move will suggest strong buying at lower levels. The BCH/USD pair could then move up to $631.71.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

4,"Institutional banking powerhouse Morgan Stanley seems to have given Bitcoin its nod of approval. Based on fresh intel via an “internal memo”, as reported on by CNBC, Morgan Stanley will give clients access to Bitcoin (BTC) investing, though only under specific conditions. “The investment bank, a giant in wealth management with $4 trillion in client assets, told its financial advisors Wednesday in an internal memo that it is launching access to three funds that enable ownership of bitcoin, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter,” CNBC reported on Wednesday. The opportunity is expected to open in April, according to the sources.Bitcoin interest from mainstream finance has risen significantly over the past year or so, with players such as MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Square buying large stacks of BTC.Participants in Morgan Stanley’s wealth management wing can gain access to Bitcoin through Galaxy Digital’s Bitcoin Fund LP and Institutional Bitcoin Fund LP, as well as FS Investments’ FS NYDIG Select Fund, although allocation is capped at 2.5% of each client’s overall wealth.Clients must also carry accredited investor status, hold capital at Morgan Stanley valuing $2 million or more, and maintain a certain account history. That minimum raises to $5 million for investment firm clientele. Each fund also comes with minimum investment conditions, CNBC noted.Bitcoin has come a long way since its inception in 2009. Rising in price from less than $1 to up past $60,000, BTC is now widely accepted as a viable investment. Bigger than numerous notable companies, Bitcoin's total market cap has also surpassed the $1 trillion mark. Although it has gained significant status in the public eye, BTC still has ground to cover in terms of becoming a staple in the investing world.  "
5,"The idea of market cycles is widely accepted in finance. The most basic principle is that what goes up must come down. The underlying rationale is that investors will accumulate when prices are low, causing prices to rise. As the price reaches a peak, sell pressure will take over as holders seek to cash out, thereby pushing the price back down. If you bought Bitcoin (BTC) in 2017 or earlier, this will sound eerily familiar. It essentially describes what happened during the last bull run when BTC hit a high of $20,000. Therefore, most crypto holders are watching the current market conditions with bated breath.But so far, apart from a few corrections, prices have held, or at least swiftly regained the losses. What are the chances it will continue? Can we expect 2021 to play out similarly to 2017 and early 2018, or is the cycle of the current run only just starting?In terms of the similarities between now and 2017, there are some critical parallels, the first of which is the relationship between BTC prices and the mining reward halvings. Each time the mining reward halves, it introduces new scarcity to Bitcoin’s supply.The second halving was in July 2016, and within 18 months, Bitcoin had climbed around 3,900%, rising from $500 to a high of $20,000 before crashing. The third halving was in May 2020 when BTC was trading around $9,000. Nine months later, Bitcoin was able to reach a new all-time high at around $62,000, gaining 560% in the process.In the same period following the 2016 halving, the gains were significantly less in percentage terms, with BTC having risen around 150% by April 2017. If the markets follow the same pattern, they will witness even more epic increases followed by a sharp crash. Of course, such price movements after a halving only apply to Bitcoin. But where BTC goes, the rest of the markets tend to follow.There are also some correlations between on-chain metrics in 2017 and 2021. Both 2017 and 2021 show a high percentage of BTC being accumulated and held, according to Glassnode. In fact, the months in the run-up to the 2021 bull run show that more BTC was being held inactively than at any time in history.Active addresses have also recently hit an all-time high above 22 million, beating the previous high of 21.6 million, which occurred in December 2017.Perhaps less tangible but still relevant is the sense of euphoria that echoes back to 2017. The ballooning markets for decentralized finance and nonfungible tokens, the meme stocks spectacle followed by an unexpected resurgence of Dogecoin (DOGE), and the general excitement around the crypto markets are all reminiscent of the heady days of the initial coin offering era.Despite the similarities, there are also many differences between the crypto markets now compared to 2017, mainly relating to an advanced state of maturity. Four years ago, crypto was entirely the preserve of individual retail speculators. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Simon Kim, CEO of crypto venture fund Hashed, said that the “market is running on a completely different fundamental,” adding:The banks in question include Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, which have all recently announced plans to integrate cryptocurrencies, creating further bullish signals. And don’t forget the boost that came from Tesla announcing that it had invested $1.5 billion into BTC.Chad Steinglass, head of trading at crypto capital markets firm CrossTower, elaborated on why the entry of corporate investors, banks and payments giants is significant and made a prediction on the kind of mainstream adoption that’s been discussed for so long:The widespread availability of derivatives is another factor that helped drive prices this time around. It may be hard to believe, but back in 2017, there were only a few exchanges, mainly BitMEX and OKEx, offering futures trading. Institutional futures offerings only arrived in December 2017 when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board Options Exchange both launched their own Bitcoin-backed contracts.Although there was some speculation at the time that these launches precipitated the start of the crypto winter, it’s undoubtedly the case that the availability of derivatives has attracted more professional investors, ultimately helping to push prices.Of course, none of the above would have been possible in 2017, given the amount of regulatory uncertainty that existed at the time — another factor that points to things being different this time around.The metrics also point to some differences between the 2017 cycle and this one. One that stands out is the variance in Bitcoin dominance. Throughout 2017, BTC’s dominance dropped dramatically from 85% to a low of 32% — which is the lowest point it’s ever been. The fall reflects an appetite for altcoins, which came on the back of Ethereum’s launch and the subsequent ICO boom.In contrast, since BTC recovered to 60% dominance in the summer of 2019, it has been holding pretty steady around that mark. Ether (ETH) has also shown similar patterns. Since the epic price rises of 2021, both BTC and ETH have seen small increases in dominance at the expense of the broader altcoin markets. Therefore, these metrics imply that the new generation of investors is less fickle and more committed to BTC and ETH as flagship assets.Related: Good correction? Bitcoin price regains $57K as institutions buy the dipBitcoin price volatility has also decreased somewhat over recent years, at least in relative terms. As recently noted by Bloomberg, rolling 60-day volatility is lower now than it was during the last peak.However, the term “relative” is key here. With a price of $60,000, a 5% price fluctuation results in swings of $3,000. At the mid-2017 price of $1,200, a 5% movement would have seen prices swing between $1,140 and $1,260. In terms of real profits and losses, the difference is chasmic.Exchange flow volume is another metric worth considering. In contrast with the 2017 bull run, far less BTC is being put through exchanges in 2021. This indicates investors are keen to keep holding, making BTC scarcer to traders and driving the price even higher.Zooming out, the big picture looks vastly different now compared to 2017. Although much of the stock market has fared better than expected under the pressure of the ongoing pandemic, investors face far more uncertainty now than they did years ago. This has likely created a bullish case for Bitcoin as a safe haven asset, which is also reflected in gold prices.Simon Peters, a market analyst at eToro, believes that while there may be further volatility, a price crash is perhaps avoidable, telling Cointelegraph: “I think at some point there will be a significant Bitcoin market correction but not the 80%–90% declines we have seen in the past.” He went on to provide reasoning for the upcoming shift:Furthermore, the pandemic has accelerated the transition into all things digital. The looming prospect of central bank digital currencies and a growing dependence on digital payments creates an even more powerful case for cryptocurrencies as an entirely digital asset class.If we weigh all the various factors, it seems that the argument for this bull run being somewhat different from the 2017 cycle is more compelling. Although it’s highly plausible that the markets will undergo further corrections at some point, it appears to be less likely that there will be a crash as sudden and dramatic as the one that occurred in early 2018.However, even in a more mature state and with a very different flavor, the crypto markets are still the crypto markets, and history can confirm that anything is possible."
6,"Bitcoin (BTC) has plenty of room to grow in its current bull run and “will not stop” at $100,000, according to analysts including PlanB.In various posts on social media on Wednesday, the stock-to-flow Bitcoin price model creator joined others in predicting huge new all-time highs for BTC/USD.With Bitcoin trading sideways below both its recent peaks of $58,300 and $61,700, investors are curious about where the 2021 bull run may end.As Cointelegraph reported, depending on the price indicator used, the peak could be uncomfortably near or still far off. For followers of stock-to-flow, the answer remains firmly the latter: Compared with previous bull cycles, 2021 is just getting started.“We are only 3.5 months into the Bitcoin bull market,” PlanB summarized.He referenced both his stock-to-flow, or S2F, and stock-to-flow cross-asset, or S2FX, models, which give an average BTC/USD price forecast of $100,000 and $288,000 during the current halving cycle, set to end in 2024.This is just the average, however, and PlanB believes that the peak of this cycle could be double those figures or even more — potentially in excess of $576,000.Currently, Bitcoin is following the stock-to-flow trajectory almost to the letter — “like clockwork,” as PlanB described it — and has yet to give off signs that the cycle top is approaching.As fellow analyst Rekt Capital noted, such signs tend to come in the form of BTC/USD jumping above the planned trajectory.“Upside price deviations from the Stock to Flow line tend to precede Bull Market tops for BTC,” the Twitter account wrote.Despite the stock-to-flow model not existing during the top of Bitcoin’s first halving cycle price peak in 2011, it achieved a trajectory deviation equal to 1,157%.Continuing, PlanB highlighted December as the deadline for $288,000 to hit. In Twitter responses, he reasoned that the bull run has “at least some more months to go.”"
7,"It has been 37 days since Tesla announced its $1.5 billion Bitcoin (BTC) purchase in a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.The exact BTC purchase size was not revealed in the document, but with Bitcoin trading between $29,000 and $37,000 in January, Tesla’s $1.5 billion outlay could mean the company holds at least 40,000 BTC.Based on these speculative figures and the Bitcoin price increase since the end of January, Tesla’s 40,000 BTC minimum is now worth $2.2 billion. This figure translates to $700 million in unrealized profit.Thus, Tesla is sitting on close to $19 million in unrealized profit per day over the 37-day period since it announced its Bitcoin purchase.The electronic vehicle manufacturer earned $31.54 billion in revenue from the sale of 499,550 cars in 2020 to deliver a profit of $721 million. Tesla’s Bitcoin ownership has almost eclipsed this profit margin, especially seeing as the above analysis only considered the company’s likely minimum BTC stash.Taking car sales across the year as a flat average, Tesla sold approximately 1,368 cars per day at a daily profit of $1.98 million.As stated earlier, Tesla has made $19 million in unrealized profits per day holding Bitcoin. To achieve this feat in its actual business, the company would have to increase its daily car sales by over 860% with all other factors remaining constant from 2020.With Bitcoin touted by some to experience a yearlong bull market, with some predictions forecasting a six-digit price valuation for BTC, Tesla’s unrealized gains from holding the asset might outrank its car manufacturing by several orders of magnitude.The largest crypto by market capitalization is up almost 90% year-to-date and has increased more than tenfold over the last year."
8,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has stressed the importance of developing additional measures to fight against illegal cross-border transactions of digital financial assets.Speaking at a board meeting of the General Prosecutor’s office Wednesday, Putin stated that “criminal elements have been increasingly deploying digital financial assets,” which needs special attention from the government.“There is one more point — quite new, but essential: we should take additional measures to suppress illegal cross-border movement of digital financial assets,” Putin said. The President ordered local enforcement as well as the Federal Service for Financial Monitoring, or Rosfinmonitoring, to give all their attention to this issue.As Putin did not elaborate on the context of illegal cross-border transactions using digital assets, it now appears to be unclear what violations exactly he meant. Nikita Soshnikov, a former senior lawyer at Deloitte CIS and director of Alfacash, told Cointelegraph:Russia adopted its major cryptocurrency law, “On Digital Financial Assets,” in January 2020, officially prohibiting payments made in cryptos like Bitcoin in the country. The Russian government has also been working on separate initiatives to adopt restrictions on foreign payment services and digital wallets like AliPay and WeChat.Putin’s latest remarks on illegal cross-border digital asset transactions come amid somewhat intensifying relations between Russia and the United States."
9,"The United Kingdom Advertising Standards Authority has upheld a complaint lodged against cryptocurrency exchange Coinfloor for its publication of a Bitcoin (BTC) advertisement in a regional news outlet.The ad, published in the Northamptonshire Telegraph on Dec. 3, 2020, was deemed to have targeted retirees, according to the complainant, who claimed the ad was misleading and socially irresponsible.The ad led with the title “There is no point keeping your money in the bank…” and featured an image of a woman, aged 63, describing her decision to convert part of her pension into Bitcoin. The retiree depicted in the advert was quoted as saying:The supposed Coinfloor customer depicted in the advert even referenced Bitcoin’s oft-quoted reputation as digital gold. It continued, “To me, Bitcoin is digital gold and it has allowed me to take the steps to secure the cash I already have… Thanks to Coinfloor’s Autobuy service, buying and holding Bitcoin has never been easier…""The advert was alleged to be misleading because “It failed to make clear the risks associated with Bitcoin investments, including loss of capital, and that neither Coinfloor Ltd nor the general Bitcoin market were regulated in the U.K.""The complaint was upheld on this point, with the ASA noting that Coinfloor had not sufficiently conveyed Bitcoin’s volatility.The ad was also alleged to be socially misleading because “It suggested that purchasing Bitcoin was a good or secure way to invest one’s savings or pension.""The complaint was also upheld on this point, with the ASA judging that Coinfloor had represented Bitcoin investments as being safer than they really were.The ASA concluded that the advert must not appear again in its current form. Any future adverts from Coinfloor must make clear the fact that Bitcoin investments could decrease in value, state that both Coinfloor Ltd and Bitcoin are unregulated in the U.K., and must not irresponsibly suggest Bitcoin is a secure investment of one’s savings or pension."
10,"The European Securities and Markets Authority, the European Union's independent financial authority, has warned about the high risk of cryptocurrency investment.In its latest “Trends, Risks and Vulnerabilities” report published Wednesday, the ESMA analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on financial markets, highlighting the increased risks linked with investment in “non-regulated crypto-assets.”The authority mentioned that crypto assets saw a massive surge in value and trading volumes during the second half of 2020, with Bitcoin reaching all-time highs. The ESMA stated that the surge was driven by “positive newsflows in the crypto sector,” including PayPal’s move to roll out its crypto buy and sell option on the platform as well as the growing interest in decentralized finance, or DeFi. “It is also fuelled by strong investor demand and search for yield amid unprecedented global fiscal and monetary stimulus,” the agency wrote.Amid the increasing volumes and demand, crypto assets are “highly volatile and bear high risks for investors,” the ESMA warned, stating, “Prices of non-regulated crypto assets at all-time highs imply significant risks for investors.”As part of the new report, the ESMA also noted the growing DeFi industry, outlining its supposed benefits like disintermediation, 24/7 availability and censorship resistance as well as risks including operational resilience, scalability and governance. The ESMA will continue to monitor developments in DeFi, as it may raise specific regulatory and supervisory challenges, it said.In February, the chairman of France’s top financial regulator, the Autorite des Marches Financiers, proposed that the ESMA become the chief authority for crypto regulation and supervision in the EU."
11,"Switzerland's Financial Market Supervisory Authority, the country's principal financial regulator, has made an ""unfavorable prognosis"" regarding Bitcoin Suisse's application for a banking license. According to an official announcement on Wednesday, Bitcoin Suisse's current application is ineligible for approval on the grounds that ""various elements that are relevant under licensing law make it unlikely that a license will be granted."" As such, Bitcoin Suisse has decided to withdraw its application.Speaking to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin Suisse CEO Arthur Vayloyan remained optimistic, stating that the firm still has ""so many options on the table."" He explained that the firm's reputation for cryptocurrency storage and trading has put it in an ideal position as institutional adoption of digital assets grows exponentially. Vayloyan explained that since the firm had initially applied for the license in July 2019, the landscape of crypto markets and the firm's position therein has shifted significantly and that Bitcoin Suisse could apply again, should it want to.Indeed, a banking license could be advantageous as security tokens gain traction.As Vayloyan explained, in February 2018, FINMA released guidelines for initial coin offerings, under which tokens were divided into three categories: payment, utility and asset, with the latter considered a security. Today, when a firm receives a banking license in Switzerland, it also automatically receives a broker-dealer license. Consequently, a firm with a banking license would be able to engage in the purchase and sale of securities, giving them a leg up in the emerging digital securities space. ""Under the assumption that the security token market takes off, it would be strategically a pity not to be able to fully participate in that unfolding opportunity and take a share,"" Vayloyan said.While FINMA stated that there were apparent weaknesses in ""money laundering defense mechanisms"" in Bitcoin Suisse's application, Vayloyan stated that the firm is aware of any gaps in this regard and is working closely with regulators to address them. ""We are as transparent to regulators as we can be,"" he stated. Bitcoin Suisse is a crypto broker and intermediary headquartered in Switzerland's canton of Zug, which is dubbed ""Crypto Valley"" for its preponderance of cryptocurrency- and blockchain-related companies, and progressive regulatory approach toward digital assets.Earlier this year, Bitcoin Suisse rolled out a payments solution that allows residents of the canton to pay their taxes in cryptocurrency. Projects with local companies and government along with the soaring bull market have grown the firm's workforce by 120 people in the past year. "

13,"Member states of the Eurasian Economic Union, or EAEU, have been struggling to come up with a shared stance regarding cryptocurrency regulations, according to an official.Iya Malkina, assistant chairman of the Eurasian Economic Commission Board, stated that EAEU member states did not support a recent initiative for a uniform cryptocurrency regulatory framework within the union.In a press briefing Wednesday, Malkina explained that the Eurasian Economic Commission received several proposals to synchronize regulations in the industry of blockchain and crypto. The EEC also recommended developing a basic uniform regulatory framework within the EAEU with a single glossary and principles. “However, this proposal did not find support,” the official said.Malkina said that the EEC has been actively analyzing the impact of cryptocurrencies on the macroeconomic stability of the EAEU member states since December 2017.The EAEU is an economic union of states located in Eastern Europe and Western and Central Asia, with member countries including Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan, Armenia and others. The union was formed in 2014 to facilitate the free movement of goods and services as well as provide common policies in the macroeconomic sphere.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the EAEU has been seeking to find an approach to promote cryptocurrency regulation, publishing its first report on issues associated with crypto regulation in 2019. Previously, the Russian Ministry of Finance urged that the EAEU will have to launch its own digital currency to circumvent sanctions by the United States."
14,"Bitcoin (BTC) slid under $55,000 on March 17 as United States treasury yields built on a comeback, which took them to their highest in over a year.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed further downward pressure for BTC/USD on Wednesday, compounding a comedown that began late on Sunday.While not plugging the week's lows at near $53,000, the latest dip to $54,425 on Bitstamp underscores Bitcoin's correction after hitting all-time highs of $61,700.The weakness came in tandem with the strength of U.S. bond yields, a classic drain on BTC performance. On-chain metrics showed broad strength, however, while derivatives funding rates also cooled, fueling bullish sentiment beyond spot price action.""Bitcoin will continue to rise and rise in the foreseeable future — we don't need charts or technical analysis to tell us what is painfully obvious,"" trader Scott Melker forecast in a fresh YouTube update.""I bought more BTC at 56,500. Just in case anyone was wondering if I’m still bullish,"" Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz added, in another example of investor optimism.At the time of writing, BTC/USD was circling $55,000 as a slight return to form kept the pair from testing deeper lows.""We'll only see further downside once $BTC loses ~$55,000,"" popular Twitter account Rekt Capital argued, adding to recent Cointelegraph analysis.On the topic of institutional involvement, meanwhile, this week was tipped by Bitcoin investment firm NYDIG to bring significant announcements from prospective large-volume corporate investors. In an episode of the On The Brink podcast recorded on March 10, NYDIG CEO and co-founder Robby Gutmann removed any doubt that the institutional scene was about to transform.""I think — I don't think, I know — starting more or less next week, you're going to see an absolute drumbeat of pretty game-changing milestones from some of these firms that are really going to mark each progressively new point in Bitcoin adoption, Bitcoin availability, Bitcoin products and services within the existing traditional financial landscapes,"" he said.As Cointelegraph reported, meanwhile, the topic of bonds has gained attention from several high-profile sources.

15,"With crypto trading reportedly reaching feverish proportions in South Korea, internet giant Kakao might be set for an upward share price advance.Quoting comments from analysts Mirae Asset Daewoo — a South Korean brokerage outfit — The Korea Herald has reported that the chat app operator stands to benefit from the ongoing enthusiasm in the Bitcoin (BTC) market. According to Mirae Asset Daewoo analyst Kim Chang-kwon:Upbit is one of the “big four” cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea along with Bithumb, Coinone and Korbit.Apart from its equity stake in Dunamu, Kakao, like other major South Korean conglomerates also maintains a significant presence in the crypto and blockchain space. The chat app operator has its own cryptocurrency KLAY as well as a blockchain platform Klaytn developed by its subsidiary Ground X.Bloomberg data puts Kakao stock price at 485,000 won ($429.77) as of the time of writing. Mirae Asset Daewoo has upped its price target for Kakao’s share price to $522.81.Indeed, the internet giant earned over $25 million in profits for Q4 2017 from its investment in Dunamu. At the time, BTC and the crypto market enjoyed a frenzied bull market that saw Bitcoin almost eclipsing the $20,000 mark in mid-December 2017.According to Chang-kwon, if predictions about 2021 being a year-long bull market for Bitcoin holds, Kakao stands to see its Dunamu investment-based profits likely reach $90 million. The market analyst also noted that a Coinbase listing on the Nasdaq would trigger an equity revaluation for Kakao.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, crypto exchange trading in South Korea is on the rise. Earlier in March, the reported volume across major platforms temporarily exceeded the market activity of the country’s stock market.Upbit has been a major beneficiary of this crypto trading boom with its main banker, K bank, reportedly targeting a 2022 initial public offering. Such is the extent of the current cryptocurrency trading fever that K bank has accelerated its profitability timetable despite major operational disruptions in 2019 that resulted in an $89 million loss for the year.Meanwhile, regulators in the country are ramping up efforts to police the cryptocurrency market amid the current trading boom. Exchanges and other service providers have been mandated to report all transactions or risk five-year jail terms for their principal executives.The crypto reporting policy is expected to come into effect later in March. Cryptocurrency businesses in the country have six months to comply with the new regulatory paradigm.South Korea’s tax authority is also turning its attention to the booming crypto market as it tries to identify individuals hiding their assets in virtual currencies to evade taxes."
16,"According to research by strategists at leading U.S investment bank, JPMorgan Chase, retail traders are flocking to buy Bitcoin from mainstream fintech firms.JPMorgan’s data suggests that retail investors have purchased more than 187,000 Bitcoin this quarter using PayPal and Square.Retail investors are even out-buying institutions, with JPMorgan’s analysts estimating institutions have purchased 173,000 BTC over the same period.JP Morgan has analyzed fund flows from retail platforms and institutional vehicles such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, as well as announcements from large funds on BTC purchases to inform its findings.Senior market analyst at Oanda Corp, Ed Moya, attributed the retail activity to social media, the current NFT craze, and stimulus payouts. He told Bloomberg:He added that while “meme-stock” trading burnt many retail traders, Bitcoin has remained overwhelmingly bullish and has been their “bread and butter” during the pandemic.Brian Vendig, president of MJP Wealth Advisors, suggested retail demand has been driven by fear of missing out (FOMO) following the recent wave of institutional investment into Bitcoin.Data from crypto market aggregator, Glassnode, appears to confirm that retail investors have well and truly arrived.

17,"The price of Bitcoin has doubled in the past 75 days, prompting some analysts to question whether the market is approaching over-extension.However, historical analysis from Bitcoin monitoring team CaseBitcoin suggests the Bitcoin markets could accelerate further, noting that BTC’s “doubling time” — the time taken for price to increase by 100% — shrunk down to just 12 days just before the peak of the 2017 bull run.3/ How low can it get? In 2017, the fastest doubling pace - 12 days - happened on December 7th, nine days before the 3yr peak: pic.twitter.com/CgyIjDBJwUCaseBitcoin notes the fastest doubling time recorded during the current market cycle was on Jan 7th, with BTC surging from $21,000 to $42,000 in just 22 days. The firm suggests there are similarities between January’s market action and that which occurred during August 2017 — the “middle period of the 2017 bull market.” Back then, Bitcoin’s price doubled over just 26 days to tag $5,000 for the first time, before slumping by 40% in the following weeks. Speaking of the recent run up, CaseBitcoin concluded:“It’ll be interesting to see if doubling-times as fast as the end of the 2013 and 2017 cycles happen this time around too,” the analysts added.Back in 2013, Bitcoin’s doubling time shrunk down to just four days within one week of the bull season’s peak.Many analysts believe the current bull market has more room to grow, with the founders of crypto data aggregator Glassnode sharing data showing that the decline in Bitcoin’s liquid supply — an estimate as to how many coins are freely circulating and not locked up by “illiquid entities” — has accelerated since the start of 2021.Despite recent volatility, #Bitcoin supply is still drying up at astonishing rates for this time around in the cycle. https://t.co/yslda1jUha pic.twitter.com/y1SInrBjEFThe data also shows that Bitcoin’s liquid supply has been falling significantly since April 2020, with Glassnode having estimated 78% of circulating BTC was already illiquid as of December 2020."

The newly launched Purpose Bitcoin fund is in sixth place with $517 million in AUM according to the report.Crypto asset investment funds closed on Friday, March 12 with a record $55.8 billion in assets under management following bullish price action for the week, the report noted. These investment product types saw a $242 million inflow, up 124% from $108 million the week prior.While Bitcoin remains the dominant asset, funds flowing into Ethereum based investment products have also increased as the asset grows in popularity among institutional investors. For the week ending March 12, there was a $113.5 million inflow comprising almost 50% of the total.Multi-asset funds are third with a reported weekly inflow of $3.6 million and a total AUM figure of $2.3 billion according to the report. The only digital asset products to record a decline in inflows for the week were those based on Ripple which saw a million dollar outflow for the period.The report noted that Bitcoin trading volumes on trusted exchanges have been slightly above average at $11.8 billion per day versus $10.8 billion per day on average for 2021.In its latest announcement, leading global crypto asset fund Grayscale reported an assets under management figure of $42.9 billion, of which 84% of that is its popular Bitcoin Trust."

20,"Bitcoin (BTC) price continues to recover from its sub-$55,000 correction and at the time of writing, traders are attempting to recapture the $57,000 level as a support. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that a wave of early morning selling pushed Bitcoin price to a daily low of $53,167 and while dip buyers did manage to step in, the lack of purchasing volume is keeping BTC pinned in what appears to be a tightening range.While Bitcoin price could continue to meet overhead resistance in the $56,000 to $58,000 range, a strong bullish case still exists as a potential $6.1 billion worth of Bitcoin options are set to expire on March 26. According to Cointelegraph contributor Marcel Pechman, derivatives data indicates that the upcoming expiry is more advantageous for the bulls as long as BTC remains above $52,000.Ether (ETH) has also traded in a consolidation pattern since setting a new all-time high at $1,950 on March 13 and professional traders view the $1,750 level as strong support following multiple bearish retests over the past week.Several altcoins saw their prices breakout on Tuesday as partnership announcements and exchange listings have proven to be effective price movers.The biggest announcement of the day came from Coinbase Pro, which revealed that it has begun accepting inbound transfers of Cardano (ADA) and will support trading services “on or after 9 AM PT on Thursday, March 18, if liquidity conditions are met.”Terra (LUNA) has also put on another double-digit gain overnight, spiking more than 40% from a low of $14.60 on March 15 to a new all-time high of $20.60 on $1.4 billion in trading volume.Basic Attention Token (BAT) has also seen its price surge to a new record high at $1.18 as the blockchain-based web browser continues to reap the benefits of multiple announcements, including the acquisition of a search engine provider and plans to integrate NFT functionality and a DEX aggregator.The global financial markets fell under pressure on Tuesday as weaker than expected retail sales and a rising 10-year Treasury yield, which closed the day up 0.87% at 1.621.Following record highs set on March 16, the S&P 500 and Dow faced dropped throughout the day and closed down 0.16% and 0.39% respectively. The NASDAQ was able to start a late-day rally that helped its price close up 0.09%.Despite the drawdown in both Bitcoin and Ether price, the overall outlook for the cryptocurrency market is bullish as signs of steady mainstream adoption emerge on a daily basis.Data shows that long-term cryptocurrency holders have been accumulating BTC in recent months, while short-term traders are confident that high leverage speculative trading will pay off. The steady increase in BTC accumulation suggests that the current bull market has ample room to run higher.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.723 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 60.8%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

21,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating between $55,000 and $56,000 following the rejection at $61,000. Whale clusters suggest that one key level has to be defended to prevent a drop to the mid-$40,000 region. According to the data from Whalemap, which tracks Bitcoin whale activity, $55,406 is a critical whale cluster support area.If Bitcoin breaks below $55,406, analysts at Whalemap emphasized that a drop to $47,438 becomes the next likely move.Whale clusters form when whales or high-net-worth investors buy or sell Bitcoin and do not move these coins thereafter.Since whales tend to buy more on the dip to their entry level or sell at breakeven after a correction, whale clusters typically serve as support and resistance levels.Since Bitcoin is currently hovering above $55,406, this level is considered an important whale cluster support area. Hence, Bitcoin has to remain above it in the short term to avoid a larger drop that may lead to cascading liquidations.From March 15 to 16, the data from Bybt.com showed that more than $2 billion worth of futures contracts were liquidated, resulting in the funding rate dropping back to normal levels.Considering that the futures market reset, as long as Bitcoin comfortably remains above $55,406, the probability of a major correction decreases substantially.Researchers at Whalemap said:Still, if Bitcoin falls below $50,000 again, it enters a danger zone. The $45,000 to $47,000 range is a major macro support area. With the risk of the 10-year U.S. Treasury rising, a potential drop below $50,000 could cause BTC's near-term momentum to significantly weaken.Based on these scenarios, there are expectations that the accumulation of Bitcoin above $55,000 would continue.While Bitcoin is battling a crucial support area, BTC/USD is perfectly in line with the popular Stock-to-Flow (S2F) price model, which puts the year-end target at $100,000.A pseudonymous trader known as ""Rekt Capital"" noted that not only is the S2F en route to its next target, it could potentially see upside deviations.The term upside deviation means when an asset overshoots the model price. The trader said:Short-term whale clusters can provide some context as to where BTC price may go in the near future, typically within a span of a week or two.But long-term models like S2F can be used to verify whether the broader uptrend and upward momentum of Bitcoin are sustainable in the upcoming months and years."
22,"Over the past two months, the open interest on Bitcoin options increased by 60% to reach $13.5 billion as the BTC price rose to a new all-time high. The result of Bitcoin's price appreciation and the rising options open interest resulted in a potentially historic $6.1 billion expiry set for March 26.Most exchanges offer monthly exposures, although a few also hold weekly options for short-term contracts. Jan. 29, 2020, had the largest expiry on record as $3.5 billion worth of option contracts expired. This figure represented 36% of all open interest at that time.The above data shows that Bitcoin's March 26 expiry holds 100,400 BTC. That unusual concentration translates to 45% of its contracts set to expire in eleven days.It is worth noting that not every option will trade at expiry as some of those strikes now sound unreasonable, especially considering there are less than two weeks left.Unlike futures contracts, options are divided into two segments. Call (buy) options allow the buyer to acquire BTC at a fixed price on the expiry date. Generally speaking, those are used on either neutral arbitrage trades or bullish strategies.Meanwhile, the put (sell) options are commonly used as hedge or protection from negative price swings.To understand how these competing forces are balanced, one should compare the calls and put options size at each expiry price (strike). Options markets are all-or-none, meaning they either have value or become worthless if trading above the call strike price, or the opposite for put option holders.By excluding the neutral-to-bearish put options below $47,000 and the call options above $66,000, it is easier to estimate the potential impact of Friday's expiry. Incentives to pump or dump the price by more than 17% become less likely, as the potential gains will seldom surpass the cost.This data leaves $1.13 billion worth of call options from $32,000 to $64,000 strikes for the aggregate options expiry on March 26. Meanwhile, the more bearish put options down to $47,000 amount to $462 million. Therefore, there's a $668 million imbalance favoring the more bullish call options.While a $6.1 billion options expiry could be worrisome, nearly 43% of them are already deemed worthless. As for the remaining open interest, bulls are mainly in control because the recent price hike to a new all-time high obliterated 84% of the bearish options.As expiry gets closer, a growing number of put options will lose their value if BTC remains above $52,000, increasing the advantage from the neutral-to-bullish call options.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
23,"Ether (ETH) reserves on exchanges are continuing to decline despite being at historic lows. This trend indicates a supply shortage of ETH across major trading platforms following the release of an Ethereum 2.0 deposit wallet for staking.As Cointelegraph previously reported, staking neared $4 billion in January, leading to around 2% of ETH's supply being locked in the Eth2 deposit contract.The low supply of ETH on exchanges should decrease the overall selling pressure on the asset, especially if the demand for ETH increases in tandem with the rapid growth of the decentralized finance market. Relative to the amount of ETH that is circulating in the exchange market, the price of ETH has not seen the strong upside momentum it saw in early February.Analysts at on-chain data analytics platform CryptoQuant said:There are two main reasons why ETH has been consolidating in the past two weeks. First, the spike in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield caused the overall risk-on market to slump. Second, Bitcoin (BTC) has been outperforming ETH, quelling Ether's momentum.But in the foreseeable future, both traders and on-chain analysts anticipate ETH to regain momentum.A pseudonymous trader known as ""Cactus"" said that based on its technical market structure, ETH is poised to see a new all-time high as long as it holds $1,750. He wrote:Moreover, the latest dip in BTC price didn't see a major drop in ETH, while the ETH/BTC pair actually saw a surprising bounce, which means that the bull cycle remains intact. ""The next big impulse wave could happen once this period of consolidation and compression is completed. This next impulse wave should propel Ether far above $2,000,"" Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe explained in his latest analysis. Atop the declining exchange reserves and favorable technical market structure, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju noted that ETH saw its second-largest hourly outflow in 2021 on March 16. Outflows from exchanges are typically a sign of positive market sentiment because it likely means that an institution or a high-net-worth investor is accumulating ETH and sending it to a self-hosted wallet. Ju said:Declining exchange reserves alone might not be sufficient to paint a bullish short-term trajectory for ETH due to Ethereum 2.0.In the first few weeks of launch, Lido, a staking platform, saw over 60,000 ETH staked through Ethereum 2.0.Due to Lido staking and the deposits into the Eth2 contract address, ETH saw a massive drop in exchange reserves. However, without major catalysts, Bitcoin has seen its exchange reserves also drop significantly in the same period.As such, it is critical that other important on-chain data points, such as increasing transaction volume and short-term exchange outflow spikes supplement the general downtrend of exchange reserves to strengthen the argument for a broader near-term rally.In the foreseeable future, cryptocurrencies will most likely see some correlation with the U.S. Treasury yield and the equities market.Over the past month, the crypto market saw a high inverse correlation with the 10-year Treasury yield.  As the Treasury yield neared 1.6% in late February, Bitcoin price pulled back to its recent lows of $43,000, bringing down Ether and other top altcoins with it.As long as the Treasury yield remains stable, with stimulus checks rolling out in the United States, the outlook for Ethereum should remain optimistic throughout March."
24,"The Belarusian government has proposed to appoint the High Technologies Park Administration as a supervisory authority for local crypto exchanges and digital tokens, First Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai Snopkov announced on Tuesday. “The government has proposed to make the Administration of the Hi-Tech Park a supervisory body for crypto-exchanges and digital tokens. The President supported the government’s idea. I believe that such a decision will be made shortly,” Snopkov said.According to Snopkov, the government is currently trying to choose an appropriate government agency to supervise local crypto platforms in line with pan-European rules. Snopkov said, “It is logical that the HTP Administration is the most proficient, with the best expertise in this field.”“I am sure that the HTP Administration will come up with ways to harness digital technology to promote the development of the country within the global network of crypto-exchanges and digital token,” Snopkov added.Belarus HTP is a special tax and legal regime for IT businesses in Belarus that aims to help grow the technology sector in the country. According to official state records, Belarus HTP is a territory within Belarus that is not considered a free or special economic zone but rather a jurisdiction providing some legal benefits and tax exemptions to its residents. The HTP Administration is a legal institution responsible for managing the HTP’s activities.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Belarus HTP has been actively involved in activities around crypto industry regulation. In 2018, a committee of the HTP issued a set of rules for the operation of the crypto market in the country, including regulations related to initial coin offerings.The HTP did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment."
25,"Bitcoin (BTC) did more than hit $60,000 per coin last week — it also became worth more than the world’s three biggest banks combined.According to publicly available data, the largest cryptocurrency surpassed the three highest-valued global banking giants by market capItalization.At its all-time highs of $61,700, Bitcoin’s market cap was roughly $1.15 trillion. The combined market cap of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China is $1.08 trillion.The achievements do not stop there: Visa and Mastercard, the biggest payment networks, have a combined market cap of $871 billion, also now significantly less than Bitcoin.Since then, BTC/USD has seen a slight pullback, bringing its market cap down to $1.03 trillion, still holding the significant trillion-dollar-asset title.That level was previously tipped by analysts as a likely consolidation zone, something that remains the case after Monday’s dip took Bitcoin back below its previous all-time high set in late February.Its ascent, others have noted, is impressive — Bitcoin went from zero to $1 trillion in network value 3.6 times faster than Microsoft, for example.Analyzing the market cap data, on-chain analytics resource Ecoinometrics added that as of Saturday, Bitcoin equaled 45% of the gold held in investment vehicles and 10% of the physical gold market as a whole.To eclipse gold entirely, something that is already a topic of debate among market participants, BTC/USD would need to trade at $590,000.As Cointelegraph reported, meanwhile, both Visa and Mastercard are coming to terms with the need to incorporate Bitcoin in their corporate strategies going forward."

In an attempt to claw back some of the huge amounts of debt created as its response, the U.S. government plans to raise taxes — and the impact could be much worse than many realize.This, Dalio thinks, will become a “new paradigm.”“If history and logic are to be a guide, policy makers who are short of money will raise taxes and won’t like these capital movements out of debt assets and into other storehold of wealth assets and other tax domains so they could very well impose prohibitions against capital movements to other assets (e.g., gold, Bitcoin, etc.) and other locations,” he summarized.As a result, the environment for those with savings will end up feeling less attractive than ever.The United States is becoming “inhospitable to capitalism,” Dalio said — and to guard against the consequences, investors should embrace a “well-diversified portfolio of non-debt and non-dollar assets along with a short cash position.”Responding, however, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor said that Bitcoin is the answer.“I agree with (Dalio) that bonds no longer work as a treasury asset,” he wrote on Twitter.MicroStrategy continues to add to its BTC position, revealing last week a purchase of 260 BTC for $15 million. In total, the company holds 91,064 BTC.Dalio himself has changed his position markedly on Bitcoin, admitting that his misgivings were based on a lack of knowledge about how the cryptocurrency works.His perspective chimes with that of Arthur Hayes, former CEO of derivatives giant BitMEX, who in a post of his own told investors to go long on cryptocurrency and interest rate volatility.“I also believe that one should be mindful of tax changes and the possibility of capital controls,” Dalio concluded."
27,"Austria-based cryptocurrency firm Bitpanda has closed a $170 million funding round to further the firm's international growth.The latest Series B funding round was led by Valar Ventures — a venture capital firm backed by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel — Bitpanda announced on Tuesday, and featured partners from Yuri Milner’s investment firm DST Global, which is known as a major investor in United States-based crypto-friendly stock trading app Robinhood. While DST is a new investor in Bitpanda, Valar previously led a $52 million Series A round in September 2020.According to Bitpanda, the new funding round has made the firm “Austria’s first unicorn” by raising the company’s valuation to $1.2 billion.With the new funding, Bitpanda is looking to further expand its services across Europe and plans to set up tech hubs and offices in Madrid, Barcelona, London, Paris and Berlin. In addition to its Austria headquarters, Bitpanda has already expanded into France, Spain, Turkey, Italy and Poland. “Now it’s about growing internationally, adding to our existing products and services, and bringing our financial solutions to new audiences,” Bitpanda CEO and co-founder Eric Demuth told Cointelegraph.Apart from its global expansion ambitions, Bitpanda is also planning to introduce some new products on its platform in the near future, including the trading of fractional shares and exchange-traded funds.Founded in 2014, Bitpanda originally focused on investment and trading services for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) but has now expanded to more investment options. “We are shifting to become a pan-investment platform, not just a crypto broker,” Demuth said.According to the announcement, the recent Series B round was signed last week and is currently pending approval by the Austrian Financial Market Authority, or FMA. The funding news comes shortly after Bitpanda upgraded its local license, gaining the status of FMA-approved investment firm in early March."
28,"Users of major privacy-oriented messaging app Signal can now support the project with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC).Signal officially announced Monday that the platform has started accepting crypto donations as a form of support for the Signal Technology Foundation, the nonprofit organization behind the app. “As a nonprofit organization, we depend on your support. If you've been patiently waiting for Signal to accept cryptocurrency donations, you no longer need to hodl back your generosity,” Signal wrote.Cryptocurrency donations are now part of Signal’s “Donate” section on its official website, specifying that the new feature is enabled via major crypto donations platform The Giving Block.Signal accepts 12 cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Gemini Dollar (GUSD), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Zcash (ZEC) and Chainlink's LINK. “The Giving Block also supports anonymous donations,” Signal notes in a memo accompanying its crypto donation section.Signal is a cross-platform messaging service with end-to-end encryption. The Signal Technology Foundation was launched in February 2018 by WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, who left both WhatsApp and Facebook to create Signal in 2017.In January, Platformer newsletter founder Casey Newton claimed that Signal was testing payment features with Binance-backed Stellar-based privacy coin platform MobileCoin, noting that Signal CEO Moxie Marlinspike also serves as an adviser on the MobileCoin project."
29,"The Bitcoin markets emphatically rejected the $60,000 price range on March 15, with excessive leverage driving a record $500 million worth of long liquidations over just 60 minutes.Glassnode’s founders, Jan & Yann, emphasized the new record hourly Bitcoin for liquidations, noting that more than half open futures contracts prior to the margin calls were leveraged by at least 20 times.In the last hour alone, nearly $500M in #Bitcoin Longs got liquidated, this is a historic ATH.

There is excess greed in the system, with 60% of contracts levered 20x or more.

Long liquidations are an artifact of the current bull market. pic.twitter.com/n9NciJcS62However, data from Bybt suggests $800 million worth of liquidations were processed over just 15 minutes.According to crypto market data aggregator, Datamish, the past 24 hours saw 292 positions liquidated for $94.5 million on derivatives exchange, BitMEX. On Bitfinex, 488 positions were liquidated for roughly $100 million over the same period.The second largest single-day liquidation came on Feb. 22, when BTC fell from its then all-time high of $58,300 to around $47,000. As reported by Cointelegraph, $5.9 billion worth of futures contracts were liquidated during the crash. Since its March 14 peak of $61,000, Bitcoin has corrected by 12.3% to $53,500 during Asian trading on Tuesday, March 16. BTC has since produced a slight recovery, last changing hands for $54,600 as of this writing.This latest correction is the third major retracement of the current bull cycle.While the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index suggested the markets were in a state of “extreme greed” last week, the retracement has seen the indicator fall back into the “greed” category with a rank of 71 — indicating a significant cooling of market sentiment."
30,"According to research by on-chain analytics provider, Glassnode, 95% of the Bitcoin changing hands last was last moved less than three months ago on the blockchain.Glassnode’s March 15 The Week On-Chain report found that just 5% of spent outputs are more than 90 days old, indicating the vast majority of BTC moving on-chain are “young coins.”Other data from Glassnode has found that addresses that have been hodling BTC for at least three years have significantly increased their holdings over the past six to 12 months, while short-term holders have been taking profits since the start of 2020.Glassnode defines “Long Term Holders,” or LTH, as wallets that have held their Bitcoin for more than 155 days, while “Short Term Holders,” or STH, are described as wallets that move BTC on-chain within 155 days or receiving coins.The report asserts LTH tend to have a greater knowledge of Bitcoin, accumulating BTC in bear markets and offloading some during bull markets. By contrast, STH are likely to either be newer market participants or short-term speculators that frequently move value between exchanges, it added.At current prices, Glassnode found that 10.85 million BTC, or 58% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply are currently in profit according to when they last moved on-chain, while 5.3 million BTC are currently in profit and held by STH wallets.Glassnode also noted that LTHs are actually hodling more coins than in previous market cycles.The analytics provider also identified that the number of active new entities has recently spiked to new all-time highs, indicating many new retail investors have recently entered the space.The number of new participants in the #Bitcoin network is unprecedented.

Over the past weeks, we have seen a large growth of new entities. This is a strong indication that new retail investors have been entering the space.

31,"Bitcoin price sold off on March 15 as bears pushed the price back into the mid-$50,000 range a few days after (BTC) hit a new all-time high above $61,000. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that Bitcoin price dropped as low as $54,600 and at the time of writing, buyers have not stepped in to arrest the decline.A series of recent developments have increased the fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) factor for the top cryptocurrency, including rumors of a potential digital asset ban in India that would criminalize the possession, issuance, mining, trading and transfer of cryptocurrency.Adding to the bad news of the day, PancakeSwap (CAKE) and Cream Finance (CREAM), two of the top DeFi projects on the Binance Smart Chain, fell victim to a DNS spoofing attack that sought to phish users into entering their private keys on the website.Both projects immediately informed users of the exploit and advised them to avoid logging in until the issue is resolved. and are reminded to keep their private keys and seed phrases secure and stored offline. At the daily close CAKE price was down by 8.7% and CREAM dropped by 14.3% before recovering to $110 at the daily close.Despite Monday’s decline, traders are optimistic that BTC will see a rapid recovery and a recent survey estimates that up to 10% of the $400 billion in pandemic relief for U.S. citiz could be used to purchase Bitcoin and stocks.Another bullish sign for BTC comes from the futures markets, where a record $22.5 billion in open interest on BTC futures indicates that bulls remain optimistic that the current uptrend will continue.According to Chad Steinglass, Head of Trading at CrossTower, the early morning sell-off was not surprising due to several factors including less liquidity on the weekends which can lead to “liquidations in highly levered swap and options products that trade outside of the U.S.,” exacerbating the downward movement.Steinglass said:The traditional financial markets rallied on Monday as optimism surrounding the recent $1.9 billion stimulus package signed by President Biden helped dampen concerns related to rising Treasury yields.The S&P 500, Dow and NASDAQ all closed the day positive, up 0.65%, 0.53% and 1.05% respectively. The S&P 500 and Dow both establishing new all-time highs as the trading day closed.Despite the bearish turn of events, several altcoins were able to resist and rally higher.Enjin (ENJ) saw its price surge 32% to a new all-time high of $3.00 during the early trading hours as the altcoins volume surged after being listed on Huobi exchange.The dual-token system of VeChain (VET) and the VeThor Token (VTHO) also moved higher as a high volume spike lifted VET to a new all-time high at $0.0827. VTHO price increased 37% to $0.0119, its highest level in over two years.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.71 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 60.9%."
32,"Touted as a digital store of value with scarce supply, Bitcoin has seen its fair share of comparisons to gold over the years. Keeping up with that trend, a sailing competition called the Liberty Bitcoin Cup offers Bitcoin (BTC) as a competition prize instead of a gold trophy.  “The Liberty Bitcoin Cup is the prime cup for the Next Generation of World Class Sailors, competing on the Next Generation of High Tech Class Foil Sailing boats,” says the Liberty Bitcoin Cup’s website. “Where traditionally Gold Cups were the premier Cups in traditional sailing, this next generation is now powered by the Next Generation of gold – Bitcoin.”Essentially, foil sailing employs new technology and design, according to a 2017 article from the Wall Street Journal. Foil boats utilize a design in which the boat maneuvers above the water’s surface to a degree, reducing friction and adding speed potential.The Liberty Bitcoin Cup hopes to lower the barrier of entry for young people interested in foil sailing competitions, its website explains. This year’s competitors must fall within the birth year range of Jan. 1, 1996 to Feb. 15, 2003. “Teams consist of 3 or 4 crew members of mixed gender and shall race with both genders or all females on board,” the site says.Including the finals, the cup consists of four events, and will pay out 1 BTC to the victor, according to the site.Crypto industry folks have often compared and contrasted gold and Bitcoin over the years. Gold shares some use case similarities with Bitcoin, such as its role as a store of value, and has been viewed as valuable for millennia. Coming on the scene in 2009, Bitcoin does not yet have such a lengthy history behind it, but has gained notable adoption over the past year or so as company allocations to the asset have become more common."
33,"The 2017 Bitcoin (BTC) bull run was led by retail traders, long-term crypto believers and Bitcoin whales. However, the tide turned in 2020 as institutional investors became the catalyst for the latest crypto bull run.However, data compiled by JPMorgan Chase shows that retail traders have made a strong comeback in the first quarter of this year. JPMorgan analysts used data from Square and Paypal to determine that retail investors bought 187,426 BTC for Q1 2021, which is more than the institutional purchase of 172,684 BTC during the same period.While this data may not be bulletproof, it gives a good overview of the underlying sentiment from both parties.Recent data from CoinMarketCap showed that the total volume of crypto transactions from major South Korean crypto exchanges during a 24-hour period on Sunday was $14.6 billion, eclipsing the $14.5 billion handled by South Korea's Composite Stock Price Index on March 12.While increased participation is a positive sign, a strong bull market also attracts several weak hands who dump their positions on every minor news and event. This could lead to increased volatility in the short term.Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot the critical support and resistance levels that may attract traders.Bitcoin broke out to a new all-time high at $61,825.84 on March 13, but this rally did not attract further buying from traders. On the contrary, traders booked profits after the rally and the price has dipped back below the breakout level at $58,341.03 today.However, a minor positive is that the bulls are still attempting to defend the 20-day exponential moving average ($53,231). If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will try to drive the price above $61,825.84. If they manage to do that, the next leg of the uptrend to $72,112 could begin.While the rising moving averages favor the bulls, the negative divergence on the relative strength index (RSI) suggests the bullish momentum has weakened. The bears will see an opportunity if the BTC/USD pair dips and sustains below the 20-day EMA.The next support on the downside is the 50-day simple moving average ($46,504) and then the critical swing low at $43,006.77.Ether’s (ETH) sharp rise on March 13 could not sustain the momentum and retest the all-time high at $2,040.77. This could have attracted profit-booking from momentum traders, which has resulted in a drop to the 20-day EMA ($1,729).If the bears utilize this opportunity and sink the price below the moving averages, the selling could intensify. That could result in a decline to $1,455 and then to the critical support at $1,289.The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI has dropped below 53 indicating a balance between supply and demand.This neutral to negative view will be negated if the ETH/USD pair rebounds off the moving averages and surges above the all-time high. This could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $2,614.Binance Coin (BNB) could not sustain above the $309.50 overhead resistance on March 11. This could have attracted profit-booking from traders, which has resulted in a pullback to the 20-day EMA ($245) today.The bulls are currently trying to defend the 20-day EMA. A strong rebound off this support will suggest aggressive buying on dips. The bulls will then again try to push the price above $309.50.If they succeed, a retest of the all-time high is possible. A breakout of this resistance could start the next leg of the uptrend that could reach $410.Alternatively, if the BNB/USD pair breaks below the 20-day EMA, short-term traders may book profits and that could pull the price down to $189.Cardano (ADA) has been trading inside the $1.03 to $1.23 range for the past few days. The altcoin slipped below the range on March 13 but made a strong comeback on the same day itself. Today, the price has again dipped below the support of the range.While the bulls have been defending the $1.03 support for the past three days, the bears have not allowed the price to rise and sustain above the 20-day EMA ($1.08). This suggests the bears are attempting to make a comeback.If the ADA/USD pair closes below the range, it will enhance the prospects of a deeper correction to the 50-day SMA ($0.87). If this support also cracks, the decline could extend to $0.80 and then $0.70.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up and breaks above the 20-day EMA, then the pair could rally to $1.23.Although the bulls have successfully defended the 20-day EMA ($34.79) in the past few days, they have not been able to push Polkadot (DOT) above the $37.50 to $40 overhead resistance zone. This suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.The flattening 20-day EMA and the RSI below 53 suggest the bulls may be losing their grip. If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, the selling could intensify as the short-term traders may rush to the exit. This could pull the DOT/USD pair down to the 50-day SMA ($28.73).This bearish view will invalidate if the price turns up from the current level and breaks out of the $40 to $42.50 resistance zone. Such a move could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $52.50.XRP attempted to rise above the 20-day EMA ($0.45) on March 13 but failed, which shows the bears are trying to gain the upper hand. If the sellers can sink the price below $0.42, the altcoin could drop to $0.35.The 20-day EMA is sloping down marginally and the RSI is trading in the negative territory, which suggests a minor advantage to the bears.This bearish view will be negated if the bulls can push the price above the overhead resistance at $0.50. Such a move could attract buyers who may then try to propel the XRP/USD pair to $0.65.Uniswap (UNI) again turned down from the $33 to $34.92 overhead resistance zone on March 14, which shows the bears are active at higher levels. The bulls will now try to defend the 20-day EMA ($28.70).A strong rebound off the 20-day EMA will suggest the sentiment remains bullish and traders are buying on dips. If the LINK/USD pair breaks above the overhead resistance zone, the next leg of the uptrend could begin.However, the negative divergence on the RSI suggests the bullish momentum may be waning. If the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, a deeper correction to the 50-day SMA ($23.40) is possible.Litecoin’s (LTC) break above $205.18 on March 12 sustained its momentum on March 13, but the bulls could not retest $246.96. The altcoin turned down from $230, which shows traders are exiting their positions on rallies.The bears are trying to pull the price back below the 20-day EMA ($197) while the bulls are trying to defend it. The flattening 20-day EMA and the RSI above 52 suggest a balance between supply and demand.This equilibrium will tilt in favor of the bulls if they can propel the price above $246.96. Conversely, the bears will gain the upper hand if the LTC/USD pair breaks and closes below the uptrend line.Chainlink (LINK) has broken below the moving averages and the trendline of the ascending triangle, which invalidates the bullish setup. Traders who had purchased before the breakout might cover their positions and that could result in a fall to $24.The flat moving averages and the RSI below the center also point to a possible range-bound action in the near term with a negative bias. The trend will turn in favor of the bears if they can sustain the price below $24.This bearish view will invalidate if the price turns up from the current levels and rises above $32. Such a move will suggest that the current break below the moving averages was a bear trap.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) surged above the $560 overhead resistance on March 13, but the bulls could not build on this breakout. The price quickly turned around on March 14 and the bears have dragged it back below the breakout level at $560.The sharp reversal could have trapped the aggressive bulls who were expecting the BCH/USD pair to rally to $631.71 and then $745. If the price sustains below the 50-day SMA ($528), it increases the possibility of a fall to $480 and then $440.The flat moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint indicate a balance between supply and demand. The bulls will gain the upper hand if they can propel the price above $609 and the bears will be at an advantage if the price breaks below $440.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

34,"Bitcoin (BTC) price has rallied 22.5% in March, but as the price moved up, some buyers began to use excessive leverage, according to derivatives data. Meanwhile, futures open interest reached a $22.5 billion record-high, causing investors to question how sustainable the current rally is.Being optimistic, especially during a bullish market, can't be deemed worrisome. Still, a yellow flag is raised when buyers use excessive leverage because this could lead to large liquidations during a sell-off.After peaking at $58,300 on Feb. 21, Bitcoin faced a 26% correction over the following week. That move wiped out over $4.5 billion worth of futures contracts, therefore virtually eliminating any excessive buyers' leverage, which was confirmed by the annualized premium on the 1-month futures contract dropping to 17%.On March 13 the open interest on BTC futures reached a record $22.5 billion, representing a 39% monthly increase.To assess whether the market is overly-optimistic, there are a couple of derivatives metrics to review. One is the futures premium (also known as basis), and it measures the price gap between futures contract prices and the regular spot market.The 1-month futures should usually trade with a 12% to 24% annualized premium, which should be interpreted as a lending rate. By postponing settlement, sellers demand a higher price, and this creates a price difference.The above chart shows the Bitcoin futures basis peaking at 60%, which is usually unsustainable. A basis rate above 35% signals excessive leverage from buyers and creating the potential for massive liquidations and subsequent market crashes.Take notice of how this indicator corrected after the BTC price dropped from the $60,000 peak on March 13. A similar movement took place on Feb. 21 as BTC reached a $58,300 all-time high and crashed 22% in less than 48 hours. Meanwhile, the futures basis rate adjusted to a neutral 16% level.A basis level above 24% is not necessarily a pre-crash alert, but it reflects high leverage usage levels from futures contract buyers. This overconfidence usually poses a greater risk if the market recedes 10% or more from its peak.It is also worth noting that traders sometimes pump up their leverage during a rally, especially on weekends, but later purchase the underlying asset (spot Bitcoin) to adjust the risk.Those betting that Bitcoin price will reach $65,000 and above will be pleased to know that open interest has been increasing throughout the 71% rally since February. This situation indicates short-sellers are likely fully hedged, taking benefit of the futures premium instead of effectively expecting a downside.Using the strategy described above, professional investors are essentially doing cash and carry trades that consist of buying the underlying asset and simultaneously selling futures contracts.These arbitrage positions usually do not present liquidation risks. Therefore, the current surge in open interest during a strong rally is a positive indicator.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

35,"Traders are increasingly checking on-chain data to ""predict"" both the short-term and long-term price trend of Bitcoin (BTC) using such platforms as CryptoQuant, Glassnode and WhaleAlert. Particularly, data points such as Bitcoin exchange inflows and outflows and stablecoin inflows are actively used by traders to anticipate where BTC may go next.499 #BTC (29,979,163 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/zkhywRQS82However, this type of data should be taken with a grain of salt, as large holders also realize that this data is being increasingly used by many individuals in their trading strategies. Hence, high-net-worth individuals or whales can manipulate this data to tilt the market to their advantage — but how? When large amounts of Bitcoin are deposited into an exchange, it typically signals that a whale or a high-net-worth investor is planning to sell BTC, at least in theory.Investors who hold a lot of Bitcoin usually leave them in noncustodial, or self-hosted, wallets for privacy and security reasons.Hence, when these holdings hit exchanges, it makes it seem like whales are about to put massive selling pressure on the market.However, since whales know that investors can track deposits through such on-chain data tracking platforms, this opens the door to a fakeout situation.In technical analysis, a ""fakeout"" is a term used to refer to a situation in which a trader enters a position anticipating a future transaction signal or price movement, but the signal or movement never develops, and the asset moves in the opposite direction.For example, whales could deposit large amounts of BTC into various exchanges, making it seem like they are selling a lot of BTC, causing fear in the market to drive BTC down.In reality, whales might not be selling the BTC deposited into exchanges at all. Instead, they may use this fakeout situation to buy the asset at a lower price, for example.Well-known pseudonymous trader Cantering Clark explained:Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, raised a similar point regarding what he calls ""psyops"" — psychological operations — with on-chain data.Ju noted that whales may deposit BTC to exchanges in order to shift market sentiment from greed to fear. The negative market sentiment alone could be sufficient to drive the price down, which may also lead to cascading liquidations if the futures market is overcrowded. Ju said:For instance, Gemini reportedly saw large BTC deposits before Bitcoin dropped on March 15 to as low as $54,500. At the time, Ju emphasized that while it could be sell orders, it also could be psyops to lead the market into thinking that selling pressure is coming. He explained:According to Philip Swift, an analyst and co-founder of Decentrader:Swift further explained that ""there is clearly an opportunity for 'pysops', where large players trick avid wallet watchers into thinking that funds are being moved ahead of being sold on the market.""Regarding these wallet transfers, Swift said:Nevertheless, Bitcoin deposits into exchanges have historically been a fairly accurate predictor of the direction BTC will go.For example, in the past three weeks alone, two major spikes in BTC exchange inflow marked the local top on Feb. 22 and March 15.Therefore, many on-chain metrics, including BTC transfers to and from exchanges, have shown to be very useful in anticipating BTC price action.But traders should also be aware that this information is open to everyone and thus cannot be considered the silver bullet of metrics. As its popularity rises, it can be gamed by whales, the media, and other influential entities. This can ultimately mislead traders and shift sentiment to give a false picture of market conditions, particularly in the short term.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

36,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price made another new all-time high above $60,000 over the weekend. However, the same cannot be said for Ether (ETH), and the market in general didn’t show much strength thereafter for a continuation. As a result, BTC price has dropped by 7% over the past 24 hours.During this pullback, ETH also dropped in its U.S. dollar pair. However, the ETH/BTC pair actually saw a bounce. It could be the case that altcoins are attempting to stabilize against BTC while Bitcoin is paring some of its massive weekend gains. Interestingly enough, could this be a prelude to a potentially massive rally for Ether later this year? Let's take a look at the charts.Ether failed to break through $1,900 on March 13, which is essentially the final hurdle before hitting the psychological barrier of $2,000. The entire market is waiting for a clear-cut break above $2,000, and it looks like it has to wait a bit longer.Since the bottom at $1,300, beautiful support/resistance flips have been seen for more upside. The last support/resistance flip occurred at the $1,740 level, resulting in a rally toward $1,900.However, Ether’s price came back to this $1,740 level rather quickly. Such a dropdown is a sign of weakness, particularly as multiple tests of key support levels increase the risk of falling further.In other words, if Ether’s price can’t hold the $1,740 area, the market should expect another leg down toward the $1,500 level.Luckily for the bulls, the ETH/BTC pair has held up nicely during this latest drop in BTC price, finding support in the 0.029–0.031 sats region. If this support zone is lost, however, the next support is found at the 0.025–0.0275 sats region. This level, in particular, is critical to hold to sustain the current bull market cycle.Meanwhile, the chart shows that altcoins do not constantly go up. They often experience heavy corrections, and ETH/BTC has already been in correction mode since February.Nevertheless, the construction itself remains intact and valid, with higher lows and higher highs constantly being printed.The chart for ETH/BTC still looks bullish. The constant higher lows have been in play since summer 2019, which kickstarted a general uptrend.Such uptrends do have periods of consolidation. But as long as the structure of higher lows remains, the bullish structure remains valid. Therefore, the regions previously discussed are important to watch, namely the area between 0.025 sats and 0.0275 sats.A strong impulse move will likely happen for Ether once Ethereum 2.0 is closer to its release date, which should help resolve some of the scaling issues and high transaction costs. Until then, the FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) and negativity surrounding the project will likely remain.However, traders should be aware that times of negative market sentiment are usually the best period to get in, rather than entering, or FOMOing, when the market is overheated. The critical areas to hold for Ether now are between $1,700 and $1,740. Tests of the resistance levels above should occur as long as this support region remains below. However, the crucial resistance to break is the $1,830–$1,860 level.However, breaking the $1,830–$1,860 level is unlikely in the short term, given that the market sentiment has shifted in the past few days. If the resistance confirms here, Ether may face another corrective move toward $1,500.The next big impulse wave could happen once this period of consolidation and compression is completed. This impulse wave should propel Ether far above $2,000.

37,"Elon Musk’s love affair with cryptocurrency shows no sign of ending after a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission announced the adoption of new official titles for him and a fellow Tesla executive.Starting Monday, Elon Musk will carry the official title of “technoking of Tesla,” while the firm’s chief financial officer, Zack Kirkhorn, will officially be known as “master of coin.” The 8-K form filed with the SEC states:The filing also states that Musk and Kirkhorn will retain their current respective positions as CEO and chief financial officer.With no sign of an accompanying tweet that the Tesla CEO has become famous for, onlookers can only speculate as to why Musk and Kirkhorn have adopted the new titles.In early February, Bitcoin's (BTC) spot price increased by $3,000 in a matter of minutes when news broke regarding Tesla’s acquisition of $1.5 billion worth of BTC, sending the coin's price to a new all-time high in the process.After a sharp dip in the value of Bitcoin — and Tesla's stock price — the title of “world’s richest man” was briefly lost from Elon Musk’s resume. However, neither Bitcoin nor Tesla spent too long in the doldrums, as a resurgent coin price soon returned healthy profits to Musk and the company. On Saturday, Bitcoin once again soared to a new all-time high when the coin price flirted with the $60,000 range for the first time in its history."
38,"The minister of finance of India, Nirmala Sitharaman, has given a ray of hope for the Indian cryptocurrency community as more fear, uncertainty and doubt circulate regarding a supposedly impending ban on digital assets. In a Saturday interview with India Today, Sitharaman emphasized that the ministry does not plan to shut off Indian innovations associated with Bitcoin (BTC) and its underlying blockchain technology.“From our side, we are very clear that we are not shutting all options off. We will allow certain windows for people use, so that experiments on the blockchain, Bitcoins or cryptocurrency [...] and fintech, which depend on such experiments, will have that window available for them. We are not going to shut it off,” she said.Sitharaman said that the ministry is finalizing a cabinet note on crypto as India continues formulating its official stance on the asset class. “It is nearing completion, and then it will be taken to the cabinet. The Supreme Court had commented on cryptocurrency. We are very clear that the Reserve Bank of India will take a call on an official cryptocurrency,” she said.After India's supreme court lifted a crypto banking ban one year ago, reports of a new ban started circulating in early 2021. In February, another anonymous Indian official claimed that the government was about to introduce a complete ban on crypto, giving investors up to six months to liquidate their holdings.On Sunday, Reuters published a report citing an anonymous senior government official who claimed that India is preparing to enforce a blanket ban on crypto and impose major penalties on rule-breakers. As part of an alleged bill, India is planning to criminalize “possession, issuance, mining, trading and transferring crypto-assets,” the source claimed.Despite reports of a ban from anonymous sources continuing to surface, Sitharaman said in early March that the ministry wants to form a ""calibrated"" stance on digital assets. Nischal Shetty, founder of local crypto exchange WazirX, seemed optimistic about Sitharaman's comments in a tweet, stating that it is time for the Indian crypto community to build. There you go! #Bitcoin crypto will NOT be shut off.

CBDC does not mean shutting off other Crypto assets & utilities.

India, your time is here. Time to BUIDL and win

Thank you @nsitharaman ji, you’ve brought joy to this sector#IndiaWantsCryptopic.twitter.com/mySjPkoyt0The RBI and the Ministry of Finance did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment."
39,"Last month, Tradelize and Cointelegraph teamed up for a contest to hear your craziest crypto stories — casting a spotlight on some of your biggest successes and fails.You didn’t disappoint… and selecting one winner was impossible. Because of this, we chose two — with the lucky raconteurs sharing a 5,000 USDT prize between them.The first tale came from Timofei, who received a $100 gift from his grandmother in Russia. He decided to invest it in cryptocurrency — all while he followed his dreams of becoming a director in film school.Timofei was able to use the profits he generated from the investment to fund the shooting of a film he was making for his course, with his grandmother serving as the main producer. His creation was a success — and as well as being entered into a Switzerland film festival, it was also shown at Moscow’s Museum of Modern Art.“This is a living dream, because I didn’t count on anything,” he wrote in his story.His grandmother lives in a remote village where internet access is limited — meaning he needs to put his mobile phone in a clay mug to get a signal. These days, Timofei says he is carefully day trading with an ambition to shoot a graduation film. He’s also been able to return the $100 to his grandmother, and buy her a TV for her birthday.Wrapping up his powerful story, he wrote: “I do not always close deals profitably, but I manage to keep myself in hand and learn from mistakes step by step. After all, for me the stock chart is a metaphor for life, with its ups and downs. Have a good investment, watch an art movie and take care of your grandmothers!”The other winner chosen by Cointelegraph comes from Cryptonaut, who used to compete in local Counter-Strike tournaments at internet cafes in 2011, when Bitcoin was trading at about $1.He wrote: “My team and I made it to the finals after several razor-thin matches. It came down to a two-versus-one situation where I accidentally killed my teammate with some friendly fire. Needless to say we lost the match.“The winning team ended up getting close to $500 in cash. As runners up we received 20 BTC each. At the time, I didn't really know what cryptocurrency really was. I ended up trading my 20 BTC for a gaming mouse pad.”Cryptonaut still has the mousepad to this very day — but naturally, he thinks of what could have been. If he had held on to the crypto stash, it would have been worth more than $1.2 million at the time of writing… 2,400 times more than the $500 would have been worth.The CEOs of Tradelize and its partner Wootrade also shared their experiences. Anton Zapolskyi revealed how he first learned about Bitcoin, while Jack Tan shared an upbeat story from the dark days of the crypto winter in 2018.Cointelegraph’s managing editor, Kristina Lucrezia Cornèr, says selecting the winners of the contest wasn’t an easy feat by any means.She added: “We all know the crypto markets have been full of drama over the past decade — and this contest with Tradelize shows that there have been plenty of highs and lows for early adopters, too. We’ve seen stories of people who have achieved financial independence by embracing Bitcoin… and those who have missed out on life-changing profits after selling in the early days. As the total market cap races to $2 trillion, the next chapter of the crypto revolution is only just beginning, and the rest of the story is still unwritten.”You can check the list of winners on the Tradelize website, and prizes are going to be distributed in the coming week."
40,"XRP tokenholders have attempted to insert themselves as third-party defendants in the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs.A motion to intervene was filed by John Deaton of Deaton Law Firm on Sunday on behalf of over 6,000 XRP holders. Deaton, himself an XRP holder, argued that the interests of tokenholders were not being adequately represented in the securities lawsuit against Ripple Labs and its executives.Deaton’s argument builds upon the refutation of any securities violations by Ripple Labs. Specifically, if XRP is not a security — as Ripple executives Bradley Garlinghouse and Christian Larsen claim — then the efforts of Ripple executives have no bearing on the performance of XRP.For this reason, Deaton, along with over 6,000 concerned tokenholders, have moved to intervene as third-party defendants. The filing states:In an announcement posted to Deaton’s website, CryptoLaw, on Sunday, the lawyer and cryptocurrency enthusiast claimed that XRP holders had suffered $15 billion in losses in the days immediately following the SEC’s announcement of its lawsuit against Ripple Labs. In the two weeks following the commencement of the lawsuit, XRP's price sunk 76% from $0.76 down to $0.18.The falling token price was triggered in part by the decision of major cryptocurrency exchanges to delist XRP in the wake of the lawsuit. Numerous major exchanges including Binance.US, eToro, Coinbase, Bittrex and OKCoin removed XRP from their respective platforms. Investment services such as Grayscale also liquidated XRP holdings, choosing to convert them into more Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC).In January, Deaton, on behalf of XRP holders, filed a petition asking that the SEC distinguish between the XRP sales carried out by Ripple executives and the XRP purchases made by individual tokenholders on secondary exchange markets. The filing also requested that any funds received from a possible Ripple settlement be diverted to a collective trust for use by XRP holders who incurred losses due to the SEC’s actions. The request was dismissed by the SEC.On Thursday, Ripple executives Garlinghouse and Larsen refuted the SEC’s demands to investigate the finer details of their personal finances. Garlinghouse and Larsen called for a protective order to block an investigation into their personal accounts, arguing that their personal and professional finances were not intertwined. The legal team also called for courts to quash subpoenas issued to six banks used by Garlinghouse and Larsen."
41,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) abruptly fell by nearly 6% in less than four hours as the new weekly candle opened on March 15.Three factors contributed to the weakening momentum of Bitcoin, namely a new weekly open, high funding rates, and stablecoin inflows primarily driving the market upward.When a new weekly candle opens, Bitcoin typically sees large volatility because the trend on Monday could dictate how Bitcoin performs throughout the rest of the week.Over the last few hours, as pseudonymous trader ""Rekt Capital"" noted, Bitcoin saw an overextended pullback. As a result, the trader said BTC could be in the process of seeing a ""volatile reset."" The trader said:If Bitcoin fails to rebound from the $55,000 area, the trader warned that a steep correction to the $46,700 support level becomes a possibility.When the price of Bitcoin began to drop, the futures market funding rate of BTC was hovering above 0.1% across major exchanges.This indicates that the overwhelming majority of the market was longing or buying Bitcoin, making it an overcrowded trade.According to data from Bybt, 194,541 traders were liquidated in the past 24 hours for a total of roughly $1.83 billion, the highest since Feb. 21. The futures market saw cascading liquidations as the market was extremely overheated.This wave of liquidations eventually led Bitcoin to drop below $57,000, which Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe identified as a key support level. He said:Before the drop occurred, on-chain data analytics platform CryptoQuant pointed out large BTC deposits into Gemini.Gemini is a leading Bitcoin exchange in the United States alongside Coinbase and is often regarded as a ""whale exchange.""Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, said:In addition to the selling pressure from whales, the recent Bitcoin rally being led by stablecoin inflows into exchanges was another bearish sign.Ju noted that the rally was catalyzed by sidelined capital held in stablecoins rather than institutions in the United States. He explained:"
42,"The Oakland Athletics, the San Francisco East Bay ballclub at the heart of the Academy Award-nominated 2011 movie Moneyball, is greeting the new season with a Bitcoin-friendly offer for its fans.Until April 1, the club is offering a full season, six-person suite for the home season at the price of 1 Bitcoin (BTC), currently valued at $57,653. That works out — for the time being — to be a slight discount, given that the fiat currency price for a suite is fixed at $64,800. Bitcoin's unprecedented price rise since December 2020 has opened up the possibility for the A's to design an offer for fans that is also economically sound for the club. In an interview with reporters on Sunday, club president Dave Kaval said:Kaval added that a further factor in the decision to engage with crypto was its rising popularity in California, noting that ""Especially in the Bay Area you see more people discussing or transacting with Bitcoin."" 100 full season suites, priced at 1 BTC, will be on sale for the new season. The go-ahead for games to open at 20% audience capacity was only recently confirmed by California Governor Gavin Newsom and remains subject to COVID-19 cases remaining under control.Aside from the A's adoption of cryptocurrency payments, the increasingly popular market for nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, has also been making inroads at the intersection of the art world and the major league sports community. In February, bidders forked out millions of dollars for tokenized art from former second baseman Micah Johnson. Meanwhile, blockchain sports firms like Chiliz have been attempting to get a foothold in the MLB fanbase, recognizing the game as a potentially lucrative route to mass adoption of the technology."
43,"Bitcoin (BTC) begins a new week riding high near record price levels — can it sustain the gains much longer?After a roaring weekend, the largest cryptocurrency is seeing mixed results prior to Monday’s Wall Street open.Cointelegraph takes a look at five factors that could serve to influence where BTC/USD heads in the coming days.It’s a mixed picture for macro markets as the week gets underway, with no clear narrative dictating what the knock-on effect could be, if any, for on-risk assets.While bond yields are troubling U.S. futures, on the other side of the world, Asia could barely be better as China reports almost inconceivable growth for the first months of 2021.As Bloomberg noted, the data looks a lot tidier thanks to being compared with the same time last year, at which point China was in lockdown over the coronavirus. Both industrial output and retail sales beat targets of 32%, jumping by 35% and 33.8%, respectively.Nonetheless, liquidity worries involving China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), kept the overall mood in check.“Since the start of this year, PBOC has net drained over 600 billion yuan in funds from the market in order to curb asset bubbles,” Xing Zhaopeng, an economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, told Bloomberg.A forecast rate increase from the United States Federal Reserve — something assumed to be all but guaranteed by some in the wake of the money-printing exercises of this year and last — is likewise far from clear cut, according to the bank’s data.“Economists expect Fed to hike by 50bps in 2023. But they also expect the US CenBank’s own forecast, which will publish at the next session on Wednesday, will show the median Fed official projecting rates staying on hold near zero throughout that year,” markets commentator Holger Zschaepitz summarized on Monday.For U.S. retail investors, meanwhile, the short term is dominated by one macro issue only: stimulus checks.With the go-ahead from lawmakers, $1,400 direct payments are already in the mail as part of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus plan, something already being called an “advertisement for Bitcoin.”The move adds to the colossal U.S. debt mountain, already over $28 trillion even before its approval, and signals an ultimate return to inflation even as the Fed itself insists that the risk of such a scenario remains low.Right now, however, Bitcoin proponents are only concerned about how much of the latest fiat windfall will find its way into the cryptocurrency ecosystem.“Millions very happy Government passes $1.9 trillion stimulus bill. Who wouldn’t be happy with free money,” Robert Kiyosaki, author of the popular book Rich Dad Poor Dad, responded over the weekend.Money has, in fact, been reaching Americans’ wallets since March 14, but the latest reports suggest that many will need to wait until at least Wednesday for their allocation.Last year, with Bitcoin at a fraction of its current price and publicity itself much lower, a spike in buy-ins on Coinbase worth exactly the amount of the first stimulus check was still visible. This time around, conditions are much more favorable for a sudden jolt of investment from the retail sector.Unlike 2020, analyst Lyn Alden Schwartzer noted, the timing of the third round of payments may make recipients feel more flush and allow them to opt for alternative investments.“The third round of stimulus checks will go out when the income spike from the second round of checks is still pushing personal income above-trend,” Schwartzer tweeted on Saturday.Within Bitcoin, Monday is already proving to be a difficult day for traders.After reaching all-time highs of $61,700 over the weekend, Bitcoin failed to maintain the bullish momentum, falling below the $60,000 mark during trading.At the time of writing, the losses were not through yet as BTC/USD headed toward $58,000, having retraced below the previous all-time high of $58,300 set in February.A look at exchange order book data from Binance shows support lined up at $57,000, but should this break, levels closer to $50,000 are in the cards.The reason for the accelerating decline could be a familiar source. As on-chain analytics service CryptoQuant revealed on the day, exchange reserves are rising to the highest levels in a month, bucking a trend that as recently as Sunday continued to see traders withdraw BTC to cold storage.Should appetites briefly return for selling, downward price pressure is a natural consequence. According to the data, Gemini appears to have seen a significant inflow, indicating that a professional trader, likely a whale, is primed to divest themselves of some or all of their holdings.“This 18k $BTC deposit is legit as it was a transaction between user deposit wallets and Gemini hot wallet,” CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju commented on the event.As Cointelegraph reported, such a practice is far from uncommon, but given the amounts involved, sentiment can still be spooked as a result.A whale sell-off likewise accompanied Bitcoin’s last major correction from all-time highs — 20% following its record $58,300 run in February.Contrasting the lowertime frame wobble is data showing that the weekend conversely saw large amounts of Bitcoin taken off the market.According to monitoring resource Glassnode, Sunday, in particular, produced a large shift away from liquid supply as all-time highs failed to dent enthusiasm among investors.Previously, the firm noted that those buying have a historical tendency to hold for the long term and not sell as a result of temporary market phenomena such as Bitcoin reaching a specific price point.Zooming out likewise shows that despite an uptick in BTC balances across exchanges on the day, the amount of Bitcoin available is still far lower than even half a year ago. Coinbase’s reserves, for example, are down almost 20% since December 2020 alone.In a rebuff to the bulls, exchange funding rates have themselves seen their biggest spike since Feb. 23 — an indication that it may yet still pay to be short.The data compounds findings from analysts including Cointelegraph contributor Filbfilb late last week, who argued that funding rate disparities across trading platforms took away from the overall narrative of a larger move soon to hit BTC markets.""Given the macro context is so bullish for BTC right now, in our opinion, it pays to be patient and not get liquidated on low time frames when larger moves are likely just around the corner,"" he wrote in an update.Filbfilb himself is aiming for a local price top of $70,000 or more, describing it as Bitcoin's ""destiny,"" but warns that the road to that goal will come with a lot more turbulence than that seen as Bitcoin cracked $50,000.In comments on his Telegram trading channel, he referenced the impact of Tesla buying Bitcoin as an example of the straight-up trajectory that may not be replicated this time around.""Just as a side note, I doubt this will break out like it did with the elon candle.. likely to be way more messy this time around,"" he wrote."
44,"Over the past 10 years, Bitcoin (BTC) has beaten out all over asset classes by at least a factor of 10.The milestone was noted by Compound Capital Advisors’ CEO and founder, Charlie Bilello, who compiled the performances of the top asset classes using data from YCharts.Responding to the findings, Messari researcher Roberto Talamas highlighted that Bitcoin has produced an average annualized return of 230% — more than 10 times higher than the second-ranked asset class.Asset Class Returns over the Last 10 Years...

Data via @ycharts pic.twitter.com/yRvdkIX1BVThe Nasdaq 100 Index ranked second with an annualized return of 20%, followed by U.S. large caps — shares in United States-based companies with market capitalizations exceeding $10 billion — with an average annual performance of 14%. U.S. small-cap stocks were the only other asset class to post double-digit annualized returns for the past 10 years, with 12.9%.The data also shows that gold made a paltry annualized return of 1.5% since 2011, with five out of the past 11 years producing a loss for the asset. According to Gold Price, the precious metal has fallen 8.5% since the beginning of 2021, much to the chagrin of Bitcoin detractor and gold investor Peter Schiff.Since 2011, BTC’s cumulative gains equate to a whopping 20,000,000%. 2013 was Bitcoin’s best-performing year, during which it gained 5,507%.The data also shows that Bitcoin has only posted an annualized loss for two years of its history, with BTC falling by 58% and 73% during 2014 and 2018, respectively.Since the start of 2021, BTC is up 108%, with its price hitting an all-time high of just over $61,500 on Sunday."
45,"Bitcoin (BTC) has risen more than 1,000% since March 2020 and this shows that the digital asset has outperformed traditional asset classes like equities, commodities and bonds by a massive margin.The resilience of Bitcoin even after the sharp rally continues to attract buyers. Jarvis Labs analyst Ben Lilly said the whales who hold between 100 to 1,000 Bitcoin have added about 63,000 Bitcoin in their combined holdings since Feb. 28.The activities of this group of whales are worth monitoring because Lilly said “this class of wallets were the ones that timed the 2017 rally the best.”In addition to the whales, Bitcoin adoption by companies also continues to increase. RushOrderTees, a t-shirt printing and embroidering company, recently revealed it had purchased roughly $300,000 worth of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the past month and they intend to increase it to $1 million by the end of April.This shows that even smaller firms are shifting part of their treasury assets from fiat to cryptocurrency. If this trend catches up, it could soon add a new class of investors to the crypto sector.Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may outperform the others in the next few days.Bitcoin resumed its uptrend on March 13 when it soared above the all-time high at $58,341. The bears will now try to pull the price back below the breakout level and trap the aggressive traders while the bulls will try to flip $58,341 into support.If the bulls succeed in their endeavor, the BTC/USD pair could start its journey toward the next target objective at $72,112. The upsloping moving averages suggest that bulls have the upper hand.If the price slides below $58,341 but rebounds off the 20-day exponential moving average ($53,028), it will indicate that the sentiment remains positive as buyers are accumulating on dips.However, it is not all bullish on the charts because the negative divergence on the relative strength index (RSI) indicates the momentum is weakening. Sometimes the negative divergence gets invalidated during a strong bull run, but its occurrence warrants caution because on several occasions it successfully predicts a reversal.If the 20-day EMA cracks, it will suggest that supply exceeds demand and traders are rushing to book profits. That may pull the price down to the 50-day simple moving average ($46,047) and then $41,959. Such a deep fall could delay the start of the next leg of the up-move.The 4-hour chart shows the bulls have repeatedly bought the dips to the 20-EMA. Therefore, the bulls may again try to defend the 20-EMA. If the price rebounds off this support, a retest of $61,825 is likely. A breakout of this resistance may indicate the start of the next leg of the uptrend.Alternatively, if the price breaks below the 20-EMA support, it will signal a possible change in the short-term trend. The next support is at $56,000 and then at the 50-SMA. A break below this support will suggest that the breakout above $58,341 may have been a bull trap.Ether (ETH) broke above the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,879on March 13, but the bulls could not sustain the momentum and challenge the all-time high at $2,040. This suggests the bears are aggressively defending the $1,879 to $2,040. resistance zone.The ETH/USD pair may now again drop to the 20-day EMA ($1,727). A strong bounce off this support will suggest the bulls continue to accumulate on dips. That may enhance the prospects of a retest and breakout above $2,040.If the bulls can sustain the price above $2,040, the next leg of the uptrend to $2,614 may begin.Conversely, if the price dips below both moving averages, it will suggest that supply exceeds demand. That could keep the pair stuck inside the large range between $1,289 and $2,040 for a few more days.The 4-hour chart shows the bears have dragged the price back below $1,879. The pair could now drop to the support line of the ascending channel. If the price rebounds off this support, it will keep the short-term trend in favor of the bulls. The buyers will then again try to resume the up-move.On the contrary, if the bears drag the price below the channel, it will indicate a possible change in trend. The price may then drop to $1,650 and $1,450.VeChain (VET) broke above the $0.0345 to $0.0607 range on March 8. This suggests that the bulls have overpowered the bears. However, the sellers have not conceded defeat as they are trying to stall the up-move at $0.0725.If the price once again rebounds off the $0.0607 support, it will suggest that the level has flipped to support. The level may then act as a launchpad for the next leg of the uptrend that could reach $0.0870 and then $0.10.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest the bulls are in command.This bullish view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below $0.0607 and the 20-day EMA ($0.0564). Such a move will suggest that the recent breakout above $0.0607 was a possible bull trap.The price has dipped below the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart. The bears will now try to sink the pair back below the breakout level at $0.0607.If they succeed, it will suggest that demand dries up at higher levels. The pair could then drop to $0.050. A deeper fall could delay the start of the next leg of the uptrend and keep the price stuck inside a range.Conversely, if the price rebounds off $0.0607, the pair may retest $0.0725. A breakout of this resistance could resume the uptrend.Monero (XMR) broke out of the overhead resistance at $232.39 on March 13. This clears the path for a rise to $288.60. However, the bears are in no mood to relent. They are trying to pull the price back below the breakout level at $232.39.If they succeed, the XMR/USD pair may again drop to the 20-day EMA ($220). This is an important support to keep an eye on because a strong bounce off it will suggest the bulls continue to buy at lower levels.The gradually rising 20-day EMA and the RSI above 57 suggest a minor advantage to the bulls. This positive view will invalidate if the bears sink the pair below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($197).The 4-hour chart shows the formation of an ascending triangle pattern. The price is currently retesting the breakout level from the triangle at $232.39. A bounce off of this support could resume the uptrend to the pattern target at $292.89.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the trendline of the triangle, it will invalidate the bullish setup. That could pull the price down to $200 and then to $171.90.FTX Token (FTT) broke out of the $35 overhead resistance on March 9 and resumed its uptrend. The first stop could be $45 and if that level is ascended, the up-move may reach the psychological level at $50.The rising moving averages and the RSI in the overbought territory suggest the bulls are in control. Any profit-booking at the current level could pull the price down to the breakout level at $35.If the bulls can flip this level to support, it will suggest strong demand on dips. The $35 level could then act as a floor on any declines.Conversely, a break below the 20-day EMA ($32.93) will suggest profit-booking at higher levels. The FTT/USD pair could then drop to $25.Both moving averages on the 4-hour chart are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought territory, which suggests the bulls are in command.The pair has continued its upward march without breaking the 20-EMA support, indicating the bulls are not booking profits in a hurry as they expect higher levels in the future.The first support on the downside is the 20-EMA. A break below this support will signal a weakening momentum. The next support on the downside is the breakout level at $35.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

46,"In these hyper-partisan times, any bill that includes sponsors from both sides of the aisle is noteworthy. There is one pending now that is particularly important in the crypto space. On March 8, 2021, H.R. 1628, the Token Taxonomy Act of 2021, was introduced by representative Warren Davidson. It was co-sponsored by representatives Ted Budd, Darren Soto, Scott Perry and Josh Gottheimer.Among other provisions, the bill would exempt “digital tokens” from the definition of security, and it would also preempt inconsistent state regulation. Crypto assets would need to meet certain specified requirements in order to count as “digital tokens” under this act:Davidson has explained that the purpose of the bill is to improve regulatory clarity. In addition, in an interview, he suggested that if the bill had been passed in prior years, “it could have forestalled enforcement actions such as the Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) suit against Ripple Labs.” This comment examines in more detail how the bill might actually play out with regard to certain forms of crypto.As virtually everyone in the crypto space is likely to know, Bitcoin (BTC) is issued exclusively in mining transactions. In other words, it is created “in response to the verification of proposed transactions,” meeting the first of the requirements to be a digital token. In addition, its transaction history is maintained on the blockchain, satisfying the second of the above requirements.The entire process is set up to resist modification or change absent consensus among a large and decentralized community. The entire Bitcoin network was set up to be peer-to-peer although numerous exchanges now also exist to facilitate transfers. Finally, Bitcoin is not associated with any company or partnership, and it represents neither an ownership interest nor the right to share in revenues.Given these facts, Bitcoin would clearly be a digital token. As such, under the new definition proposed in the act, Bitcoin would be excluded from the definition of security. Moreover, under section 2(d) of the act, state securities law regulations regarding registration or imposing limitations on the use of the asset would be precluded from applying to Bitcoin, with the sole proviso that states would retain authority to regulate and enforce actions based on fraud or deceit.Because the United States Securities and Exchange Commission already excludes Bitcoin from the reach of the federal securities laws, this would not be a change in federal requirements. It would, however, create a uniform state system pursuant to which Bitcoin is excluded from regulation as securities except as to fraud claims.It is not, however, accurate to assume that all crypto assets will count as digital tokens under the act. Consider Ripple’s XRP (and the pending action by the SEC against the company and its executive officers). For those not totally familiar with Ripple and XRP, the XRP ledger was completed by Ripple in December 2012, and the computer code set a fixed supply of 100 billion XRP. When launched, 80 billion of those tokens were transferred to Ripple, and the remaining 20 billion XRP went to a group of founders.According to the SEC’s complaint, from 2013 through 2014, Ripple made efforts to create a market for XRP by having the company distribute approximately 12.5 billion XRP through bounty programs that paid programmers compensation for reporting problems in the XRP ledger’s code. From 2014 through the third quarter of 2020, the company sold around 8.8 billion XRP in the market and through institutional sales, raising approximately $1.38 billion to fund its operations. Resales, including resales from XRP previously distributed to the company’s founders, were also occurring at this time. So, would XRP be a digital token and thus exempt from regulation as a security under the act?Related: SEC vs. Ripple: A predictable but undesirable developmentThe first requirement is actually the biggest problem for XRP. The bill contains three options for the first part of the test, but it is unclear that XRP meets any of them. Because all of the tokens were issued at the launch, there is no argument that XRP is created “in response to the verification or collection of proposed transactions.”In addition, because all of the tokens were issued at launch, it is clear that Ripple or those in control of the company could have altered the terms under which XRP was to be issued. This leaves the argument that there was “an initial allocation of digital units that will otherwise be created in accordance with” one of the first two alternatives, and it is doubtful that this happened. XRP was never set up to be mined, and Ripple certainly had the ability to maintain control over the asset since it owned the vast majority of it. This makes it appear that XRP would not actually be a digital token, although the facts might be arguable.It should be noted that the act also provides a very limited exemption for any “digital unit,” which is a much broader term that covers any “representation of economic, proprietary, or access rights that is stored in a machine-readable format.” The exemption covers any person who has acted with a reasonable and good faith belief that the digital unit is a digital token, but it only applies if all reasonable efforts are used to stop sales and return any unused proceeds to purchasers within 90 days of notice from the SEC that it has concluded the interest is a security. Ripple has obviously declined to follow this course, as it is fighting the current SEC enforcement action in court.While this analysis and result may not disappoint everyone in the crypto community since some have long argued that XRP is not a “true” crypto asset anyway, it is a clear indication that the act does not create a free pass for all crypto offerings. It also would not be the end of the road for Ripple, which could still argue that XRP is not an investment contract under the Howey Test.One more illustrative example might also be important to understand how the act would work if adopted. Consider Facebook’s original proposal for Libra. On June 18, 2019, Facebook announced in a white paper that it was actively planning to launch a cryptocurrency to be called Libra in 2020. The entire proposal has been renamed and updated, but the terms of the original white paper are the ones that are considered here.Libra was conceived by Facebook and designed to be a “stablecoin,” with its value pegged to a basket of bank deposits and short-term government securities for a group of historically stable fiat currencies. It was to be governed by the Libra Association, a Swiss nonprofit organization.The Libra Association was conceived as a group of diverse organizations from around the world, including not only Facebook but also major investors such as Mastercard, Visa, eBay and PayPal. The original plan was to have approximately 100 members for the association by the target launch date, each of which was to contribute $10 million. In exchange, the association members would have the right to oversee Libra’s development, its real-world reserves and even the Libra blockchain’s governance rules. The group of 100 members would also be able to act as validator nodes for the asset.Libra was not set to be mineable, but rather to be issued as and when the Libra Association determined. The white paper also described a system that would have allowed the association to change how the system operated and, in particular, set rules for the issuance of the assets. While the association would have a relatively large number of diverse members with their own objectives and interests, they would be acting through the association, which is itself a single legal entity. This means that the Libra coin (as originally conceived) would not have fit within the definition of a digital token as set out in the act.Would that mean Libra would have been a security? As was the case for XRP, the answer is “not necessarily.” The next step would be to ask whether it would have qualified as an investment contract. Depending on how the association determined to issue the coin, and whether there was any possibility of appreciation (which seems unlikely, as it was supposed to be pegged to fiat currencies as a “stablecoin”), the Libra coin might or might not have been an investment contract. The determination would have been based on the same Howey Test that the act was reportedly designed to clarify.Defining security to exclude digital tokens means that the SEC will retain no authority to regulate fraud in connection with transactions involving these interests, leaving the bulk of enforcement to agencies like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. While the CFTC has sought enforcement against those who engage in fraudulent or deceitful conduct in the crypto spot markets (where transactions in crypto rather than those involving futures or other derivatives are involved), it lacks the resources available to the SEC.For example, the CFTC just announced its first enforcement action involving a pump-and-dump scheme, while the SEC’s list of prior crypto enforcement actions includes a number of market manipulation claims in addition to claims against John McAfee, the target of the CFTC’s recent action.This difference is explainable, in part, by the relative size of the two agencies. The SEC’s 2021 budget justification plan called for support in the amount of $1.895 billion. On the other hand, the CFTC’s 2021 budget request was a relatively modest $304 million. Moving fraud enforcement to the CFTC is, therefore, not necessarily prudent or wise.In addition, while it is quite clear that the proposed definition of digital token is likely to be far simpler than the Howey test, it is not necessarily going to replace that analysis in all cases.Does the Token Taxonomy Act offer increased clarity? Absolutely. Preemption of inconsistent state laws could be particularly helpful in this regard. Does it provide certainty in all cases? No, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. Is the act a good idea? Sadly, probably not. Providing a ready exemption from registration for digital tokens might be supportable. Removing them from the definition of security in the current climate where fraud continues to be a major concern is probably not.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.The opinions expressed are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of the University or its affiliates.

47,"Bitcoin (BTC) pared some gains, dipping below $60,000 on March 14, a day after setting a new all-time high of $61,950 on Binance. However, on-chain data indicates that the uptrend is likely to continue in the near term.One key metric that is signaling an optimistic short-term trend for Bitcoin is the rise in stablecoin deposits into exchanges.Although high funding rates and an overcrowded market are causing the price to pull back, the entrance of sidelined capital into the crypto market may further boost Bitcoin's momentum.When Bitcoin enters price discovery and hits a new record-high, the interest in the market naturally spikes.There is a lot of liquidity in the current red-hot market, making it an ideal period for whales and high-net-worth investors to take profit on their positions.Filbfilb, a pseudonymous trader and technical analyst, noted that high futures market funding rates and Bitcoin deposits into exchanges were spotted before the drop.The Bitcoin futures market uses a mechanism called ""funding"" to incentivize traders based on the balance of the market.For example, if there are more buyers or long contract holders in the Bitcoin futures market, short-sellers are incentivized to sell or short. When this happens, the funding rate increases, making it expensive for traders to long Bitcoin.Before the drop, the futures funding rate of BTC was hovering in the 0.05% to 0.1% range, which is five to ten times higher than the default 0.01% funding rate. Filbfilb explained:High Bitcoin inflows into exchanges likely fueled the drop because whales often deposit BTC into exchanges when they intend to sell.Therefore, the combination of the selling pressure coming from whales and the high futures funding rate was the likely reason behind today's pullback.But despite, the halt in the rally, stablecoin inflows into exchanges are rising once again, according to the latest data from CryptoQuant. In the crypto market, traders often hedge their holdings against stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USDC, rather than cashing out via withdrawals to bank accounts.Typically, exchanges have a three to seven-day processing period for cash deposits, and when traders want to re-enter the cryptocurrency market, moving cash from their bank accounts back to exchanges becomes cumbersome.Hence, when stablecoins begin to flow into exchanges again — as seen by the green spikes in the chart above — it suggests that sidelined capital may be looking to get back into Bitcoin. Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, wrote:Throughout the past week, the one missing component during the Bitcoin rally was stablecoin inflows. When Bitcoin rallies without a noticeable rise in stablecoin inflows, it increases the probability of an unsustainable uptrend and a short-term correction.If the trend of sidelined capital moving back into the crypto market continues, there is a high probability that this will further fuel Bitcoin's momentum resulting in a broader rally."
48,"On March 13 bulls took full control of the crypto market as Bitcoin (BTC) price vaulted to a new all-time high at $61,844 after a high volume surge pushed the price through overhead resistance near $58,000.  Analysts had spent the week calling for an eventual move above the $60,000 level and social metrics showed bullish sentiment for Bitcoin continued to increase as a number of companies and institutional investors announced plans to make BTC purchases. Bitcoin now finds itself in the realm of price discovery as there is limited data available from a technical analysis standpoint to determine where the price may go next.One possible price target was highlighted in a recent report from Decentrader co-founder Philip Swift, who is now looking at the 1.618 fib extension ($70,000) as the next take profit level.Evidence of the growing merger between the cryptocurrency sector and mainstream industry can be found in the most recent news that FTX  exchange is in the process of finalizing a deal to sponsor the National Basketball Association’s Miami Heat and obtain the naming rights for the teams’ arena, which will likely be renamed FTX arena.Once finalized, the deal would mark the first major partnership with an American sports league for a cryptocurrency project or platform.The explosion in the popularity of nonfungible tokens has also caught the attention of the mainstream press following this week's record-breaking $69.3 million Beeple auction.  The success of the action has prompted an increasing number of well-known artists to begin exploring the NFT space and the opportunities it offers.Altcoins also lit up as Bitcoin soared to a new all-time high. Decentraland (MANA), a virtual reality and gaming-focused project, outperformed the field with an 89% gain to a price of $1.19.The majority of small-cap altcoins witnessed double-digit gains and even larger-cap coins like AAVE and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) surged 10.84% and 14% respectively.Ether (ETH) also rallied 13% to $1,933 as bulls attempt to make a run at the current all-time high of $2,043The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.84 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 62.1%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

49,"The most basic Bitcoin (BTC) options contracts involve buying a call which gives the holder the opportunity to acquire the asset at a fixed price on a set date. For this privilege, the buyer simply pays an upfront fee, known as a premium, to the contract seller.Although this is a great way to use leverage while avoiding the liquidation risk that comes from trading futures contracts, it comes at a cost. The options premium will rise during volatile markets, causing the trade to require even further price appreciation to generate a reasonable profit, so the premium is a metric investors must keep a close eye on.Bitcoin’s daily volatility currently stands at 5.4%, which is far higher than S&P 500's 1.7%. This creates opportunities for arbitrage desks, which will gladly hold Bitcoins in custody and sell a call option to capture this premium.Let’s look at a hypothetical trade to what role the premium plays in the scenario.The odds of this trade are calculated according to the Black & Scholes model and Deribit exchange presents this information as 'delta'. In short, these are the percent-based odds for each strike.According to the chart above, the $54,000 strike for March 26 has a 48% chance of occurring according to the options pricing model, which sounds reasonable. On the other hand, the $58,000 call option has an implied probability of 37%.With roughly 20 days left until the March 2021 expiry, the odds of Bitcoin price closing the month above $60,000 seem likely given today’s price action. Considering this call option is trading for BTC 0.0548 each, it costs $2,790 when Bitcoin was trading at $50,900.In order for this call option to become profitable, BTC price needs to be at $60,800. Had this buyer opted for a conservative 3x leverage futures position, Bitcoin price at $60,800 would have yielded a $1,485 gain.Option markets are a great way to leverage, but investors must set aside time to carefully analyze returns ahead of buying bullish calls.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

50,"Bitcoin (BTC) bulls finally mustered enough strength to push the top-ranked cryptocurrency through the $60,000 level and citing key on-chain metrics, analysts believe the bull run has a ways to go before reaching any considerable resistance.Since pushing back above $50,000 on March 9, every dip in Bitcoin price has been quickly purchased by institutional investors and the BTC balance of whales has also continued to grow over the past few months.A recent report from Ben Lilly, an analyst at Jarvis Labs, analyst Ben Lilly highlighted the “two steps forward, one step back” nature of Bitcoin’s price movements over the past week, noting that the rise in price was accompanied by “four drawbacks of 5%”.According to Lilly, Bitcoin's price action is a good sign of healthy profit-taking as vertical prices are “only healthy when breaking all-time highs,” otherwise known as price discovery.To get a better understanding of where price may be headed, Lilly noted that wallet sizes holding 100 to 1,000 BTC hold about 63,000 more BTC than they did on Feb. 28, indicating that these whale wallets have been accumulating since the dip in preparation for the price to move higher.According to Lilly, “this class of wallets were the ones that timed the 2017 rally the best.”Another bullish indicator highlighted by Lilly is the heavy accumulation that has been happening since BTC price broke $20,000 which hasn’t slowed down since.Lilly said:Lilly further explained that while it is nearly customary for Bitcoin price to see occassional drawdowns after touching a new all-time high, they do little to alter the bullish uptrend.Lilly said:A recent report from Decentrader co-founder Philip Swift echos Lilly's bullish sentiment by pointing to Bitcoin exchange outflows over the past few months. As shown in the chart below, Coinbase and Bitstamp experienced a significant drawdown in their exchange balances since mid-December in 2020.The report highlighted that the reduction in available BTC is “being driven by people and institutions taking Bitcoin off exchanges to keep in cold storage.” This in turn reduces the liquid supply available to quickly sell into the market and decreases the changes of a rapid selloff.Swift did note that a large amount of BTC being pulled off exchanges is being wrapped into WBTC and put into DeFi protocols. This somewhat reduces the bullish narrative as the tokens aren’t fully removed from circulation and put into cold storage, meaning the liquidity hasn’t really been reduced.Another interesting signal discussed by Decentrader is the comparison between Bitcoin being held for one to two years compared to those being held for three or more years.In recent weeks BTC held by investors for less than three years have started to be sold as ‘shorter term’ holders begin to take profits. While these levels are declining, Bitcoin investors who have been holding for more than three years have actually been accumulating recently and according to Swift, this signals that “Bitcoin still likely has a lot more upside to go” in the current bull cycle.Swift said:For David Lifchitz, Chief Investment Officer at ExoAlpha, the price action for Bitcoin between Feb. 22 and March 11 appears to be forming the classic cup and handle formation which is a bullish pattern according to technical analysis. Lifchitz explained that the price drop experienced in March 11 represented the ""top of the cup"" by those who monetized the 10% gain from $45,000 to $57,000.”According to Lifchitz, a mild pullback no lower than the $52,000 and a bounce back up would form the handle of the cup. The breakout above the rim of the cup ($58,000) would open the door for another leg-up from Bitcoin price.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

51,"Bitcoin (BTC) hit $60,000 for the first time on March 13 as the long-awaited continuation of the BTC price bull run got underway.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and Tradingview tracked BTC/USD as the pair finally crossed the historic level after several weeks of mild corrections and periods of consolidation.Bulls had spent a considerable time in limbo as Bitcoin tested prior all-time highs at $58,350 repeatedly, with a significant resistance zone beneath slowing progress.In the end, however, optimism won out, and the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization clinched its latest milestone. At press time, price action focused on an area just below $60,000 amid characteristic volatility.As Bitcoin price inched its way closer to the previous all-time high, analysts at Whalemap observed some interesting on-chain activity taking place. According to the research team:Anticipation of $60,000 and even higher had steadily built up over recent days. As Cointelegraph reported, professional analysts as well as traders were poised to announce the end of Bitcoin's prior sideways price action as indicators pointed in bulls' favor.The now-standard narrative of healthy on-chain metrics combined with positive support from institutions served to bolster confidence. Now that Bitcoin price has reached the $60,000 level, many analysts have set their targets on the $72,000 zone, followed by $100,000. The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.118 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 61.9%."
52,"Bitcoin has seen unparalleled growth in early 2021, reaching highs of over $58,000, almost triple its peak of the 2017–2018 boom. We are entering an era where institutions are starting to turn to Bitcoin (BTC), as many countries worldwide have been printing unprecedented amounts of money to service mounting debt. And to make matters worse, they are also facing the risk of unmanageable inflation. This perfect storm of macro conditions means institutions like pension funds, hedge funds, as well as high-net-worth individuals with trillions of dollars in combined value are starting to pay attention and learn about Bitcoin for the first time.Unlike the 2017 bull run, this current run is driven less by hype and more by Bitcoin being accepted in the traditional financial world as a scarce asset class. Enterprise and institutional adoption of crypto assets has been the driving theme of 2021, with Tesla investing $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, one of the most prominent examples of corporate adoption to date.Related: Tesla, Bitcoin and the crypto space: The show Musk go on? Experts answerAdditionally, large institutions are recognizing the importance of Bitcoin as a store of value, with many adding millions of dollars of the asset to their balance sheets, including Goldman Sachs, Standard Chartered, Square, BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, MicroStrategy and more.Related: Will PayPal’s crypto integration bring crypto to the masses? Experts answerBut the crypto landscape needs to change to truly allow Bitcoin to move into the traditional world. Institutions can’t use private keys that can easily be lost, transact with long strings of letters and numbers, or store funds on exchanges with high counterparty risk.New crypto regulation in the U.S. is making it easier and more acceptable to hold cryptocurrencies by providing more certainty across jurisdictions. Just last month in the U.S., The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency provided much-needed regulatory certainty regarding crypto activities. Brian Brooks, acting comptroller of the currency, stated that access to blockchains, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, the holding of coins from these rails directly or on behalf of clients, and the running of nodes for a public blockchain is permitted. In other words, this allows banks to get actively involved — a huge step in the direction of improving the comfort level of institutions interested in holding crypto.We are also seeing more developments in terms of the custody and management of digital assets, which allows even more institutional and corporate players to enter the space. Goldman Sachs recently issued a request for information to explore the bank’s digital asset custody plans, part of a broader strategy in entering the stablecoin market. While the details aren’t yet firm, these seismic moves by key institutions are fueling the fire.While these institutions have huge teams to manage and oversee their new crypto holdings, smaller companies have also started to experiment with adding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to their balance sheet. As companies, big and small, start to hold crypto, it is becoming increasingly clear that the next generation of companies will act more like investors holding and balancing funds in multiple asset classes.This includes companies for which crypto and blockchain is not their core business, reshaping businesses’ very value proposition: Everyone is now a fund whose returns may be decoupled from their core business offering. Small companies that may have only been holding cash are now investors concerned about their liquidity. In the emerging world of decentralized finance, the sky’s the limit to how complex asset management can become; you can buy and sell derivative products, engage in lending and much more.Related: Where does the future of DeFi belong: Ethereum or Bitcoin? Experts answerI envision a future where all companies hold crypto on their balance sheet, and every company is an investor, whether that is their core business offering or not. But this future is dependent on both user experience and regulation. Some companies and institutions holding crypto are willing to take risks by figuring out their own operational and financial security measures to manage their crypto, while for others, this is a non-starter. The traditional world will require custody solutions, a traditional UX for transactions, crypto wealth management and more.For smaller companies starting to dip their toes into holding crypto, my advice is to keep it simple without getting too distracted by all the crypto volatility and noise. The current crypto rally brings great excitement and opportunity for growth, but companies need to do what makes sense for them. Keeping a basic index approach to corporate crypto treasury management — for example, holding 5% of funds in Bitcoin, 95% cash and equivalents and rebalancing when the price increases or decreases — allows you to gain exposure to the market while being smart with cash and runway.Overall, as institutions start to get serious about Bitcoin and the combination of regulation and user experience helps to make crypto a more accessible and accepted asset class, the traditional world of financial management will evolve.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

53,"When talking about markets, both mainstream and crypto, “bullish” and “bearish” often come up in headlines and conversation, although such usage typically depends on financial knowledge and experience. What do the two terms mean?Bullish and bearish refer to market sentiment, seen collectively or expressed by an individual. If someone is bullish, it means they expect an asset or asset class to rise in price. Conversely, bearish refers to negative price expectations. Someone holding a bullish lean is sometimes called a “bull,” or “bulls” if a group or faction of the market is bullish. Therefore, “bears” anticipate falling asset values.Why use bulls and bears as the animals of choice for such terminology? The answer possibly lies in the way the two animals attack their prey. Bulls attack in an upward fashion, driving their horns up through their target. Bears, on the other hand, start high and attack downward with their weight and arms.This explanation of the terminology’s roots, however, is just one possibility, according to Investopedia. “The actual origins of these expressions are unclear.” The verbiage may also stem from bearskin dealings long ago.Oxford Learner’s Dictionary describes bullish as: “feeling confident and positive about the future,” or “causing, or connected with, an increase in the price of shares.” Bearish means: “showing or expecting a fall in the prices of shares.”Bullish and bearish desires depend on a number of factors. In general, traders may care less about whether a market or asset is bullish or bearish, as long as they can trade in both directions (called going long and short). Traders often move in and out of positions more often than investors, using shorter time horizons for their plays.Instead of wishing for bullishness over bearishness, or vice versa, traders may care more about whether they are correct in their bullish or bearish assessment, profiting on trades as long as they are accurate in determining which direction a given asset goes, depending on the trading strategies used. Some traders’ strategies, talents or tendencies may favor one market condition over the other, however.Investors, on the other hand, generally buy into positions and hold them for longer periods of time, profiting on the price rise, so they logically might want bullish markets. An investor may take a long-term short position or sell an asset if they have a bearish view on an asset, although the most anyone can make (in pretty much every instance) is 100% profit if they short at the absolute top and ride the asset to zero. On the other hand, assets can virtually rise in price infinitely, offering possible gains of more than 100%.Dialing into crypto specifically, why might an investor or trader wish for Bitcoin (BTC) or any given altcoin to decline in price, even if they are bullish overall on the crypto industry? One reason could be their position. If a trader is bearish on BTC — expecting upcoming falling prices — they may enter a short trade on BTC and, therefore, logically want its price to decline, as they would profit on the asset’s drop.Traders can even be short-term bearish and long-term bullish, or vice versa. They may, for example, expect Bitcoin to retrace in price over a period of days or weeks, but ultimately rise and return to an upward, multi-month trend.Investors or traders may also hold a bearish short-term view and bullish long-term view, wishing for lower prices in the near term to buy certain assets at relatively cheaper prices. Conversely, a market participant may have a short-term bullish view with a long-term bearish outlook. They may think prices will go up due to hype or other factors, so they may buy or go long in the short term, while ultimately expecting to sell their positions eventually because they believe the market to be a bubble or something of that nature.It is important to note that in markets, defining short-term and long-term can be subjective.Each person’s bullish or bearish view is likely based on a wide range of components, such as charts, news and general knowledge. A market participant may think Bitcoin or an altcoin is bearish for a period based on certain chart conditions or patterns.They may also view assets bearishly on a longer-term basis after negative announcements, such as a specific government regulatory action. One might hold a bullish view for a period based on an upcoming event, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s Bitcoin futures trading launch in 2017.People may also hold an overall bearish or bullish view on an asset as a whole. MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor sees Bitcoin as a new way to store value. Gold advocate Peter Schiff, on the other hand, sees Bitcoin as a bubble.Thus, many factors play into different parts of bullishness and bearishness. Timeframes, perspectives, opinions and events can all impact a person’s outlook on an asset or asset class. Ultimately, each individual must come to their own conclusion regarding what they think."
54,"Optimism continues to percolate in the cryptocurrency sector on as recent gains in Bitcoin (BTC) have helped push the valuation of the top-ranked cryptocurrency past that of the South Korean won.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that the price of Bitcoin experienced a wave of selling in the early hours that pushed the price to a low of $54,948 before bulls returned to briefly push the price back above $57,000.Regardless of Bitcoin price action, institutional investors have consistently expressed their interest in BTC. Today, MicroStrategy announced that it had purchased another 262 BTC at an average price of $57,146, bringing the firm's total holdings to 91,326 BTC.According to David Lifchitz, Chief Investment Officer at ExoAlpha, how the price performs over the next few days will “show if Bitcoin is ready to reach new highs or if a pullback is on its way.”Lifchitz pointed out that the price of BTC was down slightly on Friday after stalling “just a few basis points from its all-time high,” likely due to profit-taking “by those who monetized the 10% gain from $45,000 to $57,000.”Bullish indicators for Bitcoin identified by Lifchitz include interest from institutional dip-buyers around the $45,000 level and the recently passed stimulus package from President Biden that according to him “may go straight into crypto buying.”Lifchitz did concede that despite Bitcoin being price being in a long-term uptrend, there were some reasons for a more bearish outlook for the short term. A few factors to consider are the upcoming U.S. tax season which could prompt some investors to sell some of their holdings as a way to raise cash to pay taxes on profits realized during the 2020 financial year. Another short-term bearish factor Lifchitz identified was the possible spillover effect that could result from the sale of traditional assets which “are stretched by any measure and may see some profit-taking short term.”Overall, Lifchitz concluded:Non-fungible tokens remain the dominant hot topic in the cryptocurrency space following th March 11 record-setting completion of the Beeple NFT auction for more than $69.3 million.Chiliz (CHZ) is the breakout star of the day as $5.55 billion in 24-hour trading volume has lifted the blockchain-based fan engagement platform by 82% to a new all-time high at $0.59.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for CHZ on March 10, prior to the recent price rise.The VORTECS™ score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.As seen in the cart above, the VORTECS™ score increased from a low of 49 on March 8 to a high of 84 on March 10, roughly 24 hours before the price its 175% rally to a new all-time high over the next two days.Decentralized finance projects have been in a consolidation phase as of late following substantial gains in the first two months of 2021 as top DEXs and DeFi platforms explore options like cross-linked chains and layer 2 solutions as a reprieve from high transaction costs on the Ethereum (ETH) network.Polygon (MATIC) and SKALE (SKL) are two Ethereum scaling solutions that have outperformed their altcoin peers this week after both tokens saw near 100% rallies after listing on Coinbase on March 9. As a whole, the cryptocurrency market has fallen under some pressure as the weekend commences. The pullback is most likely the result of Bitcoin price rejected near its all-time high rather than a sign of a trend change but nevertheless, the majority of the large-cap cryptocurrencies have dropped by 2% to 10%.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.71 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 62%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

55,"Bitcoin (BTC) missed hitting a new all-time high on March 11 by just a whisker as Oracle Corporation denied rumors that it had purchased about 72,000 Bitcoin. This suggests that traders could be looking for signs of greater institutional adoption to boost Bitcoin’s price further. One of the main factors that may have kept several institutional investors at bay is the lack of regulatory clarity but this could be on the verge of changing. In a recent interview on the Thinking Crypto podcast, Hester Peirce, a commissioner at the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, said that Gary Gensler’s nomination to be the President of the SEC could lead to greater regulatory clarity being given to the crypto sector.If that happens, several institutional investors may jump in and purchase Bitcoin. Another possible instrument that may attract both institutions and retail investors is a Bitcoin ETF. Just this week, New York-based asset manager WisdomTree joined the list of aspirants who are seeking the SEC’s approval to launch a Bitcoin ETF.Crypto traders are likely to keep a close watch on these developments as they could prove bullish for Bitcoin. Until the next trigger, will Bitcoin and altcoins remain in a range or correct to lower support levels? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin turned down from just below the all-time high today as the bears tried to pull the price down. However, the long tail on the daily candlestick shows aggressive buying on dips. The upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($51,414) and the relative strength index (RSI) above 68 suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.If the bulls can drive and sustain the price above $58,341.03, the uptrend could resume. The next target objective on the upside is $72,112.Contrary to this assumption, if the BTC/USD pair once again turns down from $58,341.03, it will suggest the bears are aggressively defending the higher levels.If the bears can sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the short-term traders may book profits and that could pull the price down to the 50-day simple moving average ($44,934).A break below this support could result in a drop to the critical support at $41,959.63. This is an important level to watch out for because if it cracks, the advantage will shift in favor of the bears.The bears are attempting to stall the relief rally at the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,879.915. The long tail on March 11 candlestick suggests the bulls bought the dips near the 20-day EMA ($1,692), but they could not build up on the recovery as Ether (ETH) has turned down today.If the price rebounds off the moving averages, it will suggest that traders continue to buy the dips. The bulls will then again try to push the price above $1,879.91 and retest the all-time high at $2,040.77. A breakout and close above this level could clear the path for a rally to $2,614.The marginally upsloping moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a minor advantage to the buyers. However, if the bears sink the price below the moving averages, it may attract profit-booking from short-term traders. That could result in a fall to $1,455 and then to $1,289.Binance Coin (BNB) rallied above the $309.49 overhead resistance on March 11 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick. The bears tried to sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($239) today but the long tail on the candlestick suggests aggressive buying at lower levels.Traders are buying the dips and selling the rallies. This could keep the BNB/USD pair range-bound between $265 and $309.49 for a few days. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive zone, which suggests the bulls have the upper hand.If buyers can push and sustain the price above $309.49, the pair could rally to the all-time high at $348.69. Above this level, the pair may extend its up-move to $410 and then $500.Conversely, if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair may drop to $215 and then $189.Cardano (ADA) has dropped to the support of the $1.0683 to $1.2303 range. This is an important level to keep an eye on, hence the bulls are likely to defend it aggressively. If the price rebounds off this level, the altcoin may consolidate in the range for a few more days.A break above or below the range could start the next trending move. The flat 20-day EMA ($1.09) and the RSI near the midpoint suggest equal opportunities to the bulls and the bears.If the price rises from the current levels and breaks above $1.2303, it will suggest the bulls have the upper hand. That could result in a rally to $1.35 and then $1.4852.On the other hand, if the bears sink and sustain the price below $1.0683, the ADA/USD pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.831).Polkadot’s (DOT) breakout of the symmetrical triangle fizzled out at $39.60 on March 10. The bears dragged the price back into the triangle today, but the long tail on the day’s candlestick suggests the bulls are buying on dips to the 20-day EMA ($34.40).If the price turns up from the current level and rises above $39.60, it will suggest strong demand at lower levels. The pair could then retest the all-time high at $42.28. A break above this resistance may push the price to the pattern target at $52.50.On the contrary, if the price sustains inside the triangle, the bears will try to sink the DOT/USD pair below the support line. Such a move could intensify the selling and pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($27.65).XRP turned down from the $0.50 overhead resistance and broke below the 20-day EMA ($0.464) on March 10. This suggests a lack of demand at higher levels. However, the bulls are presently trying to defend the 50-day SMA ($0.445).If they manage to push the price above the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USD pair may rise to $0.50. A break above this resistance could attract buying that may drive the price to $0.57 and then $0.65.Alternatively, if the bears sustain the price below the 50-day SMA, the pair could drop to $0.392 and then to $0.359. The 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating a possible range-bound action in the short term.The long tail on March 11 and today’s candlestick suggests the bulls are buying the dips. Traders may now try to propel Uniswap (UNI) above the $33 to $34.92 overhead resistance zone.If they succeed, the UNI/USD pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $46 and then $50. The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory indicate the bulls are in command.However, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($27.90), short-term traders may book profits. That may drag the pair down to the 50-day SMA ($22.13).Litecoin’s (LTC) tight consolidation between the $205.18 overhead resistance and the 20-day EMA ($192) resolved to the upside today. This suggests the demand from the bulls has exceeded the will of bearish traders.The bulls will now try to push the price to $246.96. The 20-day EMA has started to turn up and the RSI has risen above 62, which suggests the bulls have the upper hand.On the contrary, if the LTC/USD pair fails to sustain above $246.96, it will indicate the bears are selling at higher levels.That may trap the aggressive bulls, who may cover their positions if the pair breaks below the 20-day EMA. The bears may gain the upper hand if the pair plummets below the uptrend line.Chainlink (LINK) dipped below the 20-day EMA ($28.99) today, but the bulls are defending the 50-day SMA ($27.53). A strong bounce off this level will suggest the bulls continue to buy the dip. The buyers will then try to propel the price above the $32 overhead resistance.If they succeed, the LINK/USD pair will complete a bullish ascending triangle pattern that may attract buying from traders. The pattern target of this setup is $43.19, but the rise may face stiff resistance at the current all-time high at $36.93.This bullish view will be invalidated if the price drops and sustains below the moving averages. The pair could then decline to $24 and then to $20.11. The flat moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a few days of range-bound action.The failure of the bulls to push Bitcoin Cash (BCH) above the $560 overhead resistance attracted profit-booking by short-term traders. However, the long tail on the daily candlestick suggests the bulls are continuing to buy the dips.The flat moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint show a balance between supply and demand.This equilibrium may shift in favor of the bulls if they can drive the BCH/USD pair above $560. Such a move will suggest that the bulls have absorbed the supply. That could start the next leg of the up-move to $631.71 and then $745.Conversely, if the pair sustains below the moving averages, it will suggest the bears have overpowered the dip buyers. Such a move could result in a drop to $472.72 and then $432.02.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

56,"RushOrderTees, a t-shirt printing and embroidering company, intends to buy $1 million worth of crypto with its cash reserves, according to a recent announcement. “The company has so far purchased $300k in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies over the past month and will ramp to $1 million in crypto holdings by the end of April,” a March 12 public statement said. The move from RushOrderTees is another sign of adoption and a normalization of digital asset investing.RushOrderTees is a custom shirt and apparel manufacturer based in Philadelphia, PA. They accept orders that range from single unit purchases to large-scale apparel runs. The business even touts a partnership with the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers, according to the company's website.Although Bitcoin (BTC) has had its ups and downs over the years, the asset’s price has soared in recent months, breaking its 2017 record price high near $20,000 in December 2020. BTC has continued blazing an upward trail since then, recently flying past $57,000.“Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technology offer an exciting glimpse into the future,” Mike Nemeroff, RushOrderTees’ CEO, said in the statement. “This is our opportunity to be on the cutting edge of something that has the power to change global commerce forever.”A number of other companies have also converted some of their company's assets to Bitcoin, with more expected to follow. MicroStrategy has put over $2 billion of capital toward the currency, and Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of BTC in 2021. Square and MassMutual have also bought Bitcoin in recent months.Nemeroff is no stranger to the crypto space, as the CEO himself has reportedly bought crypto over the years, the statement included."
57,"It is no secret that March 12, 2020, marked one of the darkest days in crypto history. This was the day when Bitcoin (BTC) witnessed one of the largest single-day price dips in its decade-long existence, swooping from $8,000 to a staggering low of $3,600, albeit briefly, just for a matter of minutes. To put things into perspective, within a span of just 24 hours, over $1 billion worth of BTC longs were liquidated, causing one of the most intense value drops witnessed by the digital market in its brief history. Another way to look at the crash is that during the above-stated time frame, BTC lost nearly 50% of its value, a statistic that is quite striking, to say the least.Also worth noting is the fact that over the course of the same week, Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies exhibited an extremely high correlation with the United States stock market, which at the time was seen as a possibility due to the overall drop in investor appetite for high-risk assets, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic was just beginning to rear its ugly head.The steep correction in the U.S. stock market — which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average dip by 2,300 points — was its worst decline in over 30 years. This correction, coupled with a lack in demand for BTC, resulted in the cryptocurrency’s price first dropping first to around the $5,000 mark and then to around $3,600.To explore the possibility of whether the crypto sector may be on the receiving end of another massive dip sometime this month, Cointelegraph reached out to CryptoYoda, an independent analyst and cryptocurrency expert. In his view, the triangular combination of finite supply, ever-growing demand and highly leveraged trading is a recipe for flash crashes and turbulent volatility, adding:Hunter Merghart, head of U.S. operations for cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp, pointed out that even though the structure of the crypto market has evolved dramatically since last March, the possibility of another crash cannot be ruled out entirely. That being said, he stated that the crypto industry is now full of regulated spot trading avenues, derivatives platforms that ensure a high level of liquidity.Furthermore, Merghart believes that when compared to previous years, there are now many more active participants within the global crypto landscape who can help ease out any imbalances if volatility were to suddenly increase overnight for some unforeseen reasons.Anshul Dhir, co-founder and chief operating officer for EasyFi Network — a layer-two DeFi lending protocol for digital assets — pointed out to Cointelegraph that currently, an immense amount of capital has been locked in decentralized finance, and the overall market cap of the crypto industry is more than $1.5 trillion. However, of this figure, Dhir pointed out that the majority of positions are over-leveraged even to the tune of 50x.While some fears of a possible crypto crash do exist, by and large, the sentiment surrounding the crypto space seems to be much calmer this time around. For example, Chad Steinglass, head of trading for U.S.-based crypto trading platform CrossTower, believes that even though the one-year anniversary of the much dreaded “bottom” is coming up, there is nothing to worry about in regard to such a scenario repeating itself again:He further opined that the Federal Reserve’s response to COVID-19 was the confirmation of the original thesis behind Bitcoin, and it kicked off the bull run that has been ongoing for the last 11 months. Steinglass said that the Fed has shown no signs of tightening its monetary policy, and even Congress, despite partisan gridlock, has shown that it will continue to inject stimulus into the economy until the recession brought on by the coronavirus is fully in the rear-view mirror.Furthermore, with the steady flow of institutional adoption — with a new major traditional asset player announcing its support for digital assets seemingly every other week — it appears as though there will be no serious correction for any reason other than some surprise prohibitive regulations coming from the Treasury or the Securities and Exchange Commission, which, at this point, seems highly unlikely.The only caveat that Steinglass has in relation to his otherwise bullish stance is the possibility of some profit-taking from the U.S.-based investors who may have bought BTC at the bottom and have been waiting to sell until the calendar rolls over for tax purposes. “However, I expect that the volume of BTC that these sellers will look to unload is relatively small in the grand scheme of things,” he added.Daniele Bernardi, founder of PHI Token and Diaman Group, believes that last year’s Bitcoin price drop and the collapse of financial markets all over the world were totally related to the onset of the pandemic. In this regard, he told Cointelegraph that it’s unlikely that such an event will happen again:Though the events of March 12 are etched in everyone’s memory at this point, most technical indicators seem to suggest that the possibility of such a scenario playing out once again seems improbable.In this vein, it is also worth mentioning that many of the coronavirus fears that were running rampant this time last year — and appear to be the primary drivers of the crash — have now largely died out, especially with vaccinations starting to be rolled out on a global scale.If there is one thing that the crypto market has taught its participants over the years, then anything is possible when it comes to this niche. Therefore, any prediction of future price action is nothing more than a very well-educated guess and that any unforeseen global event may reshuffle Bitcoin’s deck to form a completely different narrative."
58,"Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trade volume, is reportedly under investigation by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission regarding possible trades made by U.S.-based customers.Binance Holdings Ltd is being investigated by the watchdog concerning possible derivatives trades made by American customers, Bloomberg reported on Friday, after being tipped off by an anonymous source.The exchange has not yet been accused of any wrongdoing, however, regulators are now reportedly seeking to determine whether cryptocurrency derivatives were bought and sold by U.S citizens on the Binance platform.A Binance spokesperson told Cointelegraph, “We do not comment, as a matter of policy, on communications with any regulators. What we can say is that we take a collaborative approach in working with regulators around the world and we take our compliance obligations very seriously.”Cryptocurrency derivatives trading shot to new heights throughout the beginning of 2021, with Binance itself acting as the venue for $59 billion’s worth by the time of publication — more than twice the sum of its nearest competitor, Huobi Global.Recently, Singapore-based crypto derivatives exchange Bybit was forced to close down its operations in the United Kingdom in the wake of the Financial Conduct Authority’s ban on retail derivatives trading.Binance reportedly blocks users from U.S. IP addresses from entering the site, however a controversial Forbes article from October 2020 claimed that founder and CEO, Changpeng Zhao, regularly encouraged users to employ a VPN."
59,"Binance has released its payments app, Binance Pay, in public alpha. The app is a contactless peer-to-peer cryptocurrency payment feature that lets users send and receive payments in cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC).Binance initially rolled out Binance Pay in a soft launch in February 2020 for P2P payments, enabling 250,000 users to interact with the product. Today, Binance Pay is launching in alpha with new features like merchant-based transactions and is available to all users.A spokesperson for Binance told Cointelegraph that the new service is not limited to certain jurisdictions and is “currently available to all eligible users on Binance.com.” In order to get started with Binance Pay, users need to sign up on Binance and complete their identity verification.“Users need to go to the Pay function on their Binance app to initiate the Pay account to start using the service. Once activated, users can fund their Pay wallet by moving funds from the spot wallet,” the representative explained.Binance Pay supports more than 30 cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and supports five fiat currencies including the euro, British pound, Australian dollar, Brazilian real, and Turkish lira. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao claimed that the zero-fee structure could help address the shortcoming of fiat-based payments networks:Major legacy payments firms have increasingly been recognizing the potential of cryptocurrencies. In February, Mastercard, one of the world’s largest payment companies in traditional finance, announced its plans to enable its almost one billion users to spend cryptocurrencies in 2021. Its biggest rival, Visa, officially reaffirmed its commitment to crypto payments and fiat onramps in January.Digital payments giant PayPal also announced in early February that the company is looking to offer crypto payments across its platform after debuting crypto trading in the United States in November 2020."
60,"Bitcoin (BTC) miners are selling less and less BTC, but if one metric is correct, they could soon start causing a major price correction.In an update on March 11, Philip Swift, creator of on-chain data resource LookIntoBitcoin, flagged familiar warning signs from the Puell Multiple.Developed by David Puell, the Puell Multiple tracks when miners are likely to start selling en masse in order to realize profits from participating in the Bitcoin network.It divides the value of “new” BTC issued per day by one-year moving average issuance, both in U.S. dollars, to give an insight into where selling would be most profitable for miners.A look at the multiple’s historical performance shows that highs — when its value enters an upper red zone on the chart — coincide with Bitcoin price peaks and subsequent sell-offs.For Swift, with the multiple now closer to the red zone than at any time since late 2017, the danger is clear.“The Puell Multiple, which looks at miner rev today vs. historical norms is approaching the overbought red band,” he summarized in comments on the historical chart:In 2021, the chart is pitted against a new phenomenon which was only just beginning in late 2017 — institutional investment in Bitcoin. This year has been characterized by largescale buy-ins from institutions, and as Swift notes, the question is now whether miners can still force the market downwards despite their appetite for HODLing.Fellow analyst Cole Garner responded with data from on-chain analytics service Glassnode, this also showing Bitcoin price corrections following larger outflows from mining pool Poolin this year.“This chart would argue that they did a pretty good job of dumping price OR they're smart money, and knew exactly when to sell,” he commented.Nevertheless, overall desire to sell among miners remains negligible compared to previous years.In its latest weekly report, crypto index fund tracker Stack Funds highlighted the fact that, when taken as a seven-day average, outflows from mining pools are at their lowest since 2016.That year saw outflows break below a long-term support level, which in turn preceded the bull run to $20,000 over the next two years.“This occurred twice during the past year alone, in May 2020, and at the end of January this year,” Stack wrote.“The double break provides further affirmation that miner’s outflows will probably continue to remain low, which could be a catalyst for prices to float higher.”With expectations of a further upside still in place, researchers also considered the potential floor should suppression nonetheless return. As Cointelegraph reported, this is likely $46,000 at worst, with that level forming Bitcoin’s strongest support since it crossed $11,000 last year.“Overall, most fundamental indicators suggest that miners are back into accumulating, and we expect $50,000 to be a strong support handle for Bitcoin in the near term,” the report concluded."
61,"New York-based asset manager WisdomTree has filed for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or ETF, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.The firm submitted its filing on March 11. It states the WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust would trade on Chicago Board Options Exchange’s BZX platform under the ticker BTCW. The trust would offer a regulated way for investors to gain exposure to the price of Bitcoin, and allow speculators to execute trades through their brokers.Contracts would be settled according to CF Benchmarks’s “CF Bitcoin US Settlement Price,” a price index that tracks the price based on major BTC spot exchanges.The proposed ETF is not WisdomTree’s first foray into crypto, with the firm currently managing a leading institutional ETH fund.In June 2020, WisdomTree filed for an ETF that would invest up to 5% of capital into BTC futures contracts, despite the fund being primarily focused on energy, agriculture, and metals. In December 2019, the firm launched a physically-backed Bitcoin exchange-traded product that was listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange.WisdomTree is not alone in seeking SEC approval for a Bitcoin ETF. Last month, crypto-focused financial services firm NYDIG filed for a Bitcoin ETF, with top U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley among the proposed fund’s authorized participantsLeading exchange-traded product-issuer VanEck filed for its own BTC fund in January, in addition to an ETF tracking the performance of leading crypto firms. Texas-based Valkyrie Digital Assets also filed for a Bitcoin ETF that same month.However, VanEck’s bid for ETF approval may be impacted by an ongoing lawsuit from its former partner, blockchain tech firm SolidX — with the company accusing VanEck of plagiarizing a product the two firms worked on together during 2018 and 2019."
62,"With BTC again edging toward all-time highs, a large volume of money is flowing into the Bitcoin derivatives markets.According to crypto market data aggregator Glassnode, outstanding futures contracts pushed into new all-time highs on March 11, with open interest across exchanges approaching $20 billion.More capital is flowing into the derivatives markets, as the amount of outstanding #Bitcoin futures contracts reaches another ATH.

Open interest across major exchanges is currently sitting at the verge of the $20B mark.

Chart: https://t.co/ygoffzMSJW pic.twitter.com/BiJIpyTKDDOptions have also surged to see record volumes in 2021, with Derebit now regularly hosting more than $1 billion worth of daily trade.According to Binance-owned CoinMarketCap, the three-largest centralized derivatives exchanges — Binance, Huobi Global, and ByBit — represent more than $100 billion in combined daily trade. Binance alone is $57 billion. The next ten highest-ranked exchanges facilitated more than $65 billion in trade over the past 24 hours.However, despite the surging volumes, some decentralized derivatives exchanges appear to be struggling to attract the momentum of their centralized counterparts.Skyrocketing Ethereum fees appear to have slowed the growth of decentralized options, with the complicated smart contract executions required to interact with some Ethereum-based protocols resulting in gas prices of more than $1,000.Similarly record fees also appear to have deterred traders from Ethereum-powered decentralized futures, with daily volume on dYdX plummeting from tens of billions in January to roughly $100 million over the past week.Recent liquidity issues on the popular on-chain options trading protocol Hegic are also impacting Etherum’s decentralized option markets.On March 11, Ribbon Finance founder Julian Koh announced the protocol’s “Strangle” product had been temporarily disabled due to there being “no liquidity in the Hegic pools.” Koh also noted disruptions to Ribbon’s price feed resulting from ongoing upgrades to DeFi options protocol Opyn.On Discord, Ribbon’s founder noted the team is currently working on integrating with fellow DeFi options protocol, Charm Finance, “as a new liquidity source to solve the liquidity issue.”"
63,"Bitcoin (BTC) may be having problems cracking all-time highs but one of its best-known analysts believes its sideways trading is ""nearly complete.""In a series of tweets on March 11, Willy Woo pointed to multiple on-chain factors suggesting that fresh BTC price upside is imminent.Bitcoin saw a return to form on Thursday after a dip to $54,400 abruptly reversed, sending BTC/USD to highs of $57,200.With buyer support in evidence, the pair is nonetheless still to break out of its current wide trading range, bordered by record support at $46,000 and the current all-time highs of $58,300.For Woo, however, weak hands evaporating and stronger ones stepping in formed the backbone of a bullish take which calls for the end of this consolidatory price phase.""Strong hands came in to buy this latest dip,"" he said, alongside a chart showing BTC flowing to wallets ""with very little history of selling.""Data tracking changes in the liquid supply of Bitcoin showed more and more leaving the market during March.On the topic of support, Woo pointed to data from on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode showing that even at $55,000, Bitcoin was a popular purchase among investors.""A nice confirmation of the validity of these price levels,"" he added.The buoyant perspective counters the remaining naysayers from within cryptocurrency and the mainstream media, who continue to claim that the Bitcoin is anything but a sensible investment opportunity.Among them was gold bug Peter Schiff this week, who balked at news that his son, Spencer, had reportedly gone 100% Bitcoin.""He sold the last of his #silver stocks to raise the cash,"" he tweeted on Wednesday.With institutional engagement still in full swing, however, Bitcoin proponents delivered repeat warnings about the consequences of ignoring the largest cryptocurrency as an asset class altogether.""Anybody in the world can get bitcoin.

64,"What highs (or lows) could Bitcoin reach by the end of the year? Watch Cointelegraph’s latest video to find out!The moderatesThe Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model created by PlanB is one of the most well-known price prediction apparatuses in the Bitcoin space. It forecasts the long-term price trend of Bitcoin by weighing two main factors: the amount of BTC in existence (the stock) versus the amount of newly mined coins entering the market (the flow).Thus far, the model has been eerily accurate. Bitcoin closed February 26% above the model’s projected price and remains on pace to hit the model’s end-of-year target of $288K. With Bitcoin currently trading at around $56K, it would need to increase over 400% between now and December.Anthony Pompliano of Morgan Creek Digital and Dan Morehead of Pantera Capital haven’t set their sights on $200K for 2021, but that doesn’t mean they are bearish. They both believe Bitcoin will close the year above $100K, which would be double the current price.In a recent interview with Cointelegraph, Pomp noted:The naysayersWherever there are bulls, there are also bears. Peter Schiff is one of the most outspoken Bitcoin critics in the crypto space. He believes Bitcoin is a pumped-up bubble that will eventually lead most investors to financial ruin. According to him, it’s only a matter of time before it all comes crashing down to zero.In an interview, Schiff said:Eyes on the prizeWho would have thought the day would come when $100K, or even $200K, Bitcoin price predictions are considered moderate? Well, today may finally be that day. Unconfirmed reports say Citibank have set their sights set on even higher price targets for 2021. And that's just in the short term. As Bitcoin's price rises, so do the long-term forecasts. Frank Holmes of US Global Investors and Scott Minerd of Guggenheim Investments both believe half a million dollars is within reach in the coming years.But there's one price prediction that trumps them all. Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor foresees Bitcoin sucking up 'monetary energy', which would propel it to an unthinkable price:Watch the video above for our analysis of Bitcoin's short-term and long-term price targets.

65,"Bitcoin trades in countless locations across the globe, including on numerous exchanges. The asset, however, largely trades near the same U.S. dollar value across the market, aside from some countries’ outlying price action from time to time. How is this possible? Numerous trading products exist in the crypto space, including Bitcoin (BTC) futures and options, but how is the price of actual transactable BTC, called spot BTC, determined in the crypto market, especially given the vast number of exchanges?“The price of BTC at any moment is really no more than a function of the price people are ready to buy or sell BTC at that time,” Justin d’Anethan, sales manager at Equos — a digital asset exchange under Diginex Group — told Cointelegraph. “That is why it will vary — very slightly — from one exchange to the other,” he explained, adding:Arbitrage is one aspect of the market that helps keep Bitcoin’s price similar across exchanges. If BTC trades at $50,000 per coin on one exchange and $60,000 on another, people would likely buy BTC for $50,000, send it to the other exchange, sell it for $60,000, and keep the profit of $10,000 per coin. A number of factors play into arbitrage, however, such as transaction timing, exchange restrictions and bots.Filbfilb, a crypto analyst and trader, also sees arbitrage as a significant component in determining Bitcoin’s spot price on the market. “Generally speaking, arbitrage bots play a major role in eliminating pricing differences brought about by isolated volume,” he told Cointelegraph. “They effectively reward people who correct market price discrepancies, with profit,” he added. Filbfilb explained:Arbitrage opportunities have also existed between Bitcoin futures and spot trading, according to a strategy once mentioned by Bitcoin stock-to-flow model creator PlanB. The tactic essentially involves shorting BTC futures while purchasing spot Bitcoin.Certain Bitcoin futures, such as those tradable on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, sometimes trade above the asset’s price near the beginning of their contract periods, depending on the expiration, finding their way closer to the spot price of BTC by the time expiration comes around. This system depends on a number of factors, however, such as the length of the chosen Bitcoin futures contract.“Buy orders and sell orders from participants across the globe determine the real-time price of Bitcoin,” Rob Levy, co-founder of Hxro — a crypto trading platform — told Cointelegraph. “The markets are all connected — from the spot markets to the derivatives markets (futures, options, swaps),” he said, adding:Levy noted fast arbitrage as the force maintaining comparable BTC pricing on various crypto trading platforms.Additionally, the CME’s BTC futures trading impacts the market price for spot Bitcoin, according to a report by Wilshire Phoenix, an investment firm. “The findings of Wilshire Phoenix [...] indicate that CME Bitcoin Futures contribute more to price discovery than its related spot markets,” the report said.The CME opened cash-settled Bitcoin futures trading in 2017. In tandem with its BTC futures, the Chicago trading entity uses the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate — a value for Bitcoin, taking into account data from exchanges on the BTC spot market.Overall, although certain factors can play a part in standardizing Bitcoin’s price across exchanges, the asset derives its overall worth based on a number of rationales, including its role as a store of value."
66,"The Kessler Collection, an American luxury hotel brand, has begun accepting Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies as a payment option.According to a press release issued on Tuesday, the hotel chain has partnered with crypto payment gateway service BitPay to begin accepting Bitcoin.Other cryptos adopted include Ether (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE) as well as four stablecoins — USD Coin (USDC), Paxos Standard (PAX), Binance USD (BUSD), and Gemini dollar (GUSD).The Kessler Collection now becomes the latest luxury brand to partner with BitPay to enable crypto payments for their products and services.For Fravy Collazo, the company’s chief financial officer, adopting crypto payments will also help to reduce the forex burden on international guests. Commenting on the move, the firm's CEO Richard Kessler stated:Indeed, from airlines to travel agencies, several facets of the tourism and hospital industries have been quick to adopt cryptocurrency payments.The onset of the coronavirus and its impact on global travel has also likely accelerated the pivot towards virtual currency payment channels amid the emerging digitization of the industry and the prioritization of contactless protocols.In its February 2020 report, crypto travel agency Travala revealed that 68% of all bookings for the month were with virtual currencies as the company recorded its largest monthly revenue figures.Apart from utilizing crypto payments, airlines and other stakeholders are also exploring blockchain in fighting the spread of COVID-19.Back in February, Air France announced that it would be testing a blockchain-based system to verify COVID-19 test results for passengers."
67,"Hester Peirce of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission is well-known as a regulator who has shown consistent support for digital assets, so much so that her moniker ""crypto mom"" has become unshakeable.In a new interview with the Thinking Crypto podcast, Peirce reflected on the United States' regulatory approach to the asset class to date, arguing that, “I think we have missed the boat a bit on crypto. And I think a big piece of that comes from the failure to provide clarity in our rules.” She said that contrary to the persistent narrative that crypto is somehow indissociable from illegality and a desire to outwit the system, her own experience has been that industry participants want to comply with the rules, but have often struggled to do so without adequate guidance:The Senate Banking Committee has now voted 14-10 in favor of Gensler's nomination being sent to the Senate floor, after two Republicans joined ranks with 12 Democrats to support the choice. Peirce underscored Gensler's recent experience teaching courses on blockchain at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, noting that he's been “surrounded by people who are enthusiastic about this technology.” In her view, Gensler understands the positive potential of the industry, as well as the need for more clarity in order to facilitate its development. Not having to convince him of these things will be “very helpful,” she said.Peirce did note, however, that while the chairman does “set the agenda for the agency” and, in the case of Gensler, can be expected to support a better rulemaking approach to crypto, a considerable degree of day-to-day continuity at the SEC in its interaction with the crypto industry will be assured regardless of who's chairman:On this note of cautious optimism, Peirce also commented with good humor on her affectionate nickname in the U.S. crypto space, saying, “You know, I've always loved the idea of being a mom, and I'm not a mom in the real world. So being a mom in the virtual world is not a bad thing at all.” However, she quickly pushed back gently against any unwanted implications, commenting:Peirce stressed that she's “not an advocate for any particular asset class,” but rather “I'm an advocate for people having the ability to invest in the asset classes that they deem valuable for whatever their end objectives are.” Having first learned about Bitcoin (BTC) when she was at George Mason, she said she is a “big believer in the power of decentralization"" and that cryptocurrency ""fit really nicely into that.”"
68,"With the price of gold down more than 11% over the last six months, some investment managers are questioning its status as a hedge asset.According to Bloomberg, Russ Koesterich, portfolio manager at BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund, gold is currently failing to prove its effectiveness as a viable hedge against inflation.Indeed, Koesterich countered the popular hedge asset narrative for gold, stating, “Gold’s ability to hedge against inflation has been somewhat exaggerated. While it is a reasonable store of value over the very long-term — think centuries — it is less reliable across most investment horizons.”The current investment horizon appears to be one dominated by the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic and the various responses by governments by way of economic stimulus packages.Inflation fears are currently palpable amid massive stimulus spending to trigger economic recovery.Since setting a new all-time high of $2,100 per ounce back in the summer of 2020, gold has been on the decline and is currently trading above $1,700 as of the time of writing.Gold’s price decline has also seen significant outflows from gold ETFs with some market analysts stating that investors are pivoting to Bitcoin (BTC). In November 2020, Chinese banks began suspending the creation of new precious metal trading accounts due to rising price volatility for the likes of gold.In contrast to gold’s spot price performance, Bitcoin is up almost 90% year-to-date as the largest crypto by market capitalization continues on its positive price run since October 2020. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, senior Bloomberg strategist Mike McGlone has said BTC is ""pushing aside"" gold as a store of value asset.Koesterich’s warnings about holding gold as a hedge in the current investment horizon come on the heels of somewhat positive comments by BlackRock about Bitcoin.The world’s largest asset management company previously identified Bitcoin derivatives as a possible investment foray in filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission at the start of the year.Back in November 2020, Rick Rieder, chief investment officer at BlackRock Financial Management stated that Bitcoin could displace gold to a large extent."
69,"Spencer Schiff, the son of gold bug and major Bitcoin (BTC) critic Peter Schiff, seems to have decided to move all his portfolio investments into one single asset, Bitcoin.“My son went all in on Bitcoin on the last drop below $50k. 100% of his portfolio is now in Bitcoin,” gold bug Schiff announced Wednesday on Twitter. The famous Bitcoin skeptic specified that his son sold the last of his silver stocks for cash.Schiff went on to express concerns over the investment choices of the younger generation, stating, “If my own son is this brainwashed imagine how vulnerable most kids are. He's HODLing to infinity or bust.” The crypto community has widely welcomed the announcement, with many people expressing confidence that the 100% Bitcoin investment will make Schiff’s son richer than him. “At least someone in your family is growing their wealth this year,” Morgan Creek Digital’s co-founder Anthony Pompliano subsequently wrote.In response, Schiff said, “I need to disinherit him. Otherwise he will squander my hard earned wealth on more Bitcoin.” Schiff also emphasized that his own portfolio is not limited to gold, and the “vast majority” of it comprises equities.Despite Schiff’s criticism of his son’s decision to go 100% Bitcoin, Schiff himself apparently played a big role in this decision. Apart from regularly tweeting about Bitcoin, Schiff was the one who initiated the idea of Bitcoin birthday gifts for his son on Twitter in 2020. Schiff subsequently insisted that his son was investing in Bitcoin “against his advice.”A vocal Bitcoin critic, Schiff claimed in 2019 that Bitcoin would have never hit $50,000. Following Bitcoin’s rally up to $57,000 in February 2021, Schiff admitted that a move up to $100,000 “can’t be ruled out either.”"
70,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell $2,000 overnight on March 11 after United States-based multinational Oracle dispelled rumors that it had bought 72,000 BTC.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView showed BTC/USD returning to $55,000 on Thursday after hitting local highs of around $57,00.The previous day had delivered strong performance across cryptocurrency, with bulls eagerly awaiting a retest of Bitcoin's all-time highs at $58,300.While the momentum did much to overcome a final band of resistance in place just below that level, it did not last, as an alleged adoption announcement from Oracle failed to materialize.Starting in February, claims began to surface that the firm planned to buy a huge amount of Bitcoin in a move that would rival top institutional investors Grayscale and MicroStrategy. Confirmation should have come on Wednesday, social media users added, but an earnings call failed to confirm their suspicions.In the event, co-founder Larry Ellison did not disclose any Bitcoin-related activity, while signalling that he was bullish on the trading environment for the coming year“I’m not really ready to disclose our plans as to why I think it’s going to suddenly spike but we expect very, very rapid database growth next year,” he said, quoted by CNBC.At the time of writing, BTC/USD was continuing to retrace, losing around 2% in an hour and heading towards $54,000.Reacting, commentators remained unfazed by the anticlimax.""For those caught in the day to day pricing of Bitcoin, it is a long journey,"" entrepreneur Jeff Booth responded:Taking a longer-term view, one analyst this week described the slowdown in Bitcoin's bull run at around a $1 trillion market cap as a ""back-and-fill process.""In a tweet, Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, argued that once consolidation is over, Bitcoin would rise again — and its next target would be Amazon's market cap.""Tesla in Rear View, About $80,000 Bitcoin Eyes Amazon Market Cap — Once Bitcoin's back-and-fill process around the $1 trillion market cap is complete, we see internet pioneer Amazon.com as a potential next threshold...,"" he wrote on Tuesday.McGlone uploaded a comparative chart highlighting Bitcoin's low volatility poised to repeat performance from 2017, the year in which BTC/USD grew from $1,000 to just under $20,000."
71,"Long-term Bitcoin hodlers appear not to be selling despite 2021’s all-time highs, while nervous newbies have been taking profits along the way.According to Unchained Capital’s “Hodlwaves” chart — which visually illustrates the time since BTC wallets were last active on-chain, 2021 has seen an increase in both long and short-term activity.The chart shows the number of coins that have moved in the past 30 to 90 days is at its highest level since 2018. These addresses represent more than 15% and are currently the largest segment of BTC wallets.Bitcoin wallets that have remained inactive for between three and five years are currently the second-largest segment, representing 13.5% of all addresses. These wallets have also steadily expanded in number during 2021, with onlookers speculating the data may reflect a large number of BTC bag-holders who bought during the 2017 season and held throughout the entire bear trend.While the share of wallets that have not been active in between five and 10 years appears to have been shrinking over the past year, the number of addresses that have been inactive for at least a decade has increased from roughly 1.7% two years ago to 10.7% today.On March 11, CTO and co-founder of on-chain crypto analytics firm Glassnode, Rafael Schultze-Kraft shared data revealing the number of wallets that have not been active in the last three or more years has steadily increased since late December.1+ year hodlers: selling

72,"New research from U.K. think tank Parliament Street revealed that 25% of British investors estimate they would have made £1 million or more ($1.39 million) in profit by investing all their wealth in Bitcoin at the start of 2020.The survey “The Great Cryptocurrency Report” polled 2,000 British investors about their confidence in crypto and general investment plans for 2021.The poll found that 29% of respondents had been encouraged to invest by the outsize returns generated in the latest bull run in which Bitcoin prices have hit $56,000, or £40,000.But on the other side of the ledger, the research found that 31% will not invest in cryptocurrency because they believe they have already “missed the boat”.Investors revealed their price predictions in the survey, with 31% predicting that they expect the price of Bitcoin to hit £50,000, or $69,000, this year, a 23% increase from current prices. While a smaller number hold a more bullish view, with 18% agreeing that they expect Bitcoin to hit more than £100,000 in 2021.That still pales in comparison to Kraken CEO Jesse Powell's recent prediction Bitcoin will reach $1 million within the next decade. Powell told Bloomberg that if Bitcoin were able to replace all of the world's currency:While the attitudes of some UK investors are changing towards cryptocurrency, more than half of respondents still have no interest in entering the market anytime soon. The poll revealed that 55% of respondents have no plans to invest in crypto at all this year. In addition, 52% expressed that they are more likely to invest in the stock market and traditional assets such as gold.These results are backed up by another UK-based poll published in February, which surveyed 6,070 British residents above 18 and found that 57% have no desire to invest in cryptocurrency."
73,"Investor Ivan Malpica listed a share in a property at 5828 Wise Avenue in St. Louis on NFT marketplace Mintable last night for roughly 42.43 ETH — worth nearly $76,000 at the time of writing.The listing promises ""NFT fractional ownership (50%) of this fully gutted rehabbed home,"" noting the home had been appraised for $138,000 last year and currently generates $1200 in monthly rental income. The listing concludes:Speaking to Cointelegraph, Malpica said the use of an NFT enabled the property to be purchased with cryptocurrency, but it would be legally backed up with the formation of a Limited Liability Company between the purchaser and him showing 50/50 ownership.""The NFT doesn't actually state you own the property legally, but it will once we write up the operating agreement that is recorded,"" said Malpica, who works as an Enterprize Risk Management Lead at Verizon,.""Selling as NFT and half will allow for the easy LLC transaction. Some banks/title companies probably wouldn't accept a full pay out in cryptocurrencies. At this time you can't just buy a real rental properties with 100% crypto. This way, selling half as a partnership, it allows for that,"" he said.Given that the legal rights and ownership conferred by NFTs are something of a grey area —not to mention to fact Malpica only came up with the idea yesterday — Cointelegraph strongly recommends anyone interested do due diligence and consult a lawyer before investing in real estate through non-fungible tokens.Malica described himself as a long-term property investor who has entered into 50/50 partnership agreements on 30 previous rentals. He said he'd developed an interest in NFTs after hearing Gary Vaynerchuk, CEO of Vaynermedia, discussing them.At the time of writing, the auction has attracted fewer than 100 views and no bids. Malpica stated that if this sale was a success he'd expand the concept.""I believe if this is a success - I can do fractal shares/NFT to allow multiple owners of an asset to own REAL income producing rentals,"" he said.The founder of MyEtherWallet, Kosala Hemachandra, recently told Cointelegraph that NFTs will gradually evolve to cover ownership of real estate. Commercial outfits  are currently offering tokenized real estate, such as RealT."
74,"A Twitter account named “$1200 Stimulus Is Now Worth” has been tracking how much the first US $1200 stimulus would be worth if you invested in Bitcoin when the funds were sent out from April 15, 2020.The passing of the first $1200 stimulus bill in April last year corresponded with a huge bull run in the cryptocurrency and stock markets.Bitcoin was sitting at $6,848 on April 15, and if you had invested the $1200 stimulus then it would now be worth $10,211 at today's prices of roughly $56,000. The return on investment is 751%You’d have over $10,000 if you bought #bitcoin with your stimulus check.

Check https://t.co/jckMs158A2 for live updates. pic.twitter.com/TXp2HnOpEcAnd if you’d somehow missed out on investing the first stimulus check into Bitcoin, the second stimulus of $600 rolled out in late December would still have given you a decent return. If you had purchased Bitcoin on Jan. 1 at roughly $29,000, that $600 investment would have now grown to be worth around $1,160 — a 93% return.A third stimulus is on the way after the U.S senate approved the rollout of a $1.9 trillion relief package on March 6, which will see $1,400 paid out to eligible Americans.To see the same returns from the third stimulus, you’d need to see a gigantic increase in Bitcoin’s price. If you were looking to repeat a 751% return, Bitcoin’s price would need to reach $476,000. A 93% return on this stimulus would see Bitcoin hit $108,000.In the short term, many institutions believe Bitcoin moving past $100,000 in 2021 is achievable. Earlier this year in January, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou from JPMorgan Chase’s strategy team, claimed that $146,000-plus could be possible for Bitcoin by the end of 2021, as he foresees Bitcoin overtaking gold as a hedge and long term store of value for investors.According to a survey from Grayscale Investments conducted in June-July 2020, COVID-19 has increased investor interest in Bitcoin. The firm surveyed 1000 investors between the ages of 25 and 64 that had personal investments of $10,000 or more.The poll revealed that the pandemic impacted the decisions of 63% of respondents who invested in Bitcoin during the previous four months.The sting in the tale is that if you’d invested the first stimulus check into Ethereum on April 15, you would’ve outperformed your Bitcoin counterparts. Investing $1200 in Ethereum at that time would’ve landed you 7.5 Ether, which is worth roughly $13,500 at today’s prices, a 1025% increase.."
75,"The recent boom in non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, has been accompanied with controversy and concern over the technology’s environmental impact due to the computational power required.Out of all transaction types on a blockchain, NFTs are some of the most intensive of them all as they often involve numerous complicated transactions and executions of smart contracts in the minting, bidding, selling, and transferring process. This is sometimes reflected in transaction costs reaching hundreds of times more than that of a simple transaction.Almost 5k is the price to accept a bid on @rariblecom now!! Is it because of ETH high gas fees⛽️ or some type of bug ?
Thoughts ? pic.twitter.com/tYoV1ilB85In the past, the impact of such concerns was minimal, however, in recent weeks, some artists and platforms are starting to cancel NFT plans as a result. Digital artist Joanie Lemercier canceled his second Nifty Gateway drop after becoming aware of the environmental impact of the platform’s sales:Art portfolio platform ArtStation canceled its NFT drop of prominent artists hours after announcing it due to excessive backlash on the environmental impact of NFTs.However concrete figures behind NFTs’ real carbon footprint remain elusive.In December, 2020, computational artists and engineer Memo Akten developed the CryptoArt.wft platform which calculates the energy usage and CO2 emissions of any NFT on SuperRare, Nifty Gateway, or any individual transaction on Ethereum.According to the website, the above NFT on SuperRare has consumed 421 kWh, the equivalent energy to an EU resident’s electricity consumption for 1.5 months. On the site, Akten provided a link to his in-depth analysis behind his calculations, adding that the average NFT has a footprint of approximately 340 kWh.Offsetra, a project helping to offset cryptocurrencies’ carbon footprints, uses the same methodology as Akten but admitted the calculations have “clear gaps.” These figures, alarming as they are, only apply to Proof-of-Work blockchains (which include Ethereum and Bitcoin) and apply various assumptions..“For the time being we have included a 20% buffer in our calculations to include both unknown mining pools, and inefficiencies in the network that may lead to energy losses (e.g. such as via waste heat at the point-of-use),” Offsetra added. This 20% buffer was removed on March 8.However there is light on the horizon with the emergence of Proof-of-Stake blockchains, such as Eth2. These are viable alternatives for NFT minting and use just a fraction of the computational power required to securely transact on them, Akten stated.Nifty Gateway responded to artist Lemercier’s concerns stating that Layer2 scaling on Ethereum can be deployed in weeks and in doing so, “We can reduce the impact, today, by 99%.”SuperRare wrote an article responding to some of the environmental issues, stating that calculating transaction costs for NFTs was an incorrect approach as the overall costs of the blockchain remained the same regardless of transaction numbers.SuperRare explained that they, along with many in the Ethereum community, are aware of inefficiencies of PoW blochains and promised to donate money to aid in ETH2 research while exploring alternative scaling options.In a counterintuitive approach, Delphi Digital co-founder and head of research Medio Demarco wrote a recent post arguing that cryptocurrency mining could, in fact, help save the planet. He states that the network incentivizes cheap energy which now means clean energy.Part of his reasoning revolves around miners using otherwise unused clean electricity, allowing clean energy farms to monetize 100% of their production rather than only a fraction of it. This in turn could be enough to fund new clean energy infrastructure. He argued:"
76,"Israel's Altshuler Shaham Investment House has doubled its money after tipping $100 million into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust late last year. It's the only Israeli institution kn to have invested this magnitude of funds into Bitcoin so far.The news follows increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin internationally, with reports on March 7 that Chinese tech company Meitu had become the first Hong Kong-listed company to invest $40 million into cryptocurrencies, split between Ethereum and Bitcoin.Israel's Globes publication reported that Altshuler Shaham acquired the GBTC shares in late 2020 when Bitcoin was trading around $21,000. Co-CEO, founder and co-owner Gilad Altshuler told the publication:He added, ""This is a new investment for us. It took a few months until we got all the relevant approvals and all the opinions that approved our investment in the field.""The Globes report stated the investment house currently holds around $150 million worth of the cryptocurrency — with Altshuler noting it may add more :Altshuler Shaham is one of the largest investment houses in Israel, managing around $51.5 billion in long term savings for retirement and pension funds as of the end of January. It's not the first time Altshuler Shaham has dabbled in cryptocurrency, with the firm reportedly taking positions in local initial coin offerings back in 2017.It's subsidiary Altshuler Shaham Horizon is more actively involved in crypto investments and last week appointed Ilan Stark, who previously managed the trading and capital markets division of Israeli blockchain company Orbs, as its new CEO.The $100 million was invested in BTC via the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust — which currently has around $31.4 billion in assets under management. Recently shares have been trading at a 15% discount to the underlying value of the Bitcoin held.As of March 7, private placement offerings for GBTC shares were halted, however this is an occurrence that happens periodically."
77,"Long-term investors use dips in a strong uptrend to buy while short-term investors are fixated on calling a top. In the past few days, data from Glassnode has shown significantly sized Bitcoin (BTC) outflows from Coinbase exchange, which is a sign of accumulation according to analysts.It is encouraging to note that the demand is not limited to one exchange and data from Material Indicators shows buy orders of $100,000 and higher are reaching an all-time high.This shows that the influx of institutional investors and large corporations entering the crypto sector continues to accelerate. Proof of this comes as American Residential Warranty became the latest company to buy Bitcoin in order to maximize the returns on its investment portfolio.Another positive sign is the relative movement of the U.S. dollar and Bitcoin. Usually, these assets are inversely correlated, meaning when the U.S. dollar rises, Bitcoin comes under pressure and vice versa.However, in the past few days, the rise in the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) has not been able to stall Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. When a negative event fails to put brakes on the rally, it is a sign of strong demand.Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the possible target objectives and the critical levels on the upside.Bitcoin broke above the $52,040.95 overhead resistance on March 8, which completed an ascending triangle pattern. This bullish setup has a target objective at $61,075.13. The bears attempted to stall the up-move today, but the long tail on the candlestick shows strong buying on dips.The 20-day exponential moving average ($50,140) has turned up and the relative strength index (RSI) has risen close to the overbought territory, indicating that bulls are in control.If the bulls can drive the price above the all-time high at $58,341.03, the next leg of the uptrend could begin. The next major target on the upside is $72,112. Another possibility is that the price may rise above the all-time high, but the bears will try to trap the aggressive bulls and attempt to pull the price below $52,040.95.In order to reverse the trend, the bears will have to sink the price below the most recent swing low at $43,006.77.The bulls are attempting to resume the uptrend in Ether (ETH) and the 20-day EMA ($1,673) has started to turn up as the RSI moves above 60.If the bulls can sustain the price above $1,879.915, the ETH/USD pair could retest the all-time high at $2,040.774. A breakout of this resistance could resume the uptrend with the next target objective at $2,614.This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and breaks below the moving averages. Such a move could keep the pair stuck inside a large range. The trend could favor the bears if the price breaks below the $1,289 support.Binance Coin (BNB) soared above the $265 overhead resistance on March 9, which suggests the bulls are attempting to resume the uptrend. The long tail on today’s candlestick shows the bulls are buying on dips.The buyers will now try to push the price above $309.49. If they succeed, the BNB/USD pair could rally to the all-time high at $348.69. A breakout of this resistance could start the next leg of the up-move to $410 and then $500.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory also suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. This bullish view could invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($231). Such a move may result in a decline to the critical support at $189.Cardano (ADA) has been trading in a tight range between $1.0683 and $1.2303 for the past few days. A positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip and sustain below the 20-day EMA ($1.102).If the bulls can propel the price above $1.2303, the ADA/USD pair could start its journey to $1.35 and then to $1.48. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that bulls are in control.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the range, it could signal a deeper correction. There is a minor support at $0.90 but if it cracks, the pair may drop to the 50-day simple moving average at $0.801.Polkadot's DOT token rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($34.07) on March 8 and broke above the downtrend line of the symmetrical triangle on March 9. The altcoin could now rally to $42.2848 and then to the pattern target at $52.50.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 66 also suggest that the bulls have the upper hand. This bullish view will be negated if the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance at $42.2848 and breaks below the support line of the triangle.Such a move could trap the aggressive bulls and result in the liquidation of long positions. If the price sustains below the triangle, the DOT/USD pair could extend its decline to the 50-day SMA ($26.90).XRP has once again turned down from the $0.50 overhead resistance. This shows that the bears continue to sell on relief rallies to this level. If the bears sink the price below the trendline, it will negate the ascending triangle pattern.A break below the 50-day SMA ($0.43) will clear the path for a possible drop to $0.359. If the price rebounds off this support, it could keep the XRP/USD pair range-bound for a few more days.Conversely, a break below $0.359 will complete a bearish head and shoulders pattern, which could result in a decline to $0.17351.This bearish view will invalidate if the price turns up from the current levels and rises above $0.50. Such a move could open the doors for a rally to $0.57 and then $0.65.Uniswap (UNI) has dropped below the breakout level of $33 and the bears will now try to pull the price down to the 20-day EMA ($27.33). The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will once again try to resume the uptrend. The UNI/USD pair could pick up momentum on a break above $35. The target objective on the upside is $46.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest a possible change in trend. The next support on the downside is the 50-day SMA at $21.25 and below it $18.Litecoin (LTC) broke above the 20-day EMA ($189) on March 7 and has reached the $205.18 overhead resistance. This level may act as a hurdle, but if the bulls can push the price above it, a rally to $227 and then to $246.96 may be on the cards.The 20-day EMA has started to turn up and the RSI has risen into the positive territory, indicating an advantage to the bulls.However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. If the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages, the LTC/USD pair could drop to the uptrend line. A breakdown and close below this support could intensify the selling.Chainlink (LINK) soared above the 20-day EMA ($28.99) on March 8 and reached the overhead resistance at $32. However, the bulls could not push the price above it, indicating selling by the bears near the resistance.The price has turned down from $32 and the bears are now trying to sink the LINK/USD pair below the trendline. If they manage to do that, the bullish ascending triangle pattern will be invalidated.When a bullish setup breaks down, it usually traps the aggressive buyers who are then forced to cover their positions. The support level to watch on the downside is $24 and then $20.11.Conversely, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will try to push the pair above $32. If they succeed, the pair may start its rally to $36.93 and then to $43.19. The gradually rising moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a minor advantage to the bulls.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has formed an ascending triangle pattern that will complete on a breakout and close above $560. If that happens, the altcoin could start its journey to $631.71 and then to the pattern target at $688.On the contrary, if the price turns down from $560, the bears will try to sink it below the moving averages and the trendline. If they succeed, the BCH/USD pair could drop to $472.72 and then $432.02.Both moving averages are flat and the RSI has been hovering around the midpoint, which does not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

78,"After hitting a $43,000 local low on Feb. 28, Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied 28% to retake the $57,000 level on Mar. 10. As the Feb. 21 to Feb. 23 massive $5.9 billion liquidations caused by excessive long leverage seem long gone, futures contracts reached a $20.3 billion all-time high.This time, as Bitcoin rallied to $57,000, there seems to be no signs of retail FOMO (fear of missing out) buying, at least from the perspective of futures and volume indicators.While the funding rate stabilized at a neutral level, spot volumes stagnated, signaling that the recent growth in the open interest on futures is healthy.As shown above, the aggregate futures open interest on BTC has risen to a new all-time high at $20.3 billion. This event is usually perceived as bullish, even though longs and shorts are matched at all times. However, a yellow flag should be raised whenever an increase of this metric is followed by a high funding rate on perpetual futures.Perpetual futures are the preferred instrument for retail leverage traders due to their liquidity and hassle-free expiry date management.To keep a balanced risk-exposure, derivatives exchanges charge either perpetual futures longs (buyers) or shorts (sellers) a fee every eight hours. Known as the funding rate, this indicator will turn positive when longs are the ones demanding more leverage.Longs with insufficient margin are usually liquidated as their positions are forcefully terminated, so excessive leverage is the primary catalyst for substantial price corrections.As depicted above, the 8-hour fee reached 0.20% in late-February, equivalent to 19.7% per month. This rate is quite costly for those long on perpetual futures, but the effect vanished as the Bitcoin price crashed below $48,000 on Feb. 22.On the other hand, the current 0.05% funding rate per 8 hours is standard and expected in healthy markets. This indicator equates to a 4.6% monthly fee and shouldn't be problematic to leveraged longs.Had retail FOMO kicked in as Bitcoin approached its $58,300 all-time-high, spot exchange volumes would have been positively impacted.As shown above, the most recent $8 billion 5-day volume average is pretty much flat compared to the past couple of weeks. Thus, there is no evidence of retail investors desperately buying spot BTC or perpetual futures contracts.This data suggests room for further price appreciation from Bitcoin as institutional clients continue to heavily stack BTC regardless of its 70% gain year-to-date.Although multiple analysts may suggest that this activity would trigger fast buying from retail investors, there's no definitive proof of this at the moment.Digital Currency Group’s decision to buy $250 million of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust shares will likely bring some relief, and the same can be said for the upcoming launch of JPMorgan's crypto exposure basket.These developments could be interpreted by retail as a 'stamp of approval' from one of the world's largest banks.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

79,"Within the last hour, Bitcoin (BTC) price surged to $57,100, a level not seen since Feb. 20 when BTC price made a new all-time high at $58,352. The bullish breakout signals that investor sentiment has shifted back in favor of bulls and it increases the likelihood that BTC will attempt a run at the $60,000 level.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that Bitcoin bounced off a low of $52,998 in the early morning hours and proceeded to rally 6.5% above the $57,000 level.Today's upside move was preceded by news that Digital Currency Group intends to buy up to $250 million shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The purchase comes at an interesting time, considering that on March 8 GBTC shares traded at a 15% discount to Bitcoin's spot price on major exchanges.While institutional investors may be able to take credit for the current move, overall interest in Bitcoin is also continuing to grow. Recent data shows that 10,000 Bitcoin ATMs have been installed in the U.S. since March 1, 2020, marking a 57.5% in the number of BTC-equipped ATMs over the past year.In the past two weeks, equities markets have been weighed down by a downturn in technology stocks and concerns over the rising Treasury yield. Many analysts predicted that a strengthening dollar and rising Treasury yield would negatively impact Bitcoin price.According to Chad Steinglass, Head of Trading at CrossTower, the “underlying current in BTC is still incredibly good,” as it seems like there are major traditional finance players getting involved with BTC on a daily basis.Steinglass said that the recent addition of Ether (ETH) to the balance sheet of the Chinese software firm Meitu is another positive development as it demonstrates the growing prominence of cryptocurrencies in traditional finance.Steinglass further explained that the BTC correction of the past two weeks was the result of a “massive sell-off in tech equities” which hit GBTC hard as the “discount to NAV that GBTC traded got as high as 15%” on March 5 as European traders “ran in fear” at the close of the Europe equity markets.Steinglass said:As Bitcoin takes aim at the $60,000 level, several altcoins also chased after new all-time highs.Theta (THETA), a blockchain-based video streaming platform, rallied 18% over the past 24-hours to reach a new all-time high of $5.92.Meanwhile, Polygon (MATIC) received a 33% boost on March 9 when Coinbase announced that the token would be added to Coinbase Pro.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.74 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 61.1%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

80,"Bitcoin has finally bounced back, cleanly breaking the $50,000 barrier to trade at around $57,000 at the time of publishing. This signal comes as much-needed relief for bulls after the entire crypto market slumped for two weeks following the flash crash on Feb. 22, now known as “Bloody Monday.”The market slump seemed to persist despite the rising demand and confidence in the cryptocurrency markets both from retail and institutional investors. A blog post published by Robinhood, a trading platform often used by Gen Z and millennials, titled “Crypto Goes Mainstream” mentioned that the platform saw over 6 million new crypto users in the first two months of 2021 alone. Considering that monthly sign-ups in 2021 are 15 times the 2020 average, this is highly indicative of the shift in perception of retail investors toward cryptocurrencies.The dip in the market led Bitcoin (BTC) to hit a low of $43,700 on Feb. 28, which is 25% below the all-time high of $58,352 it hit on Feb. 21. Considering that these milestones are only seven days apart, the volatility in price seems extraordinarily high, especially to all the new crypto investors who rode the wave during the bull runs earlier in 2021 and in late 2020.Seasoned investors are often aware of — and wary of — the fact that such price corrections happen in the financial markets, even in the stock market. An instance of this was recently witnessed in the case of Tesla’s stock, which went through a major price correction of 11.4%.Such price corrections are often natural for financial assets that have long bull runs and value multiplications within a few months, as seen in the case of Bitcoin. Institutional investors, which are often staunch believers of their long positions due to the value proposition that their investment could offer in the future, wait for such price corrections to sweep up more Bitcoin. However, due to the bureaucratic nature of large organizations, there are often several obstacles they have to overcome for them to eventually invest.Jay Hao, CEO of crypto exchange OKEx, told Cointelegraph that price pullbacks are to be expected given the early stage of the bull run. Most public institutions will need to justify their purchase of Bitcoin to investors in addition to board members, thus the appropriate due diligence and justification for the allocation percentage in their portfolios will be in order.Because bringing crypto onto a balance sheet could be a time-taking process full of obstacles, Hao thinks that some institutions may be discouraged: “Many more still consider that with its market cap below $1 trillion, it’s not yet a large enough asset class to invest in, others are put off by its volatility.”In support of this theory, there are institutional investments coming in from firms led by influential business leaders such as Jack Dorsey and Michael Saylor. Square was the first large institution to buy the dip, adding 3,318 Bitcoin to its holdings on Feb. 23, worth around $170 million at the time. Considering that more than 80% of Square’s revenue in the third quarter of 2020 came from Bitcoin, this move seems like a no-brainer.MicroStrategy CEO Saylor also announced on Feb. 24 that the firm had purchased another 19,452 Bitcoin, worth around $1 billion at the time. The next week, on March 1, he revealed that the firm had bought another small lot of 328 Bitcoin, worth $15 million at the time. According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, MicroStrategy now owns a total of 91,064 BTC, worth nearly $4.6 billion. This is, in fact, 74% of the company’s market capitalization. Hao further opined that such an allocation might not be as easy for other institutions:Considering that the most notable Bitcoin price correction happened on March 12, 2020 — also known as “Black Thursday” — this most recent price dip may reflect the cyclical nature of the asset. Shane Ai, who is responsible for product research and development of crypto derivatives at Bybit — a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange — told Cointelegraph: “Historical price seasonality doesn’t favor Bitcoin in March. Knowing this, traders would exercise more caution getting long.”This price seasonality is evident in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as well. According to the index, the value “0” indicates extreme fear and “100” indicates extreme greed. Historically, the index falls to lower levels in March compared with the year’s pre-March levels.Amid the market dip, North America’s first two Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, were launched in Canada. Even though the market was in a slump, both of these ETFs have proved to be popular. The first ETF to launch was from Purpose Investments on Feb. 18. In a short timespan, Purpose’s ETF has already amassed $836 million in assets under management, representing 12,158 BTC.Soon after the first launch, Evolve Fund Group’s Bitcoin ETF was also launched in Canada after getting the necessary approval. The ETF currently has nearly $65 million worth of Bitcoin in its fund. In fact, to rival Purpose’s quick growth, Evolve started a price war with Purpose by lowering the management fee on its Bitcoin ETF to 0.75% from 1%. Currently, the Evolve ETF’s assets under management are less than 10% of those of the Purpose ETF.ETFs are a basket of assets — in this case, Bitcoin — that are traded on an exchange, just like stocks. ETFs are often the channel that institutions use to get exposure to certain assets due to the higher liquidity and tighter spreads they provide. Bitcoin ETFs doing well despite the market dip is yet another indication of the fact that institutions consider the latest dip to be a healthy correction and an opportunity to buy some more Bitcoin at a lower price.The crypto bull run during the first quarter of 2020 and running into the first two months of 2021 brought a lot of new investors into the cryptocurrency markets. However, some of the investors have been lured into the asset class due to the extraordinarily high returns that it gives when compared with traditional investments like equities, commodities and bonds. But these investors are not used to the volatility in the cryptocurrency market.Due to this, there were large sell-offs in the BTC market when the price hit $44,000, as evident in Coinbase’s outflow data. Hao elaborated on this phenomenon: “Many new investors are rattled by the volatility and we often see this type of panic selling when a swift price correction comes in.” He added further: “We will continue to see weak hands being shaken out of the space as the price stutters and corrects on its way up.”Another possibility is that new investors could be selling some of their Bitcoin at a profit to invest in altcoins instead. The marketwide sell-off reared its face even in the Bitcoin derivatives markets, as was evident in Bitcoin futures daily volumes and the associated open interest, or OI. During the dip, Bitcoin futures OI dropped more than 20% from its peak just before the dip.The OI of the futures market measures the flow of money coming into the market. A 20% drop in OI speaks to the negative sentiment that has crept into the market due to the price dip. At the same time, it’s also important to note that the market rose up to its all-time high market capitalization much faster than was expected by the community. Thus, in hindsight, a pullback was to be expected with a healthy correction.Whether the dip was caused by weak hands selling or it was just a healthy price correction as the markets cooled off after hitting their peak earlier in February, it has become clear that institutions aren’t deterred by this volatility. It seems they welcomed the drop in price, as it enabled them to buy the dip and own more Bitcoin bought at a lower price than what is considered to be its true value at the moment."
81,"Grayscale Investments’ Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has been under the heat for the last couple of weeks as it traded below the Bitcoin equivalent for each share. The instrument trades on over-the-counter markets and is by far the largest listed cryptocurrency asset.Periodically, the private-placement offerings for GBTC shares are temporarily closed, along with similar products offered by Grayscale Investment such as its Ethereum trust. As of March 7, both GBTC and the Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) are under such periods.The fact that one of the only investment vehicles containing Bitcoin (BTC) has temporarily closed its issuance, along with the timing of the pause, seems a bit odd, as GBTC reached a record-high 15% discount to the BTC-equivalent for each share on March 5.GBTC shares used to trade above the equivalent BTC held by the trust, an effect caused by the excess retail demand. Meanwhile, institutional clients were able to buy shares directly from Grayscale at par.This demand instability created an arbitrage opportunity where clients could buy at par directly from Grayscale Investments, hold their shares for the six-month lock-up period, then sell them on secondary markets with a premium attached.This strategy yielded excellent results, as the GBTC premium over its BTC equivalent content ranged from 5% to 40%. It is worth noting that excess demand on secondary markets caused this imbalance, as nonaccredited investors are unable to directly access Grayscale's private offers.On Feb. 27, this situation changed abruptly as the GBTC premium turned into a discount. At the time, BlockFi’s cryptocurrency lending wing and the Three Arrows Capital arbitrage desk held over 5% of the outstanding shares, according to disclosures required by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules.This means that if either one of the above liquidates a significant position, their move will be made public. Regardless of who was behind the abrupt selling pressure, it's important to understand what may have caused it.The recent approval of two Bitcoin exchange-traded-funds in Canada is likely one of the most significant contributing factors that impacted the GBTC premium. The Purpose Bitcoin ETF saw an impressive 11,446 BTC ($584 million) come under management in less than two weeks. While this sum seems insignificant next to GBTC's $31.2 billion, the ETF offers a better risk/reward, as reported by Cointelegraph.This is because the Purpose ETF fees are 1% versus the 2% levied by GBTC. Moreover, there is no lock-up period, and retail investors can attain direct access to buy Purpose Bitcoin ETF shares at par. Therefore, the emergence of a better Bitcoin investment vehicle seized much of allure that GBTC once possessed.The 36,000 BTC equivalent of GBTC shares issued in August 2020 finished its six-month lock-up in February.This increase in ""unlocked"" GBTC represents $2 billion at the current $56,800 BTC price and potentially adds pressure to the GBTC shares. This potential impact is relevant even if most of the volume is closing a premium arbitrage trade by purchasing a BTC futures contract while selling the GBTC shares.Even though BTC futures are liquid enough to absorb this volume, GBTC shares could see lower retail demand because of the previously discussed ETF effect — not to mention the negative sentiment that followed after BTC hit the $58,300 top on Feb. 21, and then dropped by 26%.Nevertheless, the 15% GBTC discount seen on March 5 versus its BTC equivalent does not seem sustainable. Even if there is currently no way for a market maker to buy those shares and convert them back to BTC, Grayscale Investments could buy them back and profit from the difference.As things currently stand, GBTC holders are not likely to panic sell during this unusual circumstance. On the other hand, those waiting for a 5% or higher premium to reemerge will likely be disappointed, as the Canadian ETF seems a better product for retail investors.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

82,"Earlier this month, antivirus pioneer John McAfee was officially charged by the United States Department of Justice on seven counts of fraud and money laundering. These charges have been filed with respect to his activities in the crypto space from 2017 to 2020.It could be some time before McAfee actually has to face these charges in court, as he is currently being detained in Spain under a different warrant issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. While extradition from Spain to the United States should be easy, over the past few years the European Union has taken a much dimmer view on sending people back to the United States, given its seemingly “random” application of the law and what many consider to be an archaic penal system.In order to best understand how this impacts projects, those unfamiliar with the U.S. legal system should start by knowing who the players are. The DoJ prosecutes criminal matters, the IRS prosecutes and manages tax affairs, and the SEC is one of five civil regulatory bodies dealing with securities laws. To best understand that, let’s look at each element one at a time.In mid-2017, McAfee took to the social media platform Twitter to speak generally about crypto. He undoubtedly noticed the impact he was having on the crypto market and the amount of attention it brought him. Later in 2017, after a huge number of users flocked to his tweets, he started speaking more specifically about several projects. We will discuss how he picked those projects later.To be fair, during this whole time, his Twitter use was not confined only to crypto activities. In the same period, he did also speak about other things such as his possible planned presidential campaign, wanting to make love to a whale and eating his “junk” if Bitcoin (BTC) didn’t hit a certain price.Fornication aside, it was the crypto-based tweets that have landed McAfee in hot water. Let’s take a look and see how this possibly impacts crypto-project promoters.In applying securities laws, the DoJ views all cryptocurrencies as a type of security. This means, slightly different from the SEC, that there is no separate classification as a utility token. If you promote a crypto, regardless of what the project views it as, the DoJ will look at it as a security, especially if liquidation of the rewards is done through a public company.The biggest aspect of this whole issue is that McAfee decided to liquidate a lot of his crypto holdings through New York Stock Exchange-based companies, again adding to the breach of U.S. regulators’ rules, amounting to a possible criminal action.The DoJ sees McAfee’s activities with his tweets as a type of fraud. To artificially induce (encourage) people into a project in order to inflate the price before selling everything you own is a type of fraud. You are, in its view, robbing people. Make sure that if you are promoting any kind of crypto on Twitter, you disclose any holdings you may have in that crypto itself.The DoJ considers it possible that you can manipulate the crypto market in the same way that you can manipulate the stock exchange. This is huge. The crypto market has always maintained a level of independence from regulators; however, with this action, the DoJ is acting like the crypto market is a fully regulated body. Projects, advisers and experts should be careful when promoting a project. Although, at the moment, we are not sure if this market manipulation is the result of the filtering of funds through a public company on the NYSE. Time will clarify.Back in the days of gangsters, it was almost impossible for the U.S. government to capture the notorious Al Capone. Outside of the alleged countless murders, money laundering and general organized crime, Capone was finally arrested on tax avoidance charges. It’s a playbook the U.S. has deployed for years — if it wants you in jail, it cites tax laws. U.S. tax laws are far reaching for U.S. citizens and residents. Therefore, if you are a U.S. citizen, resident or corporation, make sure your taxes are in order. If you do any business in the U.S., make sure your taxes are in order.The reality is that the laws the DoJ is applying are not a standard set of laws in every country. For example, Russian securities laws are massively different from those found in the United States, meaning what is a crime in the U.S. is not even considered “bad business” in Russia. However, that can change if the coin itself is listed on a U.S.-based crypto exchange or business is done in the United States by the company. If the coin is listed on a U.S.-based crypto exchange, or does business in the U.S., then the DoJ would have jurisdiction over anyone that interacts with the items doing business in the United States.We all know it’s not 2017 or 2018, and the crypto industry has grown up since that first boom. However, Twitter is a U.S.-based company and very much under the control of United States law. Regardless of what any of its subsidiaries may do, its headquarters is in the United States. If you are thinking of doing anything that could be viewed as promotion on Twitter, then avoid it.The biggest problem is that McAfee liquidated a lot of his holdings through NYSE (public) companies. This kicks in a huge amount of securities laws in the United States. There is a lot of attention paid to Coinbase users and its movements on going public soon! This could have a possible impact, as all transactions will become reportable through a public company.In his later days of tweeting (2018 to 2019), McAfee used to charge around $50,000 to “back” a project. That meant tweeting about the project and in some cases allowing the use of his face on the project itself.In the early days, we are not sure. Take for example Electroneum (ETN), the first project that McAfee tweeted about directly, which launched in the United Kingdom in September 2017. Electroneum asserted that McAfee was not paid anything to run his promotion of the project. We also do not know if McAfee actually held or cashed out on any Electroneum.You can see from his tweets at the time that he was not totally sure why some of the claims made by the company were a good thing — however, he was saying them anyway. This is usually indicative of someone who is simply saying what they have been told or copying and pasting from a white paper. Additionally, and not helping the situation, a lot of those claims seemed to be badly researched. The project was claimed to be “the first British crypto” despite being beaten by numerous others including Glocal, a university project that launched some six months earlier in Liverpool, and Ideas Assembly, which developed a blockchain IP platform in Bath some 12 months before the project launched. Yikes. Although, both of these projects were admittedly nowhere near as big as Electroneum, and both subsequently folded into different things.Essentially, we know that later in 2018, McAfee would publish anything he was paid to write — without any research and with very little to no commentary on these projects themselves.If you are a U.S. citizen or resident, then it would be worth not doing anything that could be seen as “promoting” a project without disclosing if you are holding or being paid to do so. If you are outside of the U.S., make sure the project is not listed on a U.S. exchange or planning on doing anything in the United States. If it is, likewise make sure you use the same disclaimers on any tweet you make about crypto.It is worth remembering that at the moment, these are only charges. This does not mean that McAfee or any of the companies he promoted broke the law. There is a big difference between being charged with an alleged crime and being found guilty. This means everyone who promoted a project over the 2017-plus timeline should not panic.Most of us will be watching this action with interest to see where it leads!Nothing in this article is constituted as legal advice. Electroneum commented on the situation and confirmed that it did not pay McAfee any compensation for his promotion of the project.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
83,"Cryptocurrency asset manager Grayscale has a new buyer of shares in its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) — its owner.In a press release on March 10, Grayscale parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG) announced plans to purchase up to $250 million of GBTC shares.The move, which comes amid volatile conditions for GBTC, follows plans to hire specialists in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) sphere, signaling a potential diversification by the company.According to the press release, DCG ""has authorized the purchase by DCG of up to $250 million worth of shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.""""DCG plans to use cash on hand to fund the purchases and will make the purchases on the open market,"" it added.DCG did not specifically state the reasoning behind the buyback.As Cointelegraph reported, GBTC traded at its steepest-ever discount last week, with investors able to get exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) at 13% below market value.The regulatory go-ahead for ETFs to launch in Canada is thought to have contributed to Grayscale's headache, with investors looking for the best value proposition when it comes to embracing the traditionally volatile asset class.The United States has yet to license a single ETF, with anticipation nonetheless building that regulators will sign off on a change to the status quo.""A United States Bitcoin ETF will unleash a wave a of retail buying that will bend minds,"" Nik Bhatia, author of Layered Money: From Gold and Dollars to Bitcoin, commented over the weekend.

84,"Bitcoin (BTC) challenged levels within 10% of all-time highs on March 10 as strength in the U.S. dollar failed to dent the bullish trend.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView tracked a comeback from an overnight correction for BTC/USD on March 10, with the pair targeting $55,000.After hitting two-week highs of $54,500 the previous day, Bitcoin improved on its performance to hit $55,700 before encountering a strong band of resistance and heading lower.The latest resurgence underscores new-found strength in the largest cryptocurrency this month, something that continues to take it to within striking distance of historical all-time highs at $58,300.""Beautiful rejection on the $56,000 area for #Bitcoin here. So far, everything fine,"" Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe commented about the past 24 hours' action on Twitter.At the time of writing, there was little indication that a retest of $52,000 was imminent, as hodlers celebrated yet more institutional investors entering the Bitcoin adoption race. This time, it was American Residential Warranty, which teamed up with exchange Gemini to invest.""And another company has decided to put bitcoin on its balance sheet,"" Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss responded.Orderbook data from Binance, the largest exchange by volume, shows sellers lined up at $56,000 and upward, with strong support available below $49,000.Elsewhere, March has continued to produce an interesting countertrend for Bitcoin traders, with the U.S. dollar flipping to a correlated asset from an inversely correlated one. As Cointelegraph often reports, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) tends to spark downward pressure on Bitcoin when it strengthens rapidly, with the reverse also true. While this was a key feature of the market landscape throughout 2020, this year has seen the phenomenon's strength begin to erode.Over the past two weeks, both the DXY and BTC/USD have gained in tandem."
85,"Since March 1, 2020, the number of new Bitcoin ATMs installed worldwide is nearing 10,000. According to the latest data from Coin ATM Radar, the current number of machines stands at 16,835, a strong 57.5% increase, or 9,683 new machines, as compared with 7,152 last year.Back in Nov. 2020, Cointelegraph had reported a striking year-on-year increase of 80%. As previously, the vast majority of machines continue to be located in the United States, where 81% (13,699 out of 16,835 machines globally) are installed.Within the U.S., growth has been unparalleled, rising by 177% since March 1, 2020, or from 4,945 machines to 13,699 as of March 10, 2021. Canada, the country with the next-highest number of Bitcoin ATMs, clocks in at just 1,268, accounting for roughly 7.5% of machines worldwide. Two of the top countries tracked by Coin ATM Radar, Austria and the United Kingdom, have seen a somewhat jagged trend in terms of Bitcoin ATM installations over the past couple of years: in the former, the number of machines peaked in May 2019, at 266, and has since fallen to 153 as of this week — a decrease of 42.5%.In the U.K., the decline has been less stark, with a high point of 283 in Feb. 2020 as compared with 199 in the latest figures: just under a 30% decrease. Figures for Europe as a whole show a more or less steady, but modest, increase from a total of 1,233 machines back in March 2020 to 1,273 as of now.Coin ATM Radar's ticker tracking crypto ATM installation speed indicated that 34.6 new ATMs are being installed each day. A vast majority of these machines remain buy-only, at 77.6%, with 22.4% offering support for both buy and sell operations.While the U.S., Canada and Europe account for the lion's share of all crypto ATMs worldwide, Hong Kong (85 machines), the Russian Federation (53) and Colombia (46) stand out as the countries with the highest number of ATM locations beyond the North American and European contexts."
86,"South Korean crypto exchanges that don't take extensive data collection and identity verification measures could soon be subject to heavy fines. According to an official announcement Wednesday, South Korea’s Financial Services Commission has come up with a revised proposal for the regulation of virtual assets service providers, or VASPs.The proposal introduces new VASP penalty standards as well as simplifying and integrating existing penalty rules for the industry. As part of the revised proposal, the FSC will be able to fine VASPs for failure to report and record suspicious transactions.Fines will vary depending on the severity and character of violations, from 30% to 60% of the legally approved maximum amount. Penalty relief of 50% or more is available for some small-scale businesses.As part of the proposal, the FSC also wants to require crypto service providers to have a dedicated reporter for large transactions as well as provide written work guidelines and employee training.According to the announcement, the proposal will be open to public feedback from March 11 until April 20, taking effect “immediately after pronouncement.” The proposal comes in conjunction with the Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information, which will be imposed on March 25. As part of the act, VASPs like crypto exchanges must impose extensive Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering checks, including reporting the real names of their customers."

88,"Allocating capital to Bitcoin risks a backlash from environmentally conscious investors, according to author and co-anchor of CNBC's Squawk Box, Andrew Ross Sorkin.In a piece for the International New York Times, syndicated worldwide, Sorkin pointed to statements by Lawrence Fink, CEO of Black Rock — the largest asset managers in the world — indicating his company would make all future investment decisions based on “how they plan to meet the climate challenge.”Tesla’s $TSLA recent bet on bitcoin sullies its green credentials. Mining and transacting the cryptocurrency requires huge amounts of computing power and electricity, much of it from fossil fuels #btc #ev pic.twitter.com/lv0pvossdrSorkin mentioned PayPal, Square and Tesla as examples of BTC-buying companies with strong green initiatives. But such initiatives seem in principle at odds with Bitcoin’s energy inefficient method of making transactions which adds to the carbon in the atmosphere:Sorkin authored a book on the Wall Street banking crisis, Too Big to Fail, in 2009, which was on the New York Times bestseller list for six months and made into a movie in 2011.Tesla received $1.5 billion in environmental subsidies in 2020, funded by U.S. taxpayers. The subsidies are intended to reward and encourage environmentally friendly behavior. #Tesla then spent the same amount buying #Bitcoin, which wastes electricity and harms the environment.Tesla came under fire in Feb. after Ben Dear, the CEO of sustainable products investor Osmosis Investment Management told Reuters that the company should “concentrate on measuring and disclosing to their market their full suite of environmental factors,” in light of its Bitcoin purchase. The statement emphasized the need for greater transparency by Tesla when it comes to environmental accountability:According to the 3rd Global Cryptoasset Benchmarking Study published by the University of Cambridge, up to 39% of all proof of work mining globally is conducted using renewable sources of energy, mostly hydroelectric power. Other estimates put the figure higher.Approximately two-thirds of all Bitcoin mining takes place in China. While a significant portion of this is done using renewable energy, coal remains the country’s biggest source of energy. Mining operations in Inner Mongolia were recently curtailed after failing to meet the standards of a government-mandated energy efficiency review.Regardless of attempts to utilize green energy, Bitcoin currently suffers from an image problem in the form of a “massive carbon footprint,” as described by Forbes in a recent article. In February, a self-professed “green hacker” called for the destruction of Bitcoin on the basis that it is immensely damaging to the environment.As the Bitcoin network consumes as much energy as a mid-sized country on a daily basis, some companies, like Jack Dorsey’s Square, have allocated funds to green Bitcoin mining projects in an effort to further alleviate the cryptocurrency’s reliance on fossil fuels."
89,"Prosecutors in Taiwan have accused Bitmain Technologies of illegally poaching more than 100 Taiwanese engineers.According to a report by Nikkei Asia, a probe has already been launched in New Taipei and Hsinchu — Taiwan’s semiconductor manufacturing hub — to investigate the activities of the Chinese crypto mining chipmaker.The New Taipei Prosecutors Office says as part of the illegal poaching enterprise, the Bitcoin (BTC) mining chip maker allegedly set up shell companies that were used for the illicit recruitment, adding:The move by Taiwanese officials comes as Beijing is reportedly upping the ante on its own chip manufacturing industry. Indeed, semiconductors are reportedly going to be a focus item at the National People’s Congress which begins on Mar. 12.A global chip famine has risen to the forefront of the Sino-American economic tussle with U.S. President Joe Biden recently calling for a robust review of America’s semiconductor supply chain.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, increasing demand for the limited supply of semiconductors has seen Bitcoin miners facing chip shortages. This situation has led to a significant premium on the price of crypto mining hardware both new and second-hand rigs.Meanwhile, the investigation into Bitmain’s alleged illegal poaching of engineers could potentially veer into issues like the leaking of trade secrets and technology theft.The investigation could also impact Bitmain’s relationship with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company — the world’s largest chipmaker.With semiconductor technology now a major focus of the economic tussle between China and the United States and the apparent deepening of diplomatic relationships between Washington and Taipei, the TSMC is reportedly working in tandem with major U.S. tech firms like Apple.Reports indicate that TSMC and the iPhone manufacturer are exploring research and development protocols for the next generation 2 nanometer (2nm) chipsets."
90,"On Jan. 3, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto mined the Bitcoin genesis block and launched the largest technological gold rush of the century. Bitcoin (BTC) was at once a software, a “protocol,” a network, a development team and a new thing called cryptocurrency. Simultaneously, cloud technology proved that abstractions and application programming interfaces could facilitate explosive scalability and product agility, removing all of the distractions that were prevalent in 90% of any application’s technology stack. Despite the onset of dozens of competitors that have appeared since Bitcoin’s inception, almost all have been vertically integrated and none have resulted in the same changes of explosions in products that the cloud has. Networks such as Ethereum and EOS broke that norm by providing a “platform” for several different public blockchain networks to emerge — but what lies beyond even that?To answer this question, we need to identify what a blockchain is at its most atomic level. Bitcoin and its successors, such as Ethereum and EOS, provide several technical features, like peer-to-peer gossip networks, decentralized consensus mechanisms and cryptographically backed “ownership.” These are not necessarily novel technical features, having existed previously in the backends of many products that failed to create the level of value Bitcoin has.Moreover, defining any blockchain by its purely technical features is a misstep that frames the technology as existing only for technologists. For people outside of tech, the most notable feature of Bitcoin, for example, is that it creates and operates Bitcoin, a digital currency that you can own, is scarce, and is provably resistant to duplication and counterfeiting.Cloud on the other hand (and aptly named) is nebulous and abstract in nature. Cloud decomposed the modern application stack into functions (or the things you can do), placed them behind APIs, and offered them as services à la carte. This innovation resulted in a wonderful amount of agility in new product development. Product teams that would have crumbled under the weight of general infrastructure and system administration costs were freed from the burden of understanding what was inside the black boxes on architecture diagrams. This created a powerful idiomatic shift in the industry and eventually resulted in an explosion of customer-driven products and services.Designing applications for the cloud leads developers away from intriguing but ultimately less valuable concerns like micro-optimizing their choice of database parameters or how they administer servers to more important questions critical to their product. Abstracting these technical details and considerations behind a set of functionalized services puts the focus on how your product is unique among its competitors rather than the rote aspects of operating a modern application stack. If this abstraction model has helped companies successfully launch more diversified products, what then are the functionalized services that blockchain applications would need to achieve the same outcome?There are many ways to answer this question, but we will focus on two potential approaches: horizontal functional layers and high-level types.Within horizontal functional layering, a blockchain — like EOS or Ethereum — can be viewed as a computing system capable of executing hundreds or thousands of provably correct smart contracts, a storage system that provides globally consistent data, a strong authentication system, and an ordering service to resolve disputes among operations. For parity with existing blockchains, each of these layers would be independently auditable. In this view, concepts such as block production and consensus protocols do not appear as distinct layers because they offer nothing beyond the implementation details of the other layers. This suggests that, if there was another means of achieving these functionalized services, then blocks or a peer-to-peer network may be unnecessary.The alternative approach would be to look at the higher-level concepts or guarantees and functionalize them as services. For instance, among the many problems a cryptocurrency must solve is the double-spend problem. If one person has 1 Bitcoin and spends it, they cannot spend it again. Conceptually, this sounds basic, but in a decentralized global-scale computer system, it can be hard to maintain such a guarantee efficiently. A service that provides that concept such that it can be easily integrated into any application would abstract away all of the complexity of operating a blockchain and enable the discovery of applications beyond cryptocurrencies more effectively.As another example, many enterprise-blockchain use cases require strict immutability of data. A service that provides that concept would reduce friction in bringing these use cases to market. In fact, this quality has already seen commercial functionalization as a service: It is the core offering of Amazon’s Quantum Ledger Database. And how these services are implemented is and should be irrelevant to the product developers.What was less obvious about the cloud revolution than its ability to accelerate product delivery was its capacity to enable inscrutable architectures and failure modes. When cloud systems work, they work astoundingly well; but when they fail, the general phrase is: You had backups, right? This liability is a non-starter for industries that need strong auditing and end-to-end authenticity. Unbreakable rules are harder to come by in the modern cloud. Although it can be easy to imagine and launch a complex architecture in the cloud, it can be nearly impossible to fully understand the resulting moving pieces.Blockchain, on the other hand, is something alien to the world of cloud computing: It is completely and rigidly in control of itself. This may mean that it will never be able to scale to the heights of modern cloud technology. What if we applied the same insight of the cloud at a higher level? Perhaps 90% of all application logic can be loose and inscrutable if the core and material, comprising 10%, are rigid and easy to reason about. If blockchain were functionalized and offered as a service alongside other traditional functions, would the resulting application stack be one where we were both confident enough in it to give it control over real money and agile enough that visionary product teams could still create products the world has never seen?This article seeks to challenge the industry’s normal definition of blockchain. I have never taken the term literally as a sequence of blocks cryptographically linked into a chain by a specific network of tribal token holders. Instead, I preferred to reason about the novel aspects of what made blockchain something unique against the history of computing protocols and systems.While a literal chain of blocks may be state-of-the-art technology today, it is important to continually remind ourselves that this is just an implementation of larger concepts like end-to-end authenticity or strong ownership of data. Even if we never conceive of protocols that allow for a real abstraction between service provider and service consumer, we should strive to enable a more product-focused industry idiom. We have only begun to realize the potential of blockchain and I, for one, am excited to see that progress continue.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
91,"Bitcoin (BTC) whales and institutions alike have made the most of the recent BTC price ""dip"" by buying big, data suggests.In an update on March 9, on-chain analytics service Material Indicators noted that buy orders of $100,000 and higher on Binance — the biggest cryptocurrency exchange by volume worldwide — are reaching all-time highs.In stark contrast to orders worth less than $100,000, larger buys are more frequent than ever before in Bitcoin's history. Smaller allocations have plummeted in 2021, matching an existing narrative that institutions are scooping up liquidity on exchanges which surfaced during the recent bull run.""The $100k - $1M class is now also about to make a new ATH,"" Material Indicators commented on Twitter alongside a chart.Material Indicators previously voiced concerns about this week's price rise, arguing that whales could ""sell into"" the surge, producing a repeat of the run to $58,000 all-time highs and subsequent 25% correction.While this has so far not come to pass, analysts also noted that macroeconomic factors were also having a different impact to that which was expected.Whale orders declined after news that the United States' $1.9 trillion stimulus package had passed the Senate, while China providing support to tech stocks had the opposite effect. As Cointelegraph reported, tech had led a dramatic change of fortunes on equities markets.Later, meanwhile, another batch of nearly 12,000 BTC left professional trading platform Coinbase Pro as an example of major BTC allocations continuing at current prices.""That happened just before the recent surge in price. Nice coincidence,"" quant analyst Lex Moskovski commented on data from fellow on-chain analytics resource Glassnode.BTC/USD hit two-week highs of $54,500 earlier on Tuesday.Zooming out, the increasing institutional involvement around Bitcoin could fuel its entry as a standard for investors alongside traditional plays.""We do think it will behave, actually, I would say more like the fixed income markets, believe it or not,"" Cathie Wood, founder and CEO of ARK Investment Management, told CNBC this week.Binance orderbooks show the next major BTC/USDT resistances for the bulls are around $58,000 — the all-time high — and $59,500."
92,"Switzerland’s crypto boom has entered another dimension with retailers rolling out Bitcoin (BTC) vouchers and gift cards.According to Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger, Manor — the country’s largest department store chain — is already selling Bitcoin voucher cards in 59 of its branches.Meanwhile, the retail giant Valora will begin selling BTC gift cards in its kiosks across the country starting April 1.Dubbed “Cryptonow,” the Bitcoin vouchers are from the stables of Värdex Suisse, a cryptocurrency financial services firm. Värdex is also a subsidiary of major Swiss crypto exchange Bitcoin Suisse.According to Simon Grylka, head of operations at Värdex, Cryptonow offers a simple onboarding channel for would-be cryptocurrency adopters daunted by the usual avenues for acquiring virtual currency. For Grylka, the Cryptonow voucher is akin to digital gold coins.The Cryptonow voucher cards will be available in three different variants ranging from 100 to 500 francs ($107 to $535). The Värdex Bitcoin gift card product is coming amid continued growth in Switzerland’s crypto and blockchain industry.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the top-50 blockchain firms in the Crypto Valley are up more than 680% in value since mid-2020.With merchant adoption of BTC still growing, Cryptonow owners are limited in how to spend their Bitcoin gift cards.Presently, the options available to them would be to redeem the vouchers via an exchange service or sell the BTC amount loaded on the card using one of the 70 Bitcoin ATMs operated by Värdex.However, with the fixed and marginal fees charged by the retailers for acquiring the cards, Cryptonow in its present iteration seems mostly to be a novelty way of acquiring Bitcoin.While there are several avenues that offer crypto-to-gift card trading, Cryptonow is one of the first products that offer gift cards loaded with cryptocurrency.The use of gift cards to purchase cryptocurrency is popular in the peer-to-peer trading arena especially in jurisdictions with underdeveloped financial services infrastructure."
93,"Prominent Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase could be headed for an IPO valuation of $100 billion, after shares reportedly sold for up to $375 each in a private auction.Shares in Coinbase Global Inc. reportedly traded for a price between $350 and $375 per unit on the Nasdaq private auction market last week, giving the company a pre-IPO valuation of between $90–$100 billion, according to a report by Bloomberg. Trading reportedly ended with the share price at $350.A Coinbase series E funding round in 2018 first saw the stock valued at a potential $8 billion. That valuation increased as shares were then privately traded at a price of $200 on a private forum created by Coinbase in January. The company was deemed to hold a valuation of roughly $50 billion at the time.The price of privately traded shares is partly used to set a reference price for the stock when companies finally go public on the Nasdaq platform. Coinbase announced its intention to launch an initial public offering in mid-2020, before filing registration with the SEC in December.Having launched in 2012, Coinbase represents one of the most long-standing cryptocurrency exchanges in the business. It currently processes the second-most trade volume among centralized exchanges and was recently revealed to store coins with a value equating to 11% of the total crypto market capitalization for its customers.Bloomberg, which claimed to have received the latest share prices from an anonymous source, notes that pre-IPO market activity is not always an accurate representation of how the stock will trade when it goes live. Restrictive trade volumes in private markets don’t accurately convey live open market conditions."
94,"Bitcoin (BTC) tackled pivotal $52,000 resistance overnight on March 9 to come within 6% of historical all-time highs.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and Tradingview showed BTC/USD hitting local highs of $54,500 on Tuesday.The latest attempt to break out of its sideways trading corridor, the move was still consolidating at the time of writing. Amid heavy volatility, a retracement on the day targeted $53,500 — still above crucial resistance.As Cointelegraph reported, analysts were eyeing $52,000 as a line in the sand for securing the next stage of the Bitcoin bull run.While the weekend produced healthy upside, Bitcoin had still to cement even $50,000 as strong support as the week’s trading began.On the back of 24-hour gains topping 8%, however, the picture on Tuesday was fast improving, after evidence showed that $47,000 had become conspicuously strong support.“Bitcoin jumps >$54k aided by more signs of institutional interest in the largest cryptocurrency,” markets commentator and contributor to German news daily Die Welt, Holger Zschaepitz, summarized to Twitter followers.Zschaepitz was referencing findings from Goldman Sachs, which among other things also revealed that 40% of its own clients already have exposure to cryptocurrencies.The institutional picture became even more bullish on Monday after one of Norway’s richest people launched a Bitcoin-focused spin-off firm using BTC as its sole treasury asset.“Bit­coin can be ver­i­fied, di­vid­ed, re-as­sem­bled, stored, and trans­port­ed at vir­tu­al­ly no cost. It’s the per­fect scarce digi­tal as­set. By de­sign,” Kjell Inge Røkke wrote in a widely-circulated shareholder letter.Elsewhere, hodlers were watching a bullish setup unfold in Bitcoin’s daily moving average convergence/ divergence (MACD) indicator, which on Monday was primed to repeat behavior which previously resulted in February’s march to $58,300 record highs.“Destiny awaits,” Cointelegraph Markets analyst filbfilb added in an update to Telegram channel subscribers, highlighting a target area of $70,000 and higher using Fibonacci levels."
95,"The Malaysia-based BCMG Genesis Bitcoin Fund-I, or BGBF-I, has officially launched, claiming to have become the first insured institutional crypto product available in the Southeast Asian region.An announcement states the fund launched in response to a growing demand for institutional crypto products in Southeast Asia. The fund leverages an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered blockchain-based platform provided by Calfin Global Crypto Exchang, which purports to offer increased security for customer holdings.BGBF-I is regulated in Labuan, Malaysia, where IBH Investment Bank serves as the fund’s main advisor. Professional financial services provider, Hong Kong-based Alpha Calibration, will provide regulatory compliance services, and be audited by HLB Hodgson.The investment vehicle also offers insurance coverage and underwriting for Public Offering Security Insurance. Fund Manager, Subbu Vempati explained:According to its official website, the BGBF-I Fund projects a minimum return of 12% per year, while noting that BTC itself has gained 266.5% over the past 12 months.All accredited Asian investors must go through mandatory Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) screenings to access the fund.The Bitcoin fund is one of many that have been recently launched to address growing institutional appetites BTC and other digital assets.

Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust also continues to grow, with its assets under management recently tagging $39.8 billion."
96,"On-chain crypto analytics firm Glassnode has reported significant on-chain support was found for BTC at the roughly $47,000 level, describing the event as the largest on-chain support identified since Bitcoin broke above $11,000 in late 2020.According to a March 8 report from Glassnode, approximately 1.2 million Bitcoin were moved on-chain as BTC’s price traded between $45,500 to $48,900 after bouncing off a local low near $45,000 last week.Glassnode CTO Rafael Schultze-Kraft noted that roughly 6.5% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply moved on-chain as support was established.This support is holding nicely.

And it got stronger! We now have a wall of 1.2M $BTC that moved on-chain between $46.6k and $48.6k.

That's 6.5% (!) of the circulating supply.

I'd be surprised if we go below anytime soon.

I was long at #Bitcoin https://t.co/eXcOhSmzbF pic.twitter.com/Gj3TFHVADWWhile Glassnode suggested the large Bitcoin movements could be indicative of accumulation, the firm acknowledged the spike in on-chain activity could also be attributed to sellers racing to get their coins onto exchanges:However, the report’s authors noted that the number of Bitcoin held on exchanges has continued its recent trend of decline, with 32,500 BTC being withdrawn from centralized platforms this past week.On-chain settlement has also been surging, with Glassnode reporting that more than $10 billion has been settled on the Bitcoin network each day on average this year. The data shows that daily settlement has exceeded $16 billion five times in 2021 so far.Twitter user “jtf.capital” noted Bitcoin’s settlement value is still “barely the equivalent of 0.2% of the daily foreign exchange market volume,” emphasizing there is still “plenty of room for Bitcoin to grow!”"
97,"The cryptocurrency market saw an influx of activity on March 8 that provided a lift to the vast majority of the top tokens as the world celebrates International Women’s Day. Bitcoin’s (BTC) recovery back above $50,000 was followed by a new wave of bullish optimism and analysis from Bloomberg senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone suggested that Bitcoin is pushing gold aside as a store of value in investors' portfolios.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows the price of BTC has increased 4.6% from a low of $49,272 during the early trading hours of March 8 to $53,300 at the time of writing.Recent analysis shows that while professional traders remain hesitant to open new BTC long positions due to a strengthening dollar index and rising Treasury yields, large corporations are buying BTC at an accelerated rate leading to heavy outflows from exchanges. Now that Bitcoin price has secured a daily close above the $52,000 level, its possible that these reluctant traders will open new long positions.On-chain data from glassnode also points to a bullish case for Bitcoin as miners have stopped selling BTC for the most part and now appear to be in accumulation mode. Altcoins also moved significantly higher as many top projects reached new all-time highs on Monday. Non-fungible tokens (NFT) projects like Ultra (UOS), Theta (THETA) and Enjin (ENJ) all managed double-digit gains and reached new yearly highs during today's trading session.UOS price surged 21% to establish a record high of $0.452 as the excitement grows around the project's mainnet launch which will enable cross-chain and NFT capabilities.Theta, a blockchain-based video streaming platform, also reached a new all-time high of $4.98 in front of the long-awaited hard fork on March 10.Theta performed strongly throughout February as the project was bolstered by the introduction of NFTs for streamers and an announced partnership that saw Sony Europe join the Theta blockchain validator program.Enjin (ENJ) also broke out to a new all-time high of $1.76 on March 5 as the project's focus on creating a wide-ranging NFT ecosystem is beginning to pay off.Recent developments for Ethereum (ETH) helped stoke an 8% rally in Ether as the community prepares to roll out the Berlin upgrade on April 14.Chainlink (LINK) is the best performing in the top 10, up 12% to a price of $31, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is up 15.73% and trading at $0.58.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.65 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 60.4%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

98,"Bitcoin (BTC) price might have re-established $50,000 as a support, but the optimism of professional traders is nowhere near the levels seen before the 26% drop to $43,000 on Feb. 28. The current scenario is far from bearish, but derivatives indicators do not reflect the substantial purchases from institutional clients, including Microstrategy, Meitu, and most recently, Aker ASA, a Norweigian oil conglomerate.The longer Bitcoin stays above a certain threshold, the more confident investors get. For example, the last daily close below $45,000 was 28 days ago. Therefore it might take a couple of weeks until a more robust support level is created. For this reason, pro traders might not be comfortable with adding long positions as the U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar are on the rise.Regardless of the reasons behind BTC's current comfort level near $50,000, the price correction that followed the $58,300 all-time high caused massive liquidations, which partially explains the recent lack of bullishness from pro traders.This price drop caused $3.6 billion long future contracts to liquidate from Feb. 21 to Feb. 25, and abrupt moves like these hold a considerable impact on arbitrage trades as whales and market makers are forced to add collateral (margin).Basis is also frequently referred to as the futures premium, and it measures the premium of longer-term futures contracts to the current spot market levels.The fixed-month contracts usually trade at a slight premium, indicating that sellers request more money to withhold settlement longer. On healthy markets, futures should trade at a 10% or more annualized premium, otherwise known as contango.Whenever this indicator fades or turns negative, this is an alarming red flag. This situation is known as backwardation and indicates that the market is turning bearish.The above chart shows that the indicator peaked at 35% on Feb. 17 as Bitcoin surpassed the $50,000 resistance. Nevertheless, it has kept above 16% during the entire correction down to $43,000.Considering the 16% interest rate offered on stablecoin deposits at platforms like Yearn.finance, Aave, and Curve, one can assume that professional traders are neither bullish or bearish on Bitcoin right now.To clarify the status of the trend, investors should look at the Bitcoin options markets. Call options allow the buyer to acquire BTC at a fixed price on contract expiry. On the other hand, put options provide insurance for buyers and protect against BTC price drops.Whenever market makers and professional traders are leaning bullish, they will demand a higher premium on call (buy) options. This trend will cause a negative 25% delta skew indicator.The negative 10% delta skew seen until Feb. 21 signaled a higher premium for upside protection and was considered bullish. On the other hand, the recent negative 5% indicator is deemed neutral as the premium on both call and put options is roughly balanced.Some will say the glass is half full, as the recent BTC price recovery wasn't enough to spark interest from arbitrage desks and professional traders. Still, this skeptical view leaves room for upside surprise when those whales finally give in for the institutional buyers' appetite.Either way, the fact that the derivatives markets held up surprisingly well during the recent 26% drop to test $43,000 is a positive outcome.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
99,"Data from Glassnode shows that Bitcoin (BTC) held on centralized exchanges has dropped by about 20% in the past 12 months. This suggests that investors are withdrawing their Bitcoin to the cold storage with a view of possibly holding them for the long term. This has reduced the available supply while the demand has continued to increase. The arrival of exchange-traded funds could increase the supply crunch further. After the success of the TSX Purpose Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, Canada could launch the second Bitcoin ETF by Galaxy Digital Capital Management, a subsidiary of Galaxy Digital. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs in Canada could place further pressure on U.S. regulators to be more accommodative in their approach of evaluating BTC ETF proposals.Meanwhile, companies across the globe have continued to open their coffers to buy Bitcoin. The latest listed company that plans to buy Bitcoin is the Norwegian investment firm Aker ASA, which intends to do it through a subsidiary company called Seetee AS. This shows that the trend has only started and several companies worldwide could allocate a portion of their reserves to be held in Bitcoin.Goldman Sachs has confirmed the launch of its crypto desk that will support CME Bitcoin futures and non-deliverable forward (NDFs) which are cash-settled. Interestingly, an internal survey by the banking giant shows that 40% of its clients already have a crypto position. The respondents of the survey expect Bitcoin to end 2021 between $40,000 and $100,000.Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot the critical support and resistance levels.Bitcoin is currently trading between the 20-day exponential moving average ($48,701) and the overhead resistance at $52,040. This tight range trading is unlikely to continue for long.Although the 20-day EMA is flat, the relative strength index (RSI) has been gradually rising, indicating that the bulls are attempting to take control.If bulls can push and close the price above $52,040, the BTC/USD pair will complete an ascending triangle pattern. This could result in a retest of the all-time high at $58,341 and then to $61,075, which is the pattern target of the breakout from the triangle.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the trendline, it may attract profit-booking from short-term momentum traders. The pair could then drop to $46,313 and if this support also cracks, the decline may extend to $41,959.Ether (ETH) broke above the $1,670 overhead resistance on March 7, which suggests strength. The 20-day EMA ($1,624) has started to turn up and the RSI has risen above 57, indicating a minor advantage to the bulls.If the bulls can sustain the price above the moving averages, the ETH/USD pair could retest the all-time high at $2,040. A breakout of this resistance could start the next leg of the uptrend.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-day simple moving average at $1,572 the pair may retest the critical support at $1,289.Binance Coin (BNB) rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($217) on March 5, but the bulls have not been able to push the price to the $265 overhead resistance. This suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.If the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA support, the BNB/USD pair could drop to $189. A breakdown and close below this support may open the doors for a decline to the 50-day SMA at $137.On the contrary, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will try to propel the pair above $265. If they succeed, a rally to $309.49 is possible. The gradually rising 20-day EMA and the RSI above 57 suggest a minor advantage to the bulls.Cardano (ADA) has been holding above the 20-day EMA ($1.08) for the past four days, but the failure of the bulls to start a strong rebound suggests a lack of aggressive buying at the current levels.The bears may now try to break the 20-day EMA support and deepen the correction to $0.9817712 and then to the 50-day SMA at$ 0.769.However, the flattening 20-day EMA and the RSI above 58 indicates that the bulls are at a minor advantage.If the price can rebound off the current levels and rise above $1.20, the ADA/USD pair could rally to $1.35 and then to $1.48.Polkadot (DOT) is currently trading inside a symmetrical triangle, which generally acts as a continuation pattern. But in some cases, the symmetrical triangle plays the role of a reversal pattern, signaling a trend change.If the bears sink the price below the support line of the triangle, the DOT/USD pair could witness selling from the short-term bulls. The pair could then drop to $26.50 and the pattern target is at $17.Conversely, if the price rebounds off the current level and rises above the triangle, the pair may retest the all-time high at $42.28. If this level is crossed, the price may extend the rally to the pattern target at $52.50.XRP has formed an ascending triangle pattern in the short term, which will complete on a breakout and close above $0.50. This bullish setup has a target objective at $0.635.On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the trendline of the ascending triangle, the XRP/USD pair could drop to $0.359. A breakdown and close below $0.359 will complete a bearish head and shoulders pattern that may pull the price down to $0.173.The flat 20-day EMA ($0.46) and the RSI just above 52 do not foretell a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. Therefore, it is best to wait for a decisive breakout to happen before taking a positional call.Uniswap (UNI) soared to a new all-time high on March 7, but the bulls have not been able to build up on this strength. The bears are currently attempting to sink the price back below the previous resistance turned support at $33.If they succeed, the UNI/USD pair could correct to $30 and then to the 20-day EMA ($26.23). A strong rebound off either support will suggest that traders continue to buy the dips. The bulls will then again try to resume the uptrend.A breakout and close above $35 could start the journey to $46. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA support. This could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA at $20.31.Chainlink (LINK) is currently range-bound between $24 and $32. The bulls pushed the price above the 20-day EMA at $28.46 on March 7 and that cleared the path for a possible rally to the $32 overhead resistance.If the LINK/USD pair breaks and closes above $32, it will complete an ascending triangle pattern. This bullish setup has a target objective at $43.191. While the 20-day EMA is flat, the RSI in the positive zone indicates a minor advantage to the bulls.However, if the price turns down sharply from $32 and breaks below the trendline of the triangle, it could extend the stay inside the range. The trend may favor the bears if the price turns down and breaks below the $24 support. Such a move could pull the price down to $20.111.Litecoin (LTC) is facing stiff resistance in the $185.58 to $196.30 zone. The altcoin has turned down from the overhead resistance today and dipped back below $185.58, which suggests profit-booking at higher levels.The bears will now try to sink the price to the 50-day SMA at $171.94 and then to the uptrend line. A break below this support could start a deeper correction to $152 and then to $120.However, the 20-day EMA ($185) has flattened out and the RSI is near the midpoint, suggesting a range-bound action for a few days.The trend may favor the bulls if the price turns up from the current levels and rises above $196.30. In this case, the LTC/USD pair may rally to $246.96. A breakout of this resistance could signal the resumption of the uptrend.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently sandwiched between the uptrend line and the overhead resistance at $539. The altcoin has formed a Doji candlestick pattern today, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears.However, the gradually downsloping 20-day EMA at $531 and the RSI below 48 suggest a minor advantage to the bears. If the sellers can sink the price below the uptrend line, the BCH/USD pair could drop to $440 and then to $370.On the other hand, if the bulls can propel and sustain the price above $539, the pair could start its journey toward $631.71.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

100,"The economic recession of 2008 to 2009 resulted in the invention of Bitcoin (BTC), creating a brand new financial system that is now growing and developing rapidly. Back then, the Harvard Business Review published an article titled “The Female Economy” pointing out that about $20 trillion of the annual consumer spending in the world was controlled by women, and “That figure could climb as high as $28 trillion in the next five years.” Also in 2009, Claire Shipman and Katty Kay published the book Womenomics: Write Your Own Rules for Success. Though the term “womenomics,” and the concept itself, was first articulated in 1999 by Kathy Matsui, vice chair of Goldman Sachs Japan, Shipman and Kay introduced this concept to the U.S. audience in 2009, which clearly indicated the important paradigm shift in our societies.Over two decades have passed since Matsui introduced womenomics, and it’s becoming more clear than ever that women now drive and play a crucial role in the development of the world economy. For example, China has produced the highest numbers of self-made female billionaires, and Japan has surpassed Europe and the United States in female labor participation.Meanwhile, the situation is far from perfect. The gender imbalance is still enormously huge, especially within the economic industry. As indicated by the World Economic Forum’s “Global Gender Gap Report 2020,” financial disparities are increasing, “with a deteriorating situation forcing gender parity to a lowly 57.8%, which in time represents a massive 257 years before gender parity can be achieved.”Related: Diversity and inclusion in blockchain and crypto: The gender aspectThough there are indications of positive trends in bridging the gender gap within the crypto and blockchain space and moving toward diversity and inclusion, a critical gender imbalance in the crypto world has been revealed by new data from eToro, which shows that as of the beginning of 2021, only 12% of Ether (ETH) traders and 15% of Bitcoin traders are women.Statistics and data are always impersonal, and they show only one side of the picture. It is more important to hear the voices of those people about whom this data speaks. That’s why Cointelegraph reached out to female experts in the crypto and blockchain space for their opinions on the following questions: What role will the crypto industry play in the global economic drive? What role do women play in the process of decentralizing and developing the world economy? And what opportunities and challenges for women are there within the ecosystem and in finance in general?“The female economy is significant and fast-growing, representing a significant opportunity in terms of customer base and also talent. Hiring and promoting women to leadership positions drives returns and boosts the overall economy. With Deloitte estimating that 10% of global GDP will be built on blockchain applications by 2025, cryptocurrency and blockchain tech are expected to play a vital role in the future of the global economy, with the potential to enable social, inclusive and economic growth reaching the underserved segments of the financial sector, very often women, by offering easier access to capital and financial services.Now is the time for women to influence the growth of this industry at its early stages so that diversity and inclusion are built into its very fabric and products and services are developed to be relevant for women’s needs. Importantly, women need to take advantage of the exciting possibilities in terms of careers and entrepreneurship and wealth creation that the industry offers. This means making women aware of the different ways that the industry provides opportunities, and for the incumbents to create a more inclusive environment.”“We have more than a billion people on Earth who are currently unbanked and more than two billion women of color currently underbanked — blockchain and decentralized finance, especially, have tremendous potential to disrupt the global fintech industry.As tech becomes simpler to use, adoption will increase, especially in emerging markets where we will see a growth of digital asset adoption powering the economic empowerment of women worldwide.Women have tremendous potential to bridge the gender gap if given access to low-cost high-value disruptive technologies powered by artificial intelligence and blockchain like the mobile apps we are currently building designed specifically for them.”“The financial world from my childhood was male and white. Cryptocurrency transactions disrupted this because they are processed and recorded by peer-to-peer networks — the opposite of the standard financial transactions that need approval by an individual, bank or government. The new system is relying on miners that solve cryptographic puzzles, not on people. The system doesn’t care if you are a woman or a man, white or black, as long as you can log on a computer and push the right buttons. So, indeed, we can summarize that the blockchain system is based on ‘gender equality,’ as the system is built gender-neutral in the first place.How do women affect this? First, by embracing it. Women are launching their own cryptocurrencies, they are leading blockchain hubs, they are founding foreign exchange and payment platforms, forming fintech startups, topping Forbes fintech lists, etc. Women are in blockchain because the system gave them the opportunity to be part of something regardless of sex, race or anything else.Look at the world today: Women are at the forefront of global finance, politics and regulatory bodies. Cryptocurrencies have managed to premiere the decentralized economy system as a free market outside of central banks and credit regulation. The decentralized economy, or the economy of the new world, is based solely on supply and demand — where private companies compete from all around the world in terms of quality and price.Digital currencies are the perfect example of the decentralized economy, as they are outside of the ownership domain of governments and financial institutions. Will countries integrate into one international market? One thing is sure: There is no need to make roundtables of prime ministers to get the answer. Women can either support and engage with the development of a decentralized economy or go against it. However, I do not think this is a single question of the entire female nation, as we are all different in thoughts and actions.I think that neither challenges nor opportunities have anything to do with gender, but with education. We need more people to get involved and educated in the new financial systems that are evolving. Only by being educated can we accept the ‘unknown’ and use the benefits of it, as there are many. Imagine what ‘free market’ would mean for us particularly. I am referring to the entrepreneurs reading this article. The world is evolving faster than ever, and more power is given to the individual. Aren’t we fighting against inequality and regulations that don’t necessarily lead to growth but often stop us from growth? The only challenge that women find is if they stay outside of the system and let men ‘run the show.’Educate yourself. Then make an impact by helping educate others.”“While the numbers of women that are contributing code to crypto projects or investing as Bitcoin or crypto traders is still low, the figures are correlated with the percentage of women graduating with engineering degrees or working in venture capital firms. Cryptocurrencies have a high level of complexity and involve a number of factors that differentiate them from just executing a traditional financial transaction.As the crypto landscape and crypto investment vehicles continue to mature, women will be playing a bigger role in crypto investments. Some momentum will come from the growth in institutional acceptance as infrastructure and traditional investment vehicles continue to evolve. The first ETF has launched in Canada, and corporate treasuries are now investing in Bitcoin. The COVID-19 crisis has triggered concerns about the value of the U.S. dollar and other currencies, as governments have been printing money at historic levels. This alone has captured the attention of many new investors.There are many different ways to invest in cryptocurrencies today, and these investment vehicles don’t require the cumbersome task of managing keys. This makes investing in Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies less intimidating. Investment advisors are better educated on cryptocurrencies, and regulators have provided clearer guidelines, making it a less risky investment vehicle for those less knowledgeable about the crypto asset class.There are a number of reports that talk about the use of digital payments as a critical driver to economic growth. The opportunity to use decentralized payments that enable full control of funds and the cost-effective execution of payments offers many benefits to communities and entrepreneurs. Yet crypto isn’t the most efficient digital payment. There are risks associated with transacting directly with crypto — for example, the receipt of stolen crypto associated with a hack. What is more interesting is the availability of decentralized business loans for small and medium businesses. Access to capital is one of the drivers for economies, and open banking and PSD2 have the ability to offer new sources of capital for small businesses. Open banking and PSD2 utilize data to assess risk and can be part of a decentralized financial ecosystem that enables access to capital.As finance is being revolutionized by fintech, there is a requirement for innovators to understand both the underlying technology and finance, making it far more complex than gaining expertise in just one of these areas. Fintech is constantly evolving, which means that women that get involved today aren’t competing with many people that have decades of experience. It is a complex space, and it requires being a self-learner, but there are lots of opportunities for women who want to invest the time to gain the fundamental knowledge required to contribute to this quickly evolving space.”“First, I want to start by saying that women’s impact on the global economy shouldn’t be news to anyone. These numbers, while staggering, in practice are likely even larger depending on data models. Women are, and always have been, significant contributors, whether behind the scenes or in the open, to driving the world economy — and we are finally getting the credit for it.And we’re getting more power to shape its future, especially as new technologies come into play. Over the next four years, women are expected to accumulate wealth at a 7.2% annual growth rate. Additionally, women are adding $5 trillion to the global wealth pool every year. Combine that with what blockchain offers — greater participation without the barriers in other male-dominated sectors, the real story of financial inclusion — and exciting new opportunities emerge for women to earn more income and impact the global economy through cryptocurrency trading, investments and virtual spending. Female entrepreneurs are also looking to ICOs to fund their startups rather than relying on venture capital investment.As in everything we do, we hold a shared responsibility to promote inclusion and opportunity. It is important for women to empower other women to succeed in this industry and require inclusive representation in and beyond their organizations. Sometimes, it just takes all of us working together to create the right culture, values and mindsets in order to make inclusion truly possible.”“Crypto offers the possibility of providing financial services to unbanked and underbanked communities around the world. According to the World Bank, 90% of all global businesses are small and medium enterprises, accounting for over 50% of jobs and taking up a crucial role for overall economic development. Statistics show that investing in women is highly correlated with poverty reduction, since they are more likely to invest in products and services that will lead to better outcomes for their children and families, such as nutrition and education, which ultimately benefit society as a whole. This is what the Nike Foundation calls the Girl Effect.Data from the developing world shows that while women are more likely to remain in poverty, informal jobs, and lack a credit history, they are also more likely to pay back loans when given the opportunity. Financial services through alternative means like crypto could be crucial for women to access and leverage networks of productivity and growth, starting by entering three major life events in the order most likely to break the intergenerational poverty cycle: first getting a job to secure an income, then getting married (or entering into a stable relationship), and then having children. Eventually, a more inclusive world economy where women have more agency will benefit everyone.”“Several credible sources confirm that the global purchasing power of women is not only significant but rising. The devil, however, is in the details, as always. The distribution of this wealth (over $31 trillion, as per Catalyst) is extremely uneven between different countries. And even amongst the most developed economies, there are many gaps. For example, the percentage of women who are the higher earners in a household and the percentage of women who control most of the household spending decisions may differ substantially.The crypto industry can empower women in a wide range of ‘financial inclusion’ services, from enabling cross-border micro-payments to designing tokens that reward women for their services to the community and the commons.Women are being held back by the broad societal organizational structure that keeps a large part of the female population at a disadvantage, in several ways. A larger degree of decentralization can reduce these inequalities if such intention is built-in by design. Blockchain technology is what we all hope will power up Web 3.0, which will have more fairness built in and allow us to exchange peer-to-peer a variety of valuables. This will automatically benefit women. This is an opportunity that we have the choice and the responsibility to tap into, for a more fair and balanced society.”“Blockchain has the power to remove barriers and increase access to financial services. Cryptocurrencies are being used as intermediary currencies in cross-border transfers and in the back end by Bloom for facilitating remittances in the Philippines, and BitPesa in Africa uses Bitcoin as an intermediary currency. In Venezuela, staggering inflation rates and a lack of alternative reserve currencies have led to people adopting cryptocurrencies as a store of value. Lebanese banks are increasing restrictions on foreign currency movements, and more people are turning to digital currencies to shift their money in and out of the country.Projects like Little Phil, Impactio, The Giving Block and GoodDollar are using blockchain for philanthropy and universal basic income. Hiveonline is working to give unbanked communities access to financial services through Village Savings and Loans Associations, with 800,000 members in Niger — most of them women. By recording VSLA records on the blockchain during regular group meetings with VSLA Online, members grow their financial reputation and develop an alternative credit score that can then be shared with microfinance institutions.Women are key to the global economy, and $12 trillion could be added to global GDP by 2025 by advancing women’s equality. Women in emerging markets invest 90 cents of every additional dollar of income into their families’ education, health and nutrition. Women farmers produce 60% to 80% of the food in developing countries, and women own 60% of all global microenterprises. Women entrepreneurs need support to establish connections with finance, legal support, suppliers, distributors and markets. By targeting women and the SHEconomy with capital and education, the blockchain community could activate the power of women to harness decentralisation globally.Blockchain and fintech are behind on tackling gender equality. The data-driven Fintech Diversity Radar will help to identify gaps, obstacles and ultimately solutions to increasing investment in women-owned fintechs and fintech products for women. Invest in women and technology — a game changer for anyone who is thinking about transforming women’s lives.”“What do women and blockchain have in common? I believe that they both contribute to the female economy, and both draw upon feminine attributes. Let’s unpack this observation.According to the Harvard Business Review, women are contributing to the world economy by dominating annual consumer spending. Further, this trend is expected to continue over the coming years. In parallel, blockchain is contributing to the world economy by breaking down traditional economic gender barriers, by empowering women to participate in the economy.This trend is also expected to continue over the coming years. Therefore, we can see that both women and blockchain are contributing to the female economy in a meaningful way, and we’re just getting started.Another layer of commonality that both women and blockchain share is that they both draw upon feminine attributes. Generally speaking, women embody a portion of feminine characteristics, which fold into the way they earn and the way they spend. Similarly, blockchain embodies feminine attributes, primarily and fundamentally by creating consensus — regardless of gender. Blockchain is predicated on achieving consensus, which could be deemed a feminine attribute. I think it’s important that we recognize the power of distributed wealth across genders and building consensus, during a time when we need it most.”“The crypto industry, while still in its earliest growth stages, has an opportunity to avoid the same mistakes of access and opportunity as other industries, most notably the legacy finance and tech worlds. One of the central premises of blockchain technology is its decentralized nature, which, in theory, should lower the barriers to entry for anyone interested in working in this industry.However, we must consider that while the tech may be blind and permissionless, the people themselves involved in the growth of this economy remain human, subject to all of the biases inherent to the broader world of business. To ensure that the crypto world does not simply mirror the rest of the economy in terms of gender bias, our entrepreneurs need to ensure anyone who is interested and qualified based on their merits has the chance to make it in this ecosystem. Crypto is young enough to arrest a slide into the status quo, but it will take a heightened awareness to achieve anything close to parity of opportunity.”“We’re finally coming to a stage where companies understand the value of gender-inclusive organizations to drive more success and productivity. I definitely see more projects and companies in the space paying attention to inclusion, with more women in executive and leadership roles.On the other hand, and especially in emerging countries, women still have limited access to finance or the capacity for building opportunities. We have a unique opportunity to bridge that gap through blockchain and decentralized finance, with the use of new technology that removes the need for traditional intermediaries like corporations and old financial services.This will allow the industry to innovate faster, creating more inclusivity and a truly global economy offering equal opportunities.”“There’s a lot of excitement around the idea that crypto could open doors for women (among other groups) in terms of inclusion, ownership and wealth creation, but this vision can only become a reality if we’re deliberate about bringing their voices and ideas into the room. Put another way, if the crypto industry is going to help create opportunities for women, then we need women to help create the crypto industry.Part of building something new is the opportunity to examine what is and isn’t working within current systems, and for whom. We know that there are gender gaps in access to banking and financing around the world. We know that women invest less and retire with less money. So, we have the chance now to ask, ‘Why is that?’ and design systems that address the gaps.How do we ensure that women play an important role within and across organizations in the crypto ecosystem? Hire them, support them and pay them well. Include them in your user-feedback processes. Elevate women leaders in the space (there are many, some of whom I know and admire!) We’re starting to see some of this happen, but I would love to see even more of it moving forward.”These quotes have been edited and condensed.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors’ alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

101,"A number of indicators suggest that Bitcoin (BTC) is pushing aside gold as the premier safe-haven asset. This could set the stage for wider mainstream adoption of the digital currency, according to Mike McGlone, a senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg.McGlone tweeted Monday that the battle between the safe havens is beginning to favor Bitcoin, based on technical and fundamental indicators. He explained:Digital #Gold Pushing Aside the Old Guard -
Gold will always have a place in jewelry and coin collections, but most indicators point to an accelerating pace of #Bitcoin replacing the metal as a store of value in investor portfolios. pic.twitter.com/RR0CCWmksFThe chart accompanying the tweet shows Bitcoin’s strong outperformance versus gold since mid-2020, while total known holdings of gold ETFs have declined. In other words, it appears that Bitcoin is gaining traction among institutional investors at the expense of gold. The chart also highlights a sharp decline in Bitcoin's volatility relative to that of gold.McGlone has long argued that Bitcoin would ultimately become the preferred safe haven of investors as the “digital gold” narrative continues to gain traction. In early February, the Bloomberg strategist predicted that BTC would quickly reach $50,000 as investors move funds out of bullion and into the digital asset. The flagship cryptocurrency hit $50,000 less than two weeks later.In November 2020, McGlone also predicted that Bitcoin could reach $170,000 over the next two years before consolidating like gold.So far this year, the haven battle between gold and Bitcoin has strongly favored BTC. As of Monday, 1 Bitcoin was worth 30.3 ounces of gold. The ratio peaked at 32.1 in February, according to MarketWatch data.The BTC spot price is currently trading above $51,100, up 1.3% on the day. Gold, meanwhile, is down 0.9% at $1,683 per troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. "
102,"Bitcoin's (BTC) price has been consolidating in the previous weeks as the sentiment and momentum have slowed to a crawl. That's very natural, as it's also impossible to throw a six every time. Therefore, consolidation and correction are necessary for the market to recharge before resuming the uptrend. Several reasons were given for such a corrective move in the previous weeks, the primary ones being whales selling in addition to macroeconomic factors, particularly the surge in Treasury yields.However, Bitcoin's price is back at a critical resistance zone for continuation. If that resistance zone breaks, new all-time highs are in play once more.BTC’s price is having a tough time cracking the resistance zone at $52,000, as the chart above shows. This resistance zone is critical for more upside, as that would open the gates toward $55,000 to $56,000.Failing to break through this resistance zone again would be a bummer for Bitcoin’s bulls and would open the door toward a retest of the critical $46,000 level. It would also confirm further weakness for BTC/USD as it's still 17% below the current all-time high at $58,000.However, the bullish aspect of this structure is the number of tests that the resistance zone has seen. Given that this resistance zone has been tested several times, it should become weaker with each attempt.Thus, another resistance zone test should generate further strength for a price breakout toward $55,000.The primary reasons for the weakness of Bitcoin are a resurgent dollar and rising 10-year Treasury yields.However, both of these rallies are now facing resistance zones, as the charts show. It's unlikely to see further strength in the dollar, as this crucial resistance zone should hold. If this resistance zone at 92.50 points holds, a retest of the 91-points zone is expected. Such a move would likely boost Bitcoin's price.Government bonds are also facing a crucial area of resistance, which should also prevent, or at least stall, any upward momentum. The yields have rallied by almost 75% in 2021, which is a gigantic move in general. Hence, downward tests are becoming more likely, especially as the yields enter a big area of resistance.So, a reversal of the rally in the dollar and yields should have a positive effect on Bitcoin’s price. Nevertheless, it is worth noting a few things that must first happen for BTC/USD to resume its bull run. It is more important for BTC to successfully flip the $52,000 level into support than simply break above the $52,000 barrier, which already occurred on March 3, before the price retraced. If that resistance-support flip happens, Bitcoin’s price will likely see a quick rally to the $56,000 level. However, another failed breakout above $52,000 would be a sign of weakness, which may be followed by a rapid drop. Therefore, traders and investors should anticipate a potential breakdown to $46,000 or even $42,000 if another fakeout does occur.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

103,"New York Digital Investment Group announced the completion of a $200-million growth capital funding round for business initiatives relating to Bitcoin (BTC). The funding round was led by NYDIG strategic partners Morgan Stanley, Stone Ridge Holdings Group, Soros Fund Management and MassMutual, among others.NYDIG, a provider of Bitcoin-related technology and investment services, will work alongside its strategic partners in applying Bitcoin-focused solutions to the insurance, banking and clean energy industries. NYDIG's co-founder and CEO, Robert Gutmann, said:Following on from a spate of high-profile Bitcoin acquisitions by various institutional entities, Gutmann said the latest partnerships were a sign that institutional adoption of Bitcoin had arrived.“These partnerships leave no doubt that institutional adoption of Bitcoin has arrived and, further, that NYDIG is the partner of choice for serious financial services firms with the highest fiduciary and diligence standards,"" said Gutmann, adding: ""In the months and quarters ahead, look out for an explosion of innovation in Bitcoin products and services delivered by NYDIG, in partnership with our new investors.”NYDIG also announced on Monday that among life, annuity, and property and casualty insurers who utilize its platform, over $1 billion worth of Bitcoin investments are now held in its institutional custody service.The founder and executive chairman of NYDIG, Ross Stevens, said the latest round of funding from institutional investors was good for the company and BTC. “I am thrilled by what this group of incredible investors will mean for NYDIG, but especially for Bitcoin,” said Stevens."
104,"American banking giant Goldman Sachs has officially confirmed its plans to revive a cryptocurrency trading desk amid increasing demand from investors.Matt McDermott, global head of digital assets for Goldman Sachs' global markets division, announced that the company will provide access to CME Bitcoin (BTC) futures on its upcoming crypto platform. In a Friday Exchanges at Goldman Sachs podcast, the executive also noted that Goldman Sachs will offer crypto services with non-deliverable forwards, or NDFs, which are cash-settled, and usually short-term, forward contracts.McDermott noted that initially Goldman Sachs’ crypto platform will be limited to these two products, stating:According to McDermott, Goldman Sachs’ move into crypto comes in response to the increasing demand from its clients. Citing an internal survey of nearly 300 clients, the executive said that 40% of Goldman Sachs’ investors currently have exposure to crypto. “That seemed actually a little high to me, but I felt that was kind of very reflective of the demand we’ve seen over the last three to six months,” he said.The executive also reported that 61% of Goldman Sachs’ surveyed clients expect digital-asset holdings to increase over the next year. Particularly, 76% of those surveyed see Bitcoin ending 2021 between $40,000 and $100,000, McDermott said. However, only 22% expect Bitcoin to surpass the $100,000 mark by the end of 2021, he noted.Goldman Sachs originally wanted to set up a crypto trading desk in 2018, announcing the plan in late 2017. At the time, Bitcoin was sitting at its former all-time high levels after hitting $20,000 in December 2017. Following a subsequent sell-off on crypto markets in 2018, Goldman Sachs was rumored to have canceled its crypto desk plans. Eventually, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon strongly refuted that the bank ever had plans to open a crypto trading desk in 2019.In the latest interview, McDermott pointed out that the existing crypto landscape is very much different than 2017 in terms of growing institutional demand. “2017 was very much a retail-driven market. This time around, we’ve seen a huge volume of institutional demand across a broad spectrum of different industry types,” he said."
105,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to break past $51,000 on March 8 as the U.S. Treasury yield is rising again, while the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is at the highest levels in over three months.The global stock market, including equities in the United States and Asia, has pulled back in tandem as the U.S. Senate's stimulus approval has sparked inflation fears.As Welt market analyst Holger Zschaepitz explained, the bond market turned into turmoil as the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield surged to 1.6% after the stimulus news broke.The instability in the bond market naturally led to a sell-off of risk-on assets, affecting both stocks and cryptocurrencies. The analyst wrote:Stocks and Bitcoin have seen a tightening correlation in recent weeks, likely due to the increasingly unfavorable macro landscape.Peter Brandt, a long-time futures and foreign exchange trader, said he has seen many correlations throughout his career. However, he said that correlations can also come to an end ""dramatically.""Hence, in the foreseeable future, Bitcoin could move in tandem with stocks as the markets react negatively to the rising Treasury yield. But on longer time frames, the bull run of Bitcoin could strengthen and gain momentum if the correlation begins to weaken. He said:Nevertheless, March may turn out to be a slow month for BTC, trading with low volatility.If the traditional market drops, traders seemingly anticipate a broader Bitcoin pullback in the near term.For example, pseudonymous cryptocurrency trader Loma said a short-term drop to $48,000, an important support level, cannot be ruled out if the legacy markets continue to show weakness. He wrote:This week, the key for Bitcoin is whether the DXY sees a pullback after a week-long rally, providing the risk-on market some room for a relief rally.As Cointelegraph previously reported, the Treasury yield is also approaching a key resistance area, and if it gets rejected, Bitcoin could regain momentum in the near term to rally above the next big resistance areas at $52,000 and $53,000."
106,"A 44-page report commissioned by CPA Australia delves into the status of central bank digital currency development worldwide, while exploring viable blockchain candidates for hosting CBDCs in the coming years.The report offers up evaluations of the three most transacted cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and XRP — and analyses their suitability (or lack thereof) for use by central banks.Bitcoin’s decentralized network and lack of oversight by banks or governments make it generally unsuitable for use in a national CBDC network, notes the report. Although Bitcoin is still accepted as a medium of exchange the world over, its volatility and unpredictability have resulted in a lack of trust among central banks. The report states:While Bitcoin continues to puzzle and confound lawmakers in most jurisdictions, the report also notes that its legal status as a currency is undergoing a transformation. The report cites a ruling by the Commercial Court of Nanterre in France in 2020 that declared “Bitcoin is an intangible asset with an exchange value, equivalent to fiat money at law.""“This, along with a January 2020 UK High Court decision recognising digital currency as property, and a February 2020 NSW District Court decision that acknowledges digital currency as a store of value, the legitimacy of digital and cryptocurrencies is gaining credence from a legal and economic standpoint,” states the report.Ethereum suffers from many of the same pitfalls as Bitcoin when it comes to hosting CBDCs, according to the report. Despite allowing for “programmable money” through the use of smart contracts, Ethereum’s decentralization and inability to be controlled by any state actor make it an unlikely candidate for hosting CBDCs. The report states:Running contrary to Ethereum’s perceived inadequacy for use in government systems, the Reserve Bank of Australia used Ethereum-based technology in November 2020 when it sought to develop a proof-of-concept for a tokenized CBDC.A slightly more optimistic view is offered regarding the use of Ripple and XRP. According to the report, the Ripple Network and the XRP coin are looked on more favorably by banks and governments due to their centralized nature. The report states:The report claims that the centralized nature of Ripple’s operations makes it similar to central banks, due to how developers can control the “timing and quantity of supply” of its associated tokens. It states: “Ripple also allows the creation of new currencies and Ripple developers can decide the timing and quantity of supply in a similar way to current central bank operations.”The report also notes that Ripple “does not operate on a blockchain network per se,” referencing the Ripple Protocol consensus algorithm, which it rightly states is Ripple’s own patented technology.The report points out that France’s central bank, the Banque de France, has already expressed interest in exploring Ripple as a possible platform for hosting a Europewide CBDC.In summary, the report notes that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation, spurring faster development of digital payment systems, blockchain projects and the financial technology sector at large.Between the rise of Bitcoin and the emergence of corporate-led financial infrastructures like Facebook’s Libra (now Diem), central banks are being forced to keep a close eye on the ongoing development of blockchain and cryptocurrency projects."
107,"Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continue to multiply as a new entrant hits the Canadian market on March 9.In a press release on Monday, Galaxy Digital Capital Management, a subsidiary of financial services and investment management company Galaxy Digital, confirmed that the CI Galaxy Bitcoin ETF would likely start trading this week.The launch will see Galaxy join the TSX Purpose Bitcoin ETF as one of the pioneering ETF products in North America, with United States regulators yet to approve a single application.As Cointelegraph reported, Purpose has seen huge interest and associated volumes since its ETF went live last month, around the same time that Galaxy filed with regulators.“We believe the emerging digital asset class presents compelling growth and diversification opportunities,” Steve Kurz, partner and head of asset management at GDAM — which will provide executive trading for the Galaxy product — commented in the press release.Institutional demand for Bitcoin exposure has been unfazed by price volatility and negative press, with a recent survey from Goldman Sachs showing that 40% of clients are already involved.The ETF boom is meanwhile providing new competition for alternative market offerings, notably the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which continues to trade at a discount of around 2% to its net asset value.Last week, the trust’s shares traded at a record discount of 13%, with new entrants currently not permitted to buy as a result of Grayscale’s periodic closure schedule. Analysts noted that if historical behavior repeats itself, the negative premium may foretell the next phase of the Bitcoin price bull run.GBTC buyers are required to pay a 2% management fee, higher than the newcomer ETFs.“I believe our ETF stands out based on its highly competitive price point and CI and Galaxy’s extensive capabilities and track record in managing alternative investments and digital assets,” Kurt MacAlpine, CEO of CI Financial — which will run the ETF — added about market fit."
108,"Publicly listed mining company Argo Blockchain has finalized its acquisition of a new 320-acre land plot in West Texas in the United States, which it plans to use for the construction of a new 200-megawatt cryptocurrency mining facility.News of the planned acquisition first broke in mid-February after Argo entered into a letter of intent with DPN LLC of New York. Details of the deal indicate that the acquisition was completed at an initial price of $5 million, satisfied by the issue of roughly 3.5 million new shares of Argo to DPN shareholders. A further payment of shares worth up to $12.5 million will occur once milestones related to the project are fulfilled.The cryptocurrency miner, which is based in London and trades on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker ARB, has until now tapped cheap hydroelectric power in Quebec, Canada for its cryptocurrency mining operations. In mid-January, the company raised fresh funds through a private placement with institutional investors in order to purchase new hardware and contribute toward financing its expansion.Chief executive Peter Wall has said that the new site in Texas will provide the firm with ""access to some of what we believe is the cheapest renewable energy worldwide, in a location where innovation in new technologies is encouraged and incentivised."" In correspondence with Cointelegraph, Wall added:Cheap, deregulated energy production in Texas is indeed one of the key factors contributing to the state's rising reputation as a popular jurisdiction for blockchain firms in the U.S., with well-known names like Bitmain already operating there. A trade association called The Texas Blockchain Council was, moreover, formed back in November 2020 with the aim of coordinating a ""Blockchain Caucus"" of lawmakers in the state legislature to promote blockchain-friendly initiatives and legislation at a state level.Argo, which focuses on mining Bitcoin (BTC) and Zcash (ZEC), plans to construct its 200MW mining facility within the next 12 months. Following the acquisition, it will have access to up to a total of 800MW of electrical power. In response to Cointelegraph's question regarding the possible implications of the recent, high-profile power blackouts in Texas this winter, Wall said that Argos ""understand[s] fully the Texas power grid challenges and opportunities"" but that the company still ""think[s] it’s a great place to build a facility.”Reflecting the bullish mood of the cryptocurrency markets in 2021, Argo also recently revealed that Wall has ostensibly become the first executive of a publicly traded company to take their entire salary in Bitcoin."
109,"Aker ASA, a $6-billion Oslo Bors-listed holding company, is set to begin investing in Bitcoin. According to a press release issued on Monday, Aker has created a new company called Seetee AS whose mission is to invest in Bitcoin (BTC).The newly formed Seetee will also delve into the Bitcoin mining arena while looking to forge useful partnerships with major players in the crypto space. Indeed, Seetee has reportedly entered into a collaborative agreement with Blockstream.According to Blockstream chief strategy officer Samson Mow, the Bitcoin infrastructure firm will work closely with Seetee on its BTC mining and sidechain implementation pursuits.Despite the Norwegian government ending electricity subsidies for BTC miners back in November 2018, Bitcoin mining activity in the country still contributes to a significant proportion of the global hash rate distribution.Outside China, the country ranks eighth in terms of global monthly hash rate, according to data from the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Bitfury signed an agreement with a private equity firm to upgrade the latter’s $35-million BTC mining farm.The press statement also reveals that the new company will look to pursue investments into other firms in the crypto and blockchain arena.Aker will provide 500 million Norwegian kroner ($58 million) in initial capitalization for Seetee, with the new company holding all of its liquid investable assets in BTC. The move marks a significant departure from Aker’s usual investments in the oil exploring and marine biotech sectors. Tweeting on Friday, Seetee revealed that it has already purchased 1,170 BTC.Today, we announced the launch of Seetee!
We are a new company in the Aker group, and will invest in ex­cit­ing projects and com­pa­nies through­out the #Bitcoin ecosys­tem.
Bitcoin is our treasury asset. Our first purchase was 1,170 BTC and our strategy is to hodl.Commenting on the rationale for exploring Bitcoin investments, Aker CEO Øyvind Eriksen remarked:Aker is the latest in a growing list of companies around the world investing in Bitcoin in recent months, from business intelligence outfit MicroStrategy to electronic vehicle manufacturer Tesla — and a Canadian restaurant has even converted its cash reserves to BTC."
110,"There’s a rumbling in the crypto world. Long perceived — not unjustly — as a boys’ club, 2020 has seen more women entering Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies than ever before. If the trend continues, we’ll see a welcome influx of women in the space.A recent survey by Gemini reports that women’s investment in cryptocurrency has surged 20% over the past year among a nationally representative sampling of United Kingdom investors. Among those planning to invest in crypto, 40% are women. Crypto trading platform eToro also reported a sharp rise in the rate at which women signed up to the site during 2020, with women’s sign-ups rising by 366% compared with a 248% rise for men.Related: The number of women in crypto and blockchain is skyrocketing in 2020While the figures suggest a heartening diversification of the crypto space, we are far from gender parity. Data from eToro reveals that women comprise only 15% of Bitcoin traders, and progress in the space remains largely marginal. Ether (ETH) investment activity among women grew a mere 1% during 2020, from 11% to 12%.Related: Diversity and inclusion in blockchain and crypto: The gender aspectBitcoin is the world’s leading decentralized digital currency. It democratizes finance and allows those historically disempowered by traditional banking to have equal access to capital, unmediated by a gatekeeping institution. By cutting out financial middlemen like banks that control the flow of capital, owning Bitcoin can enable one to wholly control one’s own finances, enjoy greater security, and avoid inflationary pressures and fees imposed by traditional financial institutions.In emerging markets, and particularly since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Bitcoin has been embraced by users cautious of economic instability in their own countries, falling national currencies and strict limitations on international money transfers. Demand for Bitcoin has surged as a safe-haven asset for users to send international payments — either as remittances to family abroad or for daily transactions — and to protect their assets against economic decline in their own countries.The usefulness of cryptocurrency for women across the world cannot be overstated. Women around the world continue to struggle with financial disempowerment and constitute the majority of the world’s impoverished population.The disproportionate effect of poverty on women is a result of a network of complex factors, including a lack of financial literacy education among women and relationship dynamics that deprive women of access to family money. The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence reports that at least 94% of female victims of domestic abuse also experienced economic abuse, in which one partner controls access to the other’s financial resources. The decentralization of currency creates monumental opportunities for groups historically disadvantaged by traditional banking, disrupting an age-old cycle of financial disempowerment.Related: Cointelegraph Talks recap: Challenges and opportunities on the road to diversity and inclusion in cryptoThis year’s Bitcoin bull market has drawn Bitcoin onto the world stage unlike ever before. The influx of big-name investors like Tesla, growing acceptance of Bitcoin on Wall Street, surging prices, instability of the traditional economy, and even the recent GameStop saga have all added up to an increasing mainstream awareness of Bitcoin.Related: What lies ahead for crypto and blockchain in 2021? Experts answerThese combined factors have facilitated notable demographic shifts, but if Bitcoin is to achieve mass adoption — high rates of holding with widespread use for payments of goods and services — everyone needs to participate. As long as it’s not embraced by half the population, a currency can’t reach its full potential.According to Coinbase, 39% of millennial women say that they would be more interested in crypto if they knew it could make finance more accessible. Communities of women in crypto can play a formidable role in spreading knowledge. Groups of women in the space have already sprung up worldwide — at conferences, on college campuses and across social media channels. More women’s voices will amplify our ideas, create a powerful basis of role models for future generations and strengthen our presence in boardrooms and C-suites.Recent innovations in technology are making investing in Bitcoin user-friendly for growing populations, thereby transforming the profile of the Bitcoin investor and drawing crypto into the mainstream. A growing crop of crypto-back rewards programs have given rise to a new generation of investors — simply by shopping online, users become passive investors in Bitcoin. Visa and Mastercard have also recently set their sights on crypto, with Mastercard launching a pilot program that will let users transact with digital assets. PayPal announced its own crypto compatibility in 2020.When we talk about the need for breaking down barriers to entry and fostering greater diversity, we are talking about a movement to benefit all Bitcoin investors. Unlike traditional financial institutions, Bitcoin doesn’t care about gender, what you look like or who you are. The implications of mass adoption go far beyond financial freedom. Mass adoption means socioeconomic mobility, material opportunities and a holistic reevaluation of the role of the institutions that stand between the individual and her wealth.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

111,"Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week on a firmly bullish note as stocks tumble and BTC managed to close the week above $50,000. After a mixed performance last week that saw multiple tests of $46,000, buyer support is entering and BTC/USD is within 15% of all-time highs.Cointelegraph takes a look at what might lie in store for traders in the coming days with five factors likely to affect Bitcoin price action.The tide is turning on the equities miracle of the past year, with indices falling left and right amid warnings that the rout is far from over.On the back of significant losses in tech stocks, including crypto industry favorites Tesla and MicroStrategy, Asian stocks shed over 1% on the open on Monday.Despite a strong close last week, expectations were for a knock-on effect for the U.S. prior to Wall Street returning. According to analysts at Morgan Stanley, the Nasdaq 100 could even touch its 200-day moving average, lying around 800 points below its current level of 12,642.“You will see a lot of volatility in markets,” Kim Stafford, Asia Pacific head at Pacific Investment Management, told Bloomberg.With grim short-term perspectives for equities traders, the U.S. dollar is boosting its existing strong performance.Extending a run from late February, the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) touched 92.19 over the weekend and held above the 92 mark on Monday.Traditionally a problematic phenomenon for Bitcoin price strength, recent moves on the index have been felt less than over the past year with BTC/USD broadly shrugging off sentiment to forge an increasingly asymmetric path.Coming in tandem with the USD meanwhile was renewed strength in oil prices, which surged on news that Saudi Arabia’s infrastructure had suffered an attack. Output, however, has not reportedly been affected.The main impetus for dollar strength, however counterintuitive, has been news that lawmakers will inflate its supply to the tune of $1.9 trillion as they pass the latest coronavirus stimulus package.Passed by the Senate on Sunday, President Joe Biden’s sweeping cash injection piles fresh debt on the country’s existing mountain but will supply eligible Americans with $1,400 payouts.Given Bitcoin’s increased public profile this year compared to the last major stimulus payout of $1,200 in March 2020, expectations are high that at least some of the money will flow into BTC.The figures, now widely repeated online, speak for themselves. According to online monitoring resource Bitcoin Stimulus, the combined value of the two previous checks — $1,200 and $600 — would be over $10,250 as of March 4 had each recipient immediately purchased Bitcoin.Put another way, the first $1,200 stimulus bought 0.18 BTC at the time of receipt, while the $600 check bought 0.02 BTC. This time around, despite the USD amount being larger, at the time of writing, it would only be worth 0.028 BTC.Long term, meanwhile, dollar weakness weighs heavy on the minds of investors given both its supply increase and the other impacts associated with the highly controversial economic response to the virus.Despite claiming not to be a “Bitcoin maximalist,” veteran trader Peter Brandt said that Bitcoin would only profit from the current policy on longer timeframes.“The devaluation of the purchasing power of the U.S. Dollar… has only just begun,” he warned on Sunday.Brandt also revealed that his second-largest investment position after real estate is his BTC allocation.Within Bitcoin, bulls were buoyed as the weekend came and went as fresh upside took BTC/USD over $50,000.Coming in step with the stimulus announcement, local highs totalled $51,177 on Bitstamp. At the same time, positive investment news from China extended the supply shortage narrative, this focusing on institutional buy-ins reducing the already dwindling amount of BTC available for purchase on the market.Despite failing to hold on Monday, the psychologically significant level did manage to remain for the weekly close, providing Bitcoin’s second-largest weekly close on record.Analyzing trader behavior, Rafael Schultze-Kraft, co-founder and CTO of on-chain analytics resource Glassnode, forecast that a return below $46,600 is unlikely.“This support is holding nicely. And it got stronger! We now have a wall of 1.2M $BTC that moved on-chain between $46.6k and $48.6k,” he wrote on Sunday.For Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe, a conspicuous trend despite the higher price levels was an overall lack of interest among consumers in particular.“I've noticed the decrease of social media engagement and media attention on Bitcoin recently. While a few weeks ago, everyone and their parents wanted to get Bitcoin out of FOMO,” he tweeted on Monday.Popular Twitter account Bitcoin Archive agreed, responding that interest “goes up and down” along with price performance.Additional on-chain indicators confirmed “business as usual” among market participants.At $50,000, miners are uninterested in selling, while flows to exchanges and exchange reserves continue to decrease, data shows.For statistician Willy Woo, selling pressure has instead come from institutional players needing to prepare for reporting as Q1 comes to an end — far from a bearish signal.“Who has been selling? Apart from margin longs liquidating, my guess from the data, it's hedge funds rebalancing for end of Q1 reporting,” he told Twitter followers late last week.Woo also noted that large whales have been selling while smaller whales, who hold between 10 and 100 BTC, have increased their presence.“Looking at the age of coins in this sell off, Dormancy being low tells us, so it's young coins. It's new whales who bought in recently selling their positions,” he added alongside charts from Glassnode and his own analytics resource, Woobull.By contrast, he said, buy support is coming from “strong hodlers.”After a brisk drop to “fear” territory, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is back to signalling “extreme greed” among investors.Providing an indication that further price rises may be short-lived, the Index hit 81/100 on Monday, up from 76 the day before. Just a week ago, it measured 38/100.Nevertheless, on-chain analysis has a convincing counterargument, with Glassnode’s Network Value to Transactions (NVT) data showing that volume has broadly accompanied recent price rises.“What defines a healthy rise in Bitcoin's price? ...one that is backed by on-chain volume!” co-founders Yann Allemann and Jan Happel tweeted referencing Woo.NVT has risen in a satisfyingly steady fashion since before the 2017 bull market peak."
112,"Data from on-chain crypto information aggregator Glassnode indicates the number of Bitcoin held on centralized exchanges has fallen by roughly 20% in 12 months.The data suggests investors are accumulating BTC and withdrawing them from exchanges into cold storage, creating a supply crunch.#Bitcoin Balance on Exchanges taking another dive pic.twitter.com/F20tohfXsuOn March 6, Glassnode also shared data revealing that coins purchased during 2021 were not moved at a loss during the late February dip, according to on-chain analysis.The firm’s “Hodlwaves” metric, which measures the time since coins were last moved on-chain, also points to increasing accumulation activity.  Hodlwaves data published on Feb. 22 indicated 57% of Bitcoin’s supply has not moved in more than one year. However, more than one-third of said BTC have not moved in more than five years, suggesting that a significant portion of the coins may have been lost.The increasing popularity of decentralized exchanges and DeFi yield protocols may also be driving the diminishing supply of BTC on centralized exchanges.Evidencing strong demand for Bitcoin in the DeFi ecosystem, the total value locked, or TVL, of BTC tokenization protocol Wrapped Bitcoin has increased by more than $1 billion since the start of March, according to DeFi Llama."
113,"While purchasing 0.01 Bitcoin (BTC) might cost only $500 today, current trends in global wealth distribution and the inevitable realization of Bitcoin's limited supply could result in 0.01 BTC being worth $1 million in the future.According to Credit Suisse's ""Global Wealth Report 2020"", there are 51.9 million individuals with a net worth surpassing $1 million. The index considers a person's net worth, along with their financial and real-estate assets, while deducting their debts and liabilities.Despite representing just 1% of the global population (excluding children), millionaires own 43% of the world's wealth.According to Credit Suisse's individual wealth breakdown, 175,700 people were worth more than $50 million. Of these, 55,800 were worth at least $100 million, and 4,410 had wealth over $500 million.As of March 1, Bitcoin's total supply consists of 18.64 million BTC, leaving 2.37 million coins to be mined. In 10 years, the supply will reach 20.6 million, or 98% of the 21 million total coin supply.When removing the 1.9 million coins that haven't been touched for over a decade from Bitcoin's supply cap, there is a maximum limit of 19.2 million BTC available for the world's millionaires. This leaves 0.37 BTC per millionaire, including the yet-to-be-mined coins, assuming Bitcoin's supply will be evenly shared between said millionaires.However, if every Bitcoin that has remained unmoved for five or more years is lost, a maximum of 14.57 million BTC will be available for accumulation. In this scenario, each of the world's millionaires could own just 0.28 BTC each, assuming supply is evenly distributed.In addition to the certified millionaires, there are 590 million individuals whose net worth exceeds $100,000. These people shouldn't be disregarded as potential holders, even though their purchasing power is less.Assuming the global wealth proportion shown in the chart above stays the same, millionaires represent 6.32 million coins out of Bitcoin's remaining supply, suggesting each individual would have the opportunity to purchase just 0.12 BTC each.The remaining 590 million individuals currently worth $100,000 or higher could effectively hold another 5.9 million coins, resulting in a mere 0.01 BTC per adult.To conclude, buying 0.01 BTC today, roughly a $500 investment at current prices, can assure one a top 13% holder position. When comparing the relative wealth concentration of the fiat and Bitcoin markets, being among Bitcoin's top 13% shares the same exclusivity as being a fiat millionaire.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

114,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) fundamentals received a boost as the U.S. Senate passed the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill on March 7. If traders react to this bill in the same way as they had done to the first stimulus package in April 2020, then the crypto markets may witness a strong rally.The stimulus package also intensifies the focus on the devaluation of the U.S. dollar. These concerns could lead some investors to park their money in hard assets or Bitcoin instead of keeping them in fiat currencies, according to veteran trader Peter Brandt.In addition to investors, a growing number of listed companies are choosing to protect their fiat reserves by buying Bitcoin. After the high-profile purchases by MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Square, a Chinese listed company called Meitu revealed that it had acquired $40 million worth of Bitcoin and Ether.If other companies across the world also follow this lead and invest a portion of their treasury reserves in Bitcoin, that could create a massive supply and demand imbalance, sending prices through the roof.Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may resume their uptrend in the short term.Bitcoin dipped below the 20-day exponential moving average ($48,484) on March 5 and March 6 but the long tail on each candlestick shows buyers are ready to jump in at lower levels. The bulls have currently pushed the price toward the $52,040 overhead resistance.While the 20-day EMA is flat, the relative strength index (RSI) has started to turn up and it has risen above 58, indicating that the bulls are attempting to make a comeback.If the buyers can propel the price above the resistance, the BTC/USD pair may retest the all-time high at $58,341. A breakout of this level could start the next leg of the uptrend, which may reach $72,112.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance and breaks below $46,313, the pair may drop to the 50-day simple moving average at $42,861. This level is likely to act as a strong support.If the pair rebounds off this support, the pair may spend a few more days in consolidation. But if the bears sink the price below $41,959.63, traders may rush to the exit, which could signal a possible change in trend.The pair has formed an inverted head and shoulders pattern on the 4-hour chart that will complete on a breakout and close above $52,040. This bullish setup has a pattern target of $61,075.The 20-EMA has started to turn up and the RSI has jumped above 62, indicating a minor advantage to the bulls.This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and breaks below $47,000. Such a move could open the doors for a decline to the next major support at $41,959.After consolidating near $29 for three days, Uniswap (UNI) has broken out of the overhead resistance today. If the bulls can sustain the price above $29, it will enhance the prospects of the resumption of the uptrend.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in overbought territory, which indicates that bulls are in command. If the UNI/USD pair rises above $33, the next level to watch out for is $38 and then $46.This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($25.31). If that happens, the pair may drop to $22 and then to the 50-day SMA ($19.78).The 4-hour chart shows that the bears are likely to defend the $32 overhead resistance aggressively. However, if the bulls do not allow the price to dip below the 20-EMA, it will signal strength. A breakout and close above the $32 to $33 zone may start the next leg of the up-move.This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA. Such a move will suggest that traders are booking profits on rallies. The pair could then drop to the 50-SMA.THETA is in a strong uptrend. Although the altcoin turned down on March 7, the long tail on the March 8 candlestick shows buying at lower levels. Corrections in a strong uptrend generally last for one to three days after which the main trend resumes.The rising moving averages and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest the bulls are in control. If buyers can drive the price above $4.72, the THETA/USD pair may resume the uptrend and rally to $5.73.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the $4.50 to $4.72 overhead resistance zone, the pair may drop to the 20-day EMA ($3.58). A strong rebound off this support will suggest the sentiment remains positive as the bulls are buying the dips.If the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, a deeper correction to the 50-day SMA ($2.82) is possible. Such a move will indicate that the momentum has weakened and may delay the resumption of the up-move.The 4-hour chart shows the 20-EMA is rising and the RSI is in the positive zone. If the bulls can push and sustain the price above the downtrend line, the pair may retest $4.72. A breakout of this resistance could start the next leg of the uptrend.On the other hand, if the price continues to correct, it may find support at the 20-EMA. If that happens, the bulls will again try to propel the price above the downtrend line. However, a break below the 20-EMA may pull the price down to $3.85.VeChain (VET) is currently stuck in a large range between $0.0345 and $0.060774. The price had reached the resistance of the range, but the long wick on today’s candlestick shows profit-booking near $0.060774.However, the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI has also inched higher into the positive territory, suggesting that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the bulls can push and sustain the price above $0.060774, the VET/USD pair may start the next leg of the uptrend.The first target on the upside is $0.087048 and if this level is also crossed, the pair may rise to $0.10.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level, the pair may drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.047). A bounce off this support will suggest that the uptrend remains intact, but a break below it may bring the range-bound action into play.The 4-hour chart shows some profit-booking near $0.060, but the positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to collapse. If the pair rebounds off the 20-EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to thrust the price above the stiff overhead resistance.If they can sustain the price above $0.060774, the next leg of the uptrend could begin. However, if the price dips below the 20-EMA, the selling could intensify and the price may drop to the next support at the 50-SMA.Terra (LUNA) is currently consolidating in a large range between $5 and $8.50 for the past few days. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought territory, indicating the path of least resistance is to the upside.The bulls pushed the price above the range on March 5, but could not build up on the breakout as the price turned down and slipped back below $8.50 on March 6. This suggests that demand dried up at higher levels.However, if the bulls do not give up much ground, it will indicate that traders are waiting to buy the shallow dips. If that happens, the buyers may make one more attempt to start the next leg of the up-move. If they succeed, the LUNA/USD pair could rally to $12.The long wicks on the candlesticks above $8.50 show profit-booking at higher levels and the bulls are currently attempting to defend the 20-EMA. If the price rebounds off the current levels, the buyers will again try to resume the uptrend by driving the pair above the $8.50 to $9 overhead resistance zone.On the contrary, if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-EMA, the pair could dip to the 50-SMA. If the price bounces off this level, the pair may consolidate in the upper half of the range for some time. A drop below the 50-SMA will be a signal that the price may settle into the $5 to $6 range.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

115,"As the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin’s (BTC) effectiveness as a medium of exchange is still a matter for debate. Unlike fiat money that is inherently infinite in supply and must be managed by a central bank, Bitcoin is akin to gold in that it is commodity money with a finite supply of 21 million.However, the supply cap is not the major stumbling block for BTC as a medium of exchange, but rather, the transaction throughput. While Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system capable of facilitating online payments without a central counterparty, seven transactions per second on average is hardly the standard for scalability.Indeed, scalability is only one of three major metrics required for any currency system to succeed as a medium of exchange along with adoption and liquidity. There is an argument to be made of Bitcoin’s growing adoption around the world across several strata of the global economy.Price volatility that has seen Bitcoin peak at $58,000 and then briefly fall below the $30,000 mark within the first two months of 2021 likely indicates lingering issues with liquidity. However, it’s important to note that the current period is being characterized by a bullish advance that began in October 2020. Ultimately, some analysts expect Bitcoin’s volatility to level out as more institutions take up positions in the market.Bitcoin’s scalability problem is even older than the network itself. Indeed, upon first proposing the system back in 2008, James A. Donald replied to Satoshi Nakamoto with: “The way I understand your proposal, it does not seem to scale to the required size.”This astute observation has been at the heart of some of the more contentious and controversial debates within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Disagreements over how to solve the problem have even resulted in multiple hard forks.These days, when Bitcoin critics cannot definitively dismiss BTC’s store of value proposition, scalability seems to be a low-hanging fruit with which to craft some anti-Bitcoin soundbite. Speaking during the 2021 Daily Journal annual shareholders meeting, Berkshire Hathaway vice-chairman Charlie Munger remarked that Bitcoin will never become a global medium of exchange due to its price volatility.The 97-year-old billionaire investor is no stranger to espousing anti-Bitcoin sentiments. Indeed, together with Warren Buffett, the two Berkshire Hathaway chiefs have been responsible for some of the more colorful negative remarks among Bitcoin. From being “rat poison squared” to “trading turds,” Munger once slammed BTC investors for celebrating the life and work of Judas Iscariot.Munger, like Buffett, is among a class of Wall Street Bitcoin critics who have often claimed that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. However, with the price of BTC continuing its relentless upward advance over the past decade while attracting significant institutional interest, detractors now seem to be left with only the scalability argument.Even among mainstream crypto adopters, Bitcoin’s inability to scale at the base protocol level also seems to be a significant issue. In an address during the Future of Money conference back in February, Mastercard executive vice chair Ann Cairns declared that BTC was not suited to its crypto payment plans.According to Cairns: “Bitcoin does not behave like a payment instrument […] It’s too volatile and it takes too long to transact.” As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Mastercard recently announced plans to offer support for cryptocurrency payment on its network.Together with the 10-minute block creation time, the one-megabyte block size acts as the actual transaction throughput constraint for the Bitcoin network. The block size debate of 2017 that ultimately led to the Bitcoin Cash hard fork proved the adamance of Bitcoin purists to the 1MB block size ethos.With the “big blockers” now firmly on their own Bitcoin forks like BCH and Bitcoin SV, the question of how to get BTC to scale without changing a thing on the protocol level still lingers. From Bitcoin banks to sidechain protocols, and even deferred settlement infrastructure layers like the Lightning Network, several developmental projects are currently ongoing to make Bitcoin more suitable for microtransactions like paying for coffee.At a high level, these scaling solutions involve the creation of trustless, centralized (pardon the oxymoron) entities or layer-two networks that maintain lightweight versions of the BTC ledger to handle the actual “coin” transfers without having to maintain the full Bitcoin ledger. These sidechain implementations then transmit the transaction data for final settlement on the actual Bitcoin network.LN is one of the major Bitcoin scaling solutions under active development by several organizations including Blockstream and Elizabeth Stark’s Lightning Labs. The Lightning Network is perhaps the most popular of the “defer-reconcile” scaling implementations that allow users to create payment channels that offer instant coin transfers at minimal fees.According to data from LN data aggregator 1ML, there are over 17,300 public Lightning Network nodes and more than 38,400 channels. LN capacity is currently north of 1,100 BTC.While LN adoption is yet to attain significant heights, layer-two implementation might be about to get a boost with Zap — a Visa-backed Lightning Network payments startup. In February, the company launched Strike — a payments and remittance app that utilizes the Lightning Network for payments.Strike has also partnered with crypto exchange platform Bittrex to deliver LN-powered payments to over 200 countries around the world. The company plans to issue Strike Visa cards to users in the United States as well as in Europe and the United Kingdom before the end of the year.There is a school of thought that argues Bitcoin scalability is only possible via layer-two solutions. Ruben Somsen, Bitcoin developer, crypto podcaster and founder of the Seoul Bitcoin meetup, is one of the proponents of this argument.Somsen is an advocate of Statechains, another layer-two implementation but with a twist — transaction participants send private keys instead of actual unspent transaction output, or UTXO. The process involves loading a Statechain-compatible wallet with the exact BTC sum required for the trade followed by the transfer of the private keys from the sender to the recipient.Since transferring private keys across the blockchain is fee-less and instant, the Statechain idea seems to have gained some traction within the Bitcoin scalability discussion. However, revealing private keys comes with significant security implications.Thus, in recent times, the Statechain concept has been modified to include a third entity that acts as an intermediary between the transacting parties. Detailing the workings of this counterparty federation within the Statechain matrix, Somsen told Cointelegraph:Blockchain infrastructure firm CommerceBlock is one of the companies actively developing Statechains as a viable scalability solution for Bitcoin. The firm is credited with introducing the counterparty federation or “Statechain entity” to improve the security of the system. In a conversation with Cointelegraph, CommerceBlock CEO Nicholas Gregory outlined how Statechains operate:While Statechains is a scalability solution on its own, some proponents agree that the system could integrate with the Lightning Network. With Statechains operating on the UTXO level, it is theoretically possible for another layer-two protocol such as the Lightning Network to be implemented on top of Statechains.Such a hybrid integration could solve the limited node capacity issue of Lightning Network while ensuring the ability to facilitate multiple microtransactions via Statechains. Since the exact transaction amount is loaded into Statechain wallets, it’s impossible to split UTXOs making Statechain in its present iteration unsuitable for microtransactions.According to Somsen, the Statechains can operate independently as well as function together with the Lightning Network: “Statechains complement the Lightning Network perfectly because opening and closing channels can happen off-chain. This removes a lot of the friction that exists in the current Lightning Network design.”For Gregory, integrating Statechains with the Lightning Network is among the future developmental plans for CommerceBlock: “Statechains are instant and do not require liquidity lock up; however, you are sending the private key, so you can’t do small or specific denominations. This is where LN excels.”With these developments and more, the quest for a workable Bitcoin scalability solution is still ongoing. While critics, like Munger, who have been consistently wrong about BTC, continue to drop soundbites, developers are hard at work to solve one of the longest-running operability issues concerning Bitcoin."
116,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) reached over $51,000 on March 7 after the U.S. Senate passed the anticipated $1.9-trillion stimulus bill, which is roughly two times larger than the market capitalization of BTC.United States’ President Joe Biden said that the Senate’s approval shows major progress in delivering a “desperately needed” stimulus bill to Americans. He said:When a stimulus bill gets passed, it immediately relaxes the financial conditions in the U.S. The past year has shown that the effect of such measures raises investors' appetite for risk-on assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies.In April 2020, when the first stimulus bill was passed, it coincided with a massive bull run in both the U.S. equities market and the cryptocurrency market.Naturally, investors anticipate the second stimulus package to have a similar effect on the price of Bitcoin in the short term.Peter Brandt, a long-time trader, said the devaluation of the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar has only started.The combination of a devaluing dollar and the new stimulus package would likely cause the market sentiment around Bitcoin to improve. Brandt wrote:If the U.S. stock market begins to recover after a week-long pullback, it could further catalyze Bitcoin given that equities and cryptocurrencies fell in tandem during the recent correction.Atop the improving macro environment for Bitcoin, the first Chinese listed company called Meitu has officially bought $40 million worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The company stated:“The first Chinese listed company to buy a large amount of Bitcoin appeared,” a popular Chinese journalist by the name of Wu Blockchain commented on March 7. “Photo-retouching software company Meitu announced that it would buy Bitcoin and Ethereum for 40mln$. But its founder was criticized for issuing multiple ICOs in 2017.” He added: If a new trend emerges where public companies in Asia begin to buy Bitcoin, it could lead to an influx of new capital into the Bitcoin exchange market.While it is unlikely that many publicly listed companies in China would announce Bitcoin purchases due to the uncertain regulatory environment, countries like Japan and South Korea could see a similar trend occur in the next few months."
117,"Engaging in the traditional financial markets has become less appealing to consumers and institutional investors as of late. New opportunities are plentiful, with decentralized finance getting a lot of attention. However, that new movement is not without its risks and flaws, either.For decades, consumers and institutional investors have explored the many different options presented to them in the financial world. This approach has worked out rather well, as one could even earn passive revenue on their savings account. Today, things look very different, as many banks charge negative interest rates and continue to exploit their customers.Another problem compounding the lessening appeal of centralized finance is the ongoing impediments in the industry. More specifically, banks are forced to settle lawsuits regularly, mostly due to their wrongdoing. This ranges from opening accounts for clients without their knowledge, masking products under different names while providing the same service, money laundering and so forth.Despite all of this, many people remain loyal to their banks or other financial institutions. Or that used to be the case, as decentralized finance has a lot of people interested today. Unlike traditional finance, DeFi has no exorbitant fees, unfair terms or financial exclusion. Instead, it is a movement that aims to bring financial services to everyone regardless of their current access to these products.While it may seem as if decentralized finance is destined to disrupt traditional finance, there is still a lot of work to be done. In its current state, DeFi primarily caters to users who have sufficient knowledge of the cryptocurrency market. Unfortunately, the crypto industry remains a niche market even today despite prices for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) moving up quickly in the past few months.In fact, there are no viable guides on how to prepare yourself for these new financial opportunities. Every existing guide assumes the reader already knows the ins and outs of cryptocurrency, which is usually not the case.Wading through the complex nature of DeFi requires clear and concise education. There is a rising need for educational platforms that address beginner levels of investing. Publications contributing educational content around DeFi noted significant growth throughout 2020 and early 2021. Educational initiatives have a goal to lower entry barriers to decentralized finance by educating people on cryptocurrency and the opportunities the broader industry provides. Ultimately, a good goal for DeFi would be for 100 million more people to have deposited at least $1 each into decentralized finance by 2025. It may seem like an easy goal, yet convincing millions of people to partake in this industry isn’t easy. Many people remain unconvinced by cryptocurrencies in general, and they will likely feel the same about DeFi.We as an industry need to acknowledge that things need to improve to be taken more seriously by the masses. Making a global impact with complex structures and technologies and requiring the use of cryptocurrencies warrants clear and concise education.A big catalyst for launching more educational initiatives now is the recent r/Wallstreetbets and GameStop saga. People worldwide suddenly found themselves in a position of power to make the financial market dance to their tunes. It depicts the need to make financial markets accessible to everyone, yet the current financial industry doesn’t always allow this to happen. This became apparent when the trading of GameStop stocks was halted by several providers to protect larger investors. It serves as an excellent example of how unfair the financial industry can be.At its core, the financial sector can operate without gatekeepers or centralized intermediaries. The DeFi industry has shown that this is possible, even though the industry is still in its early stages. Creating an environment where anyone can safely borrow, lend and trade directly is possible, but the educational aspect needs to come first.As the public perception of traditional finances keeps taking blows to the chin, it is a matter of time until large groups begin exploring other horizons. Investing in cryptocurrencies has given many a taste of what financial freedom can entail. However, it is crucial to understand that this is only the first step along a long road toward achieving that freedom.There is a lot more to DeFi than just owning Bitcoin, Ether or any other crypto assets. While that does grant one access to decentralized finance, the educational initiatives led by industry leaders will help explain how you can use these assets for more than speculative purposes. Through education, research and guidance, a new era of finance may just be around the corner.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

118,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has failed to break above the psychological $50,000 resistance going into the weekend and has dropped below the $48,000 level on March 6. Now traders are watching whether BTC/USD can break above the $50,000 level to resume the bull cycle. Conversely, a drop below the recent lows below $46,000 will likely open the door to new lower lows, which may then pose a threat to the bull run that has been in place for almost a year, at least in the short to medium term. Pseudonymous trader Rekt Capital pointed out similar price levels to watch. If BTC fails to hold the current levels above $46,000, the trader expects Bitcoin to bottom somewhere in the area between $38,000 and $45,000 despite Bitcoin posting higher lows in recent days. ""BTC higher lows hold until they don't,"" he wrote. ""Each subsequent reaction from the January HL was lesser and lesser. Could be the same now. Better to be safe than sorry by preparing for a potential breakdown from this HL.""#BTC Higher Lows hold

Until they don't

Each subsequent reaction from the January HL was lesser & lesser

Could be the same now

Better to be safe than sorry by preparing for a potential breakdown from this HL

And should this breakdown occur - $BTC will bottom on this retrace pic.twitter.com/VUzgXbVkCXOne major factor that's likely causing the current downward pressure on price is an uptick in whales' activity. Data from CryptoQuant shows an increase in large transactions to exchanges on March 6, though miners' activity remains relatively low. As shown in the chart below, previous upticks in whales moving funds to exchange coincided with drops in Bitcoin price on March 3-4.  As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin is also facing downward pressure from macroeconomic headwinds. A sharp spike in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields and a pullback in tech stocks, in particular, are weighing on cryptocurrency prices as investors flee risk-on assets.Meanwhile, the Dollar currency index, or DXY, has broken through technical resistance, hitting the highest levels since November 2020. Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michael van de Poppe points out that Bitcoin's downtrend remains intact after the latest attempt to break $50,000 failed. ""This means that the trend is still down and overall weakness on the markets in the short term,"" he explained. ""$50,000 is so far a no-go for Bitcoin.""However, Bitcoin, as well as gold, may see some respite soon as the DXY and Treasury yields are nearing their own technical resistance levels.  ""I believe that the yields are getting topped out relatively soon including the DXY,"" explained van de Poppe. ""Both are in resistance areas, which means that we should be close to a top formation on these two, but also on a bottom formation for Bitcoin and gold relatively soon.""He added: "
119,"Thailand currently lays claim to one of the more regulated crypto trading markets in the world, with exchanges having to adhere to strict regulatory standards. For example, at the start of the year, Bitkub, the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, was shut down by regulators after the trading platform faced a series of lengthy service outages. Despite these seemingly stringent conditions, the country’s crypto market has continued to thrive. That being said, a tipping point came recently when Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission released a statement that it plans to enact a 1-million-baht (about $33,000) annual income minimum requirement for crypto investment in the country.The decision was met with immediate backlash from the local investor community — as it would potentially exclude low- and middle-income earners from the cryptocurrency market — so much so that the regulatory body had to clarify its above-stated stance within days of making the announcement.In this regard, the SEC noted that the previous draft document was just a means of gauging investor sentiment, with Ruenvadee Suwanmongkol, secretary-general of the Thai SEC, claiming: “I proposed the criteria that many considered too tough to prompt people to express their opinions on the matter and did not intend to say these are the exact qualifications that will be implemented.”Providing his thoughts on the matter, Pinpraaj Chakkaphak, CEO of local cryptocurrency exchange ERX, told Cointelegraph that the original intention of the SEC was not malicious but one that sought to create a mechanism that could help protect investors from any unwarranted market risks, adding:To gain a better overview of the situation, Cointelegraph spoke with Konstantin Anissimov, executive director at CEX.IO — one of the most widely used crypto exchanges in Thailand. In his opinion, by taking a stance that potentially hampers lower-income families from gaining access to a potentially lucrative investment class, the SEC was going against the very fundamentals of a free-market economy and freedom of choice.However, on the other hand, he did concede that if a majority of the lower-income population did not have any basic financial education and understanding of the risks of such investments, the SEC’s approach may have been the only way to protect the public’s best interests. Anissimov added:Additionally, in a statement shared with Cointelegraph, Akalarp Yimwilai, CEO of a local crypto trading platform Zipmex, pointed out that he sincerely believes that the proposed draft law comes from a place of good intent and that it serves to protect investors by minimizing unnecessary risks.He highlighted that the Thai crypto market is still in its infancy and that regulations around the space have only come into being around three years ago. As a result, the SEC is still looking to craft a legal framework for this asset class that can protect investors from future risks. However, Yimwilai did go on to say:Lastly, he believes that if the current draft was to get implemented, it could potentially lead to a substantial rise in the number of scams, potentially driving investors into an unregulated market where they could run into uncharted territory. Not only that, it could also lead to a lot of much-needed capital flowing out of Thailand, resulting in the long-term detriment to the country’s development and finances.The Thai digital assets industry has grown significantly during recent months. According to the country’s SEC, the number of cryptocurrency trading accounts within the county has risen from 160,000 at the end of 2020 to 470,000 on Feb. 1. Not only that, approximately 50% of these accounts are owned by investors younger than 30 years of age.Furthermore, Chakkaphak pointed out that crypto trading volumes in November 2020 lay at 18.44 Billion THB, compared to 100.90 billion in February 2021, thus showcasing a staggering increase of 447.18% within a matter of just three months. He went on to add:Also, according to Yimwilai, Zipmex traded $1 billion in 2020 in Thailand, with the figure expected to grow exponentially in 2021. Not only that, but the cryptocurrency exchange was also able to raise $6 million in fresh funding from U.S.-based VC firm Jump Capital.He further highlighted that the assets under the company’s management are currently valued at around $100 million, which seems to back up the notion that the Thai masses are ready to dive head first into the burgeoning crypto sector.Though for now, the SEC seems to be backtracking on its initial outline for market entry requirements. According to the Suwanmongkol, people who are putting their hard-earned money into cryptocurrencies are mostly new investors who may not be fully aware of the risks that come with investing in high-risk, highly volatile assets. “If the SEC just stands by and does nothing, it would be totally our responsibility if investors lose on cryptocurrency,” she added.Lastly, the SEC reportedly had a dinner talk with representatives from local digital exchanges recently, suggesting that the government agency may still be looking to consult prominent members from within the space. The final hearing, regarding the matter, will take place on March 24 before the survey finally closes on March 27."
120,"Bitcoin’s price has declined in recent days. While it has rebounded from its weekly lows, the asset's trajectory remains uncertain says CryptoWendyO, a crypto trader on Twitter.  “The daily timeframe is not looking great as we are having trouble sustaining $50K,” she told Cointelegraph on Friday. “I am feeling like we will get a run to $51.6[K].”She added:After hitting record highs of approximately $58,360 in February, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped down to roughly $43,015 in subsequent days, based on TradingView data. The asset then rebounded up to about $52,660, before continuing its downward price action below $50,000. Bitcoin is trading at roughly $49,020 at time of publication.Cheds, a trader on Twitter holding his CMT level I certification, expects “more consolidation from BTC above that key 42k level,” he told Cointelegraph on Friday. He also tweeted a chart of his range expectations.“The big question is if the recent 27% correction is enough to bring us to a new high,” Cheds said. “In the meantime we will watch a tightening range on the daily of lower highs and higher lows.”A number of technology stocks have also suffered price decline recently."
121,"Analysts expect the U.S. economy to stage a strong recovery in the second half of this year as coronavirus vaccines are distributed and economic activity begins to increase. As growth picks up, inflation concerns are also on the rise. Speculation is rife that the U.S. Federal Reserve may have to adjust its dovish stance to hold down interest rates. In anticipation, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has jumped from about 1% at the start of the year to 1.626%. This has resulted in profit-booking in assets considered as risky and as equities pullback, a temporary pause may be put on Bitcoin’s (BTC) rally.The drop in investor sentiment has also hurt the stock prices of MicroStrategy and Tesla who have each invested in Bitcoin recently. MicroStrategy’s stock price has plunged by over 50% from its all-time high at $1,315, even though the price of Bitcoin is currently only down about 20% from its all-time high.Tesla, which had announced a $1.5 billion Bitcoin position on Feb. 8 has also seen its stock price plummet by over 34%. To stem the decline, longtime Tesla analyst Gary Black has suggested the electric car maker dump its Bitcoin holdings and instead use the proceeds for a stock buyback.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot the critical support levels where buyers may step in and arrest the current decline.Bitcoin turned down from the $52,040.95 overhead resistance on March 04, which suggests that traders are lightening up their positions at higher levels. The selling has continued and the price has dipped below the 20-day exponential moving average ($48,087).If the bears can sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, the BTC/USD pair could now drop to the critical support at $41,959.63 where buyers are likely to step in.If the price rebounds off this support, the pair could trade between $41,959.63 and $52,040.95 for a few more days.The flat 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint also suggest a few days of range-bound action.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the current levels and rises above $52,040.95, it will open the doors for a rally to the all-time high.On the other hand, if the bears sink and sustain the price below $41,959.63, the pair could drop to $37,000 and then to $28,050.Ether’s (ETH) relief rally from $1,289.09 on Feb. 28 hit a wall at the 20-day EMA ($1,593) on March 3. The moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover and the RSI is in the negative zone, indicating a possible change in trend.If bears sink the price below $1,289, the selling could intensify and the ETH/USD pair could drop to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,220 and then to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,026.Another possibility is that the pair rebounds off $1,289 and stays range-bound for a few more days. A breakout and close above $1,670 could result in a retest of the all-time high at $2,040.The bulls are currently attempting to arrest the pullback at the 20-day EMA ($1.07). This suggests that the sentiment remains positive and the bulls are viewing the dips in Cardano (ADA) as a buying opportunity.The buyers will now try to push the price above $1.23. If they succeed, the ADA/USD pair may rally to $1.35 and then to the all-time high at $1.4852896.However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. The negative divergence on the RSI shows that the momentum is weakening.If the current rebound fails to sustain, the bears will once again try to sink the price below the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the pair could drop to $0.80 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($0.72).The relief rally in Binance Coin (BNB) turned down from the overhead resistance at $265 on March 2. This suggests that traders may be using the rallies to close their long positions. The price has again dropped to the 20-day EMA ($211).If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will once again try to drive the price above $265. If they manage to do that, the BNB/USD pair could start its journey to the all-time high at $348.6969.But the 20-day EMA is gradually flattening out and the RSI continues to weaken. This points to possible range-bound action in the short term. The pair could consolidate between $189 and $265 for a few days.A break and close below the $189 support could result in panic selling that can pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($126).Polkadot (DOT) turned down from $38.68 on March 3, which suggests that traders may have booked profits during the relief rally. The altcoin has dropped to the 20-day EMA ($32.49) and the buyers are now attempting to defend this support.A strong bounce off the current levels will suggest that the sentiment remains bullish and traders are buying on dips. If the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, the DOT/USD pair may retest the all-time high at $42.2848.On the contrary, if the price breaks and sustains below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the supply has exceeded demand. In such a case, the pair may extend its decline to the 50-day SMA ($24.89).XRP broke above the 20-day EMA ($0.467) on March 4, but the bulls could not maintain the momentum and thrust the price above the $0.50 overhead resistance. This attracted profit booking and the price has broken below the 20-day EMA today.The XRP/USD pair could now drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.42) and then to $0.359. The flat 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a range-bound action for the next few days. The price may remain stuck between $0.359 and $0.50.A trending move could start if the bulls push the price above $0.50. That could result in a rally to $0.65. On the other hand, a break below $0.359 may sink the price to $0.25.Uniswap (UNI) is in an uptrend and the bulls have been buying the dip to the 20-day EMA ($24.05). The bulls tried to push and sustain the price above $29 on March 4 but the higher levels attracted profit-booking.The bears will now try to pull the price down to the 20-day EMA. If the UNI/USD pair again rebounds off this support, it will suggest that traders continue to buy the dips. The bulls will then try to push and close the price above $29. If they succeed, the pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $38.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair could drop to $20. Such a move may result in a consolidation between $20 and $29. The trend will turn negative on a break below the 50-day SMA ($18.85).Litecoin (LTC) broke and closed above the $185.58 resistance on March 3, but the bulls could not build upon this strength as the price turned down and dipped back below the 20-day EMA ($184.43) on March 4.The bulls are currently attempting to defend the 50-day SMA ($169.29) as seen from the long tail on today’s candlestick. If the rebound sustains, the bulls will again try to push the price above the $185.58 to $196.30 overhead resistance zone. If they succeed, the LTC/USD pair could rally to $205 and then to $240.However, the flat moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a possible range formation. The pair could trade between $152 on the downside and $205 on the upside. A break above or below the range could start the next trending move.Chainlink’s (LINK) relief rally turned down from $31.43 on March 3, which shows that traders are booking profits at higher levels. The altcoin has dipped to the 50-day SMA ($26.29) but the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests the bulls are trying to defend this support.Buying on dips and selling rallies usually results in a range-bound action. The flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint also suggest a balance between supply and demand. The LINK/USD pair could now consolidate between $24 and $32 for a few days.A breakout of the range may result in a rally to $34 and a retest of the all-time high at $36.93. Conversely, a break below $24 could pull the price down to the critical support at $20.11.The bounce from the uptrend line stalled at the 20-day EMA ($537) on March 3, which shows the traders are selling on rallies. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has again dipped to the uptrend line. The repeated retest of the support at short intervals tends to weaken it.The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative territory suggest that bears are in control. A break below the uptrend line could sink the BCH/USD pair to $432.02 and then to the critical support at $370.This negative view will invalidate if the price rises from the current levels and rises above $539. Such a move will suggest aggressive buying at lower levels. The pair could then rally to $631.71.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

122,"Does Bitcoin meet the definition of a Ponzi scheme? This is the subject of the latest Cointelegraph Crypto Duel, where Bitcoin strategist at Kraken meets professor of computer science at the University of Campinas, Jorge Stolfi.Similar to other Bitcoin skeptics, Stolfi repeatedly defined Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme. The core of his argument is that Bitcoin doesn’t produce any cash flows and the money with which Bitcoin investors are paid comes exclusively from new investors buying Bitcoin.“Every time you invest in Bitcoin, the money that you invest goes to the previous investors or to the miners and disappears”, Stolfi said.Responding to Stolfi’s argument, Rochard pointed out that Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer cash system and, like other forms of money, it is not supposed to produce a cash flow.“It's just a general property of money because it is cash. So it doesn't have cash flows and that doesn't make it a Ponzi scheme.”, Rochard said.Rochard also pointed out that Bitcoin is different from Ponzi schemes in that it does not guarantee fixed returns, and is well known to be a highly risky asset.“Bitcoin's promoters repeatedly emphasize that there is a risk of loss and that if we look at the empirical data, this risk has repeatedly been realized”, said Rochard. “That's not how Ponzi schemes work”, he added.Stolfi, however, is convinced that effective Ponzi schemes do not promise return since that would be ""a dead giveaway."" ""The S.E.C. would come knocking at your door the next day”, he argued.As an example, the computer scientist mentioned the notorious Madoff’s Ponzi scheme, which defrauded thousands of investors for $65 billion. “He didn't promise anything. [...] The reason why people invested in it is that he was paying everybody who wanted to cash out”.Pick your side and watch the full debate on Cointelegraph's Youtube channel!"
123,"Bitcoin (BTC) continues to struggle below $50,000 on March 5 as a spike in the 10-year Treasury yield to 1.62%, its highest level in over a year, has taken a toll on global financial markets and hit risk-assets especially hard. At the time of writing the S&P 500 and Dow are up 0.46% and 0.64% but the tech sector sell off continues as companies like Apple and Tesla continue to slump further. Economists see rising bond yields as the result of improvements in the economy thanks to the Covid-19 vaccine rollout and the expectation that economic activity will ramp up as the rate of coronavirus infections drop. The rise in yields has led some to speculate that the Federal Reserve may institute yield curve control or take a more hawkish stance, but so far the central bank has refrained from altering its current plans. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that Bitcoin bulls attempted to stage a rally during early trading hours on Friday, pushing the price up 5.25% from a low of $46,280 to an intraday high of $48,725. The $50,000 level has yet to be reclaimed as a firm support and traders are still looking for a daily close above $52,000 to confirm that bullish momentum has been restored.Despite this week's pullback, optimism among investors remains high following February's record-breaking month which saw Bitcoin reach a total market cap of $1 trillion and a new all-time high at $58,532. Ether (ETH) price has also been consolidating for the past two weeks after hitting a new high at $2,033 on put in a record high of $2,033 on Feb. 20.After strong parabolic rallies, a cooling-off period of range-bound trading and lower support retests is customary and from a technical point of view, Bitcoin and Etheruem are in a consolidation phase.2021 has seen Bitcoin put on its best yearly start since 2013, but historical data shows BTC price tends to struggle from mid-February to the end of March. A recent report from Delphi Digital highlighted this trend, which has also been applicable to Ether since 2018.According to analysts at Delphi Digital, Bitcoin's volatility also increases in March, meaning that moving forward 20% price drawdowns should not come as an unexpected surprise.Despite the most recent corrections below $50,000, Delphi Digital's overall outlook remains optimistic and the analysts said there is “nothing in the data or charts giving us reason to believe the peak for BTC this cycle is behind us.”The report said:The analysts also suggested that Bitcoin could possibly overtake gold in the future as the precious metal’s 9.8% decline year-to-date has been its worst in more than 30 years.This is possibly due to a divergence in fund flows between Bitcoin investment products and the world’s largest gold ETFs that has emerged in recent months and Delphi Digital hinted that the longer gold underperforms, “the more attention BTC is likely to garner.”While Bitcoin and most major altcoins are in the red today, there are a few notable standouts for the week.  Theta (THETA), a blockchain-powered video streaming platform, saw its price surge to a new record high of $4.50 on March 4. SwissBorg (CHSB) price also rallied 13.04% to establish a new high at $1.16.Ether experienced a 6.24% pullback earlier today, dropping to $1,481 and Polkadot (DOT) has been the hardest hit project in the top 10, down 10% and trading at $32.42.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.44 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 60.7%.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

124,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s floor is littered with failed crypto fund filings, but this year, following Canada’s lead, the U.S. might actually have an exchange-traded fund that tracks digital assets. After all, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) is booming, the SEC has a new crypto-savvy chairman, and Canada, which is sometimes viewed as a beta test site by U.S. regulators, debuted a Bitcoin ETF in late February that by most accounts has been stunningly popular. But does a crypto ETF really matter anymore?Clearly, a lot has changed in the past year — what with a global pandemic, a change in administrations in Washington and new price records being set regularly on the crypto front. Whereas many predicted as recently as June 2020 that an SEC-sanctioned Bitcoin ETF would be a very “BIG Deal” and “open the flood gates” to BTC adoption, with a crypto ETF now on the brink, some observers aren’t so sure anymore.“I used to think it would be a game-changer but now I think it would be just another step in the evolution of crypto,” Lee Reiners, executive director of the Global Financial Markets Center at Duke University School of Law, told Cointelegraph.Eric Ervin, CEO of Blockforce Capital and Reality Shares and co-founder of Onramp Invest, told Cointelegraph: “I think a crypto ETF is less significant than we thought before because a lot of institutional investors finally got tired of waiting and figured it out.” Ervin’s firm was one of nearly a dozen whose application was sideswiped by the SEC — the Reality Shares ETF Trust application was pulled in February 2019 “on SEC advice.” That said, Ervin acknowledged that there “are still a massive number of investors on the sidelines” who might welcome such an investment option.Meanwhile, applications to the U.S. agency keep flowing. Most recently, the Chicago Board Options Exchange requested permission to list a Bitcoin ETF proposed by asset manager VanEck.State Street Corporation — one of the world’s largest custodians, with $38.8 trillion in assets under custody and/or administration — will be servicing the VanEck ETF, if approved. Nadine Chakar, head of State Street Global Markets, told Cointelegraph that the company is working to bring ETFs and exchange-traded notes to market in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, adding that “Our clients have seen interest grow in Bitcoin and [...] there is a feeling the market is maturing.” Indeed, in the three years since early 2018 when Bitcoin interest last peaked:Has the crypto ETF climate really changed in Washington though? Michael Venuto, co‑founder and chief investment officer of Toroso Investments, told Cointelegraph: “I believe the odds of a U.S. Bitcoin ETF being approved are higher than in previous years.” Improved crypto custody, reporting and transaction transparency have calmed many regulators’ concerns, he said, and “The fact that BNY Mellon announced its move towards crypto custody on the same day as a Bitcoin ETF was approved in Canada is not a coincidence.”“Investors have been looking to the US as the next potential market for ETFs that track digital assets,” wrote FTSE Russell, a subsidiary of London Stock Exchange Group that produces stock market indices, in a recent blog post, adding: “And speculation has only increased in recent weeks with the first Bitcoin ETF launch in Canada joining crypto ETP listings in Germany and Switzerland, as well as the continued popularity of the Grayscale investment trusts tracking this market.”Regarding Gary Gensler’s nomination as SEC chairman, “This goes a long way towards advancing innovation in the US financial markets,” added Ervin, who agreed that the likelihood that U.S. regulators will approve a Bitcoin ETF this year has improved. He added further:Reiners observed that based on what the SEC had been saying recently ETFwise — which isn’t much — a U.S. crypto ETF seems to be no closer than a year ago. However, when taking a broader look at the maturation of the crypto market and the subsequent institutional interest, he believes “It’s getting harder for the SEC to continue to say no.”But would an SEC-sanctioned ETF really be of major consequence now? What, for instance, does an ETF offer Bitcoin investors that current “trusts” like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust don’t?GBTC and other trusts trade over the counter, not on major exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange, noted Reiners. By comparison, “An ETF is widely accessible to all,” including retail investors without access to OTC markets.State Street’s Chakar noted that GBTC is essentially a closed-end fund open to qualified investors, and although shares of the trust are available on the secondary market to retail investors, those shares “are not tied directly to the price of Bitcoin. As such shares most times trade at a premium — or a discount — to the underlying price of Bitcoin.”Venuto added further: “The ETF structure provides for intra-day creation and redemption to meet demand. This function removes the premium and discount issues which have impacted the pricing of GBTC” — though he opined that if regulators were to approve a Bitcoin ETF, “Then in short order they would allow GBTC to convert to a similar ETF like structure.”Along these lines, Canada-based investment manager Ninepoint Partners, which launched a Bitcoin trust two months ago, this week announced plans to convert its trust to an ETF on the Toronto Stock Exchange — following other Canadian investment firms seeking to capitalize on the untapped crypto ETF market in the country.If a U.S. crypto ETF comes to pass, how would it play out? Would it bring in more institutional investors, for example? “Many institutions can only invest in funds, so the ETF is a wonderful step in the right direction,” Ervin said.Institutional interest will continue to build regardless of an ETF, opined Venuto: “In terms of institutional adoption, that ship has sailed. [...] An ETF will be primarily used by individual investors and financial advisors.”“An ETF is more attractive to both institutions and retail investors in that it does tend to carry much less liquidity risk and more transparency to the underlying price of the asset — and fees associated with it,” said Chakar.But what about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption in general? Would a U.S. crypto ETF transform that landscape? Reiners told Cointelegraph:Regarding Tesla, MicroStrategy and other public companies that have purchased Bitcoin recently, Chakar told Cointelegraph that “Investing in a company that has publicly acknowledged that it’s buying Bitcoin is probably not what most institutional [investors] would do to gain exposure to the asset.”She added that crypto has been around for 10-plus years now, “But it has never been packaged in a way that allows for integration into a portfolio that is seamless.” By comparison, “ETFs have proven themselves to be a preferred and growing investment alternative thanks to the fact they offer a lower cost, liquidity and tax efficiency that direct investments may not, especially in nascent vehicles like Bitcoin.” Ervin told Cointelegraph that he likes the idea of an ETF for things like gold or silver, but for him, “Wrapping bitcoin up into a fund seems silly to me.” He added:All in all, it looks like a U.S. crypto ETF will eventually come. As Reiners noted: “Regardless of their [the SEC’s] view on the merits of an ETF, if they are the lone holdouts, you have to wonder how much longer before they cave to the immense pressure and interest for an ETF.”Under present circumstances, a U.S. government-approved Bitcoin exchange-traded fund may not be the game changer that some once predicted. A year ago, most didn’t anticipate the current institutional absorption of digital assets.As Macrae Sykes, portfolio manager and research analyst at Gabelli Funds — an investment management firm — told Cointelegraph, institutional interest in cryptocurrency continues to grow. Coinbase’s initial public offering filing and Bank of New York Mellon’s recent announcement that it will support digital currencies offer further evidence of potential growing demand: “The ETF approval in Canada is just another step in the evolving regulatory process for accessing digital assets.”“Bitcoin doesn’t need an ETF,” Venuto told Cointelegraph. Still, even if no longer a game changer, there is little for a crypto enthusiast not to like about an SEC-sanctioned crypto ETF: “Access is access and the more access to the asset class, the better,” said Ervin. After all, “Not everyone wants to own bitcoin directly.”"
125,"The Bitcoin (BTC) price correction isn’t just hurting individual hodlers — the biggest players are suffering in more ways than one.Data from markets on March 5 revealed that MicroStrategy, which owns over 91,000 BTC, has seen its stock price dive by more than half in just three weeks.On the day that the company confirmed that it had added another 210 BTC to its reserves at a cost of $10 million, MicroStrategy’s stock hit local lows of $628. At its peak in February, MSTR traded at just over $1,300.The volatility is a commentary on the ups and downs of Bitcoin in its latest bull run, which has been characterized by wild swings in both directions.Since beginning to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet in August last year, however, the overall impact on MSTR remains transformative. Prior to the move, it barely traded above $100.“They now hold 91,064 bitcoin on their balance sheet,” Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano commented on the latest buy.That “conviction” may serve the company well far beyond the short term as Bitcoin’s bull cycle is being challenged by macroeconomic headwinds. For Arthur Hayes, former CEO of derivatives giant BitMEX, central bank policy could, in extreme circumstances, cause capital to drain from cryptocurrency altogether. The reason, he explained in a new blog post this week, is that the Federal Reserve could choose to hike rates, causing pain for investors across the board, but also see periods of record low rates, creating a swell of volatility.“I do not have a model for an estimate of the ratio between the two, but at a high level if global fiat liquidity can earn a real return again in government bonds, it will exit Bitcoin / crypto,” he wrote.Should such an event occur in the future, Bitcoin would be more dependent on its technological premise, something which Hayes believes will be decidedly underwhelming without the big money on board.“The amount of remaining technological value is beyond my skills to estimate,” he warned.To counteract the risk, investors should take advantage of both cryptocurrency’s unparalleled potential and future rate volatility."
126,"Analysis of Bitcoin (BTC) price action dating back to 2011 suggests the coin price could next top out somewhere between $75,000 and $306,000, research from Kraken shows.Based on one reading of a logarithmic growth curve that connects historical tops and bottoms, a coin price of $75,000 would signal Bitcoin’s entry into overbought territory, marking the end of its current bull run.“Based on previous cycles, Bitcoin could likely continue appreciating gradually in price before ultimately going parabolic and hitting resistance, which will signal the end of its fourth bull market cycle,” the report states.Analysis of historical price retracements throws up some even bolder predictions. All things being equal, if BTC were to continue along its current growth curve and then enter a retracement similar to prior market crashes, the next bottom would be somewhere around $30,000.Based on this proposed bottom one can attempt to make predictions about the next market peak, depending on the extent of the retracement.Were Bitcoin to retrace 70% during the current cycle, the coin price would have to reach a peak of $102,000 in order to hit the aforementioned bottom of $30,000.Similarly, a 90% crash would place the next top at $306,000, while an 86% drop — the average retracement of previous market cycles — would imply an upcoming market peak of $221,000. Either way, states the report, history would suggest Bitcoin remains “far and away” from a market top.Diving into the historical data once more, the first quarter of 2021 proved to be the third-best performing quarter in Bitcoin’s 12-year existence, based on return percentage and annualized volatility.Kraken’s research shows that March has historically been a bad month for Bitcoin, with the coin price appreciating just twice during this period since it began trading. In the past, March has, on average, underperformed February’s growth by 11%.The report also notes that Bitcoin is now trending in a manner similar to the first quarter of 2013 — the most fruitful Q1 in the coin’s history. A correlation of 0.82 between the two is an encouraging sign and could subvert the historic trend which sees Bitcoin underperform in March.Bitcoin recorded five consecutive months of positive returns leading up to the time of publication. That’s a sight witnessed just once before — in 2017 during the lead up to that year’s bull run and subsequent market peak."
127,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is extending its slump below $49,000 on March 5 as the U.S. dollar index (DXY) reached the highest levels since November 2020.  Meanwhile, the prospect of rising rates and a potential stock market top is putting downward pressure on equities and Bitcoin, causing the entire cryptocurrency market to pull back.Bitcoin and risk-on assets, in general, have been heavily affected by rising 10-year treasury yield rates in the U.S. As a result, the global macro landscape has worsened.Kyle Davies, the CEO at Three Arrows Capital, said:The U.S. stock market, particularly the S&P500 index, has already erased all of its gains from 2021, according to Bloomberg.If the risk-on market continues to correct or consolidate, it would likely have a negative effect on the price of Bitcoin in the near term.Scott Melker, a cryptocurrency trader, said Bitcoin likely falls into a range. There is significant selling pressure and lots of buyer demand, placing it in a tight range. He said:In the foreseeable future, if the bond yield curve does not ease, the threat against the short-term trend of the Bitcoin price would likely remain.Continued steepening … as of yesterday, 2s10s yield curve reached highest since 2015 pic.twitter.com/XSgXIcb52mHigh Stakes Capital, one of the top traders on FTX, said that he remains full spot long, however. Although Bitcoin's outlook remains seemingly bearish, he said that the accumulation on Coinbase Pro is ongoing.In the past week, outflows from Coinbase Pro have continued to increase. This trend indicates that the institutional accumulation of Bitcoin is continuing in the U.S. The trader said:Despite the stagnant market structure, various fundamental metrics and on-chain indicators suggest that BTC/USD is on a bullish trajectory as Bitcoin is up roughly 100% year-to-date unlike stocks, which have erased their 2021 gains.If institutions accumulate Bitcoin, especially in the U.S., it decreases the probability of BTC plunging below key support levels, such as $30,000 and $40,000.Unlike previous bull cycles, massive 30% to 40% drops may occur less during this ongoing bull cycle. In the near term, the $52,000 resistance level remains key to more upside. If BTC breaks past it, it would signal a resumption in the bullish market structure, making another broad rally likely."
128,"MicroStrategy, a software company that’s been making headlines for its aggressive Bitcoin purchases, has made another $10 million purchase after Thursday’s market uncertainty.As announced by CEO Michael Saylor, the company purchased another 205 BTC at an average price of $48,888, spending $10 million in cash to do so. This puts the company’s total Bitcoin holdings at 91,064 BTC worth $4.3 billion. The total cost basis of the BTC is $2,196 billion with an average purchase price of $24,119.MicroStrategy’s latest Bitcoin purchase is one of its many “symbolic” buys where the company puts a few more million in BTC after every dip. While the software company began putting its existing assets into BTC in 2020, back when Bitcoin traded around $10,000, its latest purchases have yet to break even.The latest major purchase, funded by a bond offering of $900 million, was done at an average price of $52,700 per BTC. Bitcoin’s price has wavered ever since amid a worsening outlook for risk assets on Wall Street.Thursday’s buy coincided with a period of heightened tension on markets, as Fed chair Jerome Powell signaled that bankers do not think current conditions require additional intervention. Bond yields have been on a steady and powerful rise in the past weeks, which traditionally signals recovery from a recession and heightened inflation expectations. This should normally reflect well on stocks and risk assets, but the narrative behind 2020’s unstoppable rise strongly relied on low bond yields and continuous Fed intervention as justification for heightened valuations.Wall Street tension seems to be having some effect on Bitcoin, though MicroStrategy seems keen to continue on its previous path. Thursday’s purchase is largely symbolic, but the more important indicator is that MicroStrategy did not sell, despite its stock price having fallen 50% since February highs."
129,"Cipher Mining Technologies Inc. a subsidiary of blockchain development firm Bitfury has inked a $2 billion merger deal with Nasdaq-listed Good Works Acquisition Corp — a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. Both companies have entered into a business combination agreement.According to a press release issued on Friday the merger will see Bitfury’s U.S. Bitcoin (BTC) mining enterprise become a publicly-listed company under the banner Cipher Mining Inc.In addition to the combined $2 billion valuation for Cipher, investors like Morgan Stanley-backed Counterpoint Group and Fidelity Management and Research company will also lead a $425 million funding round.This additional cash influx will proceed via a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, funding round. Bitfury will also provide a $50 million investment-in-kind to add to the $170 million left over from the October 2020 Good Works initial public offering, thus setting the combined company’s gross cash holdings at $595 million.Commenting on the merger, Cipher Mining CEO Tyler Page remarked that the deal was a significant step in the emergence of properly capitalized Bitcoin mining enterprises, adding:With the merger expected to close in Q2 2021, Cipher is looking to achieve a 745 megawatts mining capacity by end of 2025. The company says it hopes to cross the 445 MW milestone between the end of 2021 and Q2 2022.Cipher is the latest Bitcoin mining establishment to pursue a public listing albeit via a merger with a SPAC entity. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Australian green energy Bitcoin mining outfit Iris Energy is set for a $39 million IPO in the summer.With designs towards 745 MW in mining capacity, Cipher is also the latest example of the expanding Bitcoin mining outlay in North America. While China still dominates the BTC hash rate distribution, firms in the U.S. and Canada are reportedly increasing their inventory in the quest to dilute China’s control of the Bitcoin mining arena.Meanwhile, Chinese miners are coming under significant regulatory pressure from municipal authorities. Earlier in March, reports emerged of crypto miners planning to exit Inner Mongolia amid energy consumption concerns."
130,"Singapore-based cryptocurrency derivatives exchange Bybit announced on Friday that it would be suspending services for its customers n the United Kingdom. Bybit offers a range of high-end trading products for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC) and more.The move follows a blanket ban on all retail cryptocurrency derivatives trading by the Financial Conduct Authority, and U.K. customers will be given until March 31 to close out positions and withdraw their funds from the platform, a company announcement stated.The post also affirmed the company’s intention to continue dialogue with regulators in the hope of opening up shop in the U.K. once more.“We request your immediate cooperation in this matter. We regret this situation, and will seek dialogue with regulators to explore options. We hope to be able to earn the privilege to serve you again in the future,"" stated the announcement.Going forward, new sign-ups to the exchange using U.K.-based mobile phone numbers or IP addresses will be rejected automatically.In October 2020, the FCA issued an announcement declaring that all retail cryptocurrency derivatives trading, encompassing products such as options, futures and exchange-traded notes, would be banned. The ban went into effect in early January 2021.Remarkably, the FCA’s decision to ban these products flew in the face of feedback received from industry consultants. The FCA canvassed the opinions of trade bodies, national authorities, exchanges and legal representatives, with 97% of respondents arguing against the prospect of a ban."
131,"After a tumultuous 2020 that continued into Bitcoin (BTC) setting new all-time highs in 2021, Bitcoin miners are facing a bittersweet scenario — profits have skyrocketed, but multiple issues prevent them from buying more devices and boosting Bitcoin’s hash rate.According to the founder of major mining pool BTC.Top, Jiang Zhuoer, global electronics supply chain issues are having their effect on the mining industry as well. Speaking with Cointelegraph, he said:Recently, car manufacturing giant General Motors shut down some of its plants due to the inability to source chips. Other carmakers have seen similar shutdowns in recent months as well.The shortage of mining devices can be easily seen in Bitcoin’s hash rate. Since the halving in May 2020, Bitcoin’s hash rate has increased from about 92 million terahashes per second to its current reading of 166 million, an 80% increase. Bitcoin’s price, on the other hand, increased from $9,000 to over $46,000, a gain of over 400%.Bitcoin’s hash rate has a relatively straightforward correlation with price. Barring new technological advances, increases in price should be closely mirrored by increases in hash rate. While the rate of new devices coming online should lag behind the price in bull markets, the hash rate has remained relatively stagnant in the past few months.This means that current miners are seeing much higher revenue for individual devices, which, added to the shortage, results in inflated unit prices for ASIC miners. According to ASICMinerValue, obtaining a Bitmain S19 Pro right now costs about $9,000, while its official price is less than $4,000.According to Jiang, the mining industry also saw major issues in 2020 due to Bitmain’s internal power struggle. “The indefinite delay of the Ant mining machine S19 in June, July and August 2020 caused us a lot of difficulties. We underwrote our customers according to the shipment period and used our own machines to make up the revenue to our customers,” Jiang said. With the Bitmain saga being resolved in favor of Micree Zhan, there should be no more specific issues with purchasing the company’s miners.Despite the variety of issues, 2020 was also a pivotal year for the Bitcoin mining industry due to the release of new-generation ASIC devices with improved energy efficiency. The industry leaders were the Bitmain Antminer S19 Pro and MicroBT Whatsminer M30S+ series. Publicly listed manufacturer Canaan also released new miners such as the AvalonMiner 1166 Pro and the liquid-cooled A1066I unit.The new miners offered significant efficiency gains, primarily due to their more advanced chip lithography. The S19 Pro uses 7-nanometer chips, while the M30S+ uses 8-nm lithography. The measurement indicates the distance between two ends of a transistor on a chip — at these values, it is just a dozen atoms wide. Lowering the distance helps increase computing performance and reduce power consumption.Jiang explained that the Bitcoin mining industry is currently experimenting with TSMC’s 5-nm process, while the chip manufacturer is already researching 3-nm lithography. A reduction from 5 to 3 nm would be a major achievement for the computing industry, as it would allow to pack roughly 60% more transistors in the same chip. But according to Jiang, the latest advancements in chip technology are hitting some fundamental physical limits:The practical result is that newer chips will have better computing performance but are unlikely to carry as strong improvements in energy efficiency, Jiang said. “Bitcoin mining actually does not require high computing; it requires a better power efficiency — that is, the less power you consume with the same hash power, the better,” he added.Other types of performance improvements like liquid cooling can be useful but do not radically alter the miner’s efficiency. Jiang explained:The vastly inflated revenue for miners comes as the global electronics industry is under intense pressure. Normally, new devices would quickly fill the gap and bring down the average revenue to mean values. The current chip shortages mean that this outcome may take longer than usual to occur, but existing devices are still being sold at a significant-enough premium to make prospective buyers consider their actions twice. For example, the S19 Pro currently has a return-on-investment period of eight months based on the electricity price of $0.04 per kilowatt-hour. However, if its revenue were to collapse to the still-high levels of December 2020, the miner would need to work for up to 40 months to pay itself back.In the three years that the miner could potentially require to turn a profit, new devices could make the S19 partially obsolete, prolonging the payback period even further. Still, according to Jiang, the mining industry could be heading for consolidation around state-of-the-art devices, with only marginal improvements over previous generations. This would improve the lifetime expectation for mining devices, ensuring the stability of any investment made now or in the future. ASICs have already stabilized to a significant extent, as the five-year-old Bitmain S9, for example, only became completely unprofitable after the 2020 halving but is now once again generating a reasonable profit of $3 per day, assuming electricity prices of $0.04 kWh.“Unless you buy a very expensive mine at the peak of the bull market, it’s hard not to make profits,” Jiang concluded.Jiang believes that the economics of mining makes it a superior method to acquire Bitcoin and hold it through the entirety of a rally. According to him, most Bitcoin miners kept their BTC all the way to $20,000 in 2017, while regular holders had a much lower chance of holding through to the top.Jiang didn’t wish to elaborate on the data source of this conviction, which goes against the general wisdom that miners immediately sell the Bitcoin they mine. An analysis by Coinmetrics shows a nuanced picture: Miners hold a very significant portion of the Bitcoin supply, most of which was acquired in the early years of its existence. Partially confirming Jiang’s thesis, during the 2017 bull market, the miners seem to have accelerated their selling only around October, closely timing the top at the time.A sizable increase in the miners’ Bitcoin holdings can be observed toward the end of 2019, suggesting that they began holding a larger proportion of their proceeds. Still, the relative prevalence of miner holdings has been on a steady decline throughout Bitcoin’s history, indicating that most of the BTC they mine ends up sold on the wider market.According to Jiang, though, miners can be less influenced by loss aversion: the natural human tendency of avoiding more profitable outcomes if they also carry higher risk.He explained that the mechanics of mining make it psychologically easier to hold through volatile markets:The case for acquiring Bitcoin exposure through mining remains nuanced. In most cases, breaking even on the investment requires waiting for a year or more, depending on the initial entry point. Compared to buying Bitcoin outright, miners may lose out on major price gains immediately after, but this is compensated by higher resilience during market downturns. The mining device can pay itself off even if the price of Bitcoin takes exceedingly long to return to its previous highs.Being a successful miner is similar to running a business. After an initial setup cost, the venture can turn a steady profit but requires maintenance and oversight. Not everyone has access to the conditions required to set up a successful mining farm, the most important of which is the location — cheap electricity is a must for miners.It is still possible to purchase ASICs from retail shops and mine at home, provided that the home electricity price is below $0.10 kWh. Such figures can usually be found only in developing countries that have ample natural resources.Some mining pools and companies offer a variety of ways for others to use their facilities — for a fee. The primary methods are colocation and cloud mining, which differ significantly in terms of their structure. Colocation services merely charge a fee for electricity and maintenance, while the devices are provided by the client. Cloud mining services are, in general, much different and riskier than self-hosted mining. Usually, the contracts last a predefined amount of time and carry significant maintenance costs. This gives a limited amount of time to recoup the initial investment, making it more of a bet on the price of crypto with somewhat limited upside. Overall, the opacity of the mechanism often raises questions from regulators about the legitimacy of some cloud mining operations.Jiang’s company recently launched a service called “joint mining,” which changes the business model of cloud mining to make it closer to real mining:The B.top platform is thus closer to an assisted colocation service than classical cloud mining, with the company also allowing clients to “withdraw” their miners and have them delivered to a destination of their choosing.As the Bitcoin mining industry stabilizes and matures, the companies involved in the business may become important diversification tools for investors. The unique risk and reward profile of mining is similar to gold mining companies, which are traditionally included in many exchange-traded funds for gold exposure. Jiang concluded with another parallel between Bitcoin and gold:"
132,"Bitcoin (BTC) could be in for a $100,000 bull run next if a classic signal from institutions repeats its historical trend.In a tweet on March 4, Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, said that those seeking clues about what lies next for Bitcoin should look at the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).As Bitcoin fell to $43,000 and continued to linger below all-time highs thereafter, the so-called “premium” on GBTC flipped negative.This means that GBTC shares are trading below their so-called net asset price (NAV) — institutional buyers are able to buy at a discount. In times gone by, such events have both been rare and a pointer for subsequent price upside.A negative premium was also observed in March 2020, the start of the bull cycle which has brought BTC/USD from $3,600 to $58,300.“Grayscale #Bitcoin Trust Discount May Signal March to $100,000,” McGlone wrote.At the time of writing on Friday, the GBTC premium was in fact lower than at any point since its inception in 2017, at -13%.Unlike last year, however, there could be other factors influencing its performance. Among them is competition — GBTC now has to battle for market supremacy alongside proxy exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with the prospect of more likely appearing on the market in the near future.As Cointelegraph reported, Grayscale is expected to lower management fees after new offerings went live from January onwards.“Grayscale's (GBTC) Market Cap is $30 billion. US Purpose Bitcoin ETF (BTCC/CN) is $454 million CAD. It has been trading 6 days,” Jim Bianco, founder of macro analysis firm Bianco Research, highlighted last week.Bianco added that the previous discount periods had been followed by price rises of between two and four times in magnitude.Enthusiasm about the potential for further gains continues to permeate the Bitcoin ecosystem, with Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein himself telling McGlone that gold outflows alone present a “ripe” opportunity for cryptocurrency.“There is little doubt in our mind that it is not any kind of coincidence that Q4 2020 saw some of the largest outflows on record from gold investment products at a time when Bitcoin really broke out and hit some of its new all-time high prices,” he said during the Bloomberg Investment Summit on Feb. 25.This time around, he reiterated, the landscape had little in common with 2017 and the launch of the first institutional Bitcoin products."

Major Cineplex expects to extend the pilot to 39 more of its movie theaters across Bangkok by the end of 2021.The news apparently marks the first time in history that Thai movie theater has accepted crypto as payment.Narut Jiansanong, a spokesperson for Major Cineplex, said that the new initiative intends to attract more customers that invest in crypto. He said that Thailand is now estimated to have up to 1 million Bitcoin holders, accounting for 2% of the country's total adult population.In mid-February, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand proposed to adopt specific requirements for people willing to invest in crypto, reportedly planning to require investors to have an annual income of at least $33,250. The authority subsequently appeared to back off some of its proposed requirements, stating that its initial proposals intended to gauge investor sentiment."
134,"A former equities CIO of Goldman Sachs drew an strong response on Twitter after suggesting Tesla should sell its Bitcoin and buy back company shares.The price of TSLA shares have fallen 28% from $863.42 to $621.44, since news broke on Feb. 8 that Tesla had made a $1.5 billion BTC acquisition.MicroStrategy’s shares have fared even worse in the short term. The company, which is headed by Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor and just completed its latest acquisition of $15 million in BTC on Mar. 3, is now down 50% from its all-time high of $1,315 from Feb. 9.Tesla’s share market woes are likely due to a number of factors. In early February, it was reported that Tesla had been reprimanded by the Chinese government over quality control issues after receiving consumer complaints. The broader stock market has also experienced volatility, with the S&P 500 down 4.1% in the last 30 days. But the tweet from longtime Tesla analyst Gary Black, who has several decades of financial management experience, sparked a debate on whether Tesla’s purchase of $1.5 billion in Bitcoin last month had benefited investors.Tesla stock is now down 28% since buying #Bitcoin as investors signal to @ElonMusk that $1.5 billion was not enough.“I don't want them buying back stock,” said Twitter user Techgnostik. “I want them investing in growth, and making another billion on their BTC position.”Black countered by suggesting TSLA would also draw inclusion by more fund managers with a share buyback program, considering it of greater value to the investor than buying BTC ""with excess cash.”Some users on Twitter agreed that a stock buyback seemed to be a more appropriate use of funds, while others felt too much attention was being paid to what Tesla did with 8% of their cash reserves..@Tesla's mission is to ""accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy."" It is not about catering to the mercurial whims of short-term traders in $TSLA.https://t.co/93hr25iJ27 https://t.co/eJReXuvPo4It’s not easy to ascertain the impact buying Bitcoin has had on a company’s bottom line. While MicroStrategy’s share price has halved in a month, shares of MSTR are still up 340%, (from $146.63 to $645.66), since the company announced its first purchase of 21,454 BTC on Aug. 11, 2020. The price of BTC is currently up 310% from the same date."
135,"Despite the current battle between Bitcoin bulls and bears around the $50,000 price mark — and an 8.7% pullback over the past 24 hours — a raft of analysts and commentators have got out their crystal balls to tip a glittering future for Bitcoin prices.On Mar. 4, Senior Commodity Strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence Mike McGlone pointed to historical data to suggest that Bitcoin is on the way to $100,000.McGlone’s logic revolves around the growing discount for shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust which is at the same level as last year’s Black Thursday collapse. The discount refers to when shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust trade for less than the value of the underlying Bitcoin (normally they trade at a premium).Looking at historical data, said thatGrayscale #Bitcoin Trust Discount May Signal March to $100,000 - Bitcoin's end of February price disparities on U.S. regulated exchanges portend a firming price foundation, if history is a guide, and are evidence of just how nascent the crypto is. pic.twitter.com/qj6hfTvH8KTwitter user “Lee Hendricks” wasn’t convinced, suggesting the catalyst for Grayscale’s discount could be the result of pressure from upcoming ETFs and other crypto funds. (Although that's arguably bullish too.)The Bloomberg strategist isn’t the only expert with high expectations for BTC, with influencer and YouTuber Lark Davis stating on Mar. 4 that “we are just now past the first major price wave,” with two more, larger waves to come.This #bitcoin bull run has barely even started yet! We are just now past the first major price wave. Get ready for wave 2. pic.twitter.com/kRzAqlB2E8On March 2, technical analyst Kaleo posted a chart predicting BTC will hit $100,000 near the start of April this year.It’s a follow-up on his “Bitcoin Halving Reward Era Price” analysis chart two years ago predicting the price would reach $200,000 around mid-2021. He tweeted two weeks ago that he still has faith in it:Another analyst who goes by the Twitter name MasterChangz, told his 10,000 followers he believes Bitcoin will hit the $200,000 mark even earlier than mid-2021, potentially at the start of April. The next rise, he said, is to $77,000 over the next two weeks.Ok this bull run fractal is become more insanely accurate by the day.

I'm literally making bank of trading it, its like a cheat sheet.

$77,000 next up.#BTC pic.twitter.com/JJS4Huu6riOther predictions are even bolder with Kraken CEO Jesse Powell stating the cryptocurrency could reach $1 million or even ""infinity"" in a Bloomberg television interview on Mar. 4, adding that it will eventually become the world’s currency.“We can only speculate, but when you measure it in terms of dollars, you have to think it’s going to infinity,” he said. “The true believers will tell you that it’s going all the way to the moon, to Mars and eventually, will be the world’s currency.”Kraken Head of Growth Dan Held, echoed this prediction on Mar. 5, claiming on Twitter that:Even past Bitcoin skeptics are becoming crypto converts with investment firm Sanders Morris Harris CEO George Ball admitting to Yahoo Finance on Mar. 4 that he believes cryptocurrencies are now “attractive” as a “small part” of any portfolio.""With the cryptocurrencies, I think there is a fundamental hydra-headed shift that makes them attractive as a part, a small part, of almost any portfolio,"" Ball said.Despite this wave of optimism, history also suggests March could be a bloody month, with Bitcoin’s price falling across the month in six of the past nine years by an average of 5.8%. The most recent of these occurred last year on Black Thursday when the price plunged by 50%. That said, the second-biggest monthly candle in BTC history happened in March 2013, when the price shot up 179%."
136,"Financial industry veteran George Ball believes investors would be prudent to allocate a “small part” of their portfolio to cryptocurrencies — marking a major departure from his previous stance towards digital assets. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Ball described cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) as an “attractive” option for investors looking to hedge against currency debasement. His comments came as Congressional lawmakers mulled a $1.9 trillion relief bill that would put provide up to $1,400 in direct stimulus payments to Americans impacted by Covid-19.“I've never said this before, and I've always been a blockchain, cryptocurrency and Bitcoin opponent. But if you look now, the government cannot stimulate markets forever, the liquidity flood will end,"" Ball said.He continued:If higher inflation leads to currency debasement over the long term, Ball said, “then the cryptocurrencies have a great deal of allure.”Ball, who served as Chairman of Prudential Financial between 1982 and 1992, began to change his tune on Bitcoin in August 2020 when he told investors that now was the time to seek exposure to the digital asset. At the time, one Bitcoin was worth roughly $12,000. It's presently valued at just over $48,000. Wall Street veterans like Ball are warming to cryptocurrencies as they’ve watched Bitcoin pull a 5x move in less than six months. Institutions like JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are eyeing the Bitcoin market, whereas firms like BNY Mellon have already started to custody the digital asset."
137,"On Wednesday, British cryptocurrency mining company Argo Blockchain revealed that CEO Peter Wall is now the first executive of a publicly traded company to take their entire salary in Bitcoin (BTC).In a February operational update, the company — which trades on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker ARB — said that as of Monday, Wall began taking his salary in the cryptocurrency and that “Any other Argo team members may choose to be paid in Bitcoin for part of or all of their salaries.”In an interview with Cointelegraph, Wall said that the decision was an obvious one for Argo, which mined 129 BTC last month and currently has 599 BTC on the books.“I actually woke up in the middle of the night and asked myself, ‘why am I getting paid in fiat?’” said Wall. “‘Why don’t we just start paying ourselves in Bitcoin?’”Wall pointed to NFL player Russell Okung as an additional source of inspiration. Late last year, certain publications reported that Okung was drawing a portion of his salary in Bitcoin; in reality, he was using a service to convert his wages.By contrast, Argo is in fact paying Wall in Bitcoin straight from the company’s coffers. Wall reported “strong” interest from employees as well, and he anticipates a “strong uptake” on the offer. Employee salaries will continue to be denominated in fiat, and the conversion rate will be calculated daily using Satstreet’s exchange rate.Employees aren't the only ones interested. Wall joked that some shareholders have inquired about dividend payments in BTC — a feat that may be too much of a legal hurdle to clear — and said some other company heads have applauded the move.Wall said that Bitcoin is an ideal way to take at least a portion of salary, given its utility as a store of value and its provable scarcity.“There’s an evolving payment structure for how people are getting paid out, and we’re happy to be at the forefront of pushing things in that direction,” he said.He anticipates other companies — even giants like Google — will offer cryptocurrency salary options to employees within “three to five years.”"
138,"In hindsight, February can be viewed as a watershed moment in the history of Bitcoin. The entire month could be looked back upon by market specialists and economists, as the markets saw an enormous surge before correcting themselves later in the month.The flagship cryptocurrency asset, Bitcoin (BTC), hit its all-time high of $58,352 on Feb. 21 while finally breaking the $1 trillion mark in market capitalization. On the same day, the second-most prominent asset in the space, Ether (ETH), hit its all-time high of $2,033.08.In February, Bitcoin’s price was a bit of a rollercoaster, almost drawing a bell curve of sorts. At the start of the month, BTC was trading at $32,889, gradually rising to an all-time high of $58,352 on Feb. 21 before flash crashing to around the $43,700 range toward the end of the month.So, what’s behind this meteoric rise and subsequent pullback that now leave many in the community questioning if the crypto bull run is still ongoing?Bitcoin has seen institutional involvement in the asset increasing since 2020 ended. In February, one of the oldest banks in the world, BNY Mellon, stepped into crypto as a custodian. Considering the size and legacy of such banking institutions, it says a lot about where Bitcoin has reached in its maturity from the old-timer perspectives of the likes of Warren Buffet, who has called the asset a worthless “delusion” and even “ rat poison squared,” indicating how strong his stance against Bitcoin is.In fact, such perspectives are often subject to change. The latest naysayer to have now become an investor is Kevin O’Leary, the Shark Tank star, who will now allocate 3% of his portfolio to Bitcoin. He also implied that every company he is invested in is considering putting Bitcoin on its balance sheet. In the past, he has referred to cryptocurrencies as a “crypto trap” and Bitcoin’s value to be a “giant nothing burger.”On these changing perspectives, Shane Ai, who is responsible for product research and development of crypto derivatives at Bybit — a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange — told Cointelegraph:Besides BNY Mellon and Deutsche Bank, tier-one investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have recently taken a stance on Bitcoin. Goldman Sachs announced that it would be restarting its cryptocurrency desk, which it had shut down in December 2017. Veteran trader Peter Brandt took to Twitter to claim that “it is time to guard your money” when Goldman Sachs steps into a niche market.A Citigroup report stated that Bitcoin is currently at its “tipping point” of either becoming the preferred currency for international trade or seeing a “speculative implosion.” The report says that the involvement of Tesla and MasterCard is proving to be the beginning of a transformation toward going mainstream.Among the various institutions that are now flocking to the cryptocurrency markets, Tesla is probably the most prominent and the one that has most marked the paradigm shift due to the influence of its CEO, Elon Musk, on the crypto markets.Now, his impact on the markets is often referred to as the “Musk effect.” On Feb. 8, Tesla announced its purchase of Bitcoin worth $1.5 billion at the time as a treasury asset on its balance sheet. The move sent Bitcoin’s price soaring, posting a price surge of $10,000 within a week. Just two weeks later on Feb. 21, Bitcoin reached its all-time high.Apart from the obvious institutional interest, flaws and insecurities from the global economy and traditional financial markets also seem to overflow into the Bitcoin markets. Ai further opined: “Bitcoin is a highly reflexive asset — the viability of it being a corporate reserve asset increases alongside its market capitalization.” He further added: “In a world starved of yield, financial institutions are naturally converging on crypto — which still offers superior, liquid returns relative to Traditional Finance.”Related: Can’t beat ‘em? Join ‘em: Mastercard and Visa make a case for BitcoinThe evidence that the recent asset movement in the cryptocurrency markets is institutionally driven is revealed by analyzing The TIE’s proprietary NVTweet Ratio, which compares a cryptocurrency's social conversation with its market capitalization. The ratio looks at how many tweets a particular coin has per each $1 million in market cap.A rapidly increasing NVTweet Ratio suggests that a certain coin’s market is becoming institutionally driven. If a coin’s market capitalization is rising faster than social volume, this may suggest less retail involvement in the market for a particular coin. When observing the NVTweet Ratio when Bitcoin’s price passes major support levels like $20,000 and $40,000, it is evident that the ratio surges rapidly, pointing to disproportionately less social interest despite an aggressively increasing market capitalization.As a byproduct of the rise in institutional involvement, millions of new retail investors have also been lured into the cryptocurrency markets due to the gains offered in the recent timelines and the hype surrounding it.Joshua Frank, CEO of The TIE, pointed out further evidence to Cointelegraph: “From a retail lens, we have seen Bitcoin’s tweet volume continue to soar for the most extended period of time that we have ever witnessed.”This continuous rise in tweet volumes regarding Bitcoin is driven mainly by all the landmark events that Bitcoin witnessed in the month of February, such as its all-time high and its market capitalization smashing the $1 trillion mark.Cointelegraph discussed with Marie Tatibouet, the chief marketing officer of cryptocurrency exchange Gate.io, the question of whether this is the right moment for retail investors to jump into Bitcoin despite the prices being much higher than just a year ago. She opined:Despite the fact that prices might seem high, the retail investors don’t seem to be deterred by this at all. In Robinhood’s recent report “Crypto Goes Mainstream,” the company revealed that there were over 6 million new crypto users who registered on its platform. January had more than 3 million new users, while February had more than 2.9 million new users as of Feb. 25. This is a significant increase compared with 2020 when Robinhood had only 200,000 average monthly new crypto traders.The report also pointed out that the average transaction size on the platform in 2021 is $500, a 100% increase when compared with the first three quarters of 2020. Tatibouet further elaborated that Bitcoin is seen as a lucrative investment proposition for retail investors due to its impressive gains over the past year: “Bitcoin has outperformed every single asset class, and that too by a significant amount. At one point, it was outperforming Nasdaq 100 by 300% and S&P 500 by almost 1600%.”While Bitcoin witnessed the initial price breakout beyond the $40,000 mark in January, February proved to be the month when most of the groundbreaking news came out, which led the price of Bitcoin to its all-time high. Furthermore, if Bitcoin avoids a big price correction like the one seen almost a year ago on March 12, 2020, BTC could post its most impressive quarter in recent history."
139,"Major American digital asset custody and security company BitGo has acquired a New York Trust license from the New York State Department of Financial Services.According to an announcement, the new charter enables BitGo to provide custodial services for institutional clients in New York seeking to make large investments in crypto in compliance with local regulations.With the new license, BitGo will provide Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering controls and offer offline cold storage of cryptographic keys in bank-grade vaults, BitGo said.BitGo CEO Mike Belshe said that the new trust charter from NYDFS will help the company serve the world’s premier financial organizations based in the state of New York.Belshe said that the company has seen a significant surge in institutional customers: BitGo applied for the New York trust charter in August 2020 in a move to start operating as an independent and regulated custodian in the stateFounded in 2013 in Palo Alto, California, BitGo provides institutional-grade storage for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) as well as handling crypto transactions. The company is backed by major mainstream companies like Goldman Sachs as well as industry firms including Digital Currency Group and Galaxy Digital Ventures.Last year, BitGo established two new custodial subsidiaries in Switzerland and Germany, with each one being regulated by the authorities in their respective jurisdictions."
140,"Decentralized finance is one of the most promising and indeed the fastest growing ecosystems within the crypto and blockchain space. Total value locked in DeFi — a measure of the total value of assets committed to the DeFi ecosystem — has been approaching the $40-billion mark this month, which indicates a value increase of around 200 times since February 2019. And 2021 has just started, promising some major developments for the DeFi space. Related: Was 2020 a ‘DeFi year,’ and what is expected from the sector in 2021? Experts answerDeFi has made a lot of changes in our world. Some argue it has started the shift to real decentralization; from the rise of the Web 3.0 movement to decentralized governance, others see it as the solution to the broken legacy finance and the future of banking.Despite all the benefits that DeFi offers, there are some problems and challenges that should be addressed. The future success of the ecosystem depends on accurate and secure data that is free from manipulation and thus less vulnerable to exploits, which requires the implementation of quality-control mechanisms. Improving transaction speeds and the peer-to-peer aspect also remain among the important issues in order to gain wider adoption and sustainability to the industry.Meanwhile, the major obstacle for DeFi development remains the constantly increasing gas fees on Ethereum, which were above $1,000 this month. And while the long-awaited Ethereum 2.0 transition, which aims to address this problem, “will save the day,” some argue that DeFi users shouldn’t wait for Eth2 to prove what it claims it can do.Related: The Ethereum 2.0 factor: Changing the way DeFi projects operateUndoubtedly, Ethereum has been overtaking Bitcoin (BTC) as the leading DeFi protocol infrastructure and network. Nonetheless, some experts state that “it’s hard to imagine a future where BTC is not used in DeFi products,” while others claim that Bitcoin “will eventually be forced to break its 21-million supply limit to remain sustainable and relevant” as DeFi keeps growing and flourishing. Cointelegraph reached out to experts in the DeFi space for their opinions on the following question: Will DeFi remain almost exclusively on Ethereum, or will it become big on other layer ones, or will new projects adding smart contracts to Bitcoin steal some thunder?""I am interacting and experimenting with DeFi on a day-to-day basis, and I follow all developments closely. We are still in the early days, but so far, the first-mover advantage and the infrastructure built on Ethereum give the ETH ecosystem a big head start. I do see a future where we see a multichain universe for DeFi infrastructure where less security is needed for data and transactions can be synchronized and settled. But do remember the focal point is not performance but trust in DeFi. Some complex financial transactions now possible in DeFi would cost a significantly higher amount in fees and give less trust and more bureaucracy when compared with working in CeFi systems.""“But, isn’t the question answered? DeFi is already on other chains. Doesn’t seem hypothetical.”“While Ethereum has been the innovator of smart contracts, its extensive infrastructure size makes it a slow mover regarding necessary changes it has to make to adapt to users’ needs in the current market. Gas fees have been continuously on the rise since DeFi bloomed up, and since the amount of fees spent on the Ethereum network reached its all-time high, it’s been contributing to others taking a piece of the pie. Let’s not forget, for many smaller retail investors, the current gas fees on the Ethereum network can be higher than the annual percentage yield they would gain from staking a full year.Sure, we have projects such as Stacks 2.0 with hopes to make Bitcoin programmable, but I think Bitcoin’s main functionality will stay unchanged as a long-term store of value asset. This functionality is the most sought-after since Bitcoin remains the largest market-dominant cryptocurrency today.I think winners in the DeFi space will be fast movers with robust technology, such as Project Serum built on the lightning-fast Solana blockchain with much cheaper transaction fees that back it up with massive liquidity, and interoperable with Ethereum and Bitcoin. And as long as the dominant cryptocurrency exchanges support direct withdrawal to these sets of assets, they will flourish.”“DeFi was started with the ethos of open permissionless access that drives competition and ultimately better financial products for more people around the world. We’ve seen it with Uniswap/SushiSwap, stablecoin battles, etc., and that competition is a good thing and should be encouraged.Will we see DeFi on other chains? Yes, of course.But just as Bitcoin has ‘won’ the store-of-value use case for crypto, Ethereum has a massive lead in the ‘permissionless settlement’ use case. You can see it in stablecoin usage/volumes (ETH dwarfs other L1s) and cross-chain bridges that always include Ethereum mainnet. So, we’ll see other L1s and L2s aggressively add DeFi products but most (if not all) will be bridged back to Ethereum for ultimate, censorship-resistance settlement. We believe we’re at the very beginning of a decade-long cycle of innovation and killer apps in the DeFi space across a number of different L1 and L2 blockchains.”“Ethereum continues to be the primary interest of serious builders in the industry, but it’s clear that other layer ones are starting to accrue interest and talent. In our view, the four most important layer ones right now are Polkadot, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain and Solana, respectively. Polkadot has the largest concentration of real teams building DeFi applications that could see real volume. We are already working with Reef Finance and Tidal Finance to integrate into their yield farming and insurance pools. We’re working with the Avalanche team to deploy our smart contracts on their chain. Lastly, we are likely deploying on BSC in the near future. BSC has substantial wash trading volume, but we also see real activity and yields based on our conversations with farmers at the vanguard of the ecosystem. The fact that BSC leverages the developer tooling and wallet infrastructure of Ethereum makes it attractive in the medium term, though we have concerns longer term regarding its centralized nature.”“I believe DeFi will remain on Ethereum, and if it moves to a more scalable layer one, it will most likely be a winner-takes-all scenario.”“Most of the DeFi is headquartered on Ethereum, including Aave Protocol. The recent congestion on Ethereum of course has sparked some additional interest on L2 solutions and side-chains, such as Matic, that has been getting recently lot of traction. These solutions do reduce the network fees and might work well on parallel with Ethereum. I don’t think Bitcoin will have smart contracts at least for a long time. It would require changes on the protocol itself and the Bitcoin community to have a consensus on such a decision.”These quotes have been edited and condensed.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors’ alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

141,"Vietnamese financial authorities have warned the public about the risks of cryptocurrency investment, as the industry is not regulated in Vietnam, local news agency Thanh Nien reported Wednesday.The Ministry of Finance of Vietnam stated, “Vietnam has not adopted any legislation related to the issuance, trading, and exchange of virtual currencies and virtual assets.”The ministry stated that digital currencies are not part of Vietnamese securities laws and that there are only two exchanges, Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange and Hanoi Stock Exchange, that are allowed to trade securities in Vietnam.To address this gap, the ministry has established a dedicated research group to investigate the crypto industry and develop crypto regulation policies in the country. The ministry also emphasized the need to raise awareness about the industry in order to avoid potential risks in trading and investing, as well as risks associated with illegal and fraudulent crypto-related schemes.The new warning from the government comes amid reports of growing skepticism regarding a new cryptocurrency platform called the Pi Network. The network is becoming increasingly popular in Southeast Asia but has some worried that it could be a pyramid scheme. According to a report by VnExpress, Dang Minh Tuan, a blockchain expert at the Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology in Hanoi, said that the Pi Network lacks the transparency of a legitimate blockchain project.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the Vietnamese government has been somewhat hostile to the adoption of the crypto industry in recent years, despite its apparent endorsement of crypto’s underlying blockchain technology. After banning cryptocurrency as a means of payment back in 2018, Vietnamese authorities have continued to urge the population to avoid crypto."
142,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) saw a minor correction on the day as the global stock market pulled back. The top cryptocurrency dropped by nearly 8% in the last 24 hours, retracing most of the gains it recorded during yesterday's rally on March 3.According to William Clemente, a cryptocurrency analyst, Glassnode's Reserve Risk indicator shows that Bitcoin's rally is still in the early to middle stage.As Clemente explains, the Reserve Risk is defined as price/HODL Bank. The indicator is ""used to assess the confidence of long-term holders relative to the price of the native coin at any given point in time.""Hence, if the Reserve Risk is still relatively low compared to previous peaks, it shows that Bitcoin is not at risk of nearing a macro top.Currently, the Reserve Risk of Bitcoin is at half the level seen in 2013, 2014, and 2017, when the price of Bitcoin crashed by well over 50% and entered a bear market.Moreover, despite the weakness in Bitcoin over the past 20 hours, it is performing well considering that the global stock market has seen a significant drop.Kyle Davies, the co-founder at Three Arrows Capital, noted that global macro sold off, yet Bitcoin has not seen a massive correction as a result. He said: For instance, major tech stocks and retail-favored stocks, like Tesla, saw a large sell-off on March 3. Consequently, most risk-on assets fell in tandem, showing overall weakness in the global macro market.Meanwhile, Ki Young Ju, the CEO at CryptoQuant, warned about an uptick in exchange deposits as the price of Bitcoin dropped below $50,000.When whales deposit Bitcoin into exchanges, it typically indicates an intent to sell. High-net-worth investors often keep their cryptocurrency holdings off exchanges.Ki said:The combination of whales possibly selling Bitcoin on exchanges and the gloomy macro landscape likely contributed to the decline in the price of BTC.In the longer term, however, the outlook remains bullish as the illiquid supply of Bitcoin continues to increase.Another day, another large increase in #Bitcoin illiquid supply.

Strong holders are ramping up their positions despite the sell-off.

Bitcoin is holding up against the macro spectacularly well. pic.twitter.com/DcEAbXdIB9Lex Moskovski, the CEO of Moskovski Capital, also noted that strong holders are ramping up their Bitcoin positions.As long as strong hands and high-net-worth investors are continuing to accumulate Bitcoin, the bull trend is likely to remain intact. In addition, the high time frame market structure of Bitcoin remains compelling, as it broke above the $46,000 level, establishing it as new technical support."
143,"Bitcoin (BTC) has halted its bull run in the past few weeks as the price has corrected from an all-time high of $58,000 to around $43,000.Several arguments were found for the pullback, including a sell-off from miners and whales. The other primary reason for the correction is the sudden surge of yields across the world.The 2-hour chart for Bitcoin shows a clear downtrend since the peak high in February at $58,000. Since then, bearish support/resistance flips have been happening suggesting further weakness in the near term.This bearish support/resistance flip has happened at the $55,000 and $52,000 levels, with the latter serving as the current major area of resistance.In recent days, Bitcoin’s price tried to break through this resistance zone but failed to do so. After such a failed breakout, retesting the levels below seems inevitable.In that perspective, the critical support zone to hold for Bitcoin is the area between $48,300 and $48,800. As long as those hold, a renewed test of the $52,000 zone could happen.Failing to hold the support zone and the range low (green area) is likely to receive a renewed test. Hence, the correction doesn’t seem over for Bitcoin’s price. In addition, the month of March isn’t the best period for Bitcoin so the current price slump shouldn’t come as a surprise.The weekly chart for Bitcoin shows a clear uptrend. Therefore, short-term corrections shouldn’t be classified as bearish trend reversals yet. Every bull cycle has periods of consolidation and corrections to generate more strength for the market’s next impulse wave.Therefore, corrections of 30%-40% frequently happen during Bitcoin bull cycles and this should be taken into consideration for this pullback as well.Historically, March is a terrible month for crypto as recent years have shown overall weakness during this period. Such corrections often end at the 21-Week MA, as that’s the critical indicator to watch for bull and bear the market’s momentum.As long as Bitcoin’s price sustains above the 21-Week MA, further bullish continuation is likely. The 21-Week MA is currently at $29,000, but within a few weeks, it will be between $33,000 and $35,000. As long as Bitcoin stays above that $30,000 area and the 21-Week MA, investors shouldn’t be worrying about the general bullish trend.The primary reason for the weakness in Bitcoin and gold is shown in this chart. The 10-year yield across the world has reached the highest point in a year. That’s pushing investors out of assets like Bitcoin and gold. In that light, the yields have been doing well, but also the dollar has been showing signs of recovery. However, the moment the attention shifts to a specific topic, it often marks the end of such a trend. In this case, the yields are at a crucial level here as they could, technically, see a bearish support/resistance flip, after which they can drop to retest the 1% level.This might happen following any news from the Federal Reserve in the coming weeks, but a dropdown in yields would be bullish for Bitcoin and gold moving forward.The crucial levels to watch are defined in the chart above. As long as Bitcoin sustains support at $48,300-$48,700, a retest of the $52,000 area is likely. This is the critical breaker for further bullish momentum. If $52,000 breaks, a test of the $55,000 area and potentially new all-time highs are on the table.If the $52,000 area holds as resistance, a breakdown below the $48,500 support seems likely. In that perspective, you’d be wanting to see $42,000-$44,000 hold as support next, which are quite critical.Finally, the 21-Week MA is the essential indicator to watch for bull/bear momentum on the higher time frames. As long as that indicator sustains support, the bull market remains intact.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

144,"Bitcoin (BTC) will be worth ""infinity"" and humanity will soon give up pricing it in U.S. dollars, says the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.Speaking to Bloomberg on March 4, Jesse Powell was characteristically bullish on Bitcoin as BTC/USD broke above $50,000.""Of course, you know, we can only speculate, but when we measure it in terms of dollars, you have to think it's going to infinity,"" he told Bloomberg TV about future price trajectory.Powell was commenting as the USD weakened alongside a macro market sell-off on Wednesday, an event which had next to no impact on Bitcoin. At the same time, the U.S. national debt quietly passed $28 trillion for the first time in history.Despite a rejection of $50,000 support, Bitcoin bulls thus remained more than optimistic.""The people that are believers in Bitcoin see... it's going to replace all of the world's currency, so that basically means whatever the market cap of the dollar is, the euro — all of that combined is what Bitcoin could be worth,"" Powell continued.As Cointelegraph noted, Bitcoin closed February 26% above its target dictated by the stock-to-flow-based price models, with creator PlanB still confident that $100,000 will hit at some time this year.Meanwhile, the gold ecplise argument has been steadily gaining support on social media in particular, often at the expense of gold bugs, who are left with increasingly little ammunition to defend their anti-Bitcoin stance.As Cointelegraph reported, it was billionaire and former Bitcoin skeptic Mark Cuban who this week took SchiffGold.com CEO Peter Schiff to task over his love of the precious metal. Gold, he told Schiff, ""is dead.""""Bitcoin has been crushing gold since inception,"" Kraken growth lead Dan Held added in response to claims by Schiff that a bet against gold was a losing one."
145,"Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) appear to be experiencing something of a slowdown, as on-chain data shows a dramatic decrease in the U.S dollar value of coins being sent across both blockchains in the past week. At the same time, transaction fees for both chains have receded from recent highs, or in Ethereum’s case, an all-time high.Data from Bitinfocharts shows $46.68 billion worth of BTC was sent across the Bitcoin blockchain on Feb. 25. For some context, that’s around 5% of the total Bitcoin market cap, which stands at $925 billion at time of writing.By three days later, on Feb. 28, the U.S. dollar value of Bitcoin being sent had fallen to $15.38 billion — a 66% drop off. At the same time, the average transaction fee for Bitcoin users fell by 53% — from $31.47 to $14.63. For context, the highest average fees ever recorded for Bitcoin came in December 2017 when BTC fees exceeded $55, marking the end of the coin’s bull run for that period.Over on Ethereum, the slowdown was equally pronounced. In the four days between Feb. 23–27, the total value of coins sent across the Ethereum blockchain fell 65%  from $11.1 billion to $3.84 billion.Meanwhile, average Ethereum transaction fees, which had soared to an all-time high of $38.21 by Feb. 23, dropped 70% down to $11.21.The average fee statistic can often be misleading, as it is heavily weighted by the mass of large transactions that incur super-high fees. The typical Ethereum user may be more interested in the median transaction fee value, which also fell 72% down to $5.23. For context, the recommended fee for making a “rapid” Ethereum transaction is currently around $2.80 according to GasNow.org.Such a sizable slowdown in activity on both blockchains could be interpreted by some as a sign that the current bull run is grinding to a halt. Yet a glance at the recent history of both chains shows that such pullbacks are not uncommon.In January, the dollar value of Bitcoin transactions fell 72% over a two-week period, before picking back up again to soar even higher in February. Likewise, the average Bitcoin transaction fee dropped 58% in the same time period. The same general pattern was observed on Ethereum.With this in mind, it is in all likelihood too early to assume that the current slowdown is indicative of the end of the crypto bull run, at least based on these metrics alone. Indeed, in the seven days since these metrics bottomed out, they have since begun to rise once more, as the ebb and flow of the cryptocurrency market continues."
146,"Huobi, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchange platforms in China, appears to be pursuing further expansion of its business following the recent regulatory clearance in Hong Kong.According to an official announcement by Huobi Technology Holdings Ltd., the company’s asset management subsidiary has secured approval from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission to launch a cryptocurrency asset management portfolio.The news is a follow-up to Huobi securing “Type 4” and “Type 9” licenses from the SFC back in July 2020. In Hong Kong, a Type 4 license enables a company to act as a securities investment adviser while a Type 9 license covers asset management.Dubbed Huobi Asset Management, the firm is now looking to launch three cryptocurrency asset funds following the approval by the SFC, according to reports in Chinese media. However, the launch will be contingent on the fund complying with additional provisions issued by the SFC.Tweeting on Thursday, Beijing-based reporter Colin Wu remarked that Huobi’s entry into the crypto asset management arena may incentivize institutional investors in Asia to consider crypto investments.Wu also stated that Huobi’s planned crypto asset management fund will include both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).Breaking: China's largest exchange Huobi has obtained a Hong Kong cryptocurrency fund license, and it will launch Bitcoin, Ethereum and multi-strategy funds on March 3. Similar to the Grayscale, this move by Huobi may promote traditional Asian investors to cryptocurrency field. pic.twitter.com/IIrhZVKiGQAccording to data from crypto research firm Messari, Huobi is second only to Binance in terms of real spot trading volume.Huobi’s crypto asset management license from the SFC comes amid reports that regulators in Hong Kong are close to banning retail crypto trading. Indeed, Huobi is among a group of global cryptocurrency exchanges challenging the legitimacy of the move.Following China’s ban on crypto trading and initial coin offerings in 2017, several Chinese exchanges moved their offices elsewhere with Hong Kong and Japan being favored destinations at the time."
147,"An open-source blockchain technology project has launched a smart contract that enables atomic swaps between fiat and crypto.Nimiq says the OASIS protocol means that someone who is completely new to the world of crypto can create a self-custodial wallet and buy NIM and BTC directly from their bank account in only five minutes. No sign up or installation is required, and fees come in at just 1.25%. Support for other cryptocurrencies, including Ether and Litecoin, is set to follow in the future.The project was founded with a crystal-clear objective of making crypto easy and available for everyone — and this new feature has been in the works for two years.According to Nimiq, the friction that’s associated with buying and selling digital assets has stymied the adoption of cryptocurrencies… until now.Although OASIS is currently in a public beta stage, the project says that users do not have any risk of losing their funds — meaning the technology is completely safe. Although functionality is currently focused on buying crypto, users will be given the freedom to sell their digital assets within the coming weeks.Nimiq says that a partnership with Germany’s TEN31 Bank means that OASIS supports transactions made using euros from any bank account that has SEPA Instant functionality. And the project isn’t sitting still — already, it is planning to integrate with a Costa Rican payment provider as it starts to make inroads in Latin America. In the fullness of time, the Nimiq team’s goal is to extend OASIS to every major currency.To begin with, transactions are limited to $500 (about 400 euros) — with a total limit of $1,000 (approximately 800 euros) on a rolling 30-day basis. It’s hoped that these limits will be increased in the not-too-distant future — but larger transactions may result in Know Your Customer checks.“While supporting larger swaps is certainly on our roadmap, we believe current limits to already enable most individuals to participate in the cryptoverse,” Nimiq explained.OASIS is complemented by Fastspot, a service and technology that was created by Nimiq to provide liquidity for swaps — enabling users to buy their crypto immediately.Soon, any business will be able to integrate Fastspot’s API — giving them the “easiest, fastest, safest, most decentralized and maybe even cheapest way of buying and selling.”Nimiq’s infrastructure could also prove exceedingly advantageous for merchants, who will get the opportunity to accept crypto but receive fiat — with conversions taking place instantly after a transaction. Not only could this open up retailers to a much broader cross-section of customers, but it will help crypto payments become more commonplace than they are now.The platform says its goal is to deliver an enhanced user experience that is “intuitive through simplicity.” Nimiq’s aim is to offer far greater convenience than conventional payment services — along with privacy and censorship resistance. An open-source mentality means developers are given the tools to build new and exciting applications that tap into Nimiq’s diverse ecosystem.A specialized type of smart contract known as Hashed Timelock Contracts (or HTLCs for short) served as inspiration for the OASIS ecosystem. HTLCs can only do one of two things — release funds to a specific address once a condition is met, or return funds to where they were sent from after a preset time expires.OASIS is set to be released in full this spring.Disclaimer.

148,"Colombia’s oldest commercial banking institution, Banco de Bogotá, is reportedly exploring cryptocurrency-related services.According to a report by local news agency Portafolio, Banco de Bogotá announced Monday that it will participate in a pilot project directed by the Superintendencia Financiera de Colombia, the country's top financial regulator. The project will be run within a regulatory sandbox — dubbed la Arenera — which was approved by the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit in September 2020.Banco de Bogotá will explore the business model and potential risks associated with the management of crypto assets by allowing a select group of clients to buy and sell cryptocurrencies from the bank with the national fiat currency, the peso.Oscar Bernal Quintero, vice president for technology development at Banco de Bogotá, said:The government of Colombia created la Arenera in order to let local companies test crypto transactions. According to an official announcement by the Financial Analysis and Information Unit, the sandbox was launched in March 2021.The crypto industry has been actively growing in Colombia. The country had the largest number of Bitcoin (BTC) ATMs in Latin America as of October 2020."
149,"A survey carried out by JPMorgan found that one in five institutional investors at firms that don't currently trade in cryptocurrency believe their companies are likely to do so in future.The survey of more than 3,400 investors representing 1,500 institutions, found that 11% of respondents work at firms that trade or invest in crypto, while 89% do not.Promisingly however, twice as many institutions appear likely to invest into crypto ashan those who have already taken the plunge, signalling institutional money may continue to flow into the markets over the near-term.Out of respondents from firms that do not trade or invest in crypto, 22% sa stated they believe their companies are likely to invest in digital currencies in the future.While some analysts argue that sustained institutional buying will now keep the price of Bitcoin up $50,000 — a significant number of institutional investors survestill lack faith in cryptocurrency.Asked for their opinion on crypto, 14% answered that it’s ""probably rat position squared"" and something to avoid, while 21% believe crypto is just a temporary fad. Just 7% of investors think it ""will become one of the most important assets.""The poll found that most institutions have security concerns, with 98% of respondents stating they believe fraud in the crypto world is ""somewhat"" or ""very much prevalent.""This appears to be major hurdle for institutional investors at the moment, with Damien Vanderwilt, co-president of Galaxy Digital, telling Bloomberg last month:However, these concerns aren't worrying big players like Tesla and MicroStrategy, with both parties investing billions into crypto in 2021. MicroStrategy recent increased its BTC holdings by 27% in February, upping the number of it Bitcoin held in its treasury reserve to 90,531 BTC."
150,"Bitcoin (BTC) price sliced through the $50,000 resistance level during the early trading hours on March 3 as bulls found their momentum and the majority of altcoins joined in on the rally as the day progressed. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that the price of Bitcoin was trading at $48,500 in the early hours on March 3 before surging 8.6% to an intraday high of $52,631. Currently, BTC price trades slightly below $51,000, and while $50,000 may have become a soft support, a daily close above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement ($52,000) is needed to confirm that a bullish reversal has taken place.On-chain analysis from CryptoQuant indicates that Bitcoin whales have been consistently buying the dips below $50,000 and according to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, institutional buying is taking place at the $48,000 support, as seen by the highlighted orange line on the chart above.Bitcoin's mainstream adoption continues to take place in Canada as Ninepoint Partners announced that it plans to change its Bitcoin trust offering to an exchange-traded fund on the Toronto Stock Exchange in an effort to increase trading liquidity and provide a better trading price. Bitcoin’s surge above $50,000 and increasing integration into mainstream financial markets has prompted some analysts to speculate on when a new all-time high will occur. For the time being, bearish macroeconomic factors are weighing on global markets and this could dampen growth in the short-term.The S&P 500, Dow and NASDAQ faced selling pressure throughout the trading day and closed down 1.31%, 0.39% and 2.7% after a spike in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield renewed concerns about the health of the U.S. and global markets.According to Chad Steinglass, Head of Trading at CrossTower, Wednesday’s action in the market is a “revisit of the rates-based selloff” from Feb. 25, with tech equities and ARK funds facing increased pressure.Steinglass said that headwinds being faced by BTC at the U.S. market open were the result of “being dragged down by GBTC as the GBTC discount has crept back up to about 4.5%.” Despite these challenges, Steinglass sees the recent favorable Bitcoin comments by Citigroup and Fidelity as strong support for the narrative of increasing institutional adoption.Steinglass said:Bitcoin’s pop above $50,000 also helped ignite a rally in altcoins as the majority of the top 100 coins moved higher on Wednesday.Ether (ETH) gained 8% to set an intraday high at $1,610, while Cosmos (ATOM) rallied 15.7% to a daily high at $21.18.Enjin Coin (ENJ) was the breakout star of the day as it surged more than 50% to make a new all-time high at $1.32. The sharp double-digit rally appears to be the result of the growing popularity of NFTs and Enjin’s transition into the growing NFT marketplace.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.55 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 61%."
151,"An original artwork by anonymous British street artist Banksy has been burned and turned into a nonfungible token. The NFT will be auctioned next week on the blockchain-based Rarible platform, where users can create and purchase rare tokenized artworks.The original Banksy in question is a satirical piece entitled “Morons,” which depicts buyers at an art auction bidding on a piece emblazoned with the words “I can’t believe you morons actually buy this shit.” The piece received certification from Pest Control — the only body authorized to authenticate original Banksy artworks.“Morons” was sold at Christie's auction house in London in late 2019, where it fetched $32,500 from an anonymous, independent buyer.The burning of the piece took place at an unknown location in Brooklyn, New York, and was livestreamed via the recently created Twitter account BurntBanksy. The burning was reportedly carried out by a group of cryptocurrency enthusiasts in association with executives from the blockchain project Injective Protocol.The tokenization of the authenticated piece took place without input from the pseudonymous Banksy. However, other prominent artists have seen fit to dip their toes into the crypto world of late, as witnessed recently when famed British artist Damien Hirst announced he would accept bids for his work in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).The NFT market became an industry unto itself toward the end of 2020, as almost $9 million in token sales was recorded in December 2020 alone. But that was just a sign of things to come, as NFT sales exploded moving into 2021, helped by the validation of several high-profile celebrities such as YouTuber Logan Paul and entrepreneur Mark Cuban.On Sunday, acclaimed Canadian musician and artist Grimes launched an NFT collection titled “WarNymph”, which went on to sell for a collective $5.8 million. The NBA recently embarked on a joint venture with CryptoKitties creator Dapper Labs to launch NBA Top Shot — an NBA-themed digital token marketplace that has reportedly generated $230 million in sales since launch.The “Morons” piece is not the first Banksy to be destroyed on purpose. In 2018, Banksy’s “Girl With Balloon” automatically self-destructed shortly after selling for $1.4 million at Sotheby’s. The artist later revealed that he had installed an automatic shredder in the painting’s frame in case it ever went to auction. In an ironic twist of fate, the destroyed Banksy is now thought to be more valuable than the original piece ever was.The “Morons” NFT will be auctioned on Rarible on Tuesday next week. All proceeds from the auction will be donated to charity. The successful bidder will be entitled to receive the certificate of authentication from Pest Control; however, this too will be burned if it is not claimed within two weeks of the sale.In an art industry fraught with fakes and forgeries, “Morons” may now be the most authentic, most secure Banksy piece in the world. Once logged on the blockchain, the possibility of it being forged, altered or manipulated in any way is close to zero.Given Banksy’s rejection of the bloated, materialistic art world, what would he think of the current mania surrounding NFTs? Keep an eye on your local graffiti spots. The answer may be forthcoming."
152,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) resilience in the face of global market uncertainty continues to attract new institutional investors. Dan Loeb, the CEO of New York-based asset management firm Third Point, said that he has been “doing a deep dive into crypto.” To strengthen the venture investments team, Third Point hired former pro-crypto Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry, according to Reuters.Loeb’s move into crypto seems to have prodded 'Shark Tank' star Kevin O'Leary to allocate a portion of his portfolio to Bitcoin. Additionally, O'Leary hinted that every operating company that he had invested in was considering investing in Bitcoin.Billionaire Tim Draper expects Netflix to be the next Fortune 100 company to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. Draper voiced his views while appearing on the Unstoppable Podcast. He also speculated that Amazon could start “accepting Bitcoin pretty soon.""These developments show that the institutional adoption of Bitcoin is only in its infancy and it is likely to grow in the future.It is heartening to see that former Bitcoin naysayers are now voicing their favorable opinions of the digital asset. Billionaire Mark Cuban recently schooled gold bug Peter Schiff on Twitter, suggesting that gold would soon lose its status as a store of value. Cuban also highlighted the advantages Bitcoin held over gold.With all these positives, it is no surprise that Bitcoin's price action has resumed its bullish momentum. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot the strengths and weaknesse.Bitcoin surged and closed above the 20-day exponential moving average ($48,123) on March 1. The bears tried to pull the price back below the 20-day EMA on March 2 but failed, which suggests that traders are buying on dips.The buyers pushed the price above the $52,040.95 overhead resistance today but the bears are not ready to give up just yet. The long wick on the day’s candlestick suggests the bears are selling on rallies.If the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below the 20-day EMA, the BTC/USD pair could drop to $41,959.63. The price could then remain range-bound between these two levels for a few days.This neutral view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price above $52,040.95. If that happens, the pair could retest the all-time high at $58,341.03.On the other hand, a break below the 50-day simple moving average ($41,921) will be the first indication of a possible change in trend.Ether’s (ETH) has broken above both moving averages today and the bulls are currently attempting to resume the uptrend. However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily as they may try to stall the up-move at the current levels.If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will signal that trader's sentiment is shifting from buying on dips to selling during rallies.The bears may gain the upper hand if they can sink the price below the $1,289.098 support. If that happens, the ETH/USD pair could correct to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,026.776.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. If the bulls can propel the price above $1,708.391, the pair may rally to $2,000.Cardano (ADA) is currently witnessing a minor correction in an uptrend. The altcoin has formed an inside day candlestick pattern, which indicates indecision among the bulls and the bears about the next move.If the uncertainty resolves to the downside and the bears sink the price below $1.55, a fall to the 20-day EMA ($1.05) is possible. A rebound off this support will suggest that the sentiment remains bullish as the traders continue to buy on dipsIf the ADA/USD pair breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate profit-booking by traders. That could pull the price down to $0.9817712 and if this support also cracks, the decline could extend to $0.80.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the current levels and the bulls push the pair above $1.30, a retest of $1.4852896 is possible. A breakout of this resistance could resume the uptrend with the next target objective at $1.83.Binance Coin (BNB) broke and closed above the downtrend line on March 1. The bears tried to sink the price back below the downtrend line on March 2 but failed, which shows that the short-term correction could be over.The bulls will now try to push the price to $281 where the bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance. If the price turns down from this level, the bears will again try to sink the price to the 20-day EMA ($208). A bounce off this support or $189 could keep the BNB/USD pair range-bound for a few days.A breakout and close above $281 could ready the pair for a rally to $309.4995 and then a retest of the all-time high at $348.6969. Conversely, if the pair breaks below $189, the decline could extend to the 50-day SMA at $119.Polkadot (DOT) has consistently closed in the green for the past five days, which shows that traders continue to buy at each higher level. The rising moving averages and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest an advantage to the bulls.The DOT/USD pair could now rise to the all-time high at $42.2848. If the bulls can drive the price above it, the pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach the psychologically critical level at $50.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the pair may again correct to the 20-day EMA ($32.27). A break and close below $30 could signal a possible change in trend.XRP bounced off the 50-day SMA ($0.41) on March 1 and reached the 20-day EMA ($0.46) today. The bears are currently pushing back at the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down, the altcoin could remain stuck between the moving averages for a few days.This view of a consolidation could invalidate if the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA. If that happens, the XRP/USD pair could drop to $0.359 where the buyers may step in and provide support.On the contrary, if the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may reach $0.50. The bears may try to stall the rally at this resistance, but if the bulls can thrust the price above it, the pair may start its journey to $0.65.Litecoin (LTC) has broken above the 20-day EMA ($186) today, which suggests that the bulls are attempting to make a comeback. If the bulls can sustain the breakout, the altcoin could rally to $205 and later to $240.However, the flat 20-day EMA and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a range-bound action for a few days. If the price turns down from $205, the LTC/USD pair could again drop to $160 and consolidate between these two levels.The pair could turn negative if the price reverses direction from the current levels and plummets below the uptrend line.Chainlink (LINK) bounced off the 50-day SMA ($25.89) on March 1 and broke above the 20-day EMA ($28.37) on March 2. The bears tried to stall the relief rally on March 2 as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick.However, the bulls did not give up ground and have again resumed the up-move today. The LINK/USD pair will now attempt to retest the all-time high at $36.9307. A breakout of this resistance could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $40 and then $46.The 20-day EMA has started to turn up and the RSI has jumped into the positive territory, indicating advantage to the bulls. This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) broke above the 50-day SMA ($515) on March 2 and reached the 20-day EMA ($547). However, the bears defended the 20-day EMA as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick.The flat moving averages and the RSI just below 49 suggest a balance between supply and demand. If the bulls can drive and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair could rally to $631.71 and then $745.Contrary to this assumption, if the price again turns down from the current levels, the bears will try to sink the pair below the uptrend line. If they succeed, the pair could extend the decline to the next support at $370.Stellar Lumens (XLM) has been trading close to the 20-day EMA ($0.427) for the past few days. A tight consolidation near a resistance usually results in a breakout because it shows that traders are not closing their positions in a hurry.If the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA, the XLM/USD pair could rise to the resistance line of the descending channel where the bears may again try to stall the relief rally. If they succeed, the pair could again drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.375) and then to $0.35.On the contrary, if the bulls push and sustain the price above the descending channel, it will suggest that the correction has ended. The pair could then rise to $0.50 and then to $0.600681.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

153,"Whales are continuing to accumulate Bitcoin (BTC) despite the price more than doubling so far in 2021, according to the latest data from CryptoQuant.This trend indicates that the confidence in Bitcoin is strengthening as the price is now attempting to stabilize above the $50,000 level.During bull cycles, whales can take profit on their positions, especially if the futures market is highly overcrowded.Whales selling their holdings to rebalance their portfolios can cause massive price swings in the market, especially when accompanied by cascading liquidations.In this bull cycle, on-chain data show that whales are buying Bitcoin rather than selling it, likely in anticipation of more upside in the future.Ki Young Ju, CEO at CryptoQuant, said:Whales or high-net-worth investors might be accumulating Bitcoin rather than taking profit on their positions because they might believe a supercycle might be emerging.Bitcoin has not had this much institutional interest prior to the current bull cycle, particularly coming from public companies and financial institutions.Bitcoin is becoming highly compelling in an environment where the continuous expansion of the money supply by central banks is forcing some companies to look for alternatives to cash.Additionally, William Clemente, a pseudonymous analyst, also points out that accumulation addresses are increasing, indicating another ""wave"" of accumulation.Appears we are in the midst of another wave of new #Bitcoin Accumulation Addresses pic.twitter.com/7TQ1NE08lHAs Fundstrat's Leeor Shimron explains, Bitcoin still has a lot of room to run when priced by the M1 money stock.Shimron said the Bitcoin cycle could ""get very wild,"" suggesting that BTC is far away from reaching a potential top.There are several other metrics that suggest a Bitcoin top is likely far from being reached in the near term.For instance, the SOPR indicator, which measures the profit-taking activity of investors, shows that many investors already took profit on their positions.In the foreseeable future, this could reduce significant selling pressure on Bitcoin, which coincides with whales continuing to buy up the circulating supply of Bitcoin.Raoul Pal, the CEO of Real Vision Group, shared a similar sentiment. He said that Bitcoin would suck up most of the world's capital over time. He said:"
154,"Lawmakers in Kentucky are looking to impose tax breaks for local cryptocurrency miners.Kentucky lawmakers on Tuesday approved several state tax breaks including House Bill 230, which would remove the sales tax from electricity purchased by local crypto mining operators.According to a report by the Lexington Herald-Leader, Kentucky legislators voted 19 to two for the new measure. The bill’s fiscal note is reportedly estimated to cost the local budget at least $1 million annually. The exact cost cannot be calculated so far because “it is unknown how many of the businesses might choose to locate here to avail themselves of this exemption,” lawmakers said.The bill’s sponsor reportedly urged that Kentucky needs to attract more cryptocurrency mining businesses by offering tax breaks on consumed electricity. Representative Steven Rudy emphasized that cryptocurrency mining needs to be supported as an industry in the state.“Mining for cryptocurrency takes a lot of electricity. It is very heavily impactful on industrial-type things. It is not just a few people sitting in their mom’s basement or in their parents’ basement writing code. This is actually highly sophisticated, highly technical,” he said.Kentucky has been attempting to attract crypto business to the state. In January 2021, Kentucky economic development officials approved tax incentives for Blockware Mining to open a crypto mining operation in Paducah, with a total investment of $28 million. The Kentucky Senate has been also advancing its own tax break bill for cryptocurrency mining, Senate Bill 255."
155,"Netflix may just be the next Fortune 100 company to buy Bitcoin (BTC) and Amazon will have to accept it, says billionaire Tim Draper.In an appearance on the Unstoppable Podcast on Feb. 28, the serial investor and hodler forecast that out of all possible candidates, Netflix is his pick for putting BTC on its balance sheet.""You know who it might be? Netflix,"" he said. The prediction comes as telltale signs of institutional buy-ins continue to surface at current prices, with $48,000 seeing multiple large transactions at Coinbase Pro over the past week. Classic buyers MicroStrategy and Square both added to their positions.Ever the optimist, Draper also considered that Amazon would add a direct Bitcoin payment option in future. ""Amazon will probably start accepting Bitcoin pretty soon,"" he said, noting that consumers have been able to buy products indirectly using cryptocurrency for many years.Amazon added Ethereum availability to its Managed Blockchain this week.Bitcoin itself meanwhile saw a change in fortunes on Wednesday, exiting the $40,000 corridor to hit highs of $51,800 — the most since Feb. 25. Taking traders by surprise, higher levels held at the time of writing, with BTC/USD circling $51,500.""That went well,"" popular trader Scott Melker summarized about overnight activity.Earlier, Cointelegraph had highlighted stagnation in the U.S. dollar as a catalyst for short-term gains."
156,"Iris Energy, an Australian firm that invests in Bitcoin (BTC) mining data centers powered by renewable energy sources, has doubled its second pre-initial public offering round.According to Bloomberg, a 13 million Australian dollar ($10 million) commitment from equity manager outfit Platinum Asset Management has seen Iris increase its second pre-IPO target to 40 million Australian dollars ($31 million) from the initial 20 million Australian dollars set earlier in mid-February.As reported by Financial Review back in December 2020, the Bitcoin miner secured $19.5 million in equity funding and $3.9 million in debt during its first pre-IPO funding round.Firms like Regal Funds Management and Thorney led the equity funding round.Meanwhile, Iris Energy is getting set to apply to the Australian Securities Exchange for an IPO in the summer. The Bitcoin miner reportedly has a $39 million target for the summer float with the proceeds of the IPO earmarked for the expansion of its BTC mining enterprise.Indeed, Iris Energy has set its sights on upscaling its capacity by investing in 500 megawatts data centers spread across the United States, Canada and some countries in the Asia-Pacific region.Apart from doubling its second pre-IPO funding target, the company also announced changes to its management structure with a new CEO in Jason Conroy, the chief financial officer at TransGrid — one of the largest energy utility companies in Australia.Iris is only the latest in a growing list of Bitcoin mining firms pursuing public listings on the back of the current bull market for the largest crypto by market capitalization.In February, reports emerged that major European Bitcoin mining outfit Northern Data was mulling a $500 million IPO with backing from Swiss investment giant Credit Suisse.The Swiss Investment firm was also temporarily involved with the Canaan Creative IPO back in 2019.Following the resolution of the leadership tussle at Bitmain, the crypto mining giant is believed to be getting set for another attempt at a public listing following the 2018 failed attempt."
157,"Major cryptocurrency tax compliance startup TaxBit has raised $100 million as it expands into Europe.According to a March 3 blog post, TaxBit has secured the funds in Series A round led by Paradigm and Tiger Capital. Additional investors included PayPal’s venture arm, major industry firms like Coinbase and Winklevoss Capital, as well as individual investors like Bill Ackman, Ryan Smith, Anthony Pompliano and others.According to the announcement, the new investment round comes in response to the increasing global demand for crypto services amid the crypto industry’s parabolic surge to hit a $1.5 trillion market capitalization. “The importance of TaxBit’s tailored tax and accounting software is readily apparent,” TaxBit’s vice president of marketing, Michelle O’Connor, said in the blog post.With newly raised funds, TaxBit is planning to start to expand internationally in 2021. TaxBit CEO Austin Woodward told Forbes the company wants to tap the United Kingdom market as its first destination. The company is also expecting to launch an enterprise resource planning solution in compliance with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission later this year.Launched in 2018, TaxBit’s platform is designed to automate aspects of crypto tax compliance for enterprises, consumers and governments. Developed by a group of CPAs, tax attorneys and software developers, the solution enables users to track the tax impact on their trades on crypto exchanges.TaxBit's raise comes as the U.S. Internal Revenue Service updates its crypto reporting rules to clarify that investors who purchased crypto with fiat currency do not need to report their transactions under the “virtual currency” question."
158,"Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) are empowering but gold is ""dead,"" billionaire Mark Cuban has told one of cryptocurrency's biggest naysayers.In a Twitter debate on Mar. 2, Cuban, who has become increasingly sympathetic to crypto, warned Peter Schiff that gold ""will die"" as a store of value (SOV).Schiff, a gold bug who has long made a name for himself as a firm Bitcoin skeptic, continues to tweet disparaging comments about the phenomenon despite BTC/USD regularly hitting new all-time highs.Responding to remarks about Wall Street firms being ""dumb"" by buying it, Cuban offered a dose of surprisingly pro-Bitcoin medicine.""Let me help Peter. Gold is hyped as much as Crypto. Do we really need gold jewelry? Gold can make you a ring,"" one tweet reads.Continuing, he gave a stark verdict on the future of gold.""What we are seeing built w/crypto today is just proof of concept. As tech continues to get better/cheaper/faster there will be new applications and maybe even something that supersedes what we know as crypto today,"" a further post says.Cuban had formally given little time to Bitcoin or cryptocurrency technology more broadly, sparking a concerted effort among proponents to persuade him to reconsider. In January, he revealed that he still had holdings from years ago which he had ""never sold.""""Don't forget, Gold was a SOV built on technology. From picks and shovels to mining operations that keep trying to improve. Whoever could use the tech of the day to find and mine the most efficiently was the most rewarded. Much like Crypto is today,"" a final message to Schiff concludes.Schiff had little to counteract his words, calling cryptocurrency a ""malinvestment"" and arguing that gold could back digital currency in future. Meanwhile, Schiff's years of scorn have found a new, more productive purpose.As many joke that his Twitter posts serve as an indication of Bitcoin price bottoms, one trader revealed a homemade trading tool that has spent a year performing transactions based solely on Schiff's social media activity.""Since May, the algorithm would have executed 203 trades, achieving an annualized return of ~1000%,"" Sam Baker, a student at Boston College said, uploading a sample of its profits.""I guess that's as good a reason as any to buy Bitcoin. Good luck,"" Schiff replied."
159,"The U.S. dollar index (DXY) is showing signs of a short-term top as the price of Bitcoin (BTC) demonstrates signals of a short-term rally.There is a narrative that the price of Bitcoin often coincides with a drop in the value of the dollar.Since stores of value, like gold and Bitcoin are priced against the dollar, theoretically, a downtrend in the DXY would likely have a positive impact on the price of BTC.As the dollar began to consolidate, Bitcoin broke above $50,000 on March 3, putting it on track to retest the $51,600 resistance level once again.Above $51,600, there is little resistance until $56,000. Hence, breaking past this level is critical to secure upside momentum in the short term.Bitcoin Jack, a semi-pseudonymous trader, who predicted the $3,600 bottom in March 2020, said:If Bitcoin continues to rally as the dollar stagnates, it could allow BTC to simultaneously benefit from two macro factors.First, the dollar's decline naturally benefits Bitcoin. Second, the impending $1.9 trillion dollar U.S. stimulus could serve as a catalyst for a broader BTC rally while diluting the value of the dollar.Bitcoin likely slumped in the past week due to the shaky macro climate, as the dollar began to climb and bond yields rose to a yearly high.If the macroeconomic conditions were the major catalyst for Bitcoin's downturn, now that bond yields are easing, it could bouy BTC's momentum in the coming weeks.According to John Cho, the director of global expansion at Ground X, $42,900 was most likely the local bottom for Bitcoin in the foreseeable future.Cho earlier predicted a short-term Bitcoin downturn, expecting a drop to around $40,000 to $41,000. BTC did not drop that low, but it declined to sub-$43,000, almost completing a 30% drop from its local high. Cho said:Although $44,000 was a major support level, Bitcoin's quick recovery to $51,000 suggests the drop itself was a deviation.In technical analysis, the term deviation refers to when an asset briefly drops or rises above a key level, and then reverts to the mean.Following the strong recovery of Bitcoin, it is critical for the dominant cryptocurrency to retest the $56,000 resistance area. Above it, the path toward a new all-time high is open, making $60,000 the next likely target."
160,"Bitcoin (BTC) bulls appear to have found their momentum as BTC price reclaimed the $49,000 level within the last hour.On March 2 the price dropped as low as $47,000 but currently, BTC is trading above the 20-day moving average. Bulls are likely to make another attempt at flipping the $50,000 resistance to support and a sustained high volume spike could send the price to $52,000 where a daily close would confirm that bulls are back in the driver's seat.   Even though Bitcoin is struggling to secure a daily close above $50,000, a steady thread of favorable news continues to emerge.Businessman and Shark Tank star Kevin O'Leary, who once called Bitcoin a “giant nothing burger,” revealed that 3% of his portfolio will be put into Bitcoin and in the future, O'Leary plans to invest in a sustainable mining operation.The drive to secure a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is also back in the headlines, following the successful launch of the Purpose Bitcoin exchange-traded fund in Canada. Evolve Funds Group revealed that it is now looking to secure approval for an Ether ETF product in Canada after it became the second firm approved to list a Bitcoin ETF in February.In the U.S., the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) is hoping that the ETF approvals in Canada will add momentum to its Jan. 3 filing to list the Van Eck Bitcoin ETF after all of its attempts made in 2017 were denied.Traditional financial markets faced pressure on March 2 as trading cooled following Monday’s rally which saw the S&P 500 put on its best performance since June 2020.The NASDAQ, Dow and S&P 500 all finished the day in the red, down 1.69%, 0.41% and 0.74% respectively, while the U.S. Treasury 10-year yield also continued its decline from last week’s spike. Several altcoin projects made big announcements that helped provide a boost to their token values.Sony Europe revealed that it had joined the Theta (THETA) network's validator program. Following the announcement, the price of THETA increased by 15.31% to $3.70 while the network’s TFUEL gas token rallied to a new all-time high at $0.144.Meanwhile, the launch of Aavegotchi’s (GHST) mainnet was accompanied by the platform’s first portal drop which involved 10,000 NFT-bearing portals selling out in under a minute. The successful launch and NFT sale was followed by GHST price rallying 15% to set a new all-time high at $1.79.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.51 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 60.7%."
161,"One of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining operations in the world, Bitfarms, has undertaken to purchase 48,000 new miners over the next two years.The Canadian mining company has sourced the equipment from Chinese supplier MicroBT in a bid to increase its hashing capacity by another 5 EH (exahashes) according to reports. Bitfarms was founded in 2017 and currently has a capacity of 1 EH. It has targeted a 200% increase by the end of 2021.The hashing capacity is the amount of pure computing horsepower that can be dedicated to mining Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies.The firm anticipates the initial shipment of hardware to take place on or before January 2022, with the final mining rigs expected to arrive in December 2022. It will increase its overall hashing capacity to a total of 8 EH over the next two years. Emiliano Grodzki, CEO of Bitfarms, stated it was getting harder to secure mining rigs:The report did not specify which units would be purchased but MicroBT’s flagship product is the “WhatsMiner M30S++” boasting 112 TH/s and retailing at $9,300. The company website currently reports all mining devices are sold out.Over the past eight months, Bitfarms has acquired over 12,000 mining rigs from MicroBT, citing reliability and power efficiency as reasons for the purchases.In December 2020, Bitfarms deployed 1,000 new Whatsminer M31S mining rigs and placed an order for an additional 3,000 Whatsminer M31S+ miners scheduled for delivery in late February 2021.Bitfarms was the first Bitcoin mining company to complete its long-form prospectus with the Ontario Securities Commission and started trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange in July 2019. The company has five industrial scale facilities located in Quebec, all powered with hydroelectric energy."

The card was acquired by Kell at the first-ever live auction for blockchain art for $38,500 — said to be the highest price for a non-fungible token, or NFT, at the time. The artwork was also recently featured in the Sundance Film Festival award-winning documentary, ""Feels Good Man."" The documentary’s official Twitter account said the card sold for more than the cost to make the entire film.The new owner, TokenAngels, appears to be accumulating hundreds of other NFTs in the series, and rushed to pick up the most prized one after news emerged it was up for grabs.“I had to sell a few punks in a hurry,” TokenAngels explained referring to collectibles CryptoPunks. “It was for far less than they’re worth but it was so important to get the funds together to make the transaction on time!”. Joe Looney acted as escrow for the sale.Well-known artist Matt Kane, honored in Cointelegraph’s Top 100 this year, had earlier created a tribute artwork to Homer Pepe and his tweet about it drew attention to the fact that Kell was looking to sell the original.Auction closes March 11th.

163,"HGreg, a Quebec-based vehicle superstore with 30 North American locations, will begin accepting cryptocurrency payments for new or preowned vehicles this month. The auto dealer, which has locations in Quebec and Florida, is becoming one of the first large automotive groups to accept digital asset payments in its day-to-day operations. The company claims to have sold 500,000 vehicles over the past 25 years and maintains a warehouse in Miami that's stocked with over 1,000 cars.“A portion of the revenue from sales made in cryptocurrency will be kept in this format by the company,” HGreg said, indicating that it plans to hold digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC) on its balance sheet.In terms of accepting crypto payments, the dealership said:The dealership sells a wide variety of used cars, from Hyundais to Lamborghinis. Crypto users can therefore use their funds to buy practical cars in addition to luxury vehicles. HGreg claims to have the largest inventory of vehicles in Canada.HGreg’s decision to accept cryptocurrency payments comes on the heels of Tesla’s entry into the Bitcoin market. As Cointelegraph reported last month, the electric vehicle maker allocated 7.7% of its gross cash position to Bitcoin. In the process, the company announced it will begin accepting BTC for payment.While cryptocurrencies remain largely within the domain of investments, payment infrastructure is increasingly integrating digital assets.

164,"Peter Brandt, a popular veteran trader and CEO of proprietary trading firm Factor LLC, recently gave his thoughts on Goldman Sachs potentially restarting its cryptocurrency desk.Us old-timers have learned that whenever @GoldmanSachs enters a market niche it is time to guard your money. $BTC pic.twitter.com/tHfRkS4igbOn Dec. 21, 2017, a similar Bloomberg piece stated that Goldman Sachs would set up a cryptocurrency trading desk, although the bank was “still trying to work out security issues.”Although Brandt’s chart seems significant, one needs to understand that such speculation had been ongoing for a couple of months. The Wall Street Journal already covered Goldman Sachs’ intention to do this on Oct. 2, 2017.Even if we disregard the exact date, Goldman Sachs apparently ditched those plans to launch its Bitcoin (BTC) trading desk. But more importantly, there aren’t many similarities between the 2017 bull run and the current market in terms of their structures.Take notice of how BTC volume soared from a $2 billion average daily volume in November 2017 to $14.6 billion by year-end, a sevenfold increase. The incoming retail demand was so impressive that it caused the exchanges Binance, Bitfinex and Bittrex to reject new users temporarily.Binance accounts were even sold by users directly to other users at the time when no new sign-ups were being accepted. In other words, there is currently no retail frenzy in Bitcoin similar to what happened in late 2017. In fact, the current bull cycle appears to be driven by institutions that are seemingly scooping up BTC on every dip. Meanwhile, the $66 billion daily average traded volume seen on Feb. 22, as Bitcoin's market capitalization peaked at $1.09 trillion, had been relatively flat for the previous six weeks.Therefore, an experienced technical analyst such as Brandt should have added the caveat that volume is the most relevant market participation indicator — which he frequently emphasizes in his other analyses.To settle this difference for good, one needs to understand the basics of futures markets. Derivatives exchanges charge either perpetual futures longs (buyers) or shorts (sellers) a fee every eight hours to keep a balanced risk exposure. This indicator, known as the funding rate, will turn positive when longs are the ones demanding more leverage.As the above chart indicates, buyers were willing to pay up to 40% per week to leverage their long positions. This is entirely unsustainable and a sign of extreme optimism. Any market downturn would have caused cascading liquidations, with the BTC price accelerating to the downside.Such exorbitant rates no longer exist, albeit the current 4% weekly funding rate has been the highest since June 2019. Nevertheless, scales of magnitude lower than late-2017 outrageous retail-driven long leverage frenzy.Lastly, one should factor in that December 2017 marked the launch of CME and CBOE futures contracts. As Cointelegraph astutely put back then: “This unprecedented event could have a significant impact on the Bitcoin economy.” In retrospect, this seems to have been the peak euphoria signal the bears were waiting for. Thus, Goldman Sachs balking was likely the effect, not the cause. But while Brandt has become well known in the cryptocurrency space for anticipating the 80%-plus correction after the 2017 Bitcoin price top, his track record has been less impressive in recent times. So, to sum up, there is zero evidence to support Brandt’s theory aside from a single event that happened once in the 11 years of Bitcoin trading. Not to mention that the 2017 Goldman Sachs cryptocurrency trading desk rumors had been going for a while.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

165,"Turkey made itself a name as a crypto-friendly country with a ""wait and see"" approach to digital assets, but that could be about to change, as the government is now ready to take things in hand.The Turkish Ministry of Treasury and Finance went to Twitter to express concerns about cryptocurrencies and to announce collaborative work on the topic with several local regulators on Monday.According to the announcement, the ministry is working with the central bank alongside two financial regulatory agencies:Cointelegraph Turkey reached out to local blockchain and crypto experts for comment. Blockchain 101 co-author and Blockchain Turkey Platform's chief editor Ahmet Usta noted that the fast-growing cryptocurrency and digital asset ecosystems can be risky for investors who are uninitiated in the complicated dynamics of crypto. ""I think it would be appropriate to approach the statement by The Ministry of Treasury and Finance within this context, and I hope future regulations will pave the way for innovation while protecting consumers,"" he said. ""I hope Turkey will seize this historical opportunity in the field of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, which made these assets possible and reach a leading position with its exemplary projects in the global arena by creating a healthy ecosystem.""Crypto lecturer İsmail Hakkı Polat told Cointelegraph that the primary goal of the ministry's announcement is to protect consumer rights, stating, ""I believe the first step would be licensing local crypto exchanges to prevent any activities that could potentially harm investors. This can be done by using capital markets as a template.""The second step, according to Polat, could be taxes for crypto trading, perhaps as soon as the third quarter of 2021:Polat also suggested that any potential tax regulation should follow the approach of international institutions such as the Financial Action Task Force and have clear definitions of what constitutes a cryptocurrency.""Lack of definition and regulations for cryptocurrencies would cause confusion of authority among regulatory bodies. Taxes would surely come, but only after a systematic and careful study,"" Polat said.In an earlier interview, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao told Cointelegraph that the exchange worked closely with local regulators when entering Turkey. “Working with governments is key to building a sustainable industry and promoting greater adoption. We are always working with local regulators in our development efforts,” he explained.Özgür Güneri, CEO of major Turkish crypto exchange BtcTurk, expressed open support for regulations in a press release. ""A regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency market would add value to İstanbul Finance Centre strategy and position Turkey as a leader in this industry. We appreciate and support the efforts within this context.""More support for the announcement came from Bitpanda Turkey general manager Elbruz Yılmaz, who said that his exchange has know-how on the regulatory framework of European markets and is ready to participate in local studies on the topic.According to an earlier report from Cointelegraph, the Capital Markets Board of Turkey — the regulatory body overseeing securities markets in the country — had plans to develop guidelines to oversee, audit and regulate crypto markets.Additional reporting by Cointelegraph Turkey’s Ayşe Karaman and Emre Günen."
166,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is outpacing the popular Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model, which predicts that the BTC price will eventually reach $200,000.The S2F model forecasts the long-term price trend of Bitcoin by taking two main factors into account, namely the amount of BTC in existence (the stock) against the amount of newly mined coins entering the market (the flow).According to the S2F multiple, the price of Bitcoin should be hovering at around $36,851 in order for the S2F model to be on track.Due to the recent bull cycle and Bitcoin's strong momentum, BTC/USD is now well above the S2F estimate at around $49,000.Stock-to-Flow Multiple (463d)

S2F multiple: 0.21 pic.twitter.com/rGgfgNmS3CSaifdean Ammous, renowned author of The Bitcoin Standard, emphasized that Bitcoin has rarely diverged from the S2F model since it was created well over two years ago.The accuracy of the S2F model to date suggests that the market is recognizing the value of Bitcoin based on its scarcity and growing demand. Moreover, it highlights Bitcoin's value proposition against the depreciating U.S. dollar and the programmed reduction of the flow (i.e., Bitcoin halvings).Ammous noted:As Cointelegraph previously reported, S2F creator PlanB has said that he has no doubt the price of Bitcoin will reach $100,000 by December 2021, based on the model.New orange dot: Feb close $45,240! (Jan was $33,141 and current price is $46,500) .. like clockwork pic.twitter.com/zcNuTVZQZxIn mid-2020, PlanB said Bitcoin could tap anywhere between $100,000 to $288,000 by December 2021. He said:According to Willy Woo, a prominent on-chain analyst, Bitcoin's monetary velocity is higher than U.S. dolla M1.This simply means that Bitcoin is moving more value than the amount used for spending with the U.S. dollar.Such a trend indicates that Bitcoin is being actively used as a means to transfer value and a store of value simultaneously as it evolves into an established asset. Woo said:Currently, Bitcoin is considered a store of value and a way to hedge against inflation. When the dominant cryptocurrency's adoption as a means of payment and a settlement layer rises, it will likely catalyze a second wave of mainstream adoption and use.At that point, the value of Bitcoin could accelerate further, moving in tandem with the S2F model as the next block reward halving in about three years materializes, potentially moving BTC price further up the S2F curve.Bitcoin could still see major corrections in price, as it did many times during the current and past bull cycles. But the S2F model will still be on track as long as BTC/USD remains within its range of short-term deviations."
167,"Bitcoin (BTC) has delivered returns that are “unheard of” in history and ultimately leave Tesla stock in the dust. That’s according to fresh data from on-chain monitoring resource CaseBitcoin, which this week delved into Bitcoin’s astonishing compound annual growth rate (CAGR).A familiar phrase among crypto and traditional investors alike, CAGR is often overlooked as an overly simple gauge of Bitcoin’s performance versus other assets.In its 12-year existence, however, the largest cryptocurrency has achieved so much that it has, in fact, outperformed everything by an order of magnitude. It barely fits on the scale.As CaseBitcoin summarized, at 196.7%, Bitcoin’s 10-year CAGR “is unmatched in financial history.”“This is an unheard-of number. This means that bitcoin has returned almost 200% (so nearly tripled your money), every single year for 10 years, *compounded*,” the firm wrote in a series of tweets accompanying the figures.CAGR is calculated using the return on investment (ROI) between two dates and working out the average compound return per year that results.Comparing Bitcoin with gold, the S&P 500, the Nasdaq composite index and long-dated U.S. Treasurys, along with Tesla and Amazon stock, CaseBitcoin showed the extent to which Bitcoin is in a different league — and has been since its creation.Second to BTC, for example, is Tesla stock, which has a 10-year CAGR of 63.8%. In third place is Amazon with 33.5%.“Ok, but bitcoin was tiny 10yrs ago, and maybe 10yrs happens to be a cherry-picked timeframe…” CaseBitcoin added in defence of CAGR as a valuable yardstick.The stark figures fuel an existing narrative among some of the Bitcoin world’s best-known, most-exposed investors. Notably among them is MicroStrategy, which this week added to its existing stack of over 90,000 BTC.In August 2020, when the company first announced the conversion of its treasury from cash to Bitcoin, CEO Michael Saylor began to stress the fact that nothing offered comparable returns to Bitcoin or shielded capital from cash inflation. Today, his argument is no different.“Bitcoin has outperformed Gold by 100x over the past decade,” a tweet from Monday reads.MicroStrategy is far from the first to realize the potential in long-term Bitcoin investment. Cointelegraph has been reporting on CAGR prospects since before its 2017 bull run to $20,000."
168,"Following weeks of volatility in the crypto markets and two high-profile legal cases involving crypto firms in New York state, New York Attorney General Letitia James has issued her starkest warning yet to all participants in the industry.In a double alert published on Monday, James warned retail traders that they face heightened risks and low protection, both in terms of regular crypto trading and being potentially subject to ""abusive and unsafe activity"" by bad actors exploiting a period of widespread economic anxiety and high unemployment.Regarding everyday trades and the allure of the 2021 crypto bull market, James's alert pulled no punches. ""Even if you purchase a well-established virtual currency from a more reputable trading platform, the price could crash in an instant,"" the announcement notes, taking pains to stress that cryptocurrency trading is not like traditional stocks, bonds and other assets: Moreover, in the absence of central, comprehensively-regulated exchanges, James warned that those targeted by fraudsters may have ""no recourse"" to help from law enforcement in the state.James's alert to cryptocurrency business operators comes in the wake of last week's settlement with Bitfinex and Tether after they were found to have misrepresented the degree to which Tether (USDT) coins were backed by fiat collateral. The conclusion of the landmark case required the firms to stop servicing customers in the state of New York and to pay $18.5 million in damages to the state.In mid-February, moreover, James sued crypto investment platform Coinseed for allegedly defrauding thousands of investors out of more than $1 million.Given that digital currency is defined as a commodity under New York’s Martin Act, James's notice reminded broker-dealers, investment advisors and trading platforms that they are required by statute to register with the Office of the Attorney General. Should they fail to do so, they will be exposed to both civil and criminal liability and could be prohibited from future conduct, as well as be ordered to pay out restitution and damages.The notice also cites a recent Department of Justice alert that echoed the New York attorney eneral's earlier characterization of crypto trading platforms as being “highly susceptible to abuse,” offering protections for customers that are often “illusory.”"
169,"The globally leading exchange holding company Chicago Board Options Exchange, or CBOE, has filed to list the Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund proposed by asset manager VanEck.CBOE filed a Form 19b-4 requesting permission to list the ETF from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on Jan. 3. On the form, CBOE emphasizes the benefits an ETF would offer to retail investors over the spot Bitcoin markets, including custody:While CBOE did not reveal who its custodian is, the document notes its custodian is “a trust company chartered and regulated by [the New York Department of Financial Services].”Once the SEC has formally acknowledged it is reviewing the application, the regulator has 45 days to deliver its verdict or extend the assessment deadline. The SEC can extend its deliberation period for up to 240 days before finalizing its decision.If approved, the ETF would be the first crypto product offered by CBOE since February 2019, with CBOE having then ceased offering Bitcoin futures contracts. In December 2017, CBOE became the first regulated financial institution in the United States to offer Bitcoin futures contracts, beating out the Chicago Mercantile Exchange by just a couple of weeks.In January, VanEck filed for SEC approval of a Bitcoin ETF. While VanEck had previously filed for a BItcoin ETF in 2017, the firm also teamed up with SolidX — a blockchain firm that had been attempting to bring a Bitcoin ETF to market since 2015 — to file for a jointly issued ETF in 2018. The joint application was withdrawn in September 2019, with the two firms parting ways shortly after.However, VanEck’s latest filing has become the subject of a lawsuit from SolidX, which alleges VanEck plagiarized it product.VanEck also filed for an ETF tracking the performance of prominent crypto firms on Jan. 21. The product would seek the price and performance of the Global Digital Asset Equity Index, which is run by its subsidiary MV Index Solutions.As of the time of writing, the SEC has yet to approve any crypto ETF product."
170,"According to on-chain analytics provider Glassnode, the late-February crypto market correction may have purged excessive leverage from the markets.On March 1, Glassnode published a report analyzing the recent crypto crash, which was only the second significant crypto correction since the markets pushed into new record highs in late 2020.Glassnode noted that the crash peaked with a 25% fall in the price of Bitcoin (BTC) from the local top of $58,300 to $43,343. As such, the move was weaker than January’s dip, which saw a roughly 30% retracement from $42,000 to less than $30,000.The analytics provider suggested that these pullbacks are positive for the crypto markets overall, attributing the latest correction to liquidated leveraged positions held by risky speculators:The report added that several key market indicators were reset as BTC prices found fresh support, including futures open interest, futures funding rates and the price premium for Grayscale’s investment products.Futures open interest, which is the total number of outstanding contracts that have not been settled, dropped almost $4 billion, or 22%, from its peak of $18.4 billion. Glassnode also noted that perpetual futures funding rates have also reset close to zero, which could indicate that traders are not willing to enter short positions, stating:However, the report did note that open interest is still hovering roughly $2.5 billion above the previous peak of $3.9 billion on Feb. 21, meaning there is still significant leverage within the market.Glassnode also noted that shares in Grayscale’s Bitcoin trust are trading at a discount compared with spot market prices for the first time ever, with investors receiving a nearly 4% discount to access exposure to BTC through Grayscale’s trust.It added that competing products such as Canada’s Purpose ETF could diminish Grayscale’s premium as more institutional products enter the market and close arbitrage opportunities.At the time of writing, Bitcoin prices were up 5.3% over the past 24 hours, with BTC currently changing hands for $49,200."

172,"On March 1 cryptocurrency investors woke up to the sight of Bitcoin (BTC) rising from it weekend correction to $44,000 as the market found its bullish momentum and altcoins rebounded from their swing lows.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that the price of Bitcoin increased 16.6% from its low of $43,504 on Feb. 28 to the $50,000 level which bulls are attempting to flip back to support.Earlier in the day, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor tweeted that the firm had purchased another $15 million worth of Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 90,859 BTC and further demonstrating that institutional demand for the top cryptocurrency continues to grow as firms buy each dip’Analysis of key BTC price indicators also shows that bulls were eager to buy the $43,000 retest which occurred over the weekend.Bitcoin’s surge above $49,000 has some calling for new all-time highs in the near future, but according to veteran analyst Peter Brandt, nothing is certain when it comes to the cryptocurrency market.Today Goldman Sachs announced that it would restart its crypto trading desk and Brandt was quick to tweet the following chart and point out that its launch didn’t work out so well for the cryptocurrency market in December 2017. According to David Lifchitz, Chief Investment Officer of ExoAlpha, it’s still “too early to tell” if the pullback in Bitcoin is over but $44,500 appears to have provided strong support.In terms of whether the top cryptocurrency could breakout to new highs in March, Lifchitz said he's uncertain on exactly what might happen as March is historically a bearish trading month for BTC.According to Lifchitz, tax season in the U.S. could put bearish pressures on the market as investors may need to “sell some of their holdings to pay for earlier realized capital gains.”From a bullish perspective, the 20% correction during the second half of February may have signaled an “early start” to the usual March weakness, with the worst of the downturn already transpiring.Lifchitz said:Analysis of Glassnode's Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) metric shows that while both 20% corrections experienced during this cycle have created the “signature sideways and choppy” price action typically seen during bull markets, buyers have been stepping in sooner than they had in previous bull cycles and fewer long-term holders are willing to sell their BTC. The traditional financial markets also rallied on Monday as Treasury yields stabilized and optimism related to the COVID-19 vaccine rollout boosted investor sentiment about the future of the global economy.The S&P 500, Dow and NASDAQ all closed the day in the black, finishing up 2.38%, 1.95% and 3.01% respectively. The strong performance from each index occurred as global central banks world continue to reaffirm commitments to accommodative policies that will support the global economic recovery.Altcoins also recovered their recent losses as Bitcoin price broke out to $50,000.Binance Coin (BNB) was the best performer in the top 10, increasing 21% to $248, while Ethereum (ETH) saw its price rise 9.46% to $1,525. PancakeSwap (CAKE) and Fantom (FTM) both rallied price 36% and currently trade for $12.30 and $0.558 respectively.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.52 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 61%."
173,"Bitcoin's (BTC) severe 26% drop from its $58,300 all-time high on Feb. 20 injected a bit of bearishness into the market, but from a technical perspective, this was purely psychological, as the digital asset held the $43,000 support with ease. This downside move caused indicators like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to hit 38, its lowest level in five months.Even though a $15,400 downside move might seem unusual, 25% and even larger corrections happened on six separate occasions during the 2017 bull run. Moreover, when BTC first made an all-time high at $42,000 on Jan. 8, a 31.5% negative swing to $28,750 happened in the following two weeks.As Bitcoin tried to establish a bottom, derivatives contracts eliminated any bullish signal and momentarily displayed worrisome data. For example, the open interest on futures dropped 22% after peaking at $19.1 billion on Feb. 21.As depicted above, considering the end-of-month expiry impact, BTC futures open interest fell by 22%. Albeit significant, the remaining $14.9 billion is still 44% above the previous month's data.By measuring the futures contracts premium to the current spot levels, one can infer whether professional traders are leaning bullish or bearish. Typically, markets should display a slightly positive annualized rate, a situation known as “contango.”Although the one-month futures contracts premium toned down from the ultra-bullish 6% rate seen mid-February, it did manage to sustain levels above 1.2%. The annualized equivalent is a 70% peak compared with the current 17% rate. Therefore, the futures contracts premium indicates that any excessive leverage from buyers has been eliminated, but we are nowhere near a bear market.Meanwhile, the BTC options markets 25% delta skew measures how the neutral-to-bullish calls are priced compared with equivalent bearish puts.The indicator acts as an options traders' fear and greed gauge and was sitting at -5% until Feb. 21, meaning protection to the upside was more expensive. Over the past week, the 25% delta skew moved to a neutral zone that was last seen almost five months ago.This further confirms the absence of desperation from market makers and top traders while shredding signs of the excessive optimism seen in January.As institutional investors continue to flock to the space, Bitcoin’s volatility tends to have a lessened impact on derivatives markets. To illustrate this new situation, both BTC futures and options markets indicators were far from flashing any red flags despite the 26% price drop.Bitcoin's positive newsflow and institutional investors interest is likely unharmed after the most recent retest of $43,000. Thus, as companies and mutual funds accumulate Bitcoin, instead of framing dips as catastrophic, these moves should be interpreted as buying opportunities.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

174,"The U.S. bond yields have softened and this has ignited investor's appetite for risk-on assets. After a negative closing last week, the S&P 500 has started the current week on a positive note. Thi bullish sentiment has also rubbed on to the crypto sector, which is surging higher, led by Bitcoin (BTC). After Tesla and Mastercard’s foray into Bitcoin, analysts at Citigroup believe that Bitcoin is at a “tipping point,” which could either take it mainstream and make it the preferred currency for world trade or result in a “speculative implosion.”Citi’s analysts expect the central bank digital currencies and the fiat-pegged stablecoins to be positive for Bitcoin’s adoption.While several investors have been worrying about a deeper correction in Bitcoin, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor seems unfazed. Saylor announced that MicroStrategy added another $15 million worth of Bitcoin to its purse, taking its total holding to 90,859 coins which were purchased at an average price of $24,063 per coin.However, not everyone is bullish on Bitcoin. 'Big Short' investor Michael Burry believes that Bitcoin is in a speculative bubble at the current levels and may witness a sharp fall that “will be dramatic and painful.”Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine whether the uptrend has resumed or if the current up-move is only a dead cat bounce.Bitcoin dipped to an intraday low at $43,006.77 on Feb. 28 and the long tail on the day’s candlestick suggests the bulls used the fall to accumulate at lower levels. The buyers are currently trying to sustain the price above the 20-day exponential moving average ($47,711).If they succeed, the BTC/USD pair could be on target to rally to $52,000. The bears are again likely to mount a stiff resistance at this level. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair could consolidate between $43,000 and $52,000 for the next few days.The flat moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) above 55 also point to a possible range-bound action in the near term.However, if the bullish momentum picks up and the buyers push the price above $52,000, a retest of the all-time high at $58,341.03 is possible. This bullish view will invalidate if the pair turns down and breaks below the 50-day simple moving average ($41,313). Such a move could signal the start of a deeper correction to $28,850.Ether’s (ETH) slide below the moving averages shows that it is in a corrective phase. But the long tail on the Feb. 28 candlestick shows that the bulls are attempting to defend the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,413.The bulls are currently attempting to build up on the recovery and sustain the price above the 50-day SMA ($1,509). If they succeed, the next stop is likely to be the 20-day EMA ($1,624), which is likely to act as a stiff hurdle.In a correction, the bears try to sell on relief rallies to the 20-day EMA. If the ETH/USD pair turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest a negative sentiment. The bears will then try to sink the price below $1,289. If they succeed, the decline could extend to the 61.8% retracement level at $1,026.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can propel and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may retest the all-time high at $2,049.The long wick on the Feb. 27 candlestick shows profit-booking near the psychological resistance at $1.50. However, the long tail on Cardano’s (ADA) Feb. 28 candlestick suggests that bulls continue to accumulate at lower levels.Although rising moving averages are a bullish sign, the negative divergence on the RSI indicates that the momentum may be weakening.If the bears sink the price below $1.55, the ADA/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($1.02). This is an important support to watch out for because a rebound off it will suggest that traders continue to accumulate on dips.A breakout of the $1.50 resistance could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $1.83 and then $2. This bullish view will invalidate if the pair breaks below $0.98.Binance Coin (BNB) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($200) on Feb 28 and the bulls have pushed the price above the downtrend line. If the bulls can sustain the price above the downtrend line, it will suggest the start of a relief rally.The rising moving averages and the RSI above 61 suggest that bulls have the upper hand. The first target on the upside is $281 and if that is crossed, the BNB/USD pair may rally to $309.4995.Contrary to this assumption, if the price fails to sustain above the downtrend line, it will suggest that traders who are stuck at higher levels are bailing out of their positions. The trend will signal a deeper correction if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA.In an uptrend, traders buy the dips to the 20-day EMA as it offers a low-risk entry opportunity. Therefore, Polkadot’s (DOT) current bounce off the 20-day EMA ($31) suggests the uptrend remains intact.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is above 64, indicating the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the bulls can drive the price above $35.6618, the DOT/USD pair may rally to $42.2848.This bullish view may invalidate if the price turns down from the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that traders are using the relief rallies to lighten up their long positions.The bulls are attempting to defend the 50-day SMA ($0.40). If the current bounce sustains, the buyers will try to push XRP above $0.50. If that happens, the altcoin could start its journey to $0.65.However, the bulls are unlikely to have it easy because the downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.472) and the RSI below 50 suggest that bears have the upper hand.If the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance at the 20-day EMA, the bears will try to sink the price below the 50-day SMA. If they succeed, the XRP/USD pair may drop to $0.359. A break below this support could start a sharper decline to $0.25.Litecoin (LTC) broke below the 50-day SMA ($166) and dipped to the uptrend line on Feb. 28, but the long tail on the day’s candlestick shows strong buying at lower levels. The bulls are currently trying to push the price towards the $185.58 overhead resistance.They are likely to meet stiff resistance from the bears at the 20-day EMA ($186). If the price turns down from this resistance, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the LTC/USD pair below the uptrend line. If they can manage to do that, a drop to $120 is likely.On the other hand, if the bulls can propel the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rally to $205 and then to $240.The bulls are trying to stall the correction at the 50-day SMA ($25.26). Although the price dipped below the 50-day SMA on Feb. 28, the long tail on the candlestick suggests buying at lower levels. Chainlink (LINK) is currently attempting to start a relief rally.If the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA ($27.98) and the $29.33 overhead resistance, it will suggest that the correction may be over. The LINK/USD pair could then rally to $34 and then to the all-time high at $36.93.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the bears will try to sink and sustain the pair below the 50-day SMA. If that happens, a drop to $20.11 is possible.Stellar Lumens (XLM) broke above the 20-day EMA ($0.428) on Feb. 27, but the bulls could not push the price above the resistance line of the descending channel. This suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.However, the positive sign is that the bulls have successfully defended the 50-day SMA ($0.369) on Feb. 28. If the XLM/USD pair rises above the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to drive the price above the channel. If they succeed, the pair could rally to $0.50.On the other hand, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the pair may again drop to the 50-day SMA. The flat moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a few days of range-bound action.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) broke below the uptrend line on Feb. 28, but the bulls purchased the dip as seen from the long tail on the day’s candlestick. If the current rebound sustains, the bulls will try to start a relief rally that may reach the 20-day EMA ($551).The bears are likely to defend the 20-day EMA and if the price turns down from this resistance, it will suggest that the sentiment remains negative. A break below the uptrend line could result in a fall to $370.Both moving averages have started to turn down and the RSI is in the negative territory, indicating advantage to the bears. However, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair could rise to $631.71.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

175,"MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin buying spree shows no signs of slowing after CEO Michael Saylor announced the purchase of another 328 Bitcoin (BTC) on Monday. The acquisition, which was paid for in cash, cost the firm around $15 million and equated to an average coin price of $45,710 at the time of purchase.The investment takes MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 90,859 coins — a haul worth $4.3 billion based on the current price. The firm has essentially dollar-cost-averaged into Bitcoin over the course of the past five months, leaving the average price of each of its Bitcoin purchases at $24,063 per coin. Saylor tweeted on Monday:MicroStrategy has purchased an additional ~328 bitcoins for ~$15.0 million in cash at an average price of ~$45,710 per #bitcoin. As of 3/1/2021, we #hodl ~90,859 bitcoins acquired for ~$2.186 billion at an average price of ~$24,063 per bitcoin. $MSTRhttps://t.co/fGH5KacsPIThe firm first acquired Bitcoin in August 2020 when it made an initial $250 million outlay on 21,454 coins. MicroStrategy continued to buy more BTC at various points toward the end of 2020, eventually accumulating over 70,000 coins by the turn of the year.In February, the business intelligence firm announced that it would raise an additional $900 million for further Bitcoin purchases — a sum that eventually exceeded $1 billion when an additional 19,452 coins were purchased last Wednesday.MicroStrategy’s total outlay on Bitcoin stands at $2.18 billion, while current coin prices would value the firm’s holdings at $4.3 billion, meaning the firm would have made over $2 billion in five months were it to sell. However, there is little reason to suggest this will happen any time soon. Saylor previously said buying Bitcoin was one of the firm’s two corporate goals, along with growing its analytics software business."
176,"Hackers have threatened to release sensitive company documents supposedly belonging to USDT stablecoin issuer Tether unless the firm sends a 500 Bitcoin (BTC) ransom to a specified address.As revealed by the official Twitter account for Tether on Sunday, hackers purportedly threatened to leak documents that would “harm the Bitcoin ecosystem” if their ransom demands were not met. Tether has already stated that it will not pay the ransom, which amounts to a dollar value of $23.8 million at the time of publication. The firm tweeted:The firm said the extortionists’ motivations weren’t clear, noting that it could be a simple cash grab or part of a greater effort to undermine Tether and the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem.“It is unclear whether this is a basic extortion scheme like those directed at other crypto companies or people looking to undermine Tether and the crypto community as a whole,"" the firm tweeted. ""Either way, those seeking to harm Tether are getting increasingly desperate.""Tether may have assumed the worst of its troubles were behind it after reaching a settlement in the landmark case launched against the company by the Office of the New York Attorney General. Putting an end to the legal uncertainty surrounding Tether in the past few years, the firm was ordered to pay an $18.5 million fine and to submit regular reports of its reserves. The firm stressed that it had admitted to no wrongdoing in the wake of the judgment by the New York court.On Sunday, Tether warned customers that forged documents were circulating on the internet that alleged to be genuine communications between Tether and representatives of Deltec Bank and Trust.The tweet and Twitter account from which the documents were posted have since been deleted, although peripheral discussion surrounding the posts can still be found on Reddit.Now, Tether will seek help from authorities regarding what it deems to be a “pretty sad shakedown attempt.” A tweet from the company stated:The deadline by which Tether was ordered to pay the 500 BTC ransom has since passed. Speaking to Cointelegraph, a Tether representative reiterated that the documents are fake. They stated that copies of the threats have been forwarded to law enforcement and that the company is unaware of the ransomer's identity. "
177,"Authorities of the Chinese autonomous region of Inner Mongolia have proposed closing down all local cryptocurrency mining facilities to reduce energy consumption in the region.The Inner Mongolia National Development and Reform Commission, or NDRC, released an official proposal to shut down local crypto mining operations in line with its energy-saving rules.Published Thursday of last week, the draft proposal suggests to “comprehensively clean up and shut down virtual currency mining projects” by the end of April. The authority also proposed a strict ban on new cryptocurrency mining projects in the region. The NDRC will collect public feedback on the draft proposal until Wednesday.According to a Reuters report, Inner Mongolia was the only one of 30 mainland areas under Beijing’s energy consumption and energy intensity review that failed to meet energy-saving targets in 2019.As part of the new energy control proposal, Inner Mongolia aims to cap its energy consumption growth at about 5 million tons of standard coal equivalent in 2021. The authority also plans to cut energy intensity — the amount of energy consumed per unit of economic growth — by 3% from 2020 levels. Between 2016 and 2019, energy intensity in the region reportedly spiked 9.5%, whereas the overall energy consumption rose by nearly 65 million tons.Inner Mongolia became a popular destination for cryptocurrency miners due to low electricity prices. Local authorities, however, have apparently been planning a crackdown on crypto mining operations in the region in recent years, issuing multiple statements scrutinizing local mining businesses. In August 2020, Inner Mongolia officials considered a new policy preventing crypto miners from using state-subsidized electricity."
178,"Bitcoin (BTC) is looking stable at the start of a new week after recovering from a drop to $43,000 — what’s in store?After last week’s 20% drop from all-time highs, opinions are divided over what the future might look like for Bitcoin price action in the short term. Macro factors are encouraging, but naysayers insist that a major crash is still a distinct possibility.Cointelegraph highlights five factors that could be set to influence BTC/USD in the coming days.Macro is looking to deliver a perfect storm for alternative assets, led by the United States. President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package has been under review by lawmakers, who have all but given the green light for yet another unfathomably large money-printing exercise to begin.Traditionally a boon for Bitcoin, the huge increases in the dollar supply are set to include direct payments to eligible Americans, this time $1,400.The third such “stimulus check” — or “stimmy,” as it is popularly referred to — could easily find its way into the Bitcoin ecosystem if historic trends repeat themselves this year. As Cointelegraph reported, in 2020, amounts equal to stimulus check payouts began appearing on exchanges soon after regulators approved them.While it was a niche phenomenon a year ago, this March is an entirely different playing field for Bitcoin and altcoins, with prices exploding and with the publicity in recent months.Coupled with the ongoing appeal and controversy of social-media-inspired stock trading, the potential impact on cryptocurrency more broadly from the U.S.’ “free money” could hardly be more obvious.“In the US a $1.9 trillion stimulus package is on the way. That's more than all the cash currently sitting on the US Treasury account at the Federal Reserve,” on-chain analytics service Ecoinometrics summarized to Twitter followers.On the topic of stocks, these have been rallying once again after a global bond sell-off last week had regulators concerned.So too has the strength of the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY), which continues its climb from late last week after hitting lows of 89.67. At the time of writing, the DXY measured over 91 for the first time since Feb. 8.A strong DXY tends to come hand in hand with price problems for BTC/USD, a persistent trait that characterized much of last year.With the temporary boost of the stimulus package likely to wear off sooner rather than later, however, the status quo may not endure for long.“There is little doubt in my mind that central banks will eventually lean quite hard against a sustained rise in yields,” Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said in an admonitory note to clients quoted by Reuters.Within Bitcoin, much attention is still being given to “the dip” across social media and further afield.After hitting lows of just above $43,000 over the weekend, bulls were left disappointed that previous bottoms around the $44,000 had not constituted a definitive floor.Against a backdrop of unbelievable performance since March 2020, however, the dive of $15,000 from all-time highs of $58,300 last month seemed almost like a non-event for some.“The panic of yesterday was so unnecessary. Welcome to the markets, dips happen. Part of the game,” Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe wrote on Monday.In a fresh video update, Van de Poppe noted that the net balance on exchanges is still decreasing, indicating that buyer appetite is clearly present at current levels and investors are making the most of cheaper levels to accumulate, not sell.“You shouldn’t be worrying at all about this correction as this is just a very healthy and natural correction that we’re seeing on the markets here, especially given that we’ve just anticipated a run from $10,000 to $58,000 in just a matter of months,” he said.For bulls, it is important to avoid a deeper drop to take liquidity below the $42,000 level. Should Bitcoin avoid this, a chance to move higher remains.For Bitcoin metrics, the dip has also been a positive, rather than negative, sign. Most prominent among them is the spent output profit ratio (SOPR), which benefited from a “reset” as BTC/USD returned to the mid-$40,000 range.As Cointelegraph reported, SOPR provides a window into trader mentality: Once it turns negative, it indicates that anyone selling BTC is selling it at a loss.“The daily Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has seen a full reset, and turned negative for the first time in five months — investors were on average moving BTC at a slight loss, indicating profit-taking has abated,” on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode said in a series of tweets at the weekend.Total realized losses for Feb. 27 alone were $243 million from wallets taking a hit on their balance.Beyond the SOPR, derivatives funding rates saw a “reset” of their own last week as a major options expiry date came and went on Friday. Short traders, with that, are effectively paying long positions once again, rather than the other way around.The combined impact of these two phenomena is only good for Bitcoin, with historical precedent serving to support the theory that their current behavior is a bullish signal.A final round of resets focuses on sentiment rather than numbers. In an update, market insight firm Santiment noted that Bitcoin was getting its most negative press on social media in five months.Far from being a cause for concern, however, the implication could be that a BTC buy-in is a prime move to capitalize on overly cautious investor mood.“Buying into crowd fear can lead to rewards,” Santiment wrote on Twitter.In a breath of fresh air, meanwhile, the popular Crypto Fear & Greed Index, previously near all-time highs, has almost halved in a matter of days.Based on multiple factors, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index aims to process sentiment to provide a rough idea of when crypto markets are overly bearish or unreasonably bullish.At the time of writing, the index measured 38, its lowest level since September 2020."
179,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) recovered by more than 8% overnight on March 1 following a steep drop during the weekend.There are three reasons the price of Bitcoin recovered swiftly over the past 24 hours. They include the recovering global stock market, rising Coinbase premium and a typical weekend reversal.The global stock market started to recover as soon as the market opened on Monday.The stock market slumped during the past week due to the rising Treasury yield curve. As the bond market rallied, risk-on assets, such as stocks, saw a pullback.Holger Zschaepitz said the global risk markets started the week strongly as bond yields eased. He said:Although Bitcoin is considered a safe-haven asset and a store of value, it often moves in tandem with the risk-on market.This trend occurs because the market capitalization of Bitcoin is still hovering at around $1 trillion. Bitcoin's valuation is relatively small compared with other safe-haven assets like gold. Hence, there is a higher probability that it would be more affected by macro factors, at least in the short term.Analysts at Santiment explained:The simultaneous recovery of the global stock market and cryptocurrencies followed a minor correction in the crypto market over the weekend.Historically, when the price of Bitcoin falls hard during the weekend, BTC often sees a relief rally in the following week.This likely occurs because there is generally lower volume during the weekend. Hence, the trend can change sharply when a new weekly candle emergesDuring the past 12 hours, the Coinbase premium rebounded to around $100. Prior to the reversal, Coinbase was selling at a lower price than Binance, which meant there was strong selling pressure coming from the United States.As Cointelegraph reported, the futures funding rate resetting signaled that the market became less overheated. This coinciding with the Coinbase premium returning was a solid signal of improving appetite for Bitcoin, particularly in the United States.When the price of Bitcoin trades lower on Coinbase, it is a sign of short-term bearishness because the U.S. dollar pair naturally trades higher than Tether (USDT).In the foreseeable future, based on the recovering stock market trend and the consistently high Coinbase premium, the crypto market has a good chance of rebounding this week.Whale clusters from Whalemap also show that $46,000 and $56,000 are the key support and resistance levels in the short term.Since Bitcoin rebounded strongly from $46,000, there is a high probability that it could rally to $56,000 in the next impulse wave."
180,"Crypto-friendly Japanese retailer Rakuten is now enabling users of Rakuten Wallet, its crypto exchange subsidiary, to easily spend their cryptocurrency holdings in everyday transactions. According to an announcement published last Wednesday, users are now able to load up their Rakuten Pay accounts seamlessly with their wallet holdings of Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ether (ETH). Rakuten Pay is a mobile payment app that is operational nationwide and supported at a wide range of large- and medium-scale retailers. Back in 2019, Rakuten had already enabled consumers to convert their Rakuten Group loyalty points to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Now, a deeper integration is being implemented, tying together Rakuten Wallet, Rakuten Cash (Rakuten's e-money service) and Rakuten Pay to support cryptocurrency spending at retailers such as McDonald's, Seiyu and FamilyMart.There will be no conversion fees between fiat, e-money and crypto holdings, although there is a minimum spend amount of 1,000 yen (roughly $9.40) and a monthly upper limit of around 100,000 yen (roughly $940).To make use of the integration, users will need to be a Rakuten member and have a trading account set up for Rakuten Wallet. The company is also offering a small bonus of Rakuten points to incentivize the new service."
181,"The world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), is at a defining moment in history, according to analysis from United States investment bank Citigroup.Bitcoin is now at a “tipping point” to either become the preferred currency for international trade or face a “speculative implosion,” Citi analysts reportedly said.According to a Reuters report Monday, Citi analysts are confident that Bitcoin is on the cusp of going mainstream. According to the report, Bitcoin’s tremendous potential has been fueled by recent big Bitcoin moves by companies like Tesla and Mastercard.Citi analysts wrote, “There are a host of risks and obstacles that stand in the way of Bitcoin progress. But weighing these potential hurdles against the opportunities leads to the conclusion that Bitcoin is at a tipping point.”Citi analysts also hinted that the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin could be helped along by digital currency developments like central bank digital currencies and fiat-pegged stablecoins. The news comes amid a major correction on the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin dropping below $44,000 yesterday after hitting a new all-time high of above $58,000 earlier in February. At publishing time, Bitcoin is trading at $47,285, up around 4.5% over the past 24 hours, according to data from Cointelegraph’s Bitcoin price index.According to some experts, global regulation could be one of the biggest hurdles for Bitcoin’s adoption by institutional investors. Bridgewater's director of investment research, Rebecca Patterson, said last Wednesday that regulatory certainty around Bitcoin would solve some of the cryptocurrency’s biggest problems associated with high volatility and low liquidity."
182,"Since 2017, investors have been anxiously awaiting a Bitcoin ETF approval as the existence of such a fund was an important symbol of mass adoption and acceptance from the realm of traditional finance. On Feb. 18, the Toronto Stock Exchange hosted the official launch of the Purpose Bitcoin ETF and the fund quickly absorbed more than $333 million in market capitalization in just two days.Now that the long-awaited Bitcoin ETF is here, investors are curious about how it will compete with Grayscale Investments GBTC fund. On Feb. 17, Ark Investment Management founder and CEO Cathie Wood said the likelihood that U.S. regulators will approve a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund has gone up.Although exchange-traded funds (ETF) and exchange-traded notes (ETN) sound quite similar, there are fundamental differences in trading, risks, and taxation.An ETF is a security type that holds underlying investments such as commodities, stocks, or bonds. It often resembles a mutual fund, as it is pooled and managed by its issuer.ETFs have become a $7.7 trillion industry, growing by 65% in the last two years alone.The most recognizable example is the SPY, a fund that tracks the S&P 500 index, currently managed by State Street. Invesco's QQQ is another EFT that tracks U.S.-based large-capitalization technology companies.More exotic structures are available, such as the ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil ($SCO). Using derivatives products, this fund aims to offer two times the daily short leverage on oil prices.Exchange-traded notes (ETN) are similar to an ETF in that trading occurs using traditional brokers. Still, the difference is an ETN is a debt instrument issued by a financial institution. Even if the fund has a redemption program, the credit risk relies entirely on its issuer.For example, after Lehman Brothers imploded in 2008, it took ETN investors more than a decade to recoup the investment.On the other hand, buying an ETF gives one direct ownership of its contents, creating different taxation events when holding futures contracts and leveraging positions. Meanwhile, ETNs are taxed exclusively upon sale.Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust Fund (GBTC) is the absolute leader in the cryptocurrency market, with $35 billion in assets under management.Investment trusts are structured as companies — at least in regulatory form — and are 'closed-end funds.' Thus, the number of shares available is limited and the supply and demand for them largely determines their price.Investment trust funds are regulated by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), therefore outside the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) authority.GBTC shares cannot easily be created, neither is there an active redemption program in place. This tends to generate significant price discrepancies from its Net Asset Value, which is the underlying BTC fraction represented.An ETF, on the other hand, allows the market maker to create and redeem shares at will. Therefore, a premium or discount is usually unlikely if enough liquidity is in place.An ETF instrument is far more acceptable to mutual fund managers and pension funds as it carries much less risk than a closed-ended trust like GBTC. Retail investors may not have been aware of the possibility that GBTC trades below net assets value. Thus the recent event might further pressure investors to move their position to the Canadian ETF.To sum up, an ETF product carries a significantly less risk due to greater transparency and the possibility to redeem shares in the case of shares trading at a discount.Nevertheless, the impressive GBTC market capitalization clearly states that institutional investors are already on board.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

183,"Bitcoin (BTC) price has been correcting in the past few days and traders are curious to know whether this is a minor pullback or the start of a deeper decline. The problem is that no one has a crystal ball and analysts can only point to critical support levels that may hold based on historical data and evidence. However, in a bear phase, the price tends to slip below key support levels as traders panic and sell out of fear, similar to how the price exceeds the upside targets during a bull run as traders buy due to FOMO.March has historically been a weak month for Bitcoin, which suggests seasonal traders may prefer to wait and watch rather than jump to buy on dips. This lack of demand may be one of the reasons for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust premium dipping into the negative over the past week.However, not all the data is bearish. On Feb. 26, Moskovski Capital CEO Lex Moskovski pointed out that Bitcoin miners positions turned positive on Feb. 26 for the first time since Dec. 27. Adding to this, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said the large Coinbase outflows in the past few days suggest that institutions are still accumulating at lower levels.This data seems to be inconclusive and does not provide an immediate picture of whether the advantage is with the bulls or the bears. Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the next few days.Bitcoin has broken below the 20-day exponential moving average ($47,441), which is the first indication of the start of a deeper correction. The next critical support is the 50-day simple moving average at $41,066. The price has not closed below this support since Oct. 9, hence the level assumes significance.The bulls are likely to defend the 50-day SMA aggressively. If the price rebounds off this support and rises above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the sentiment remains bullish and traders are buying on dips.However, the flat moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) just below the midpoint suggest the bulls are losing their grip.If the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA, it will indicate that supply exceeds demand and traders are booking profits in a hurry. Such a move could pull the price down to the Feb. 8 intraday low of $38,000.A break below this support will be a huge negative as the next support is at $32,000 and then $28,850.The downsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the negative zone suggest that bears are in control. The price is now approaching the critical support at $41,959.63.If the price rebounds off this support, the bulls will try to push the price above the 20-EMA. If they succeed, it will suggest that bulls are accumulating the dips aggressively. The BTC/USD pair may then rise to the 50-SMA and then $52,000.Conversely, if the $41,959.63 support breaks and the bears flip it to resistance, then a deeper correction is likely.Binance Coin (BNB) has been in a corrective phase since Feb. 20, which shows that traders are booking profits after the sharp up-move on Feb. 19. However, the pace of the fall has been gradual since Feb. 25, indicating that traders are not panicking.The price has currently dropped to the 20-day EMA ($194) where the buyers may step in. If the price rebounds off this support and breaks above the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair may again attract buying from short-term traders. That could push the price to $280 and then to $300.The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI is just above the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. However, if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that supply exceeds demand, The pair could then correct to $167.3691 and then $118.The 4-hour chart shows the formation of a descending triangle pattern that will complete on a breakdown and close below $189. If that happens, it will suggest that the top is in place and the pair could then drop to $118.Conversely, if the bulls defend the support at $189, it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive as the bulls are buying on dips to strong support levels. A breakout and close above the downtrend line will invalidate the bearish setup and that may result in a rally to $280.Polkadot (DOT) is correcting in an uptrend. The long tail on the Feb. 23 and Feb. 26 candlestick suggests that the bulls are attempting to defend the 20-day EMA ($30.49). However, the long wick on the rebound on Feb. 27 shows that demand dries up at higher levels.The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is dropping towards the center, which suggests the bullish momentum is weakening. However, during the recent bull run, the DOT/USD pair has repeatedly taken support at the 20-day EMA.If the price again rebounds off the 20-day EMA and the bulls push the price above $35.6618, the pair may retest the all-time high at $42.2848. A break above this resistance could result in a rally to $50.This bullish view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $25.7817. If that happens, the pair may drop to the 50-day SMA ($22.33). The 4-hour chart shows the price is currently trading inside a symmetrical triangle. If the bears can sink the price below the support line of the triangle, the pair could drop to $25.7817 and then to the pattern target at $18.70.The downsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the negative territory suggest a minor advantage to the bears in the short term. But if the price rebounds off the current level, the bulls will try to push the price above the triangle. If they succeed, the pair may rise to $42.2848.The bulls defended the 20-day EMA ($0.475) on Feb. 26, which shows that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls are currently attempting to resume the uptrend in NEM (XEM).The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 63 suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the bulls can drive the price above $0.5051, the XEM/USD pair could rally to $0.7637. A breakout of this resistance could open the doors for an up-move to $0.9607.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from $0.5051, the pair may consolidate for a few days before starting the next trending move. A break and close below the 20-day EMA will suggest the start of a deeper correction.The 4-hour chart shows the price is stuck between $0.439 and $0.63 for the past few days. Both moving averages are sloping up marginally and the RSI is just above the midpoint, which suggests a minor advantage to the bulls.If the bulls can propel the price above $0.63, the pair may rally to $0.763 and then to $0.821. On the contrary, if the price breaks below the moving averages, the pair may drop to the $0.439 support. If this support also cracks, the correction may extend to $0.346 and then to $0.277.MIOTA has been in a corrective phase since topping out at $1.554775 on Feb. 19. While the pullback has been sharp, the positive sign is that the bulls have been successfully defending the 20-day EMA ($1.09) for the past few days.The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI is also trading just above the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. Attempts by the bulls and the bears to assert their supremacy have failed in the past few days.This equilibrium may tilt in favor of the bulls if they can push and sustain the price above the overhead resistance at $1.30. In such a case, the MIOTA/USD pair may rally to $1.554775.On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below $0.90, a fall to the 50-day SMA ($0.74) is possible.The 4-hour chart shows the formation of a symmetrical triangle, which generally acts as a continuation pattern. Both moving averages are gradually turning down and the RSI is in the negative territory, indicating advantage to the bears.The pair has broken below the support line of the triangle but the bulls are attempting to arrest the decline and push the price back into the triangle. If they succeed, it will suggest buying at lower levels. The bulls will gain the upper hand after the pair sustains above the triangle.However, if the price turns down from the current levels, it may signal the start of a deeper correction.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

184,"Google Finance has added crypto prices to the finance.google.com domain. The section, titled “Crypto,” now appears in the “Compare Markets” category alongside conventional stock and currency markets. The section provides key pricing information for various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).Google's parent, Alphabet, also owns video platform YouTube — which has consistently irked crypto users by banning educational and news content, often seemingly at random. Cointelegraph and CoinDesk, the two largest publications in the crypto news space, have both been subject to suspensions that have subsequently been overturned after the video streaming platform confirmed they were not in violation of YouTube's terms of service.The cryptocurrency market has attracted mainstream attention over the past year, as institutional investors and corporations have started to invest in the asset class. Their involvement helped launch the cryptocurrency market cap past $1 trillion in January. The crypto market cap would eventually peak north of $1.7 trillion in February before experiencing a pullback. At current values, the digital asset class is worth over $1.4 trillion.Both retail adoption and institutional interest has been growing rapidly over the last three months. And with major firms like Tesla and Mastercard actively embracing cryptocurrencies, the need for clearer regulation is growing, according to United States Securities and Exchange Commissioner Hester Peirce.Calls for clearer guidelines on digital assets will likely grow louder as the bull market heats up. In the meantime, Peirce says, the new Biden administration can provide a fresh look at the regulatory aspect."
185,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped to the key $44,000-$45,000 support level on Feb. 28 for the third time in the past week.The BTC/USD pair briefly dipped below $44,000 on Bitstamp before paring some of the losses, bouncing back above $45,000 at the time of writing. Some analysts have pointed out an uptick in miners' selling as the reason behind the latest drop in price. It's a whale war, and you know who got the real power.

- Miner to Exchange Flows = SELL pic.twitter.com/fhVBp8qocmFortunately, the third retest of this key support level may have a silver lining for the bulls. Data analytics resource Glassnode noted that the daily Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has seen a ""full reset.""The SOPR essentially shows whether spent outputs are in profit or loss at the time of transaction. This key metric turned negative for the first time since September 2020. In other words, investors are now moving BTC at a slight loss on average, suggesting that profit-taking has abated, according to Glassnode. ""In total, we saw an on-chain net realized loss of $243 million yesterday,"" the analysts added.Meanwhile, popular trader Philip Swift, the co-founder of trading suite Decentrader and creator of the Golden Ratio multiplier method, also pointed out the SOPR crash.He considers this a potentially bullish turnaround for BTC price in combination with last week's reset of derivatives funding rates because such events have previously coincided with the start of new uptrends.  ""The SOPR has now reset (green on the chart) meaning that wallets selling are now selling at a loss,"" he explained, adding:The last time the SOPR flipped green was five months ago when Bitcoin was trading around $10,000. At the time, this was a key hurdle for BTC to trigger a new bull market. Since then, the price has surged more than five folds to new all-time highs of around $58,000. Nevertheless, many traders remain cautious as the market enters the month of March, which has historically been bearish for cryptocurrencies, and all markets in general. ""I think March may be slow with a lack of confidence in traditional markets but overall I am bullish Bitcoin and expect significantly higher over the next three months,"" said Swift in private comments. In the meantime, Bitcoin traders are keeping a close eye on the $44,000-$45,000 level. Trader Willy Woo, for instance, says the $45K level is very strong support and expects any dips below this level to be bought up aggressively should they occur. UTXO Realized Price Distribution. This is the on-chain, more precise version of volume profile. The peaks represent the price where most coins changed hands.

$45k upwards is very strong support.

Any dip (if you're are lucky) into $39k is a no-brainer BTFD.

186,"Coinbase’s IPO announcement has been hailed as “a milestone for the crypto industry” by Fortune Magazine. Similar to the Netscape IPO announcement that signaled the legitimacy of the internet, Coinbase’s impending public offering signals to the public at large that cryptocurrency trading is legitimate, legal and secure in the eyes of the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, investors have an opportunity to own stock on the largest crypto trading platform in the United States.As a result, many see an investment in Coinbase as an investment in the future of crypto trading. It is the highest volume U.S. crypto exchange, with three times the volume of its next closest U.S. competitor. The largest of anything in the U.S. must be the world leader. Except, it’s not. And conventional wisdom and current market realities are very far apart.In order to understand the nuances of the crypto trading platform market, one must understand some important facts.These are important implications that shape current market maturity and the problems institutional crypto traders face today. There is no single exchange that enables traders to access global trading markets, cross-border price discovery, global best prices, global liquidity or decentralized trading markets.Together, the top five crypto exchanges represent only 41% of the total global trading volume. Coinbase, the largest exchange in the U.S., generates only 2.1% of global volume. The number one ranked exchange in the U.S. ranks only 19th globally. In the global market, there is no dominant player as we’d expect to see in a more mature market.According to the data above, the New York Stock Exchange’s share of global equity trading is more than 12 times higher than Coinbase’s, and the top two U.S. equity exchanges account for over 50% of global daily trading volume, while the top two U.S. crypto exchanges represent only 3% of the global trading volume.Compared to traditional stocks, the crypto market is also highly fragmented. The top two stock exchanges represent 51% of daily trading volume, while the top three crypto exchanges represent only 27% of daily trading volume.The crypto trading market is still in its infancy. Based on my conversations with institutional traders and independent professional traders, I’ve learned that institutions are still clamoring for institutional-grade capabilities that are not yet available on a single platform, such as:Each exchange is its own trading “lake” with no “canal” connecting them. In the U.S., a trader can only trade with 2.1% of global users, with an order book that is completely separate and distinct from other U.S. trading markets — e.g., Coinbase and Kraken.Global trading volume, liquidity and price discovery are available only to those who are able to manage multiple accounts across multiple exchanges in multiple countries and continents. It’s a tall order that ties up both legal and technical resources.Clearly, traders would benefit from a single, global order book normalized in a single currency to discover the best global prices along with the liquidity required to execute large block trades. The industry sorely needs crypto’s equivalent of traditional securities’ National Best Bid and Offer.Binance and Coinbase are centralized exchanges that match buyers’ orders with sellers’ orders, executing trades and settling accounts. Customers’ crypto assets are held in custody by an exchange, and users only trade with other users on the same exchange. Even in aggregate, centralized exchanges don’t capture the entirety of digital asset trading volume.This is because decentralized exchanges are on the rise, enabling peer-to-peer trades (or swaps), in which assets are exchanged directly between traders, typically without Know Your Customer. At one point during 2020, Uniswap’s trading volume exceeded that of Coinbase’s. It’s possible that DEXs will gain an even footing with CEXs, so one cannot gain a full picture of the crypto trading market without taking DEXs into account.The CEXs that figure out how to incorporate DEX price discovery and liquidity into their trading will have an important advantage.Decentralized exchanges generate approximately 15% of the total crypto trading volume (based on CoinMarketCap data on Feb. 16, 2021). DEX trading has been growing fast, with Uniswap’s trading volume surpassing Coinbase’s in 2020 — a feat achieved with only 20 employees. Today, Venus is trending alongside Binance, which leads the market in 24-hour trading volume at the time of writing.Professional traders may value DEXs for the security of wallet-to-wallet, or peer-to-peer, trades. However, there are two issues. First, without counterparty KYC, institutional traders cannot trade on DEXs. Second, the public chain technology supporting DEXs is slower and more expensive than exchange trading.Institutional investors will need DEXs that are faster, with lower fees and robust KYC procedures. A DEX must be built on a faster, less expensive blockchain in order to attract institutional traders.Confusing matters even more, today’s crypto exchanges are more like regional brokers than true, global exchanges. For example, compare and contrast trading Apple (AAPL) on E-Trade versus trading Bitcoin (BTC) on Coinbase.A professional trader in the U.S. seeking to trade BTC accesses only a small portion of the global market via Coinbase. Price discovery and liquidity are only by Coinbase’s BTC/USD order book. Over 97% of the world’s world’s supply, demand, price discovery and liquidity are only accessible via hundreds of other exchanges.To sum up, selling Apple on E-Trade compared to selling Bitcoin on Coinbase:There is no truly global crypto trading market but rather hundreds of smaller, local markets. Imagine AAPL selling on 300+ different exchanges, each with its own buyers and sellers. This is the current state of the global crypto market.The problems with this are twofold. First, trading on a CEX strips away many of the benefits of decentralized assets. Second, crypto trading is segregated into hundreds of discrete trading “lakes” — each with its own local fiat/crypto supply and demand.Decentralization ensures no single entity can fully control a cryptocurrency. Users cede significant control when depositing in centralized exchanges that manage token listing privileges, custodianship, order matching and execution, and brokerage services.This centralized power presents security and compliance hazards, which has led to market criticisms. In fact, Asia–Pacific traders have launched several coin withdrawal campaigns to show their resistance to CEX trading. The younger generation is averse to centralized power and daring to challenge it, as evidenced by the recent retail shorting war in the United States.Centralized exchanges are also limited in their access to the global market and are severely limited. Why? Exchanges, such as Coinbase and Gemini, accept users from limited regions (the U.S. only) with limited fiat currency trading pairs (the United States dollar only) unlike E-Trade, which opens the doors for its traders to a multitude of exchanges, equities, exchange-traded funds and more. In contrast, CEXs close the doors to all others, severely limiting price discovery and liquidity, which leads to higher spreads, lower fill rates, higher slippage and, generally, inefficient markets. The concept of Best Bid and Offer does not yet exist in the crypto world, as the BBO on Coinbase is not the same as Gemini’s, Binance’s or Huobi’s.From the perspective of professional traders, the market maturity and global trading capabilities required are not yet available. Cryptocurrency trading market segmentation is in its infancy, and the needs of professional traders are far from being met because: (1) they cannot efficiently access a global market; (2) they cannot access the best prices in a global market, and they cannot access institutional-grade liquidity.Furthermore, DEX trading is not yet viable for institutional traders due to the lack of KYC during onboarding. Yet, the average Uniswap trader is far more active. Uniswap users are completely on-chain, open and transparent, and its 300,000 users trade more than Coinbase’s, which claims to have 35 million users. Therefore, an entire market of whales is trading outside of centralized exchanges, completely overturning the market misperception that Uniswap and DEX users are mainly retail investors.No trading market exists that provides true global coverage, and retail and institutional traders cannot access a truly global market. And no trading market exists that provides institutional-grade DEX trading.Industry consensus is that the continued digitization of assets is inevitable. Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) are blockchain-native tokens that constitute the main trading volume of the current cryptocurrency trading market. Yet the cryptocurrency market cap is less than half of Apple’s.The stock market is almost negligible compared to the untapped digitized asset market. While the opportunity is large, it is also too early to predict the outcome.Some of the world’s leading exchanges allow trading in a large number of controversial tokens. Many exchanges’ Anti-Money Laundering regulations are not robust enough. Despite claiming to have licenses in some countries, it is hard to imagine the legitimate compliance of offering derivatives trading to users all over the world by using an exchange license in a single country. These compliance risks pose a serious challenge to the stability of the position of some exchanges, and not long ago, the market landscape for derivatives changed rapidly after BitMEX was indicted, resulting in a loss of users and a decline in trading volume.Innovation in institutional-grade exchange technologies is not yet widely available. Volume rankings tell today’s story. Tomorrow’s story will be told by the trading markets that provide a true, global Best Bid and Offer price discovery, institutional access to DEX pricing and liquidity, and the ability to execute global trading strategies on a single platform.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

187,"Historical data shows that it is nearly impossible to consistently predict Bitcoin’s price action and many traders that attempt this end up losing money. Now that Bitcoin trades near $50,000, the ultimate goal for most traders is to hold on to their current holdings and incrementally add to them in a way that is not terribly risky. Options strategies provide excellent opportunities for traders who have a fixed-range target for an asset. For example, using leveraged futures contracts might be a solution for a scenario where one expects a price increase of up to 28% over the next month. Of course, using a tight stop loss lessens the viability of the trade.On the other hand, using multiple call (buy) options can create a strategy that allows gains that are four times higher than the potential loss. These can be used in both bullish and bearish circumstances, depending on the investors' expectations.The long butterfly strategy allows a trader to profit from the upside while limiting losses. It’s important to remember that options have a set expiry date; therefore, the price increase must happen during the defined period.The Bitcoin (BTC) calendar options below are for the March 26 expiry, but this strategy can also be used on Ether (ETH) options or a different time frame. Although the costs will vary, its general efficiency should not be affected.The suggested bullish strategy consists of buying 1 BTC worth $48,000 call options while simultaneously selling double that amount of $56,000 calls. To finalize the trade, one should buy 1 BTC worth of $64,000 call options.While this call option gives the buyer the right to acquire an asset, the contract seller gets a (potential) negative exposure.As the estimate above shows, if BTC is trading for $48,700, any outcome between $49,380 (up 1.5%) and $62,630 (up 28.6%) yields a net gain. For example, a 10% price increase to $53,570 results in a $4,000 net gain. Meanwhile, this strategy's maximum loss is $1,350 if BTC trades below $48,000 or above $64,000 on March 26.This allure of this butterfly strategy is the trader can secure a $4,050 gain, which is 3x larger than the maximum loss, if BTC trades from $53,550 to $58,460 expiry.Overall it yields a much better risk-reward from leveraged futures trading considering the limited downside.The multiple options strategy trade provides a better risk-reward for bullish traders seeking exposure to BTC’s price increase and the only upfront fee required is the $1,350 which reflects the maximum loss if the price is below $48,000 or above $64,000 at the expiry date.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
188,"Not everyone is excited about hyperbitcoinization. According to a popular copy/paste meme, Bitcoin hodlers are set to become a neo-aristocracy as Bitcoin becomes the dominant world currency:Only $BTC holders will be permitted to the upper echelons of society. Nocoiners will be shunned, socially and financially. At best forced to become servants to the new upper class. At worst executed for crimes against the #Bitcoin empire.The meme is part of a larger vision for Bitcoin’s future, a semi-serious but mostly tongue-in-cheek narrative that can be lumped under the “Bitcoin Citadels” umbrella: a vision of the future in which Bitcoin becomes so valuable that hodlers become lords quite literally defending their coins in castles. Originating from a Reddit post written by someone claiming to be a time traveler (they called for a $1 million price target in 2021, if you’re curious), the Citadel meme has taken on a life of its own, even inspiring a short film.But despite the self-evident farce and fantasy behind the meme, one economist is now warning that it might not be far off from reality should Bitcoin succeed in its mission to achieve monetary supremacy.On the think tank Center for Economic Policy and Research’s website, academic Jon Danielsson of the London School of Economics wrote an article yesterday in which he envisions a future where “Bitcoin aristocrats” will “fuel social division and populism” through extreme wealth inequality:The government would be forced to “protect or attack” this new class of overlords, ones who attained their “rank just by buying early. They will make no contribution to society.” Gloom and grumpiness aside, Danielsson ultimately concludes that such a future “cannot” come to pass because Bitcoin is unsuitable as a unit of account due to its price instability. Because of these “internal contradictions,” Danielsson writes, “the price of Bitcoin will head to zero.”Economic analysis that comes to the same conclusions as time-traveling Redditors aside, not everyone is as grim about a hyperbitcoinized world. In fact, in many cases it has proven to be a boon for countries struggling under inflation. "
189,"After a violent price reversal last week that saw Bitcoin retreat from all-time highs, traders and analysts are now eyeing major players and investors to gauge BTC’s next move — and so far the reaction is decidedly mixed.Data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode indicates that the number of Bitcoin whales — a term for wallets that hold between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC — has at least temporarily reversed what was previously a strong uptrend starting in April 2020, a phenomena Glassnode labeled as a potential “end of whale spawning season.”The Glassnode blog did make note that a ""sizeable portion"" of the decline may be attributable to custodial wallets restructuring, however. In fact, if some of the decline is related to custodians moving coins into deep storage, there’s an outside chance it could be a sign of more BTC moving into whale ownership, even the actual number of coins in whale addresses indicates otherwise. As a result, it may be difficult to label the decline in whale wallets to panic selling during crypto and macro market chop. Miner outflows, meanwhile, paint a more explicitly bullish picture. In a Tweet on Friday, Moskovski Capital CEO Lex Moskovski noted that Bitcoin miners — a frequent scapegoat for price dumps and boogeyman of cryptoTwitter — have actually begun accumulating coins as opposed to selling:Miners have stopped selling and started accumulating #Bitcoin

Yesterday was the first day since Dec, 27 when Miners Position change turned positive.

Miners were selling their bitcoins for two months.

Bullish. pic.twitter.com/S89iBcz4k3Likewise, there appears to be good news in regards to institutional accumulation. Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, noted that the quantity of BTC in exchange wallets continues to drop — a sign he believes points to continued institutional demand:Another significant Coinbase outflows at 48k. US institutional investors are still buying $BTC.

I think the major reason for this drop is the jittering macro environment like the 10-year Treasury note, not whale deposits, miner selling, and lack of institutional demand. https://t.co/wzwkwMhJWx pic.twitter.com/1uEEF8SX5QHowever, some recent research indicates that the institutions hoovering Bitcoin may not have as much an impact on the price as originally thought. What's more, indicators suggest that retail mania has hardly even begun — a sign that the latest pullback may only be temporary, and the next push is where FOMO will really kick in. At the time of writing Bitcoin is trading at $46,750, down 2% on the day. "
190,"Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a corrective week as the price dropped from $58,000 to $44,000 in a matter of days. This dropdown caused a panic reaction across the markets as the euphoria was immediately halted.For instance, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index plunged to monthly lows of 56 after being above 90, or ""extreme greed"" for an entire month. However, such a panic reaction is unwarranted because corrections appear frequently in a bull market as a ""reset"" before continuation. This is organic and healthy and offers a good opportunity for traders and investors to buy the dip.The 4-hour chart shows an apparent downtrend since the previous high at $58,000. This high could be the top for the coming months, a period that may see a more prolonged correction.However, the price action since this top at $58,000 indicates weakness as every support level flips into resistance, indicating further weakness.The chart shows these flips, where the $55,000 level was the first one. After that, the price of Bitcoin dropped significantly to the support zone around $45,000. This support zone held and resulted in a strong bounce toward $52,000.But, unfortunately for the bulls, this level wasn't broken and instead saw a rejection, confirming further weakness across the market and more downside for BTC price. This now paints a clear picture of the critical levels to watch. Ideally, the support zone between $42,500-$44,000 has to hold for further upward momentum. If it fails, further weakness can be expected toward the $37,500-$39,000 level.But if the $42,500-44,000 support zone holds, higher prices can be expected once Bitcoin breaks above the resistance between $50,000 and $51,000.While the lower timeframes indicate weakness for BTC/USD, the higher timeframes suggest a healthy correction. The market construction is still very bullish, as the chart above shows.The previous top was at $42,000, after which the new support was established at $30,000. This last top was easily broken as Bitcoin’s price accelerated to the $58,000 high. Hence, a correction to even $37,000 could be classified as healthy and organic in this type of bull market.Simply put, as long as BTC holds above the $30,000 low of January 2021, the market can be classified as bullish.History shows that March isn’t the most bullish month for the cryptocurrency market. In recent years, corrections have been seen in March. Specifically, corrections of 15%-60% happened in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2020.The latest crash was caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and could be classified as a ""black swan."" Nevertheless, corrections tend to happen in March and this year could also see another pullback.Therefore, corrections can last for several weeks and are frequently not completed in just one drop. Hence, a correction toward the $35,000-$40,000 is still on the table.The primary indicator to watch for this is the 21-Week MA. Often, corrections tend to move toward this line as a key point for a potential reversal. Therefore, in the coming weeks, this 21-Week MA could provide support in the correction.Currently, the 21-Week MA is around $28,000, though this should climb up in the coming weeks toward $33,000-35,000.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

191,"Everyone knows the story. When the first block of Bitcoin (BTC) was mined, the protocol itself entered a world of grave economic uncertainty. Not long before the market would hit its lowest point of the 2009 recession, Bitcoin was quietly created, dropped like a life raft alongside a then-sinking economy. The now infamous phrase “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks” was cribbed from the headlines, immortalized in code in the origin story of one of the most compelling, innovative, best-performing assets of the last decade.But Bitcoin did not immediately take root beyond a small community of true believers. Bitcoin and digital assets, in general, have been a lot of things in their relatively short histories, from purely speculative investments and “magical internet money” to a crisis-time safe haven and an attractive hedge against “the great monetary inflation.”In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, an associated market meltdown and huge amounts of central bank stimulus, cryptocurrencies have proved themselves to be remarkably resilient.But as we watch vaccines being distributed around the country, cautiously optimistic that the end of the pandemic is within reach, where will crypto fit in a post-pandemic world? If its history of resilience shows us anything, we expect crypto to adapt to whatever the next few years will bring — crisis or not.Related: How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the crypto space? Experts answerJust three years ago, leaders of some of the largest banks in the world refused to even talk about Bitcoin in interviews, calling the asset itself a “fraud” and referring to those who would buy it as “stupid.”Today, the general sentiment across banks is markedly different. On the heels of the United States Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s Interpretive Letter #1170, which made explicitly clear that federally chartered banks can provide banking services to legally operated companies in the digital asset space and custody digital assets on behalf of their clients, banks have been looking for the best way to get their clients the crypto exposure they demand. We anticipate legacy financial players’ interest in crypto to only grow in the coming years, with crypto becoming a mainstream requirement of financial services.In the short term, banks will almost certainly rely on subcustody relationships with digital asset specialists to safely and effectively get crypto into their clients’ hands. And this is because the complexity is easier to address from the crypto-native side than the other way around.Related: The need for a dialogue between crypto businesses and regulatorsWe also anticipate some number of acquisitions to occur, with some crypto service providers being swallowed up by banks with pockets deep enough to buy them. As demand for crypto services grows, and as regulatory clarity comes, more and more institutions will enter.Just as Bitcoin was built in response to the failings of a legacy system, decentralized finance has emerged as crypto’s answer to financial intermediaries. Until recently, though, entire portions of this ecosystem have been unavailable to institutions, mostly for lack of a secure means to participate.Slowly but surely, institutional-grade DeFi tools are coming to market, and we anticipate this trend to continue. Not only will we see a continued proliferation of DeFi growth, but institutional-grade tools will make institutional participation far more accessible.Related: Was 2020 a ‘DeFi year,’ and what is expected from the sector in 2021? Experts answerDespite its significant growth, the DeFi space is still very much fragmented. Cross-chain interoperability — or lack thereof — is still a problem. Institutions want to be able to put their assets to use across the DeFi ecosystem. We anticipate significant growth in this area, with more and more layer-one protocols being bridged to DeFi and the broader Ethereum ecosystem — a development that also has the potential to improve liquidity along with market stability and efficiency.Against a backdrop of seemingly endless monetary stimulus, a significant number of private companies are treating digital assets as an inflation hedge. Some of these, like Square and MicroStrategy, have taken significant positions in recent months. We’ve seen MassMutual buy up $100 million in Bitcoin. And with Tesla’s $1.5-billion dollar Bitcoin purchase this month, the trend shows no signs of slowing. In the coming years, we expect digital assets to become an instrumental part of private-company balance sheets.Related: Tesla, Bitcoin and the crypto space: The show Musk go on? Experts answerAnother factor at play is the lowered barrier to entry on the retail front. With tools like Celo’s Valora coming to market, Diem expected to launch in 2021 and firms like PayPal making it easy for their clients to buy crypto, we expect to see more of crypto as a tool for banking the unbanked — for putting financial tools into the hands of the millions without access to traditional banking services.Related: Will PayPal’s crypto integration bring crypto to the masses? Experts answerBy virtue of being built in response to one economic crisis, crypto seems to be locked into a crisis narrative. In reality, digital assets have more than proved to be resilient in even the most challenging economic times. Just this past year, crypto proved itself in the grips of a once-in-a-century global emergency, earning a place in the portfolios of institutional and retail investors alike.As the pandemic (hopefully) fades into the rearview, it’s exciting to think about what crypto can do without being forced into a defensive posture — without being defined against legacy assets like gold. It would be naive to say that crypto will never face another crisis — it almost certainly will. But from here, at what feels like the tail end of the pandemic, it’s exciting to think about what crypto can do in whatever “new normal” comes next.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
192,"The United States is divided politically these days into red states and blue states, and increasingly, it seems to be fracturing into cryptocurrency-friendly and crypto-wary locales, too. On Feb. 21, it was revealed that San Francisco-based Ripple Labs had registered as a Wyoming business. Wyoming is arguably the most blockchain and cryptocurrency-welcoming state in the United States. Meanwhile, several days later, New York State’s attorney general announced a settlement of the office’s long-standing investigation into crypto trading platform Bitfinex for illegal activities. As a result, Bitfinex and affiliated Tether must pay $18.5 million for damages to the state of New York and submit to periodic reporting of their reserves.Wyoming and New York — poles apart on the crypto regulatory spectrum — were both making industry headlines in the same week in other words. The irony wasn’t lost on Timothy Massad, former chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and now a senior fellow at Harvard University at Kennedy School, who told Cointelegraph:Whether this “smorgasbord” is a good thing is a matter of some debate. Crypto havens like Wyoming can be centers of innovation, pushing a potentially revolutionary technology further forward, as Wyoming’s recently elected U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis emphasized this week in a Chamber of Digital Commerce panel discussion with Miami’s Mayor Francis Suarez, another crypto enthusiast.But it also leads to regulatory uncertainty that gives entrepreneurs a case of hypertension. As Stephen McKeon, an associate professor of finance at the University of Oregon, told Cointelegraph: “Our regulatory system is a complex fabric of multiple agencies at both the state and federal level.” He further emphasized that “they need to coordinate on the topic of crypto assets because this asset class doesn’t map cleanly to the existing regulatory structure.”Asked if, from a business standpoint, Ripple and others were making a smart business move registering in crypto-warm states like Wyoming with a higher degree of regulatory certainty and freedom — as well as lower taxes — McKeon added: “Businesses strive to reduce regulatory uncertainty. If moving to Wyoming helps to achieve that objective, then it’s a smart move.”Others could follow Ripple. Zachary Kelman, managing partner at Kelman Law, told Cointelegraph: “Many crypto projects fled New York after the introduction of the onerous BitLicense back in 2015. I expect more projects to relocate in Wyoming, as well as other crypto-friendly states like New Hampshire.”Wyoming created a stir in 2019 when its legislature authorized the chartering of special purpose depository institutions, or SPDIs, that can receive both deposits and custody assets, including cryptocurrency. The state’s banking division itself acknowledged that “it is likely that many SPDIs will focus heavily on digital assets, such as virtual currencies, digital securities and utility tokens,” though they could also deal with traditional assets. SPDIs can’t make loans like traditional banks, however.Kraken Bank was the first business to receive a Wyoming SPDI bank charter in September 2020, followed by Avanti Bank and Trust in October, and there are “three more [SPDIs] in the pipeline” said Lummis at the Chamber of Digital Commerce’s Feb. 25 event. Avanti founder and CEO Caitlin Long had earlier suggested that Wyoming’s SPDIs potentially were “a solution to the #BitLicense problem” faced by crypto companies because “New York law exempts national banks from the BitLicense.”But even though the Wyoming SPDI’s are state-chartered institutions, not national banks, “federal law protects parity of national banks and state-chartered banks,” continued Long, and following that logic, she concluded that SPDIs represented “a passport into some 42 U.S. states without the need for additional state [crypto] licenses.”Not all are enthralled by Wyoming’s new special-purpose banks, though. The Bank Policy Institute suggested that Wyoming’s SPDIs could be an “accident waiting to happen.” The BPI noted in September that Kraken was “the first digital asset company in U.S. history to receive a bank charter recognized under federal and state law” but warned that its business model “is inherently unstable under stress” because the new bank is funded by uninsured, demandable retail deposits “and relies on a pool of assets such as corporate bonds, munis and longer-term Treasuries to fund redemptions under stress.”David Kinitsky, CEO of Kraken Bank, in a conversation with Cointelegraph, said that he believes the BPI blog post “comes from a lobbyist group funded by, and working on behalf of, the world’s biggest banks” and rests “on a slew of faulty assumptions,” adding further:Others have opined that innovation centers like Wyoming were merely filling the void left by the federal government, which has yet to take a coherent stance vis-a-vis the burgeoning crypto market. Benjamin Sauter, a lawyer at Kobre & Kim LLP, told Cointelegraph: “Wyoming is showing that individual states can play a meaningful role in crafting a coherent legal framework for the crypto/blockchain industry — particularly when it comes to state taxation as well as commercial and some banking issues.”By comparison, according to him, the U.S. federal government “hasn’t really made an effort to create such a framework, and this has led to a lot of regulatory inefficiencies and general confusion.”So, what about the notion that Wyoming merely created a means for its new banks to lure firms and investors based in more regulated states like New York? Kelman told Cointelegraph on the matter: “Many institutions operate entities all over the world, not just the United States. New York has jurisdiction over New Yorkers — but not any company related to a company that has had operations there.”“Wyoming can and is becoming a center for crypto business and innovation,” Kinitsky told Cointelegraph, adding: “Certainly, there are ready similar examples within financial services like the credit card industry in South Dakota and ILC banks in Utah….SPDI banks have similar frameworks for being able to operate across the country and indeed internationally.”McKeon agreed that Wyoming was following the South Dakota playbook: “South Dakota created favorable legislation for banks around interest rates and fees in the 1980s and now has one of the highest concentrations of bank assets in the U.S.,” adding further:Of course, other states could follow Wyoming’s lead. Kelman said: “I also expect larger states, like Florida, to follow suit with more crypto-friendly guidance, especially after Miami Mayor Francis Suarez’s overtures to the crypto community.” However, he further stressed that “given Wyoming’s small size and relative obscurity, I don’t know if it will remain a haven for an entire industry in the way Delaware has been for incorporations and corporate governance.”As reported, Mayor Suarez is looking to develop some of “the most progressive crypto laws” and proposing within his jurisdiction innovations like paying city workers’ wages in Bitcoin (BTC) and purchasing BTC for the municipality’s treasury. Senator Lummis applauded the mayor’s initiatives at the Chamber of Digital Commerce’s panel, inviting him to “look at Wyoming’s legislative framework as a template and then build on it” by developing new Bitcoin “components,” including a pension plan for Miami workers that includes Bitcoin — something Suarez is looking into.Multiple innovative centers like Miami and Wyoming, among others, could advance technological progress generally, she suggested. Suarez, for his part, said: “One of the things that we want to do is imitate Wyoming’s very successful integration of crypto into their community.”Meanwhile, Avanti’s Long remains an ardent booster for her state: “Why should crypto companies redomicile to Wyoming?” she asked rhetorically on Feb. 21 following the news that Ripple Labs had registered as a Wyoming limited liability company, adding:What exactly do these tech-friendly states and cities mean for cryptocurrency adoption? Sauter was cautiously optimistic: “It’s possible that Wyoming’s efforts will have some trickle-up effects, should the federal government ever get its act together.” He stated further that there is also a major risk as businesses may be “lulled into a false sense of security and potentially conflating Wyoming’s regime for compliance at the federal level.”Kinitsky told Cointelegraph that the convergence between crypto and banking, as is happening in Wyoming, “portends an important step toward mainstream adoption,” while McKeon added that crypto users “are primarily concerned with access to products and features. Better products translate to increased adoption.” Therefore, if Wyoming-type legislation enables crypto projects “to provide new and desirable features by mitigating regulatory risk for the providers, then it will be a positive force for general public adoption.”Many, though, still seem to be treading water until the federal government acts to provide some legislative/regulatory structure to the nascent blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. According to Sauter, “as great and encouraging Wyoming’s recent actions are, there is only so much one state can do.” Massad also told Cointelegraph:"
193,"The last few months’ frenzy of institutional money flowing into Bitcoin (BTC) has seen crypto hitting the headlines — at the least as a novelty asset, at the most as a must-have. There is undoubtedly a trend in the market toward greater awareness and acceptance of digital assets as a new investable asset class.A June 2020 report by Fidelity Digital Assets found that 80% of institutions in the United States and Europe have at least an interest in investing in crypto, while more than a third have already invested in some form of digital asset, with Bitcoin being the most popular choice of investment.A good starting point for institutional investors would be to differentiate between crypto (Bitcoin, in particular) and decentralized finance products. To date, most institutional interest has involved simply holding Bitcoin (or Bitcoin futures), with few players dipping into more exotic DeFi products.There are a plethora of reasons for the recent Bitcoin rage. Some would cite the relative maturity of the market and increased liquidity, which means sizable trades can now take place without resulting in excessive market movement. Others would cite the unusual high volatility, high return and positive excess kurtosis (meaning a greater probability of extreme values compared with the stock market) of the asset class. Bitcoin’s backstory and its limited supply that makes it akin to digital gold have also been highlighted, making it more and more attractive in a world of inflated asset prices and unruly monetary and fiscal policies.However, the main reason for the recent institutional interest in crypto is much less philosophical, much more practical and has to do with regulations and legacy infrastructure.Financial institutions are old behemoths, managing billions of dollars’ worth of other people’s money, and are therefore required by law to fulfill an overabundance of rules regarding the type of assets they are holding, where they are holding them and how they are holding them.On the one hand, in the past two years, the blockchain and crypto industry has made leaps forward in terms of regulatory clarity, at least in most developed markets. On the other hand, the development of the high-standard infrastructure that provides institutional actors with an operating model similar to that offered in the traditional world of securities now allows them to invest directly in digital assets by taking custody or indirectly through derivatives and funds. Each of these represents the real drivers in giving institutional investors enough confidence to finally dip their toes into crypto.With U.S. 10-year Treasurys yielding a little higher than 1%, the next big thing would be for institutions to look at investing in decentralized yield products. It might seem like a no-brainer when rates are in the doldrums and DeFi protocols on U.S. dollar stablecoins are yielding between 2% and 12% per annum — not to mention more exotic protocols yielding north of 250% per annum.However, DeFi is in its infancy, and liquidity is still too thin in comparison with more established asset classes for institutions to bother upgrading their knowledge, let alone their IT systems to deploy capital into it. Additionally, there are real, serious operational and regulatory risks when it comes to the transparency, rules and governance of these products.There are many things that need to be developed — most of which are already underway — to ensure institutional interest in DeFi products, whether on the settlement layer, asset layer, application layer or aggregation layer.Institutions’ primary concern is to ensure the legitimacy and compliance of their DeFi counterparts at both the protocol level and the sale execution level.One solution is a protocol that recognizes the status of a wallet owner or of another protocol and advises the counterparty as to whether or not it fits its requirements in terms of compliance, governance, accountability and also code auditing, as the potential for malicious actors to exploit the system has been proved over and over.This solution will need to go hand in hand with an insurance process to transfer the risk of an error, for example, in validation to a third party. We are starting to see the emergence of a few insurance protocols and mutualized insurance products, and adoption and liquidity in DeFi need to be large enough to caution the investments in time, money and expertise to fully develop viable institutional insurance products.Another venue to be enhanced is the quality and integrity of data through trustful oracles and the need to increase the confidence in oracles to achieve compliant levels of reporting. This goes hand in hand with the need for sophisticated analytics to monitor investments and on-chain activity. And it goes without saying that more clarity on accounting and taxes is needed from certain regulators who haven’t emitted an opinion yet.Another obvious issue concerns network fees and throughput, with requests taking from a few seconds to double-digit minutes depending on network congestion, and fees twirling between a few cents and 20 bucks. This is, however, being resolved with plans for the development of Ethereum 2.0 in the next two years and also the emergence of blockchains more adapted to faster transactions and more stable fees.A final, somewhat funny point would be the need for improvement in user experience/user interfaces in order to turn complex protocols and code into a more user-friendly, familiar interface.People like to compare the blockchain revolution to the internet revolution. What they fail to remember is that the internet disrupted the flow of information and data, both of which were not regulated and had no existing infrastructure, and it is only in the last few years that such regulations were adopted.The financial industry, however, is heavily regulated — even more so since 2008. In the United States, finance is three times more regulated than the healthcare industry. Finance has a legacy operational system and infrastructure that makes it extremely hard to disrupt and tedious to transform.It’s likely that in the next 10 years, we will see a fork between instruments and protocols that are fully decentralized, fully open source and fully anonymous and instruments that will need to fit in the tight framework of the heavy regulation and archaic infrastructure of financial markets, resulting in a loss of some of the above characteristics along the way.This will by no means slow down the fantastic rate of creativity and the relentless, fast-paced innovation in the sector, as a large number of new products in the DeFi space — products we haven’t even predicted — are anticipated. And within a quarter of a century, once DeFi will have first adapted to and then absorbed capital markets, its full potential will be unleashed, leading to a frictionless, decentralized, self-governing system.The revolution is here, and it is here to stay. New technologies have undeniably shifted the financial industry from a sociotechnical system — controlled through social relations — to a technosocial system — controlled through autonomous technical mechanisms.There is a fine equilibrium to be reached between tech-based, fast-paced crypto and antiquated, regulated fiat systems. Building a bridge between the two will only benefit the system as a whole.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

194,"Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ($GBTC) is currently the largest listed cryptocurrency asset with $30.17 billion in assets under management. The firm currently holds more than 655,730 BTC and the security is tradable in the United States through over-the-counter markets.The fund was launched in 2013 and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust became the preferred institutional vehicle in the U.S. for BTC due to the lack of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).Investment trust funds are regulated by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and they are designed exclusively for accredited investors. Nevertheless, those can be sold to retail traders after a six-month lock-up period.This specificity causes GBTC shares to trade above the equivalent BTC held by the trust whenever there's retail demand on secondary markets. Meanwhile, institutional clients can buy at par directly from Grayscale Investments regardless of the price on OTC markets.As displayed above, such a premium sometimes surpassed 40%, indicating heavy buying pressure from retail investors. The situation changed over the past four weeks as Bitcoin price peaked at $58,000 and initiated a substantial correction, causing the GBTC premium to range between 5% and 10%.A diminished appetite in the secondary markets creates a potential imbalance as there is currently no redemption program for the GBTC. Had there been a way to convert it back to BTC, a market maker would gladly buy the trust shares at a discount.Although the recent price crash could explain the 7% discount seen on Feb. 26, Bitcoin faced multiple 30% corrections in the past with no apparent impact on GBTC premium. Even during the horrific bear market in late 2018, GBTC traded above the net asset value (NAV).Although no better alternative was previously offered, Canada’s TSX launched a Bitcoin ETF on Feb. 18, providing investors direct exposure to BTC. This structure allows the market maker to create and redeem shares, thus minimizing eventual premium or discount to the net asset value.This time around, the selling pressure that took place found less buying activity from non-accredited investors. On the other hand, the Canadian Purpose Investments ETF surpassed 10,000 BTC under management in one week, which signals the instrument's success despite a sharp downturn in BTC price.Unless Grayscale Investments opens a redemption program, nothing is preventing GBTC from continuing to trade below its net asset value.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

195,"Hindsight is 20/20, but when money is on the line, being prepared can give investors better foresight. Just over a year and a half ago, Investopedia reported on the panic among many crypto investors who’d found themselves on the wrong side of the taxman. The article read, “Online forums like Reddit are abuzz with posts citing possible scenarios by worried investors about pending tax liabilities for their past dealings in cryptocoins, which may now leave them poorer.”As Bitcoin’s (BTC) price soars and investors flock to crypto to cash in, legislators and regulators around the world are taking notice. Most recently, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development announced a plan to release a ubiquitous tax standard for its member states, partly intended to curb base erosion and profit shifting. Although announcements like these serve as positive signs of intergovernmental collaboration, economic unity and progress, to the average investor, they feel rather distant. Yet it is crucial for investors in the United States to understand the digital asset tax regulations because, in some cases, it may mean the difference between prosperity and five years in prison with fines up to $250,000.Related: Parents, it’s time for ‘the talk’: Did your kid trade crypto in 2020?A handful of libertarian, crypto torchbearers might be inclined to believe that the built-in anonymity privileges of blockchain may save them from government scrutiny, but after all, the Internal Revenue Service isn’t quick to let go of these matters.Digital currencies and tokenized assets tend to be a mixed bag under the U.S. tax code. Many investors think of Bitcoin as a digital currency, like fiat currencies used regularly by consumers to buy goods. However, under the U.S. tax code, Bitcoin is actually considered “property” and is taxed under capital gains tax when either sold or used to purchase items or transferred for other digital currencies, such as trading Bitcoin for Ether (ETH). For example, purchasing a house with Bitcoin in the U.S. would trigger a taxable event on capital gains, and the exchange of Bitcoin for any other type of asset is considered a sale in the same way you might sell security like a stock.Related: Crypto taxes, reporting and tax audits in 2021It’s difficult to pinpoint why Bitcoin is classified differently from fiat currencies, but precedent in how Bitcoin is utilized by investors may tell us the answer. The IRS likely recognizes Bitcoin as a property asset because the popular crypto asset serves most users as an investment utility and not as a functional currency in the same way the fiat U.S. dollar does. More importantly, because these types of assets are not issued by a central bank, the U.S. government will not recognize them as such until further notice. Understanding crypto taxation also means digging into the little details.Unlike centralized financial systems, decentralized systems require investors to take a far more active role in diligently tracking their investments from the moment of purchase to sale or exchange for commodities.At the most basic level, the onus falls more on the investor to track the purchase date, purchase price and what was received in exchange for the Bitcoin in the case of a sale. In contrast, investment history in traditional, non-digital assets, such as stocks or commodities, is fairly easy to track because of the diligent records that brokerages maintain for clients and how readily accessible they are.Basics aside, there is one area in particular in which many accredited investors miss the mark.Crypto hedge funds are reputed for offering lucrative crypto opportunities. While some crypto hedge funds are considered risky due to questions about crypto-market liquidity, they can be the better route to invest instead of buying individual units of Bitcoin. And as of late, they have proven themselves increasingly popular over the last year. According to Big Four audit firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, assets under management with crypto hedge funds rose from $1 billion in value in 2018 to over $2 billion in value in 2019. Despite piquing the interest of investors, buyers beware.Compared to traditional assets, when onboarding investors for crypto assets, it’s a whole different ball game. Unlike traditional assets, it’s imperative that digital asset hedge funds ask deeper questions about tax considerations. Some questions regarding crypto investments should include: What kind of property is cryptocurrency x? or Can staking assets on proof-of-stake networks, which offer rewards for staking, be classified as unique income? These are just the basics, but questions like these can easily slip the mind when in the moment and can trigger unintended tax events.On the other hand, when joining a hedge fund, it’s standard procedure to sign a standard legal entity fund structure, which is often as lengthy as 500 pages. Included are taxation clauses in the contract that explain the implications of investing with the fund. But with hundreds of pages of details, investors may not pay close attention to the little details, inadvertently putting them at serious risk of conflict with the IRS at a later juncture. That’s where a tax advisor should come in, who is accustomed to a more passive role.Because of crypto’s unique properties, the tax advisor’s role has to become more active rather than passive, as it usually is. Rather than take a backseat, tax advisors should be summoned to provide consultation on investments before they’re undertaken and play a proactive role in educating investors every step of the way. As a result, investors would find themselves better prepared to provide a comprehensive and abiding tax return, rather than find themselves on the short end of the stick, playing catch up with the IRS.When the taxman comes knocking, it’s better to be safe than sorry and know the regulations; otherwise, the consequences could be much graver. More importantly, the tax advisor must be in the passenger seat, not the back seat, when investors sign on the dotted line.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
196,"The cryptocurrency market faced another day of downward pressure as the unease in the traditional markets continues to spread following the recent interest rate spike on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that the price of Bitcoin (BTC) fell to a low at $44,710 late on Feb. 25 before buying at the key support returned to help the digital asset recover back above $46,500 but generally, analysts are looking for $50,000 to become an established support before expecting bullish continuation.Despite major BTC purchases by MicroStrategy, Tesla and MassMutual, a majority of institutional investors still have security and tax treatment concerns that prevent them from investing in Bitcoin, according to Galaxy Digital co-president Damien Vanderwilt.Institutional investment has been a significant source of optimism in the cryptocurrency sector in 2021, but its influence in helping BTC reach a market cap of $1 trillion may be overstated as recent analysis shows that stablecoin whales and retail traders still hold the most buying power.On Feb. 25, the interest rate for the 10-year U.S. Treasury spiked to 1.52%, its highest level in over a year.According to Chad Steinglass, Head of Trading at CrossTower, the move led to market-wide pressure that pushed the “GBTC premium down as low as negative 6% and it closed around negative 2% today.” The analyst sees interest rate volatility as a major source of market volatility, as the long end of the curve steepens while the U.S. dollar is pushed lower.Cryptocurrencies fell under increased pressures as equity markets deteriorated throughout the day, possibly due to a “scramble for liquidity” resulting from traders “pushing up against margin calls and needing to free up cash.”Steinglass said:The 10-year Treasury yield pulled back .0582 basis points to 1.46 on Feb. 26, marking a 3.82% decrease from its high on the previous day. This leadi to a choppy day in the markets which saw the major indices close mixed.The NASDAQ finished the day up 0.56%, recovering some of its losses from the 3.5% drop on Feb. 25. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and DOW finished the day in the red, down 0.48% and 1.51% respectively.A majority of the top cryptocurrencies also took on sharp losses on Friday, with the exception of Cardano (ADA), which became the third-ranked cryptocurrency by market cap after its price broke out to a new all-time high at $1.29. The current excitement for the altcoin appears to be connected to the upcoming 'Mary' mainnet launch scheduled for March 1.Basic Attention Token (BAT) has also battled back against the market sell-off to post a 6.43% gain following the Feb. 23 announcement of the upcoming Brave Decentralized Exchange (DEX).Ether (ETH) price is down 7.19%  and trading below $1,500, while Binance Coin (BNB) has dropped 8.36% to $224.14The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.533 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 61.3%."
197,"In recent months, companies such as MicroStrategy and Tesla have picked up sizable positions in Bitcoin (BTC). This trend has not yet become the norm for most companies, however. Damien Vanderwilt, co-president of Galaxy Digital, believes security and taxes may be acting as deterrents for crypto investing. ""When we think about the conversations we have with corporates and institutional clients and any part of those constituencies considering investing in the sector, the first order problem is safety and are the assets that they're buying going to be safe and available and secure,” Vanderwilt told Bloomberg in an interview on Thursday.“The second order problem, particularly for the corporates, is tax treatment and the way that particularly under GAAP accounting in the U.S., Bitcoin is viewed as an intangible asset,"" he added.The Bloomberg interviewer noted that “5% of finance executives” are considering Bitcoin purchases. This 5% figure came from a report recently published by research firm Gartner, detailing February survey results from 77 finance executives. “Just 5% of Finance Executives Polled in February 2021 Said They Planned to Hold Bitcoin as a Corporate Asset in 2021,” said a Feb. 16 public statement from Gartner on the report.MicroStrategy, MassMutual, Tesla and Square have all allocated millions of dollars to Bitcoin. MicroStrategy has spent more than $1 billion on the asset and put an additional billion into BTC recently. Square also recently announced adding $170 million worth of Bitcoin to its stack. The firm spent $50 million on the coin last fall.“They’re not unsolvable problems or things that companies can’t get comfortable with, but it does take a little bit of time,” Vanderwilt said of the two issues he mentioned."
198,"Every bull market witnesses periodic pullbacks, where the weaker hands sell anticipating a top and the stronger hands accumulate for the long term. Data from Coinbase Pro shows two large Bitcoin (BTC) outflows this week, suggesting that institutions are likely continueing to buy the current dip.Comparing historical data, on-chain analytics resource Whalemap, recently said that previous macro tops in Bitcoin in 2017 and 2019 coincided with thousands of large Bitcoin transactions worth $5-7 million. However, the researchers believe there is “no such FOMO in sight for BTC.”JPMorgan strategists Joyce Chang and Amy Ho recently endorsed a 1% allocation to Bitcoin in multi-asset portfolios “to achieve any efficiency gain in the overall risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio.”With gold and the S&P500 both seeing a downturn in the short term, investors looking to hedge their portfolios may look for alternatives such as cryptocurrencie, which may limit the downside for Bitcoin.While data suggests that the downside is limited, let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine where buyers may step in.There is a tug of war currently going on between the bulls and the bears. The bulls attempted to resume the up-move on Feb. 25, but could not sustain the higher levels. Bitcoin reversed direction and broke below the 20-day exponential moving average ($48,159), which shows selling by the bears at higher levels.However, the long tail on today’s candlestick shows that bears are not able to sustain the price below the 20-day EMA. This suggests traders are buying on dips.The flat 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint suggest a possible consolidation in the near term. The support of the said range could be at $41,959.63, which is just above the 50-day simple moving average ($40,914).If bears can sink the price below the 50-day SMA, the selling could intensify and the pair could even drop to $28,850.Conversely, if the bulls can propel the price above $52,040.95, a retest of $58,341.03 may be on the cards.Ether (ETH) could not rise above the 20-day EMA ($1,686) on Feb. 24, which suggests the bears are defending this level. The biggest altcoin turned south on Feb. 25 and fell to the 50-day SMA ($1,498).Although the price dipped below the 50-day SMA today, the bears could not break the Feb. 23 intraday low at $1,350. This shows a lack of selling pressure at lower levels.The bulls have pushed the price back above the 50-day SMA. If they can sustain the momentum and propel the ETH/USD pair above the 20-day EMA, it could enhance the prospects of retesting $2,000.On the other hand, if the price again turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest a change in sentiment from buying the dips to selling the rallies. If the bears break the $1,350 support, the pair may drop to $1,000.Cardano (ADA) is in a strong uptrend and has broken into the top-three cryptocurrencies by market capitalization for the first time. The bulls attempted to push the price above $1.20 on Feb. 25 but failed. However, the bulls successfully flipped $0.9817712 to support today, which suggests aggressive buying on every minor dip.The buyers have driven the price above the $1.20 overhead resistance, indicating the resumption of the uptrend. The altcoin could now rally to the next target objective at $1.25.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI in the overbought territory, suggesting that bulls are in control.This bullish view will be invalidated if the ADA/USD pair fails to sustain the breakout and sharply reverses direction, breaking below the 20-day EMA ($0.92).The failure of the bulls to push Binance Coin (BNB) above the downtrend line on Feb. 24 may have attracted another bout of profit-booking by traders. The altcoin has pared most of the gains made on Feb. 19.If the current rebound sustains, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above the downtrend line. If they succeed, it will suggest that the short-term correction could be over. The BNB/USD pair may then rise to $300 and then to $348.6969.The upsloping 20-day EMA ($192) and the RSI in the positive zone suggest bulls have the upper hand. Falling below the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA would invalidate this bullish scenario. Such a move could pull the price down to $118.Polkadot’s (DOT) sharp recovery on Feb. 23 faltered on Feb. 24 as the bulls could not push and sustain the price above the resistance line of the ascending channel. This may have attracted profit-booking from the dipbuyers.The buyers are currently attempting to defend the 20-day EMA ($30.30). If they manage to sustain the bounce, the DOT/USD pair will again try to break out of the resistance line of the channel and retest the all-time high at $42.2848.Conversely, if the pair again goes down below the resistance line of the channel, the bears will try to sink the price under the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair may drop to the support line of the channel.The 20-day EMA is gradually sloping up and the RSI is above 61, indicating a minor advantage to the bulls.The long tail on the Feb. 23 candlestick shows buying on dips, but the bulls could not keep up the momentum and push XRP price above the 20-day EMA ($0.048) on Feb. 24. This showed that demand dried up at higher levels.The price has again dipped back to the 50-day SMA ($0.40). A lack of a strong rebound could attract further selling and the XRP/USD pair may drop to $0.359. A break below this support could clear the path for a fall toward $0.25.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair sustains the current bounce, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above the $0.50 overhead resistance. If they succeed, the pair may consolidate between $0.65 and $0.359 for a few days.Litecoin (LTC) rallied above the 20-day EMA ($192) on Feb. 25, but the bulls failed to sustain the higher levels as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick. This suggests that traders are booking profits at higher levels.However, the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests that bulls are buying the dips to the 50-day SMA ($166). If the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA and the $205.186 overhead resistance zone, the LINK/USD pair may rise to $230.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls fail to sustain the current rebound, the pair may U-turn and drop below the 50-day SMA and the uptrend line. If that happens, the pair may slide to $120.Chainlink (LINK) could not climb back into the ascending channel on Feb. 24, attracting profit-booking from the aggressive bulls who may have purchased the dip on Feb. 23. The altcoin turned down on Feb. 25 and dipped back to the 50-day SMA ($24.70) today.The downsloping 20-day EMA ($28.80) and the RSI in the negative zone suggest bears have the upper hand. If the price slips below the 50-day SMA, the decline could extend to the critical support at $20.111.Contrary to this assumption, if the current rebound off the 50-day SMA sustains, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the LINK/USD pair may begin a new uptrend.The relief rally in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) could not even rise to the 20-day EMA ($578) on Feb. 24 and 25, indicating a lack of urgency among the bulls to buy at these levels. The price turned down on Feb. 25 and dropped to the uptrend line.The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative zone suggest bears are in control. If the sellers sink the price below the uptrend line, the BCH/USD could start a deeper correction to $370.On the contrary, if the bulls can build up on the current rebound off the uptrend line, the pair may rise to the 20-day EMA. A breakout of this resistance could push BCH price to $631.71.Stellar Lumens (XLM) could not rise above the 20-day EMA ($0.430) on Feb. 24 and 25, which shows the bears are selling on rallies to this resistance. The altcoin pulled back on Feb. 25 and fell to the critical support level at $0.35.The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative territory suggest advantage to the bears. If the sellers can sink the price below the support line of the descending channel, the XLM/USD pair may decline to $0.23.Conversely, if the bulls can sustain the current rebound off $0.35, the pair may rise to the 20-day EMA. A breakout of this resistance will suggest the bulls are back in the game. The pair could then rally to the resistance line of the channel.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

199,"The Komodo project launched on Friday the stable beta of its latest product, AtomicDEX. The platform seeks to enable trustless atomic swaps between different blockchains, currently connecting Ethereum and its tokens to blockchains like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin and Qtum.Using atomic swaps allows users to trade directly with the native tokens. Someone buying Ether (ETH) with Bitcoin (BTC) would just exchange ownership of the respective coins on their blockchains, without having to use intermediary tokenized representations.The integration comes within a dedicated multiblockchain wallet built by Komodo, which includes the atomic swap feature. The beta of the trading system officially launched on Friday at 6 pm UTC.Atomic swaps are a type of cross-chain interaction where special cryptographic techniques — usually based on hash-time locked contracts, or HTLCs — ensure that two transfers either occur completely or not at all. This means that two parties in an exchange transaction will swap funds simultaneously, and if either party backs, down the transaction is canceled.In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Komodo’s pseudonymous operations agen, known as JC, said that the project aims to connect most blockchain environments, with upcoming integrations including the Cosmos ecosystem. In general, the mechanism can support almost any kind of blockchain, though each integration must be added manually. The team is also working on integrating privacy coin Monero (XMR), though with a lower priority.The exchange uses a more classical model of a decentralized order book supported by torrent-based technologies. This is in contrast to the most popular type of decentralized exchange today, based on automated market makers like Uniswap. The project is also using Band Protocol oracles for setting target prices. In the future, the team is planning to integrate Chainlink, “as we don’t have to be married into just one oracle solution only,” said JC.JC reassured that the system does not custody or control funds at any point in the mechanism, noting that “Decentralization slows down the [development] process, we can’t just slap bang it all together.” One potential drawback of the mechanism is the requirement of higher security, which requires waiting for blockchains to confirm the trade, JC noted, though this is common to DEXs in general.Atomic swaps can be a valid alternative to bridging tokens to other blockchains, a process that is usually centralized due to technical limitations. For example, many popular Bitcoin wrappers on Ethereum are facilitated by custodial agents, like BitGo in the case of Wrapped BTC (WBTC). At the same time, wrapping a token simplifies the process of using it on another blockchain, as once initial liquidity hurdles are overcome, it becomes a relatively seamless process. The DeFi boom has allowed Wrapped BTC to reach wide acceptance, making it easy to swap or use in lending protocols.There may be liquidity hurdles for atomic swap platforms as well, but the solution could be particularly attractive for purists who do not wish to rely on centralized entities overseeing the token’s issuance."
200,"In the history of financial markets, there are only a few tradable assets that have conquered this frontier. Currently, Bitcoin has the eighth-highest market cap among all tradable assets in the world, including equities and commodities. Among the top 10 exchange-tradable assets, it sits right above Tencent, which Bitcoin flipped on its eventual surge past the $1 trillion mark, below which stands Facebook, which was flipped earlier this month.Bitcoin is only one step away from surpassing Google and two steps away from silver. Considering the history of commodities like silver and gold, which have been traded for centuries now, Bitcoin’s history is extremely short, starting only in January 2009 as no more than an experiment. Even stocks like Google and Tencent have histories over two decades, while Apple and Microsoft have over four decades.In analyzing the timing of Bitcoin finally smashing this landmark, it’s evident that there were no big institutional announcements leading up to the surge in market cap. The Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index by on-chain data provider CryptoQuant — when the premium is high, it indicates strong spot buying on Coinbase — suggests that at the time when this breakthrough occurred, the Coinbase premium was negative.Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, explained to Cointelegraph what this suggests: “The buying power seems mostly to come from stablecoin whales and retail investors, not institutional investors or high-net individuals in the U.S.”At long last, Bitcoin (BTC) broke the $1 trillion market capitalization frontier on Feb. 19, with its market cap tripling in just three months. This important landmark came almost a year after it tanked to less than $100 billion on March 12, 2020, more commonly known as “Black Thursday” in the cryptocurrency community.It is also important to consider the proportion of BTC actually in circulating supply before assuming the price implications of Bitcoin volumes. According to research from Glassnode, 78% of Bitcoin’s supply is illiquid, thus implying the supply-demand economics of the asset is only a small aspect of how its price is influenced. Fortunately, or unfortunately, for the market, Bitcoin’s price is still mostly dependent on sentiment. This is evident in the fact that Robinhood has already acquired more than 6 million retail crypto investors this year alone.While acknowledging the presence and overall influence of institutional investors, Jay Hao, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange OKEx, told Cointelegraph that a Twitter trend could be responsible for the push to $1 trillion: “This frenzy that included Elon Musk, Michael Saylor, and Senator Cynthia Lummis, could have helped BTC break the $1 trillion market cap without any final push from institutional investors who generally don’t buy when the markets are looking overstretched.” He added further:Crypto venture capitalist Brock Pierce outlined to Cointelegraph that in his view, institutional involvement could indeed be “overrated” but that it is still present as evidenced by their long positions:He further opined that corporations are adopting “programmatic buying” as they attempt to reach a certain allocation. Moreover, as indicated by both Pierce and Hao, it is often the sentiment in the market that causes retail investors to get involved, thus causing major price movements in the BTC market.Ju recently pointed out on Twitter that prominent miners often have private wallets separate from their mining wallets; hence, their power could be greater than what on-chain analysis may suggest. He further clarified the implications this may have on the price of Bitcoin:After Bitcoin breached the $1 trillion mark, it quickly went on to reach its all-time high of $58,352 on Feb. 21. But the very next day, BTC price dropped 20% alongside several other cryptocurrency assets in a correction now more commonly referred to as “Bloody Monday” in the cryptocurrency community. Its price continues to trade between around $45,000 and the previous $50,000 support level.During this drop in price, it seems that institutional investors have taken it as a green light to buy the dip in large quantities. Jack Dorsey’s Square bought another round of Bitcoin, approximately 3,318 BTC for $170 million. Square first purchased Bitcoin in October 2020, buying 4,709 Bitcoin for about $50 million at an average price of $10,618 per BTC. Square’s motivation to buy the dip in a second round of investment could be driven by the fact that its gains on the first round of investment are around 400%.In addition to Square, Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy purchased another $1 billion worth of Bitcoin, an additional 19,452 coins at an average price of $52,765. This investment into Bitcoin comes just six months after its initial investment of $250 million in August 2020.Now, MicroStrategy owns over 90,000 BTC, which accounts for 63% of its total market cap. Saylor has announced that MicroStrategy “remains focused on our two corporate strategies of growing our enterprise analytics software business and acquiring and holding bitcoin.” Hao further commented on the purchase:David Donovan, executive vice president of Publicis Sapient — a digital transformation firm — expressed to Cointelegraph his reservations regarding the lack of regulation, especially because investing in BTC comes with risk and volatility: “Individuals should not invest their money in bitcoin if they are not in solid financial standing as there is no FCID protection for stored bitcoin at this time.”JPMorgan Chase became the most recent financial giant to cautiously endorse Bitcoin when it advocated in a note to clients that “investors can likely add up to 1% of their allocation to cryptocurrencies in order to achieve any efficiency gain in the overall risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio.” Most would see this as a bullish announcement; however, as the price of Bitcoin continues to struggle below $48,000, it adds to the narrative that the influence of institutional investors on the market could be overrated in the minds of the average crypto consumer."
201,"Since the start of 2021, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) has been chasing new highs on a weekly and daily basis. On Feb. 21, BTC reached a new all-time high of $58,300. However, an interesting phenomenon is that even with many global cryptocurrency exchanges in existence, BTC's price can still vary greatly depending on geography.This raises an intriguing question: How can Bitcoin simultaneously trade at $53,047 in Malaysia, $49,727 in Singapore, $51,133 in India and over $86,000 in Nigeria? Is the reason simply a temporary imbalance between buyers and sellers, taxes, or regulations? Or is there something else at play?As shown in the chart below, there really isn't a set price for BTC, as nearly every country has its own digital asset valuation.At any given time, cryptocurrency prices will differ between countries, even after adjusting the currency rate. Indeed, some additional buying or selling pressure could create discrepancies, but that should not be continuous and steady.This phenomenon isn't something new or exclusive to cryptocurrencies, however. Exxon Mobil stocks, for example, are traded in United States, Russian, Argentine, German, Mexican and Swizz markets.While there may be different reasons for the friction, including bureaucracy and nation-specific laws, they're basically the same asset. Nevertheless, their prices usually differ after adjusting for currency exchange rates.Unlike stocks, however, transferring cryptocurrencies usually takes less than an hour, and it doesn't depend on custodians and depositary receipt administrators. Therefore, bureaucracy can not be the reason for the big price differences for Bitcoin, which is borderless.On the other hand, suppose one just bought BTC in the U.S. or Europe and is willing to sell it in Argentina to profit from the 6.5% difference. Even if there were no trading fees involved, the result would be the local currency, the Argentine peso.Things get more complicated though, as one will need to convert this fiat money back to dollars or euros. There might be domestic restrictions, taxes or, even worse, a different currency rate for foreigners. Moreover, traditional currency remittances don't take place on weekends and usually take one or two business days.Not surprisingly, the countries with the highest BTC valuations consistently score low on investment and financial freedom global rankings. Barriers and taxes created by strict government controls translate into additional risks and costs for the fiat conversion and remittance. This all contributes to the premium seen versus the remaining countries.Extreme capital control situations such as the Central Bank of Nigeria recently shutting down all cryptocurrency-related bank accounts could be behind the current 70% premium versus global BTC markets. But Nigeria likely has the highest premium in the world because the country, in particular, is also the leader when it comes to Bitcoin adoption, based on the latest data. #Bitcoin Price is now $80,000 in Nigeria - a 60% premium.

That’s what happens when you try to ban something people want.Eventually, arbitrage traders will find a solution to bypass sanctions, and the price gap should tighten. But right now, there is no effective way to ""profit"" from the arbitrage.For those wondering what would cause Bitcoin to trade below most liquid markets such as the U.S., there is no definitive answer. It is most likely some regulatory hurdle for depositing fiat money on local exchanges, thus creating an imbalance favoring the sell-side.The negative premium is less common, however, and stablecoins could be used to mitigate this effect. Meanwhile, when a hefty premium is seen in local fiat currency, it does not justify a similar price gap for dollar-denominated stablecoin trading.Thus, such differences in pricing across various countries represent the risks, red tape, taxes and inefficiencies of converting fiat between currencies and sending fiat money across borders.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

202,"Rumors of a possible investigation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission into Tesla CEO Elon Musk's alleged impact on Dogecoin's (DOGE) price moves have been circulating on social media over the past day — a phenomenon that one Twitter user has quipped is ""peak 2021."" I hope they do! It would be awesomeMusk's previous showdowns with the SEC notwithstanding, the CEO appears to be unfazed about the possibility of an all-too-real legal fallout sparked by his penchant for the meme cryptocurrency. Musk's professed love for ""dogs & memes"" has spurred him to repeatedly post jocular memes about Dogecoin, most recently one showing the DOGE mascot ""on the actual moon."" Literally pic.twitter.com/XBAUqiVsPHWhile the reference apes trader lingo for stratospheric price action and could therefore be construed as some form of endorsement, Musk has publicly said that for all his love of the meme cryptocurrency, he is partial to Bitcoin (BTC) when it comes to strategic personal and corporate investment. That hasn't stopped the CEO's tweeting, however tongue-in-cheek, from providing some serious fuel for meme coin market volatility — Dogecoin Christmas 2020 being just one instance. Musk's apparently all-too-real impact on the price movements of both cryptocurrencies, given his enormous social media following, makes disentangling meme fun from celebrity shilling almost impossible. Legal advisors have previously voiced their opinion that the CEO could already be in for scrutiny from the SEC after his documented influence on Bitcoin's price moves this year.Both the prospect of an SEC investigation and the prospect of DOGE's metamorphosis into ""a real currency"" remain, for now, parallel meme-like and humorous eventualities in the CEO's imagination. Musk's previous SEC battles back in 2018 may have had real ramifications for the CEO, resulting in his removal as chairman of the Tesla board and the payment of financial penalties, but he seems unlikely to give up on his Twitter kicks just yet."
203,"Belarus is studying the cryptocurrency industry for a potential move into mining digital coins like Bitcoin (BTC).The Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Belarus officially announced Friday that it is actively exploring the pros and cons of cryptocurrency mining. Minister Viktor Karankevich said that the crypto mining industry is rapidly growing all over the world in countries like China, the United States, Canada and Russia.The minister went on to say that the government is considering tapping into the mining industry following an investigation of the potential risks and other factors:The Belarusian government has been exploring the question of crypto mining for a while. In April 2019, President Alexander Lukashenko reportedly proposed to deploy excess energy from the country’s first nuclear power plant to mine cryptocurrencies and sell them.Belarus has been trying to position itself as a cryptocurrency-friendly country in recent years. In 2017, Lukashenko signed a decree on the development of the digital economy, legalizing major crypto-related activities like mining, buying and selling, and trading crypto. In 2019, Belarusbank, the largest bank in Belarus, claimed that it was considering setting up a crypto exchange."
204,"Bitcoin bears thinking that $58,000 was this cycle's top will be sorely disappointed, fresh investment data from past bull markets shows.Compiled by on-chain analytics resource Whalemap, statistics covering Bitcoin (BTC) buys of between $5 million and $7 million conclude that even at recent all-time highs, Bitcoin was far from a ""macro top.""During the 2017 and shorter 2019 bull market, Bitcoin saw mass buy-ins of a similar size: $5million to $7 million. When investments of that amount hit a peak, price action began to reverse, signaling the start of consolidation or a heavier retracement. According to Whalemap, cash injections in that area have been far from their previous peaks this year, indicating that the current correction will likely be temporary and on par with BTC's typical corrections during a bull run.""Previous macro tops have occurred when thousands of transactions worth 5 to 7 million dollars each were flooding the blockchain. True FOMO,"" researchers tweeted on Feb. 25.The expectation of further buy-ins supports existing data that came to light this week, notably from Coinbase Pro, which has seen multiple tranches of over 10,000 BTC leave its books for private or custody wallets.The first negative premium on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) since early 2017 may also point to the conclusion that the 2021 bull cycle still has a lot more room to run.""Another significant Coinbase outflows at 48k. US institutional investors are still buying $BTC,"" Ki Young Ju, CEO of fellow monitoring resource CryptoQuant, tweeted on Friday.The start of the turnaround may be sooner than many think. In his latest analysis, pseudonymous cryptocurrency trader Rekt Capital eyed the four-hour BTC/USD chart for proof of a turnaround.""Pulls back but still holds the wick-to-wick Higher Low. Turn $46720 in to support (black) and BTC will move higher. Strong bullish divergences on the 4HR are appearing as well,"" the trader commented alongside an annotated screenshot of the chart.Speaking to Cointelegraph, the Whalemap team noted that in the short term, the spent output profit ratio (SOPR), which tracks overall market profit and loss, was indicating that a deeper sell-off is off the cards, at least for now.""Hourly SOPR shows potential for at least a short term bounce,"" they said.Friday further sees a major expiry event on Bitcoin options, something that has dictated temporary downward pressure on BTC in the past. The day's low of $44,150, some say, was merely an attempt to suck up liquidity before the next leg higher.""Yes, market dumped after 'mega-whales' sold into the rally (as warned), but since then, they have been buying dips!"" observed the creator of exchange order book data analysis service Material Indicators.That ""uncertainty"" is being exacerbated by concerning trends in bond yields, Cointelegraph reported this week, with behavior seen as similar to before the global financial crisis of 2008."
205,"Bitcoin (BTC) hit fresh local lows on Feb. 26 despite what appear to be ongoing largescal institutional buy-ins.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView showed BTC/USD $44,150 during Friday trading — last seen two weeks ago — after a rebound to $50,000 fizzled overnight.Bitcoin had seen good news in the form of asset manager Stone Ridge planning to become the first Bitcoin mutual fund, along with major corporate purchases from MicroStrategy and Square. These, however, failed to stem the bearish mood, with 24-hour losses standing at near 10% at the time of writing.""Everyone wants 42k, so we probably just go up now or drop to 38k on a savage wick. Crowd rarely gets what it wants,"" popular trader Scott Melker summarized on Twitter.Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe had prevously forecast ultimate support lying at around $38,000 should Bitcoin not find buying volume at higher levels.""Bitcoin doesn't look too great for a bull continuation coming period,"" he said on Thursday.Data from the professional trading arm of U.S. exchange Coinbase meanwhile showed another major tranch of BTC leaving its books for a private or custody wallet — something which traditionally suggests institutional buying.The latest spike of 12,100 BTC is the second this week, such large volumes themselves being a rarity, a fresh chart from on-chain monitoring resource CryptoQuant confirms.The so-called ""Coinbase premium,"" the difference in price between Coinbase and Binance, flipped to negative for several brief moments as Bitcoin dropped to nearly $44,200. As Cointelegraph reported citing CryptoQuant, whales appear to favor buying at current price levels, with the result that a dip much below $44,000 would be ""unlikely,"" according to CEO Ki Young Ju.On Thursday, Ki described the last Coinbase Pro spike, which occurred at $48,000, as ""the strongest bullish signal"" he had yet seen in Bitcoin."
206,"Bordier & Cie, a Swiss financial institution operating for more than 170 years, has announced a partnership with digital asset bank Sygnum to allow its customers to purchase crypto assets.The integration with Sygnum’s business-to-business banking platform allows Bordier’s clients to purchase Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Tezos (XTZ).The announcement describes the move as “lay[ing] the foundation for a broader offering of regulated digital asset products and services,” including options and tokenized asset classes. Bordier managing partner Evrard Bordier said:Bordier noted the move was driven by increasing demand from clients looking to diversify their portfolios with new assets. The firm emphasized the lack of correlation between the cryptocurrency and mainstream financial markets, describing crypto assets as a ""powerful tool to enhance diversification and achieve superior risk-adjusted returns.""Bordier & Cie is a Geneva-based private banker founded in 1884, that has been owned and managed by the Bordier family for five generations. The bank’s introduction to crypto follows that of many other large institutions looking to adopt cryptocurrency in 2021."
207,"A survey of more than 2000 Australian investors has found that cryptocurrency is a more popular investment than gold and silver — but it still has a long way to go to catch up to shares.The poll, conducted on behalf of BTC Markets over the month of February, found that 12.6% of Aussie investors hold Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, compared to 12.1% who hold precious metals.However, the stock market is by far the preferred in option for investors, with 63.6% holding shares directly and 28.8% investing in either exchange-traded funds or managed funds. Property is also a popular investment (25.8%), while 18.8% said they invested in “collectibles”.Australian crypto investors heavily favor Bitcoin and Ethereum, with 83.2% holding Bitcoin and 42% holding Ethereum, followed by Ripple with 28.5%, Litecoin with 18%, and Bitcoin cash with 12%.The research revealed that almost one-third of the cryptocurrency investors made their first investment after the COVID-19 induced market crash of March 2020. This research is backed up by another poll from October 2020, which revealed that 39% of respondents had found Bitcoin more appealing after the pandemic began.Despite many cryptocurrencies rallying to all-time highs in recent months, 51% of Aussie investors stated they had no intention of selling their crypto soon, with 31% planning to exit after at least three years of holding. Of the 49% who are looking to sell or take profits, one in five investors intend to reinvest the capital back into crypto.The largest demographic of Aussie crypto investors (36.3%) in the survey were aged between 25-34 with, followed by those aged between 35-44 at 30.1%. Men accounted for 63% of all crypto investors, and one in four earned an income of more than $100,000 per year.BTC Markets CEO Caroline Bowler noted that an increasing number of older Australians are investing in crypto, with investors 60-plus doubling in number over the past couple of years to make up 10% of the client base:The research is broadly in line with other polls, including one in December that found almost one in five Australian adults owned crypto in 2020."
208,"The Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Digital Currency Initiative has revealed a new “Bitcoin Software and Security Effort” intended to foster research into bolstering the Bitcoin network’s defenses.The open-source initiative has received support from a diverse group of crypto industry leaders, including Gemini’s Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, MicroStrategy’s CEO Michael Saylor, Square CEO Jack Dorsey, and major European digital asset manager, CoinShares.In a blog post unveiling the project, DCI said that Bitcoin’s ascent from an “obscure cryptographic toy” to a robust network that “secures on the order of $1 [trillion] of value” was due to the millions of hours invested into building the project by open-source developers.Coinshares announced a $500,000 donation to the project and chief executive Jean-Marie Mognetti hinted that perhaps other crypto companies should do likewise:The DCI’s four-year research and development program aims to “harden the Bitcoin network and steward the industry's commitment to funding open-source software.”The blog post noted that, “The objective of DCI’s new program is to contribute neutral, expert resources to improving the robustness of the Bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin’s security is foundational to the underlying technology’s continued evolution, as well as the broad realization of the public-good promises of digital currencies.”The post listed several key issues that MIT is exploring, including sustaining a senior team of Bitcoin developers, exploring new programming languages, and pre-emptive investigations against possible attacks,MIT also stressed the need for the network’s security to grow and strengthen alongside increasing adoption, noting the challenge associated with coordinating a decentralized network:In July 2020, DCI researcher James Lovejoy warned that attempted 51% attacks — attempts to capture a majority share of nodes and thus control over the Bitcoin network — may be more plausible than previously thought.Lovejoy stressed the need for active blockchain monitoring in order to identify 51% attacks targeting proof-of-work blockchains, stating: “You need an active observer to be monitoring the network to check whether or not an attack occurs.”“Up until now we've been reliant on victims to tell us about whether they've been attacked. As you can imagine, if this results in insolvency or a loss of user funds, victims are often not super interested in revealing when an attack has taken place,” he added."
209,"Strategists at Wall Street banking giant JPMorgan have suggested that a one percent portfolio allocation to Bitcoin would serve as a hedge against fluctuations in traditional asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and commodities.A small percentage allocation was advised to mitigate the risk of any large downturns in the digital asset’s value. Bitcoin has declined 20% since its all-time high of over $58,000 on Feb. 21 but it is up 60% since the beginning of this year.According to Bloomberg, JPM strategists Joyce Chang and Amy Ho stated in a note to clients:The endorsement comes on the back of major investments in Bitcoin by Paul Tudor Jones, Stan Druckenmiller, Tesla, and MicroStrategy. The report added that BNY Mellon (Bank of New York Mellon Corporation) has also announced plans to hold, transfer and issue the digital asset for its clients.The JPMorgan analysts added that crypto assets should be treated as investment vehicles and not funding currencies such as USD or JPY. The comments appear to contradict those made earlier this month by other strategists at the investment bank who claimed that “crypto assets continue to rank as the poorest hedge for major drawdowns in equities.”Speaking to CNBC on Feb. 17, Ark Investment Management’s Cathie Wood observed that if all corporations were to put 10% of their cash into Bitcoin, it would add $200,000 to the asset’s price.Cryptocurrency purchases have surged in 2021, and it is not just institutions that are loading up. Trading firm Robinhood has reported that about 6 million new users bought cryptocurrencies on the platform just the first two months of this year.The numbers have dwarfed those for the previous year indicating that the bullish momentum from the retail sector is still strong despite the recent correction. At the time of writing, BTC had retreated a further 7% over the past 24 hours to trade at $47,100."
210,"The cryptocurrency market recovered some of the losses from the past couple of days on Feb. 25 as Bitcoin (BTC) briefly pushed back above the $50,000 level and multiple altcoins have seen double-digit price gains. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that Bitcoin bounced off a low of $45,200 late on Feb. 24 before rallying 15% to $52,000 in the morning trading session.While the rebound in the cryptocurrency market is a welcome sight for bullish investors, Bitcoin price is still finding resistance above $50,000, and this level has yet to be confirmed as support.Economists have also begun to worry about the rising Treasury yields, which are usually a signal of weakness for the economy and can have a large impact across many markets.Now that Bitcoin has entered a slight corrective phase, analysts are debating whether or not the digital asset will be able to surpass $100,000 by the end of 2021.According to Giles Coghlan, chief currency analyst at HYCM, the answer to that question “depends on who you ask,” with crypto advocates feeling “very bullish” that 2021 “will be the year Bitcoin steps into the limelight,” while traditionalists remain skeptical about the “risky, unpredictable market.”Coghlan sees the momentum behind the recent gains being driven by “the general public hype” following pro-crypto tweets from Elon Musk and Mark Cuban, but now the enthusiasm “seems to be waning” as Bitcoin struggles to hold $50,000.Due to the volatile nature of BTC, it’s “too early to tell if this will be the new baseline support level.”Coghlan said:The analyst sees the acceptance and endorsement of Bitcoin by “large institutional funds and regulatory bodies” as the next big driver of new price highs, which would also end the domination of the crypto market by retail traders and could lead to a “less volatile” market as a result.Several large- and mid-cap altcoins saw their prices breakout on Thursday as recent announcements and new integrations pushed trading volumes higher.Cardano's ADA is the best performing coin in the top 10, currently up 10.4% and trading at $1.15, while Fantom (FTM) continues to benefit from its recent cross-chain integration with Ethereum and is up 31.79% to a price of $0.7755. Other notable performers include Enjin Coin (ENJ), which is currently up 34% and trading at $0.6221. Polygon's MATIC has also increased by 27.74% and trades at $0.2023.The overall cryptocurrency market capitalization now stands at $1.533 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 61.3%."
211,"This week's correction in the price of Bitcoin (BTC) showed that a market doesn’t go up in a straight line. Meanwhile, another topic has been gaining attention, namely the big rise in the 10-year yields of United States government bonds. In recent weeks, the 10-year Treasury yield of U.S. government bonds has surged 35% to a new high of 1.44%, the highest point since the cross-asset crash in March 2020.The 10-year Treasury yield has been accelerating massively in recent weeks, similar to the run-up to the economic downturns in 2000 and 2008. Hence, rising yields are typically considered a signal of weakness for the economy and can have a big impact across many markets.As the yields increase, governments must pay more for their underlying government bonds. This combined with the current economic conditions of the post-COVID-19 era and record national debt are factors that are unsurprisingly worrying economists. However, looking at the chart above from a technical perspective, this entire run can still be considered as a simple bearish retest of the previous support level.Such an example is shown by the previous attempt to test the resistance above. This could be happening here as well, where the rates will then drop back down from the 1.53% level. But it is important to keep an eye on this level because breaking through it can have a major impact on the markets.The government bond yields also have an impact on mortgage markets. Given that the real estate market is massively overheated at the moment, with people taking on massive debt to purchase homes, an increase in interest rates could pop this entire bubble, similar to what happened in 2008.However, yields also impact other markets, as gold often reacts to these moves as well. But is this time different? And how will Bitcoin respond to these potential macroeconomic shocks?The U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) index continues to show weakness as yields are rising, which is generally good news for Bitcoin bulls. This suggests that investors are fleeing the dollar toward higher risk, higher reward investments, such as Bitcoin.However, from a technical perspective, the DXY saw a bearish retest at 91.50 points, followed by more downside for the dollar, as seen in the chart above. Now, a retest of the 90 points level is underway, with the primary question being whether this level will hold as support.Nevertheless, it’s debatable whether the rise in yields is having any direct effect on the price of Bitcoin, particularly in recent days. Meanwhile, the DXY has often been inversely correlated with the price of Bitcoin, though this has been decreasing in recent months (see below).After the crash in March 2020, this inverse relationship grew stronger until September 2020, as a weakening dollar was accompanied by a major increase in BTC price.Of course, assets are only correlated until they aren't, and many other factors can have a much bigger impact on BTC in the short term — for example, miners or whales selling Bitcoin, government regulations, etc. The 3-day chart for gold's price shows a clear-cut correction since August 2020. More importantly, the increase in yields and the weaker dollar have not impacted the gold market as much as Bitcoin's market.Even with the recent surge in yields, people are not buying gold. In fact, an increase in yields has historically not benefitted gold — at least not in the short term — because higher yields would make government bonds more attractive for funds to hold for settlement and as a risk-off asset in their portfolios.When yields continue rising toward higher levels, however, the uncertainty surrounding the economy also increases, and investors typically begin to shift from the dollar to gold as a safe haven. This was seen in the 1980s when yields ran toward 14% and gold also spiked to new all-time highs.In the current state, however, falling gold prices may simply be an immediate reaction to the increase in yields in general. However, another possibility is that an increasing number of investors are opting for ""digital gold"" instead of the precious metal, not only because of the higher upside potential — i.e., risk-reward — but also because these positions can be liquidated much easier.But another possibility is that an increasing number of investors are preferring ""digital gold"" to the precious metal — not only because of the higher upside potential but also because these positions can be liquidated much easier on digital trading platforms.11 August 2020, dotted blue line, US corporations led by $MSTR begin buying #bitcoin as a treasury asset. pic.twitter.com/LEMNzwqQruToday, the market capitalization of Bitcoin is still only 7% to 10% of gold's, which highlights this massive upside potential.Therefore, the macro conclusion that can be drawn is that the markets are becoming increasingly uncertain about the economy's and the dollar's future, as exemplified by the rising 10-year Treasury yields. However, it's still too early to write off the recent correction in BTC price to this macroeconomic development, as multiple other variables are at play.Ultimately, the rising yields and a weakening dollar are exciting developments to keep an eye on moving forward. With Bitcoin becoming an increasingly important player in the macroeconomic environment, strategists at JPMorgan Chase, for example, believe BTC may continue to eat away at gold's market share. This will likely result in an even higher valuation for Bitcoin, particularly in the event of another economic crisis at the expense of gold.In December 2020, JPMorgan strategists noted:The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
212,"Bitcoin Cash (BCH) holders have no reason to celebrate, despite the 46% year-to-date gains in U.S. dollar terms. One year ago, the altcoin was the third-largest by market capitalization. It now risks dropping out of the top 10, having been surpassed by other cryptocurrencies including Litecoin (LTC) and Chainlink's LINK.After three years of continuous devaluation, BCH finally traded below 0.01 Bitcoin (BTC) on Feb. 22. Besides being psychological support, it marks a 96.5% devaluation from its highest close of 0.285 BTC on Aug. 2, 2017.Even though both cryptocurrencies' combined hash rate was somewhat comparable at the time, it has since become a one-sided battle, with BTC's hash rate dominance now over 98% versus BCH and Bitcoin SV (BSV) combined.As depicted above, the BCH hash rate currently stands at 1% of BTC's 150 exahashes per second. However, BCH proponents argue that Bitcoin Cash's 10-block checkpoint system defends the blockchain against hostile reorgs, so less hash rate is needed.Nevertheless, while the risk of a ""deep reorg"" is reduced, checkpoints come with tradeoffs, particularly the increased risk of a consensus chain split, according to BitMex. The addition of checkpoints has also led to criticism from Bitcoin proponents, who argue that this solution compromises the decentralization of the Bitcoin Cash network. Just woke up:
So apparently Jihan took a lot of hashpower from Bitcoin to mine on $BCH. He got really scared and is burning a lot of money. https://t.co/RbObgu5fiS
They added a checkpoint to prevent attacks. It means that 1 person is saying what is the valid chain = centralized.Daily active addresses are a vital on-chain metric, albeit they are often inflated when the lower transaction costs are considered alongside network security tradeoffs. Nevertheless, comparing BCH with Litecoin and Dash seems reasonable, as the three networks have average fees below $0.05.As the data indicates, Litecoin currently has double the number of Bitcoin Cash daily active addresses. Therefore, the activity on the Bitcoin Cash network is more similar to that of Dash, an altcoin with a $2.2 billion market capitalizationAdditionally, the VORTECS™ metric from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began dropping on Feb. 18, just days before the price began to plummet.The VORTECS™ score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from multiple data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.The score fell to sub-50 levels, and the drop in BCH price came four days later, losing the important $670 support level.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

213,"The trustee of hacked, now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox has posted another update on the long-running process of refunding the exchange clients.Nobuaki Kobayashi, a Tokyo attorney appointed to act as civil rehabilitation trustee to manage Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy estate funds, announced Thursday that the Tokyo District Court ordered that “There were no grounds for disapproving the draft rehabilitation plan.” As previously reported, the plan was filed on Dec. 15, 2020.According to the announcement, the court has approved a repayment process schedule that includes a vote by creditors on the proposed refund plan. As part of the process, the trustee will initially determine the creditors with voting rights on March 24. Following the voting deadline on Oct. 8, creditors will attend a meeting on the resolution of the compensation plan on Oct. 20.Creditors will have three options to proceed with the voting on the draft compensation plan, including online voting, written voting, and voting in person on the day of the creditor meeting. Select creditors will be asked to choose one of these methods, Kobayashi wrote.Founded in 2010, Mt. Gox was once the world’s largest Bitcoin (BTC) exchange, reportedly handling up to 80% of global BTC trading volumes. The crypto exchange suffered a series of devastating hacks, losing a total of 1.35 million BTC in two incidents in 2011 and 2014.Following the second hack, Kobayashi was appointed to oversee the civil reimbursement process to reportedly compensate the 24,000 victims of the Mt. Gox hack. According to reports, there is around $630 million and 150,000 BTC in the Mt. Gox bankruptcy trust waiting to be distributed to their rightful owners. Despite the reimbursement operation being initiated years ago, creditors still haven’t been paid back, following multiple delays."
214,"Like Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett, 97-year-old Charlie Munger is a known critic of Bitcoin (BTC).Addressing the 2021 Daily Journal annual meeting with shareholders organized by Yahoo Finance on Wednesday, Munger again espoused some negative sentiments about the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.Fielding questions from shareholders concerning Bitcoin, Munger stated:Compared with Munger’s previous comments about Bitcoin, his remarks during the meeting appeared watered down. Indeed, Munger once said that Bitcoin investors were celebrating the life and work of Judas Iscariot.During the 2018 edition of the Daily Journal annual meeting, Munger characterized cryptocurrencies as “totally asinine” and called professional crypto traders “disgusting.”At Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting in 2018, Munger likened the crypto market to “trading turds.” At that same event, Buffett would render his infamous “rat poison-squared remark” about Bitcoin.With development work on scaling solutions like Lightning Network and sidechains still in progress, the jury is still out on whether BTC will ever function efficiently as a medium of exchange.However, the case of Bitcoin as a store of value appears significantly stronger, despite assertions to the contrary by critics like Nouriel Roubini and gold bug Peter Schiff. Munger also touched on BTC being like gold on Wednesday, adding:The Berkshire Hathaway vice-chairman did not waste the opportunity to drop an anti-Bitcoin soundbite, quoting Irish poet and playwright Oscar Wilde by comparing BTC to fox hunting. “It’s like what Oscar Wilde said on fox hunting: the pursuit of the uneatable by the unspeakable,” Munger quipped.Buffett’s right-hand man also dismissed the idea of the Daily Journal emulating companies like Tesla in adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet.As part of his comments at the event, Munger also waxed lyrical about mainstream finance saying that “a properly run bank is a great contributor to civilization.”"
215,"United States-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has revealed that Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets have been a key component of its corporate treasury since the company's founding back in 2012. In a new announcement addressed to other corporate actors, the exchange presented its own experience in managing its treasury position in cryptocurrencies as a solid foundation for advising other private and publicly traded companies about how to deal with their own prospective investments. In a newly published, highly detailed corporate treasury FAQ, the exchange provides a thorough overview of the kinds of investment, accounting and tax policies that companies would need to consider and adopt if they wish to diversify their treasuries into crypto. The FAQ is both a general resource that covers all manner of regulatory, auditory, technical and investment questions about crypto from a corporate investment perspective and a pitch for companies to choose Coinbase in particular as a trade executor, consultant and professional custody partner.The document also provides overviews of Bitcoin's performance in recent years from a macro perspective, revealing its favorable comparison to other financial assets such as gold and the S&P 500. ""Bitcoin’s strong absolute performance compensated investors for its volatility,"" the exchange notes. Risk-adjusted, the asset had a rolling annualized Sharpe ratio of 1.52 over the past five years, taking into account the 2018 bear market.Corporate investment in cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin, has made headlines in recent weeks due to Tesla's $1.5 billion investment in the asset, which resulted in rumored profits of up to $1 billion. Notwithstanding this extraordinary windfall, analysts have said that while they expect a ripple effect among corporations following Tesla's move, less than 5% of publicly traded firms are likely to be confident enough to invest at present, until there is more regulatory clarity."
216,"Bitcoin (BTC) may be worth almost three times more than at the height of its 2017 bull run, but a lot of hodlers from that time refuse to sell.The latest data from Bitcoin financial services firm Unchained Capital shows that 2017 buyers control an increasingly large amount of the BTC supply.According to Unchained’s HODL Waves chart, which ranks the supply according to when coins last moved, those who bought three to five years ago are sitting on their investment.Since the cross-asset crash of March 2020, when BTC/USD fell to lows of $3,600, the percentage of the BTC supply that last moved between February 2016 and February 2018 increased from 5.57% to 13.38%.In other words, the uptrend in price during 2019, much of 2020 and all of 2021 has not made 2017 bull run investors sell after surviving the multiyear bear market.By contrast, the five-year to seven-year and seven-year to 10-year hodl crowd has been reducing its presence over the past year.“At the beginning of January, 59% of all bitcoin in the network were sitting for longer than 1 year without moving, and by the end of the month, that number dipped to 57%, a decrease of 2% or around roughly 372,320 bitcoin,” Unchained wrote in an update earlier this month.The data counteracts an informal narrative still found online that claims that Bitcoin breaching $20,000 for the first time since 2017 last year triggered a mass sell-off from investors desperate to exit at parity or with a modest profit.As Cointelegraph reported, subsequent gains produced limited selling beyond the whale investor crowd, with any price drips aggressively bought up.HODL Waves likewise confirms that appetite for Bitcoin has not been dented by price rises beyond $30,000, $40,000 and even $50,000.A separate cohort, those who bought before 2011, is meanwhile similarly responsible for a larger amount of the supply. Since March 15, 2020, their share has increased from 6.85% to 10.24%.A stash of 100 BTC, untouched since 2010, made its first reappearance on the network this week.11 August 2020, dotted blue line, US corporations led by $MSTR begin buying #bitcoin as a treasury asset. pic.twitter.com/LEMNzwqQruUnlike 2016 to 2018, however, the situation is complicated by the advent of large-scale corporate buyers, notably MicroStrategy, which this week announced its latest buy-in, taking its total Bitcoin holdings to over 90,000 BTC."
217,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is continuing to range between $48,000 and $51,000, unable to break out of the $51,600 resistance level.If Bitcoin struggles to surpass the $51,600 resistance area in the near term, technical analysts say the probability of a correction rises.According to Josh Olszewicz, a cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst, the $51,600 level is currently acting as a strong resistance level.For Bitcoin to retest the all-time high at $58,000 and initiate a potential rally towards $62,000, it needs to cleanly move past $51,600, he explained. Hence, a rally beyond $51,600 is the clear invalidation point for any short-term bearish scenario for Bitcoin.The failure to break out in the near term could result in a bearish test of lower support areas, found at around $42,000. He said:The $42,000 support area is a key level because it marks the top of the previous rally. On Jan. 8, the price of Bitcoin peaked at $42,085 on Binance, seeing a steep correction afterwards.Bitcoin dropping to $42,000 to retest the previous top as a support area would not be necessarily bearish beyond the short term, however. Moreover, analysts at Whalemap noted large inflows to whale wallets at $48,500 and $46,500, which they say should provide BTC with some support. ""The current situation looks similar to the one we had at 29K,"" they explained. What's more, the $46,532 level may now be ""the new $29,000,"" which held as support during the previous correction in January before the rally continued. They added: Bitcoin tends to seek liquidity after a prolonged consolidation, which means it can drop down to fill buy orders at lower support areas that can ultimately fuel a new rally.A pseudonymous trader known as ""Salsa Tekila"" echoed this sentiment. He said that there is a big support area at $41,000, followed by resistance at $54,000. He wrote:Bitcoin tested the $44,800 support level in the past 72 hours, but it was not enough to propel BTC above $51,600.This trend could cause the price of Bitcoin to drop back to the $44,800 level or to a lower support level, at $42,000.The ideal scenario would be for Bitcoin to hold onto the $44,800 support area if it drops again, stabilize it as a macro support level, and move back up."
218,"The Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand has launched a public consultation on proposed cryptocurrency investor qualification rules.According to an official announcement Thursday, the Thai SEC is now seeking public comments on proposed qualifications for crypto investors including certain income and trading experience requirements.As part of the initiative, the Thai SEC is planning to hold a live hearing through its Facebook page on March 24. The public consultation will continue until March 27, the authority said.According to a proposed consultation paper, the regulator is planning to set solid limits on cryptocurrency trading in Thailand, including requiring local crypto investors to possess net assets of at least 10 million baht ($332,500) as well as have an annual income of 1 million baht ($33,250). According to the proposed rules, investor net worth will not include the value of real estate used for permanent residence.As part of the new investor qualifications, the SEC is also looking to require traders to have investing experience and education. Local traders should have at least two years of experience in securities or derivative trading or obtain a special certification from the authorized institutions.The SEC initially announced its plans for crypto investor requirements earlier this month. By initiating the new rules, the authority aims to ensure proper investor protection measures as local interest in crypto investments surges. “Cryptocurrency is a financial innovation that is exposed to high volatility. Investment in this digital asset thus requires knowledge and understanding and a risk profile that is not so sensitive to investment loss,” the new announcement notes. Ruenvadee Suwanmongkol, the secretary general of the SEC, told Bloomberg that investors who do not qualify for trading will still be able to invest through licensed fund managers or financial advisers.“It’s a big concern as most crypto investors on domestic exchanges are very young, such as students and teenagers. We realize those people love innovations and technology, but investments in these assets have enormous risk,” Suwanmongkol said.The SEC did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment."
219,"Indian cryptocurrency exchange Unocoin has adopted the blockchain-based Unstoppable Domains, which simplifies crypto transactions by turning blockchain addresses into human-readable web URLs.Announced on Wednesday, the partnership between Unocoin and Unstoppable Domains — both funded by Silicon Valley investor Tim Draper — is expected to reduce remittance costs and simplify the transaction process for the exchange’s 1.2 million users.Unstoppable Domains turns crypto addresses into decentralized websites on the Ethereum and Zilliqa blockchains. Instead of sending coins to a 42-character blockchain address, Unstoppable Domains allows users to create simple URLs ending in “.crypto” and “.zil” extensions. Domain names need only be purchased once, and then exist forever on the blockchain without requiring any renewal or maintenance fees.The decentralized aspect of Unstoppable Domains should be of particular interest to Indian crypto users, especially amid the furor created by the Finance Ministry’s decision to ban the use of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.Pushback against the country’s plan to outlaw cryptocurrency has emerged on social media in the form of the #IndiaWantsBitcoin campaign. Despite regulatory uncertainty, the co-founder and CEO of Unocoin, Sathvik Vishwanath, sees the adoption of Unstoppable Domains as being in line with the maturation of the crypto industry in India. Vishwanath said:Unstoppable Domains co-founder Brad Kam referenced the reluctance of the Indian government to allow the spread of cryptocurrency within its borders:On Wednesday, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das reiterated the central bank’s intention to create its own centrally issued currency, the digital rupee. This follows a common trend that has emerged in recent years as national governments attempt to reign-in the spread of decentralized cryptocurrencies and replace them with digital versions of existing fiat currencies.As reported by Cointelegraph, Unstoppable Domains was recently integrated into Cloudflare’s Distributed Web Resolver, meaning any web browser can now access the .crypto URL extensions.A spokesperson for Unstoppable Domains confirmed to Cointelegraph that even if Unocoin were to be shut down in the near future, the addresses and URLs created through the platform would remain unaffected. How Indian authorities would react to the use of such technology in the event of a full crypto ban remains to be seen."

While the majority of altcoins have entered a consolidation phase that includes a retest of underlying support levels, several projects have started to regain lost ground after new developments reignited investors' optimism.Cardano's ADA started the year with a bullish spark that saw its price increase 624% from $0.165 on Jan. 2 to a high of $1.20 on Feb. 20.

The move was done in response to the growing momentum of Polkadot and a desire to build an interoperability protocol on top of Ethereum.High gas fees on the Ethereum network have increased the need for layer-two solutions, and Polygon has emerged as one of the top solutions with projects like Aavegochi and Golem already operating on the protocol.The rebrand helped lift the price of MATIC from $0.07 on Feb. 9 to an all-time high of $0.197 on Feb. 20 before the market downturn pushed it back down to $0.111 on Feb. 23.Since that time the MATIC has recovered 62% to trade at $0.16 as the community and total value locked on Polygon continue to grow.Stacks (STX) was the breakout star on Feb. 24 as the layer-one blockchain solution designed to bring smart contracts and decentralized applications to Bitcoin saw a record $166 million in trading volume that elevated STX to a new all-time high of $1.17.Excitement for the project comes after the Feb. 23 announcement that STX holders can now participate in delegated staking from the Stacks wallet, allowing them to earn BTC rewards.According to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro, market conditions for STX have been favorable for some time.As seen in the chart above, the VORTECS™ score for STX hit a high of 87 on Feb. 23, around 30 hours before the price increased 75% to its new high of $1.17.Interoperability, cross-bridge solutions and staking have emerged as drivers of growth that help incentivize investors to hold their tokens and also attract new participants to old and new blockchain projects.Following the recent market downturn, it's clear that projects that offer tokenholders multiple ways to earn a yield and operate across separate blockchain networks are beginning to stand out from the rest of the field."
222,"Decentralized finance and the numerous platforms offering investment services have been the talk of the cryptocurrency sector for several months, and this has resulted in investors capturing spectacular gains for some of the top DeFi tokens like Uniswap's UNI and AAVE. The fast-moving prices and 1,000% annual percentage yield on staked tokens elicited cheers from investors when the market was going up, but the recent selling pressure seen as Bitcoin's (BTC) price dropped below $45,000 shows that the highest fliers are often the quickest to fall as traders rush to exit their positions and lock in their gains.On Feb. 22, Bitcoin's price entered a sharp corrective phase that saw the top digital asset pull back by more than 20% from its all-time high of $58,274. As this occurred, the majority of altcoins also saw double-digit corrections, and DeFi tokens like PancakeSwap's CAKE fell as much as 55%. The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi platforms also took a hit as Bitcoin and altcoins corrected. Data from DeFi Llama shows the combined TVL of all DeFi platforms fell from $64.89 billion to $54.22 billion on Feb. 24. Cointelegraph also reported that this week's correction led to the second-largest day of DeFi loan liquidations in history. The decline in TVL is a result of decreasing token values rather than protocol outflows, indicating that tokenholders remain committed to the continued expansion of decentralized finance and that the current yields are still incentivizing investors to remain engaged.Market analysis indicates that despite the recent $5.8-billion Bitcoin and altcoin liquidation, bulls remain optimistic and see this price pullback as a sign of a healthy market.The same goes for the DeFi sector, which has been in a strong uptrend since the start of the year. Increasing DEX volume and as a rising TVL show that DeFi is still in the early stages of growth, and while pullbacks are to be expected, the overall trend is positive as institutional and retail investors increasingly gain exposure to this emerging asset class."
223,"Bitcoin’s price rose significantly in January. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or CME, also hit record Bitcoin (BTC) futures trading numbers in the same month. “In January, BTC average daily volume (ADV) reached a monthly record of 17,549 contracts (87.7K equivalent bitcoin),” a CME representative told Cointelegraph. Each CME Bitcoin futures contract is worth the value of 5 BTC paid out in dollars.“In December 2020, BTC average daily volume (ADV) reached 11,179 contracts (55.9K equivalent bitcoin),” the representative added. “This represents a +57% increase.”In January, Bitcoin rose from $30,000 up to almost $42,000, according to TradingView data. The month before, the asset had broken its longstanding record high of approximately $20,000, surging up to nearly $30,000 by the end of 2020.“We are continuing to see robust interest in our Bitcoin futures contracts, with a record 528 accounts added in January, helping drive BTC average daily volume (ADV) to a monthly record of 17,549 contracts (87.7K equivalent bitcoin), up 63% YoY,” the CME representative said.CME’s BTC futures trading product has gained a notable number of users since its inception in December 2017. “7,400+ unique, active accounts have traded since launch,” CME said in a recent report showing numbers up to Feb. 17. “Of those, 733 were added in 2021, 2.3x more than in 2020,” the report added.Bitcoin recently dropped more than $13,000 from its last record high, although the asset has since regained some ground, trading at around $49,200 as of publication time."
224,"Institutional investors continue to pour money into the crypto sector even with the current dip below $45,000. On Feb.24, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy announced that it had recently purchased over $1 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) at an average rate of $52,765 per coin. This takes the company’s total holding to 90,531 Bitcoin.Another company that bought Bitcoin during the current market correction is Square. The company said it had acquired roughly “3,318 Bitcoin at an aggregate purchase price of $170 million.”These purchases by institutional investors show they are bullish on the long-term prospects of Bitcoin and believe that it is a good buy near $50,000.While the institutional purchases are a bullish sign, traders must also remember that for every buyer, there is a seller. Glassnode data suggests that Bitcoin whales, holding between 1,000 Bitcoin to 10,000 Bitcoin and “humpback whales” holding more than 10,000 Bitcoin have sold more than 140,000 Bitcoin in February.In the past, the whales swayed the crypto markets at their will. But the entry of institutional investors has reduced their dominance. Therefore, along with the whales, traders must also keep an eye on the institutional activity.While large investors can buy and hold for the long-term, the smaller investor would do well to buy at the right time to make the most of the limited available capital. Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the trend.Bitcoin’s pullback from the 20-day exponential moving average ($48,323) on Feb. 22 was greeted with aggressive selling on February 23. The bears dragged the price below the channel, but the long tail on the day’s candlestick shows buying at lower levels.The buyers are currently attempting to keep the BTC/USD pair inside the channel. However, the inside day candlestick pattern today suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. The flat 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) just above the midpoint also suggest a balance between supply and demand.If the bulls can sustain the price above $50,000, the pair will try to rise to the resistance line of the ascending channel. The next leg of the uptrend may begin after the price breaks above the all-time high at $58,341.03.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears again sink the price below the channel, the pair may drop to $45,000 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($40,541). A break below this support could signal a deeper correction to $28,850.Ether (ETH) fell below the support line of the ascending channel and the 50-day SMA ($1,487) on Feb. 23, but the bulls purchased the dip and managed to keep the price inside the channel.The bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($1,728). If they succeed, the ETH/USD pair may again try to rise to the resistance line of the channel.However, the 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is near the midpoint, which suggests that the bears are trying to make a comeback.If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will once again try to sink and sustain the pair below the 50-day SMA. If they can manage to do that, the pair may enter a deeper correction and slump to $1,000.Binance Coin (BNB) remains volatile within a large intraday trading range. The bears pulled the price down to the 20-day EMA ($182) on Feb. 23 but the altcoin made a smart recovery as seen from the long tail on the day’s candlestick.VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for BNB on Feb. 23 prior to the recent price rise.The VORTECS™ score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity.Even as Binance Coin’s price started to correct from $273 on Feb. 23, the VORTECS™ score started to turn up from 71.The score reached 82 just after the announcement of UFT token listing on Binance and this was followed by several other revelations related to BNB’s integration to the DeFi space. Following these announcements and the bullish outlook seen in the VORTECS™score, BNB price started to rally from $201.That was soon followed by a sharp recovery in the price. After a brief dip, the VORTECS™ score started to strengthen from 71 and reached 80 as the price recovered to $271 on Feb. 24.The bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the downtrend line, but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling at higher levels.If the price again turns down from the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA. A break below this support could intensify the selling and drag the price down to $118.Conversely, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the downtrend line, the BNB/USD pair may rally to $300 and then to $348.6969.The long tail on the Feb. 22 and 23 candlesticks shows that traders are aggressively buying the dip in Polkadot (DOT).VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for Polkadot on Feb. 23, prior to the relief rally from the intraday lows.The VORTECS™ score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activityThe VORTECS™ score for DOT moved above 70 on Feb. 23 when the price was at $36.78. Even as the price continued to fall, the VORTECS™ score reached 82 when DOT’s price was below $30. This strength in the VORTECS™ score was followed by a sharp recovery in price to $36 on Feb. 24.DOT’s recovery coincided with the rebound in most major cryptocurrencies, which followed Bitcoin’s relief rally from the $45,000 intraday low made on Feb. 23 to about $50,000 on Feb. 24.The bulls are currently attempting to push and sustain the price back above the resistance line of the ascending channel. If they succeed, the DOT/USD pair may rally to $42.2848.A breakout and close above the all-time high could open the gates for a rally to the psychological level at $50. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest advantage to the bulls.This bullish view will invalidate if the pair turns down sharply from the current levels and plummets below the support line of the ascending channel.The bears once again tried to sink Cardano (ADA) below the 20-day EMA ($0.867) on Feb. 23 but failed. This shows the sentiment remains positive and traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.The bulls have again pushed the price above $0.9817712. If they can sustain the price above the psychological level at $1, a retest of $1.1980811 is possible. A breakout and close above this resistance may signal the resumption of the uptrend.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought territory. This suggests the path of least resistance is to the upside.This bullish view will be negated if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the ADA/USD pair down to $0.6879684.XRP has been all over the place in the past few days. After the bulls failed to sustain the price above $0.65 on Feb. 22, the altcoin witnessed intense selling pressure and plunged to $0.365 on Feb. 23. However, the long tail on the day’s candlestick shows aggressive buying at lower levels.Buying on dips and selling on rallies is a sign of consolidation. The XRP/USD pair could trade between $0.359 and $0.65 for a few days. The flattish 20-day EMA ($0.499) and the RSI near 50 also point to a possible range-bound action for a few days.The next trending move could start after the bulls push and sustain the price above $0.65 or the bears sink the pair below $0.359. Until then, volatile range-bound action is likely to continue.The failure of the bulls to build upon Litecoin’s (LTC) recovery on Feb. 22 shows a possible change in sentiment. Traders seem to be using the rallies to book profits. The altcoin turned down on Feb. 23 and this may have caught the aggressive bulls on the wrong foot, resulting in liquidation of long positions.The LTC/USD pair broke below the 50-day SMA ($166) on Feb. 23, but the bulls defended the uptrend line. However, any relief rally is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($195) that has started to turn down.If the bulls fail to drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may witness one more bout of selling that could pull the price down to the $120 support.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. Above this level, a retest of $246.9679 may be on the cards.Chainlink (LINK) plunged below the support line of the ascending channel on Feb. 23 and this could have trapped the aggressive bulls who had purchased the dip on Feb. 22. Stop losses may have triggered below $25.2312, which pulled the price down to the critical support at $20.1111.The dip buyers purchased the fall on Feb. 23 and are currently attempting to push the price back into the ascending channel. However, the buyers are likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($29.58).If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that traders are selling on rallies. The bears will then try to sink the price back below the 50-day SMA and retest the $20.1111 support.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push and sustain the price inside the ascending channel. Such a move could result in a rally to $34 and then to $36.9307.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) sold off on Feb. 23 and broke below the 50-day SMA ($514). However, the bulls purchased the dip to the uptrend line and are currently attempting to push the price back above the $539 resistance.The 20-day EMA ($596) has turned down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a marginal advantage to the bears.The sellers are likely to defend the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from this resistance, it will suggest that traders are selling on rallies. A break and close below the uptrend line could clear the path for a decline to $370.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair may rise to $631.71 and then to $745.Stellar Lumens (XLM) plunged below the $0.35 support on Feb. 23, but the long tail on the day’s candlestick suggests the bulls bought the dip. The altcoin is currently trading inside a descending channel.If the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.439), the XLM/USD pair could rise to the resistance line of the channel. A breakout of the channel will indicate that the bulls are back in the game. The buyers will then try to propel the price to $0.600681.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and plummets below $0.35, it could open the doors for a deeper correction to $0.23.The flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not indicate a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

225,"Crypto exchange and debit card provider Crypto.com has published a new report estimating that the total number of crypto users globally rose from 66 million in May 2020 to 106 million by January.Given the complexity of mapping unique crypto wallet addresses onto the number of persons, Crypto.com's methodology combines on-chain data with several blended parameters to calculate separate estimates for the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). These then yield an aggregate that can be used to track trends in the growth of global users over time.Over the past eight months, June 2020, August 2020 and January 2021 were the strongest for growth. As a general rule, Crypto.com note that this growth correlates with price strength for Bitcoin, but breaking down the data between the two coins can provide more specific insights.In particular, adoption in August 2020 was largely led by Ether due to the popularity of decentralized finance. Moving into the autumn and winter months, PayPal’s launch of support for crypto purchases for United States-based users in November 2020 and institutional adoption from Grayscale and Microstrategy intersected with strong Bitcoin price performance to spur yet wider adoption.By January, the global number of Bitcoin users was estimated to be 71 million, as compared with 14 million for Ether. Each coin saw a tremendous surge in users that month — 30.2% and 13.1%, respectively.While the trends appear to be clear, Crypto.com has noted some of the limitations and caveats that should be kept in mind regarding its findings. The methodology draws on Bitcoin and Ethereum’s on-chain data, survey analysis and Crypto.com’s own internal data, but will likely not capture over-the-counter users and off-chain transactions effectively.Crypto.com also had to assume and estimate how many on-chain users still own crypto today, versus the number likely to have already sold their holdings. In addition, sampling bias (due to some use of internal surveys and data) should be taken into account, as well as possible differences between exchanges' deposit sweeping flows. However, the report notes that an effort was made to remove those exchanges that use different flows from its list of 24 analyzed platforms."
226,"Users of the Opera web browser will now be able to purchase cryptocurrencies directly within the application following a partnership with Simplex. Founded in 2014, Simplex is a European Union-licensed fintech company that provides access to over 50 cryptocurrencies and is a principal member of the Visa network.The Opera browser was one of the first to integrate cryptocurrency use into its core functions, supplying in-built wallets for Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Tron's Tronix (TRX). Now, users will be able to move from fiat to crypto with the same ease.Simplex’s technological infrastructure is used by numerous well-known cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance, Kucoin, OKEx and others. The firm has partnered with over 350 crypto institutions since its launch, supplying access to cryptocurrencies via debit and credit card purchases.The Opera browser’s focus on privacy sees it come with a free built-in VPN, and in 2020, it became the first browser to allow access to the decentralized web “.crypto” URLs, in combination with Unstoppable Domains.A Simplex representative told Cointelegraph the integration was in response to user demand, and that in-browser Know Your Customer checks can be completed in minutes. Opera is currently the fifth-most-used browser in the world, taking up around 2.5% of the market share, behind Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Microsoft Edge."
227,"Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy increased its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings by 27% on Wednesday after purchasing an additional 19,452 coins, taking its total haul to 90,531 BTC.Announced on the company’s website on Wednesday, the coins were reportedly purchased for approximately $52,765 per coin, equating to an outlay of just over $1 billion.MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor said the firm’s focus was now twofold: grow its analytics software enterprise, and buy more Bitcoin. Saylor said, “The Company remains focused on our two corporate strategies of growing our enterprise analytics software business and acquiring and holding bitcoin.""In the six months since MicroStrategy announced its first $250 million investment in Bitcoin, the company has gone on to spend in excess of $4 billion on the digital asset. Saylor said there was no plan to stop buying BTC any time soon.“The company now holds over 90,000 bitcoins, reaffirming our belief that bitcoin, as the world’s most widely-adopted cryptocurrency, can serve as a dependable store of value. We will continue to pursue our strategy of acquiring bitcoin with excess cash and we may from time to time, subject to market conditions, issue debt or equity securities in capital raising transactions with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase additional bitcoin.""The value of MicroStrategy’s purchase exceeded the figures previously floated by the firm, which announced it would raise $900 million to buy more Bitcoin on Feb. 17.Phong Le, president and chief financial officer of MicroStrategy, said the Bitcoin purchases would help enhance awareness of its brand as a software business while also acting as a sign of faith in the Bitcoin network.“We believe our bitcoin strategy, including our bitcoin holdings and related activities in support of the bitcoin network, is complementary to our software business, by enhancing awareness of our brand and providing opportunities to secure new customers,"" he said."
228,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) quickly recovered from around $44,800 to over $50,000 within merely 22 hours. Behind the rapid recovery are three major factors, including low funding rates, Square's $170 million Bitcoin purchase and the spot market stabilizing.Across major futures exchanges — including Binance, Bybit and Bitfinex — the funding rate of Bitcoin has dropped to 0.01%.The Bitcoin futures funding rate was consistently above 0.1% throughout the entirety of the rally from the $40,000s to $58,000.When the futures funding rate is high, it means the market is overcrowded with buyers and the rally is likely overextended.This creates a major risk of a long squeeze, which can cause the price of Bitcoin to drop quickly in a short period.With the funding rate back to 0.01%, the risk of a long squeeze is significantly lower, and if a new uptrend ensues, the rally could be more sustainable.On Feb. 24, the United States payments giant Square bought $170 million worth of Bitcoin. This comes after purchasing $50 million worth of Bitcoin on Oct. 8, 2020. At the time, Square's chief financial officer, Amrita Ahuja, said:The additional purchase of Bitcoin by Square carries a significant meaning because it shows that the company is confident in BTC over the long term.The price of Bitcoin is substantially higher than where it was in August 2020, which indicates that as its price rises, the confidence from institutions also increases.When Bitcoin was correcting, its price on spot exchanges, like Coinbase, was much lower than futures exchangesOn Feb. 23, for instance, Bitcoin was trading $600 lower on Coinbase at one point when the price was near $44,800.When the price of Bitcoin initially recovered from $44,800 to $48,000, there were signs of a bearish retest.John Cho, director of global expansion at GroundX, said:Bitcoin's price has recovered above $50,000 since, and that could have reduced the likelihood of a bearish retest and the potential for more downside.In the near term, if Bitcoin continues to remain above $50,600, which has turned into a support area, the probability of a rally toward the next resistance level at $56,000 rises.Lastly, such corrections are quite normal for a Bitcoin bull market cycle, as Cointelegraph previously pointed out. In fact, they were commonplace during the 2017 bull market, which had nine major pullbacks between 20% and 40%. But despite these reoccurring ""severe"" corrections, the price of Bitcoin still increased twentyfold from its previous all-time high during that year."
229,"Bitcoin (BTC) hit back to reclaim $50,000 on Feb. 24 amid fresh bullish comments from major investors.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView tracked a 14% rise from Tuesday's lows over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin posting local highs of $51,278 on Bitstamp.At the time of writing, $50,000 was forming a price focus with bulls still to take charge to dictate new support levels. After its 20% decline from all-time highs this week, Bitcoin's almost instant renaissance accompanied votes of confidence from various investment sources.Among them was Ark Investment Management founder, CEO and CIO Cathie Wood, who said that the retracement was a ""healthy"" sign given months of near-vertical upside.Speaking to Bloomberg, she said that was “very positive on Bitcoin, very happy to see a healthy correction here.""That correction was in fact ""relatively modest"" even compared to the dive from $42,000 to $30,000 in January, Bespoke Investment Group noted in a blog post about market conditions. In additional comparisons surfacing on Twitter, commentators highlighted the many and various drawdowns witnessed during the 2017 bull run, the majority of which were in excess of 30%.Meanwhile, Wood did not share the pessimistic outlook from Bitcoin critics over major companies exchange cash on their balance sheets for BTC.""This has to mature a little bit before broad-based adoption can take place, but we're very reassured that companies like Square and Tesla have chosen to allocate,"" she told CNBC.Square expanded its Bitcoin holdings considerably this week, buying 3,318 BTC for $170 million, adding to its existing $50 million stash. Tesla, one analyst continued, should also be looking to ""double down"" on its commitment.Wood additionally reiterated that if all United States corporations were to make a 10% Bitcoin allocation, the cryptocurrency would be worth $200,000 more. Earlier this month, Cointelegraph reported on the Ark data that Wood cited in the form of a report into the potential impact on BTC/USD from mass corporate adoption."
230,"One of Southeast Asia’s biggest crypto exchanges is blaming a technical glitch for the price of Bitcoin dropping down to 300,000 Philippine pesos, roughly $6,100, on Feb. 16. An unknown number of customers of the Philippine Digital Assets Exchange, or PDAX, managed to buy thousands of Bitcoin (BTC) from the exchange at a massive discount, making them local currency billionaires on paper — at least for a few hours.A number of PDAX customers withdrew their purchased Bitcoin up to the exchange’s limit on individual accounts of 1 BTC per 24 hours. PDAX is reportedly demanding these users refund BTC obtained during the crash under the threat of potential legal action.The tech glitch led to a 36-hour closure, and several users continue to report remaining locked out of their accounts.Still unable to login for 7 days straight now. They're trying to cover up something fishy here. I also heard from many of the users that their transactions was reversed by pdax during the downtime. They're obviously lying because many still couldn't access their accounts.One user, who managed to purchase Bitcoin when it dropped to 300,000 Philippine pesos from 2.4 million Philippine pesos, took to Reddit to ask for opinions on whether or not they are legally required to return the Bitcoin, receiving an outpouring of mixed responses.“I managed to transfer the purchased BTC to another wallet outside PDAX just before they closed the trading and eventually the website,” the Redditor explained in a thread on r/Phinvest.On Tuesday, PDAX CEO Nichel Gaba held a press conference to further clarify what happened the week prior. He explained that the burden placed on the exchange by a flurry of unanticipated activity introduced a glitch that allowed an unfunded order to be matched with a funded order. According to Gaba, this led to a cascade effect that dropped the price of BTC below reasonable levels.Gaba stressed that of all the exchange’s customers, only “0.2% are unable to access their accounts” as of Tuesday.Founded in 2019, PDAX is licensed to operate as an exchange by the Philippine central bank. The exchange’s Feb. 16 closure occurred during a pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s history as its price soared above $50,000 for the first time.PDAX is not alone in its growing challenge to meet the demand of its users, as Coinbase and Binance also suffered service outages this year."
231,"According to a new report from crypto market data aggregator, Glassnode, Bitcoin whales offloaded massive amounts of BTC during February.Glassnode defines any address that holds between 1,000 BTC and 10,000 BTC as a “whale”, while “humpback whales” hold more than 10,000 BTC. The report found that the number of whales increased by more than 14% in the year to Feb. 5, 2021.Whales and humpbacks' buying spree peaked in January as they snapped up 80,000 BTC, worth $3.84 billion at today’s prices.But since February, whales and humpbacks appear to have taken heavy profits, offloading 140,000 BTC — equal to $6.72 billion since the start of the month.The data shows an inverse-correlation between the trading activities of whales to smaller, but still very wealthy investors. Glassnode noted that “dolphins” and “sharks” — wallets that hold between 100 BTC and 1,000 BTC — shed 95,000 BTC worth $4.56 billion in January, but flipped bullish in February, collectively accumulating 117,000 Bitcoin ($5.61 billion) since the start of the month:“Octopus” and “Fish” — wallets that hold between 10 BTC and 100 BTC — have been consistently offloading their holdings since November 2020, selling more than 128,000 Bitcoin or $6.14 billion in less than four months.The 20% BTC price crash this week sparked a lot of action for the whales and was front run by one clever whale who managed to cash out $156 million before the dip began on Monday.Fears of a further down-trend may not eventuate as new research from trading platform CrossTower argues that institutional buying will hold BTC above $50,000 in the long term."
232,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk has lost his crown as the world’s richest man following a sharp correction in Bitcoin (BTC) and a slump in his company’s stock that some analysts believe are correlated. Tesla stock (TSLA) has dropped 21% from its high of $890 on January 26, accelerating those losses over the past two days in a fall to $698. Shares of the electric vehicle maker dipped as much as 13% on Tuesday, the stock’s worst day since early September 2020.Fox Business has blamed this week's stock drop on the company’s association with Bitcoin, citing analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush, who also noted he believes the move was a strategic one for the long-term.Tesla stock traded at around $865 on Feb. 8 when the announcement it had purchased $1.5 billion in Bitcoin was made. It bottomed out at $681 on Tuesday, according to Yahoo Finance. However, reports of quality control issues in China may have also affected the price.Tesla owns an estimated 48,000 BTC, which means that paper profits were in the region of $1 billion dollars by the time the asset hit its all-time high of a little over $58,000 on Sunday.Despite this week’s price plunge, the firm is still in profit on the Bitcoin buy, as the asset was priced at a touch over $39,000 when the purchase announcement was made (the buy happened prior to that).The Telsa stock drop has knocked Musk off the top of Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, with recent losses reported at $3.56 billion. Jeff Bezos tops the list again, with an estimated total net worth of $187 billion, while Musk has $180 billion, according to Bloomberg.At the time of writing, Bitcoin prices had corrected by 17% to around $48,000, marking a $10,000 slide in just three days. In terms of pullbacks, markets are used to much larger ones such as the mid-January retreat that resulted in a 30% correction for BTC."
233,"A U.S. Congress subcommittee is investigating if domestic extremists are turning to cryptocurrency as a source of funds for their activities.On Feb. 25, the Subcommittee on National Security, International Development, and Monetary Policy will hold a hearing titled “Dollars Against Democracy: Domestic Terrorist Financing in the Aftermath of Insurrection.” A committee memorandum ahead of the hearing stated that “as scrutiny by traditional banks and payment platforms increases, extremists are turning to solicitations of cryptocurrencies.”The memorandum lumps cryptocurrencies with other potential avenues for illicit activity financing including crowdfunding, charities, and social media platforms. Two main incidents are used to suggest crypto may have helped fund the Capitol insurrection.Specifically, on Dec. 8 a French extremist who committed suicide sent 28.15 BTC (worth $522,000 at the time of transfer) to 22 addresses with many belonging to known far-right activists and internet personalities.More than $250,000 of the BTC he sent went to activist Nick Fuentes who was identified as being at the Capitol during the insurrection, although he expressly denies entering the building.The other source cited by the memorandum was a live video of the Capitol protest on the video streaming platform Dlive in which the streamer received approximately $222 in cryptocurrency tips. According to the document, the platform has paid out “hundreds of thousands of dollars to extremists since its founding.” The platform was purchased by peer-to-peer file sharing service BitTorrent, which is in turn owned by the Tron Foundation.However the memo concedes the two incidents are circumstantial evidence and that “it is unknown whether the funds from these Bitcoin transfers or others were used in the planning and execution of the January 6th Trump rally or the Capitol insurrection that followed.”The committee believes that as traditional finance ramps up the reporting of suspicious activity, future insurrectionists are likely to turn to non-traditional methods to finance their activities. It added that “some of the arrests related to the Jan. 6 attack,” were successful due to the reporting methods banks and other regulated financial institutes employ.There is still significant push-back to the “cryptocurrency is a criminal’s haven” narrative.Bitcoin influencer Pierre Rochard responded on Twitter to the memo saying “almost all domestic terrorism happened before Bitcoin was invented. Domestic terrorism is financed by USD.”Cryptocurrency investor who goes by the title “The Crypto Monk” said that even Pokemon cards would be better for payment than Bitcoin due to the cryptocurrency’s ability to trace funds.I'd literally rather accept Pokemon cards than a distributed ledger."
234,"Cryptocurrency traders and investors in India are among the latest casualties in an increasing trend of personal account closures by global banking operations. India’s parliament is currently contemplating a nation-wide crypto ban which local industry critics, such as former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan have compared to “banning the internet for five years.”The Economic Times reports that customers of private banks in India, such as HDFC, HSBC and Citi, have been receiving notices this year asking them to clarify crypto-related transactions, often requiring them to visit their local bank branch in person. If such clarification is not received, accounts are at risk of being suspended or seized. One letter to an affected customer states:In 2020, India’s Supreme Court reversed an order from the Reserve Bank of India in which banks were asked to discontinue provision of services to cryptocurrency traders.Banning #Bitcoin will be an backstep for #India in the international community.
I hope our leaders will take positive steps to ensure to regulate the Cryptocurrency space in India.
Don't #BAN, Just #REGULATE#Crypto #IndiaWantsCrypto #TryCrypto #IndiaWantsBitcoin
Jai HindIndia’s parliament is expected to enact a new bill that will further restrict the financial activities of traders, and prominent members of the Indian cryptocurrency community have spoken up against it. Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO of India-based exchange Unocoin, believes that a move in the opposite direction is needed to encourage growth of the fintech space in his country. “With crypto by her side,” he said, “the country can bank the massive unbanked population.”Banks are also preemptively closing customer accounts deemed to be associated with funds moving in or out of cryptocurrency exchanges in a number of countries.On Feb. 5, the Central Bank of Nigeria prohibited financial institutions operating in the country from “facilitating payments for cryptocurrency exchanges,” leading to the immediate closure of bank accounts associated with exchanges and the individuals behind them.They closed 5 bank accounts because I purchased crypto... I now have no bank account except my ledger wallet... I guess I’m my own bank nowIn the U.K., HSBC recently stopped accepting transfers from cryptocurrency exchanges altogether. Lloyds Bank, a British retail and commercial bank, has also been ramping up efforts to dissociate themselves with cryptocurrency traders, as experienced by podcaster Peter McCormack in a Feb. 22 tweet. However that may be a self inflicted wound.A long-time Bitcoin investor based in the U.K., who wishes to remain anonymous, told Cointelegraph that major banks across Europe are increasingly distancing themselves from crypto traders. He said that new accounts are being turned away from banks on the basis of their involvement with crypto.“I was looking to openly approach a new bank and be up front about it,” he says. “But I met a brick wall.” The investor claims to have put “six figure amounts” through HSBC “with no issues,” but that legacy accounts are being treated differently than newcomers."
235,"Another wave of selling pressure hit the cryptocurrency market on Feb. 23 as Bitcoin struggles to reclaim the $49,000 level.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that Bitcoin fell under intense pressure in the early trading hours on Tuesday and this pushed the price of BTC as low as $44,927 before buyers arrived to stop the descent.The majority of altcoins and DeFi tokens are now even deeper into their double-digit losses and Bitcoin (BTC) price has dropped by more than $10,000 in the past 48 hours. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at a price of $48,600, which reflects a 11% decrease for the day, but according to Cointelegraph analyst Marcel Pechman, pro traders have looked to buy the dip and opened new leveraged long positions.Today's market downturn has overshadowed several positive developments for the cryptocurrency ecosystem, including the news that Bitfinex and Tether have settled their case with the Office of the New York Attorney General and agreed to pay $18.5 million for damages to the state of New York. Both parties also agreed to submit to periodic reporting of their reserves.Interest in the first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund in North America has also continued to explode as the Purpose Bitcoin ETF has grown to $564 million in assets under management just five days after the fund was launched. Filings also show 2,251 BTC being added to the fund on Feb.23.Despite the marketwide carnage, many crypto traders and professional investors view the current pullback as a necessary break that allows overbought assets to retest key underlying support levels.As pointed out by Twitter user Bitcoin Archive, corrections like these are par for the course and were commonplace during the 2017 bull market, which had “9 dips between 20–40%.” Despite these reoccurring deep corrections, the market still increased by “20x the previous ATH” over the course of 2017.Summing up how that relates today and where BTC is headed, Bitcoin Archive stated:Traditional markets also faced early selling pressure on Tuesday morning, but they were able to climb back into the green shortly after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reaffirmed that the Fed will maintain the current accommodative policies, including keeping benchmark rates near zero and asset purchases at the current pace of $120 billion per month.By the closing bell, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.13% and 0.50%, respectively, while the Nasdaq closed down 0.50%.Bitcoin’s $13,000 drop over the past 48 hours has taken a heavy toll on the altcoin market, and many of the recent high-flying decentralized finance tokens took the brunt of the damage.Crypto.com Coin (CRO) saw a 33% pullback, and Binance Smart Chain’s Venus (XVS) DeFi protocol saw its price drop 24% to trade at $58.63.A select few projects were able to buck the trend and post positive gains on Feb. 23, as new announcements about blockchain interoperability-related projects provided a well-needed lift to tokens focused on layer-two and cross-chain transactions.Solana (SOL) rose 11.23% to trade at $14.94 after the release of its new automated market maker protocol Raydium. Fantom’s (FTM) price also rallied by 24% after the team announced a collaboration with Yearn.finance and the rollout of a cross-chain bridge to the Ethereum network.The overall cryptocurrency market capitalization now stands at $1.44 trillion, and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 62%."
236,"Financial services outfit Square just announced it has picked up more Bitcoin (BTC). Square “has purchased approximately 3,318 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $170 million,” the company said in a public statement on Tuesday, adding:Bitcoin has fallen significantly this week so far, dropping below the $50,000 mark after tapping a record high past $58,000, based on TradingView.com data. Based on the $170 million sum Square swapped for about 3,318 BTC, the outfit looks to have paid an average of $51,235 per coin on its new investment.“Aligned with the company’s purpose, Square believes that cryptocurrency is an instrument of economic empowerment, providing a way for individuals to participate in a global monetary system and secure their own financial future,” Square noted in the statement. “The investment is part of Square’s ongoing commitment to bitcoin, and the company plans to assess its aggregate investment in bitcoin relative to its other investments on an ongoing basis.”Square bought $50 million worth of Bitcoin in 2020, which it announced last fall.Square’s statement also included an unveiling of its 2020 financial documents. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey also serves as CEO of Square. Dorsey recently donated 1 Bitcoin to a nonprofit aimed at Bitcoin technical progress."
237,"Less than a week after its debut, the Purpose Bitcoin exchange-traded fund continues to attract large inflows of investor capital, offering further reassurance that institutional interest in digital assets is on the rise. Crypto data provider Glassnode reported Tuesday that the Purpose ETF has reached $564 million in assets under management, an impressive feat considering the fund only launched five days ago. As Cointelegraph reported, the fund generated $80 million in volume during its first hour of trading and reached nearly $100 million on its first day.Glassnode data reveals that as of Tuesday, the Purpose ETF had 8,288 BTC, having added 2,251 BTC on Monday.Just a few days after the world's first #Bitcoin ETF started trading, its holdings are at 8,288 BTC – 2,251 were added yesterday alone.

The ETF's AUM has crossed half a billion USD, currently sitting at $564M.

Charts: https://t.co/gupWslpJDR pic.twitter.com/FMMFSDZJ7ZThis explosive growth aligns with a recent forecast by Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, who said the ETF will likely hit $1 billion in assets by the end of the week.Canada has quickly emerged as a hotbed for Bitcoin ETF activity. In addition to the Purpose ETF, Evolve Funds Group has received approval from the Ontario Securities Commission to launch its own Bitcoin fund. Trading under the ticker symbols “EBIT” and “EBIT.U,” the Evolve Funds ETF will provide direct exposure to BTC priced in both Canadian and U.S. dollars.Inflows into the Purpose ETF appear to be unaffected by Bitcoin’s recent price retracement. The flagship cryptocurrency declined sharply at the start of the week and briefly fell below $45,000, according to TradingView data. Peak to trough, Bitcoin's price fell more than 20%. It was last seen holding above $46,700."
238,"In the past 48 hours, Bitcoin's (BTC) price has dropped by $13,360 and more than $2.6 billion worth of futures contracts have been liquidated. When including altcoins, the total sum of liquidations equaled $5.9 billion.After marking a record-high open interest at $19.5 billion on Feb. 21, the metric has stabilized at $16.5 billion. This means that half of the terminated leverage positions have been reopened.According to the top traders' long-to-short data and various funding rate indicators, retail traders took the largest hit.The top traders' long-to-short indicator is calculated by using clients' consolidated positions, including spot, margin, perpetual and futures contracts. Unlike the futures premium or options skew indicators, this metric gathers a broader view of professional traders' effective net position.Despite the discrepancies between crypto exchange methodologies, analyzing changes over time provides valuable insights.Top traders at Huobi held a 0.81 long-to-short ratio on Feb. 20, favoring shorts by 19%. By adding net long positions over the following 48 hours, the indicator peaked at 0.95, indicating that buy-side activity prevailed.OKEx top traders were aggressive net buyers over the past three days. Starting from a 0.86 indicator favoring shorts by 14%, they've managed to revert it to a 69% net buyer position.Lastly, Binance top traders started at 1.36, favoring net longs, but were either liquidated or opened net shorts until reaching the current 1.23 level. Either way, those traders haven't been adding positions over the past three days.Overall, the average top traders' long-to-short position went from 1.01 (flat) on Jan. 20 to the current 1.37 favoring net longs. Therefore, it’s clear that arbitrage desks and whales increased their longs throughout the liquidations.If top traders are net buyers, then retail must be holding the other end, even if that happened through leveraged long liquidations.To keep a balanced risk exposure, derivatives exchanges charge either perpetual futures longs (buyers) or shorts (sellers) a fee every eight hours. Known as the funding rate, this indicator will turn positive when longs are the ones demanding more leverage.On the other hand, periods of fear and heavy selling activity lead to negative funding rate turns. This time around, shorts would be the one paying up.Since Feb. 6, the average weekly funding rate has exceeded 2.3%. That happened while Bitcoin surpassed $38,000, indicating excessively leverged retail longs. On the other hand, top traders usually opt for fixed-calendar futures in order to avoid the exorbitant funding fees during rallies.This movement faded completely on Feb. 23 as Bitcoin's price plunged below $50,000. After briefly flirting with a negative funding rate, it has now stabilized near 0.5% per week. The metric signals that retail traders were liquidated, hence causing the indicator to return to neutral levels.Although $50,000 sounds like a meaningful psychological level, Bitcoin’s 67% year-to-date gains will likely continue to attract investors. The modest 3% performance from the S&P 500 and a 0.6% yield on  five-year U.S. Treasury Notes offer no match for the potential upside that can be captured from cryptocurrencies.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

239,"Jack Dorsey, CEO of social media powerhouse Twitter, has donated 1 Bitcoin (BTC) to Brink, a nonprofit group focused on Bitcoin’s technological framework. “Honored to have received a 1 BTC donation to our developer funding efforts from none other than @jack!,” Brink’s Twitter account posted on Tuesday. At the time of publication, that Bitcoin is worth $46,824.Reporting earlier this month showed the recently established organization receiving 503(c)(3) nonprofit status from the Internal Revenue Service, giving Brink a break on federal taxation.The entity looks to further Bitcoin by helping out its developers, as noted on Brink’s website:Dorsey has expressed interest in Bitcoin before. In 2020, he referred to the asset’s white paper as poetic. In the fall of 2020, Square — another outfit Dorsey leads — also unveiled allocating $50 million to BTC. Dorsey took the 16th spot on Cointelegraph’s list of the top 100 people in the crypto industry this year."
240,"Bitcoin (BTC) will be the savings method of choice for 1 billion people on their phones by 2026, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor predicted.In an interview with CNBC on Feb. 23, Saylor, whose company owns in excess of 70,000 BTC, continued his public Bitcoin advocacy, calling it ""the dominant digital monetary network.""Saylor was speaking a day after United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen described Bitcoin as ""inefficient,"" comments that accompanied a price dip of over 20% from all-time highs of $58,300.For him, however, the comments were of little consequence compared with the broader Bitcoin use case quickly encroaching into more and more people's financial lives.""The story here that's not being told is that Bitcoin is egalitarian progressive technology,"" he told CNBC's Squawk Box segment.Continuing, he cited Bitcoin's 12-year race to becoming a trillion-dollar asset — two to four times quicker than technology giants such as Amazon, Google and Apple.""So, the world needs this thing, and I think you can expect that we'll have a billion people storing their value — in essence, a savings account — on a mobile device within five years, and they're going to want to use something like Bitcoin,"" he added.Saylor continues to make waves with MicroStrategy's ongoing Bitcoin buys, the latest of which involved raising $900 million solely to add to its existing holdings.While skeptics claim that few others will follow in the company's footsteps, another CNBC guest on Tuesday forecast that Tesla, which itself bought $1.5 billion in BTC, will ""double down"" on its exposure. ""I think this is not just a fad. I think Tesla's going to continue to double down on its Bitcoin investment and you'll see it from a transaction perspective as well,"" said Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities.BTC/USD saw a welcome reprieve on Tuesday as lows of $45,000 reversed upward on news that U.S. lawmakers had reached a settlement with stablecoin issuer Tether, ending a two-year lawsuit.At the time of writing, the pair traded above $48,000, with $50,000 appearing to act as current resistance.""As expected, 'they' protected the 44k level. I think $BTC will go up or sideways as there's no more Tether FUD,"" Ki Young Ju, CEO of on-chain analytics service CryptoQuant, added about whales controlling the extent of further losses."
241,"For a long time, the United Arab Emirates has been one of the most progressive crypto countries in the world. For example, government-owned licensing firm Kiklabb allows clients to pay for their visa and trade license fees via various digital assets to the Dubai Financial Services Authority, which announced its decision to work on a holistic crypto regulatory framework as part of its 2021 business plan.In fact, as a result of Dubai’s crypto-friendly policies, Ripple, a firm that has recently been in murky waters with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, announced its decision to open an office in the region. Furthermore, the UAE and Saudi Arabia are reportedly working on a joint central bank digital currency research initiative that has been dubbed “Project Aber.”Commenting on why the UAE is fast becoming the destination of choice for some crypto/blockchain startups, Mazdak Rafaty, managing partner for Ludwar International Consulting FZC, told Cointelegraph:He further opined that blockchain as a novel disruptive tech was recognized very early by UAE regulators, as a result of which many governmental organizations were instructed not only to facilitate its development but actually utilize its advantages within a comprehensive e-government strategy.Hadi Malaeb co-founder & CEO of the Agora Group and host of the Global Blockchain Congress told Cointelegraph that companies are attracted to the country due to the government's openness to hold the dialogue with the companies: ""In 2019, the SCA consulted with the industry and the public on the wording of the draft text. Because of this, we see a lot more activities in crypto in the UAE with many new and well established companies choosing the UAE as their headquarters.""Lastly, Rafaty added that while blockchain adoption was swift, cryptocurrencies definitely took more time to understand, utilize and regulate. Even in terms of crypto adoption, Abu Dhabi was one of the first regions to introduce a well-thought-out framework for exchanges and different types of tokens back in 2018.At a time when many countries are still struggling to formulate comprehensive strategies to adopt crypto-enabled technologies in a streamlined fashion — with some even looking to implement blanket bans — the UAE is seemingly laying the foundation for a digital ecosystem.Providing his insights on the subject, Mohammed Abbas, project manager for TDeFi Accelerator, the firm that co-hosted the Dubai Global DeFi Congress, told Cointelegraph that many projects, such as decentralized ride-sharing platform Drife and blockchain-based fantasy sports ecosystem DeFi Eleven, have been able to attract interest from the private offices of UAE’s Royal Families as well as other big-name players, such as San Francisco-based VCs like the Draper Walled Garden, adding:Similarly, on the subject, Marwan Alzarouni, CEO of Dubai Blockchain Center, opined that the UAE — Dubai, in particular — has always been forward-thinking and fast-moving when it comes to any futuristic technology, with cryptocurrencies and blockchain being no different.He highlighted that Dubai launched its “Blockchain Strategy 2020” in 2016 and is already achieving its goals. Alzarouni further pointed out that when it comes to cryptocurrency regulations, the UAE Securities and Commodities Authority issued its regulation in 2020, which was swiftly followed by the country’s central bank revealing the Stored Value Facilities regulation, which seeks to provide clarity as to how crypto and other digital assets may be used as a stored value when purchasing various goods and services.The aforementioned regulations are quite in-depth and seem to help to position the UAE as a leader in the cryptocurrency adoption space. Not only that, but it also stands to provide a solid foundation for startups and investors in the UAE with the right and safe environment in which to operate.Elucidating his thoughts on why the UAE regulatory landscape is different than most other nations today, Abbas pointed out that the Know Your Customer, Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing laws that are currently in place in the region are progressive when compared to those of other “global financial hubs.”On the subject, Saeed Al Darmaki, co-founder of Alphabit crypto fund, told Cointelegraph that the UAE has been forward-looking with its adoption of crypto-enabled technologies for a long time, with the Arab powerhouses’ regulatory outlook looking very positive at the moment, adding:A similar sentiment is shared by Austin Alexander, managing director for the MENA region of the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, who believes that to date, the UAE has been among the most proactive locations globally in regulating cryptocurrency. In this regard, he pointed out that Abu Dhabi Global Markets was one of the first regulatory jurisdictions to draft a framework from the ground up specifically for digital asset exchanges, adding:On the subject of how the local UAE population views the country’s tech-friendly stance, Rafaty opined that most residents have acknowledged the government’s blockchain initiatives. However, he did add that it will be some time before these projects actually start to bear fruit.Additionally, he also shared that on the crypto side of things, most of his private and professional contacts in UAE are, to some degree, involved and/or invested in various crypto and altcoin offerings thanks in large part to the bullish growth that has happened in the sector over the course of the last few months.Similarly, Alexander believes that UAE residents and businesses tend to embrace new innovation more enthusiastically than most, and cryptocurrency has been no exception. However, he added that for some time now, UAE residents have had some difficulty investing in digital assets, as there have been few legitimate local gateways for crypto exchange, adding:Lastly, Abbas believes that local residents and businesses in the UAE have quickly warmed up to the utility of the blockchain ecosystem and have been looking at cryptocurrencies as not just another financial instrument for monetary gains but also as a means to exchange and settle transactions among users operating within this domain.In his view, the barriers for entry are getting lower by the day and that soon, mainstream retail crypto offerings will flourish within the country. “UAE is probably the only country that has been able to host some of the largest blockchain summits and bring crypto pioneers, think-tanks and investors on a common platform to address the global issues concerning financial inclusion and neo-banking solutions”, Abbas added.Some of the interviewees have participated in the Global Blockchain Congress in Dubai on Feb. 9, hosted by theAgora Group."
242,"While public adoption of crypto assets is increasing, global regulations continue to progress and recognize decentralized technologies as a suitable infrastructure for the dematerialization of securities. In Luxembourg, the country that is second in the world in terms of assets under management, the country’s regulator adopted a bill that explicitly recognizes the possibility of using distributed ledger technology for the dematerialization of securities. The regulation is moving quickly elsewhere across Europe: Tokenized securities now fall under the same rules and regulations as traditional financial instruments in many other European countries including France, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain and the United Kingdom.Read the e-book written by Tokeny Solutions and Cointelegraph Consulting to discover how you can be part of this emerging digital asset industry.What's next for the industry? Due to the increase in public adoption and the favorable regulatory environment, demand from the financial industry to access digital networks is on the rise. So far, banks have digitized the retail industry, but not much has evolved in capital markets.The digitization of this industry is now possible through the blockchain, an infrastructure now widely recognized by the largest governments globally for financial instruments. Funds and asset managers can now upgrade their distribution channels by launching digital asset marketplaces, or DAMs, and connecting to others via decentralized networks.DAMs will help their customers discover new opportunities, manage their investments and even open secondary market possibilities. In this ebook, industry participants explain how capital market players can benefit from blockchain by launching a DAM and maximizing the monetization of their investor base.Financial institutions are beginning to publicly embrace and adopt the technology. So far, they have started, as expected, with crypto assets. Once they begin to trust the technology and it becomes embedded within their portfolios, it will mean one thing: Curiosity will peak, and these institutions will realize the operational benefits of decentralized technology.Driven by increased confidence in the technology, and pressured by DeFi replacing many traditional banking functions, institutions will begin to learn that the technology can solve long-standing and deeply entrenched industry problems, particularly in the opaque and highly illiquid private markets.Digital asset marketplaces — i.e., primary and secondary venues where investors meet — will be the driver for this, according to the study. However, open-source standards like the Token for Regulated EXchanges are required to enforce compliance on-chain in a heavily regulated world."
243,"The billionaire investor known as India’s Warren Buffet, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, has voiced his support for India’s impending cryptocurrency ban, warning that the hangover from Bitcoin (BTC) mania will be worse than the party itself.Jhunjhunwala, speaking on CNBC’s Street Signs Asia segment on Tuesday, said the Bitcoin party was one he’d rather not attend:The headache from that hangover was felt to some extent on Tuesday as almost $400 billion departed the global cryptocurrency market capitalization. Bitcoin lost close to 20% of its value in hours, while much of the altcoin market suffered losses in excess of 30%.Whether that means the bullish Bitcoin party is over for now or investors will return for a hair of the dog that bit them remains to be seen.Either way, Jhunjhunwala is eager to see Indian regulators rubber-stamp their ban on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and believes the nation should focus on building its own central bank digital currency — the digital rupee.“I think regulators should step in and ban Bitcoin, and they should focus on the digital rupee,” said Jhunjhunwala.In mid-February, news broke regarding the Indian government’s impending blanket ban on all cryptocurrencies, with holders expected to be given a three- to six-month grace period in which to cash out their crypto funds.Not everyone is as eager as Jhunjhunwala to see cryptocurrency banned in India. Former chief technology officer of Coinbase Balaji Srinivasan voiced his own concerns about the ban, declaring that such a move would be akin to banning the internet.Other nations have already moved to ban the spread of cryptocurrencies. The Nigerian central bank recently issued a directive to all commercial banks ordering them to cease doing business with cryptocurrency exchanges. That’s despite, or perhaps because of, the fact that Nigeria is one of the busiest centers on earth for Bitcoin use — so much so that Nigerian officials labeled it a threat to their own national currency."
244,"Sweden's financial regulator, Finansinspektionen, or FI, has issued a fresh warning to retail traders about the high risks and low consumer protections associated with crypto-related investments.In an announcement published on Monday, the regulator wrote that while it had already issued a warning regarding the risks associated with Bitcoin (BTC) trading, it was publishing further advice following its completion of a wider study of the crypto-asset sector.The FI said it has carried out a “thematic review of the market for financial instruments with underlying crypto-assets.” FI Director General Erik Thedeén said: Thedeén's view is compounded by the fact that consumer protection regulations in Sweden do not comprehensively protect investors from the risks tied to purchases of financial products or instruments that have crypto assets as an underlying asset. The FI’s warning coincides with a period of marked volatility in the cryptocurrency spot and derivatives markets. Bitcoin dropped more than 17% in value over the last 24 hours, and $5.64 billion worth of BTC futures positions were liquidated in the same time period.While the Swedish financial authorities’ skepticism about the health and impact of the cryptocurrency markets is evident, the country’s central bank is pursuing a research and development pilot for a centrally issued e-krona that could provide a complement to cash."
245,"Major European Bitcoin (BTC) mining company Northern Data is reportedly considering going public in the United States.Germany-based Northern Data is planning to raise up to $500 million in an initial public offering, or IPO, Bloomberg reported on Monday. The company is working with Swiss investment bank Credit Suisse to proceed with the IPO, anonymous people familiar with the matter told the publication.According to the report, the company is considering conducting a sale of new shares later in 2021, intending to boost Northern Data’s shareholder base along with its global profile. Northern Data’s shareholders include investors like Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz as well as companies like investment firm Cryptology Asset Group and EOS developer Block.one.Northern Data has been listed on Germany’s over-the-counter market since 2015, and its stock has surged more than 300% over the past year. At publishing time, Northern Data stock is trading at 112 euros ($136), down more than 11% over the past 24 hours amid a major sell-off on the crypto market, according to data from Bloomberg.Based in the outer parts of Germany’s financial hub of Frankfurt, Northern Data operates mining data centers in areas with cheap electricity. Its largest facility, located in Rockdale, Texas, is one of the world’s largest crypto mining facilities with a planned capacity of 1 gigawatt hour by the end of 2021. The company reportedly started as a Bitcoin mining firm but later moved to operating data centers on behalf of customers.Credit Suisse declined to comment to Cointelegraph on its involvement in Northern Data’s IPO. As previously reported, Credit Suisse was once among IPO backers for Bitcoin mining giant Canaan Creative. However, the bank renounced its involvement amid concerns over the order sufficiency in November 2019.Northern Data declined to comment on the matter to Cointelegraph, as well."
246,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted more than 17% over the ast 24 hours as the futures market saw mass liquidations across the board.Liquidations occur when leveraged futures positions fall to a certain threshold. For example, a position using 10x leverage would b liquidated or turn worthless if the price of BTC drops by 5%.If the Bitcoin futures market is highly overleveraged and overcrowded, a minor price movement can trigger mass liquidations.According to analysts at Santiment, a data analytics firm, an address was responsible for the second-largest Bitcoin transaction of the year, as Cointelegraph reported.More than 2,700 BTC was transferred right before the drop, which was bigger than the 2,000 BTC inflow seen before the March 2020 crash when Bitcoin dropped below $4,000. The analysts said:It is a possibility that a major sell-off in the spot market triggered the futures market to see intense selling pressure from many long positions being liquidated.When Bitcoin initially began to correct on Feb. 22, the futures funding rate of the dominant cryptocurrency was hovering at around 0.15% even as it continued to drop.This trend showed two things: Overleveraged buyers were aggressively buying each dip, and the market remained overheated even as the pullback happened.As a result, new buyers during the short-term downtrend were continuously liquidated, igniting a brutal cycle of cascading liquidations.However, a pseudonymous trader known as ""Byzantine General"" described it as a ""coordinated shakeout,"" and said it is a healthy trend.If Bitcoin dropped on so-called ""black swan"" news or some abnormality, it would be a cause for concern. But the trader pinpointed the presence of relatively large buy orders to show that buyers are waiting to step in to buy the dip. He said:In the near term, it is critical that Bitcoin defends the $45,000 support area to ensure that the short-term cycle does not enter the ""bear zone."" Below it, the probability of a deeper, prolonged correction rapidly increases."
247,"Several major banks across Asia have joined forces to construct a cross-border central bank digital currency, according to a joint announcement issued on Feb. 23.Dubbed the Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Bridge, or m-CBDC, the project sees the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Bank of Thailand, the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Digital Currency Institute of the People's Bank of China combine to create a CBDC prototype using distributed ledger technology.Building upon the “Inthanon-LionRock” research project started in 2019, the latest phase of the exploration into CBDCs will develop a proof-of-concept to “facilitate real-time cross-border foreign exchange payment-versus-payment transactions in a multi-jurisdictional context and on a 24/7 basis,” states the announcement.The stated aim of the project is to address “pain points” in conducting cross-border transfers. These include cost inefficiencies and the complex regulation that accompanies moving money from one country to another.As previously described by the deputy governor of the Bank of Thailand, Mathee Supapongse:The central banks taking part in the project hope to attract more institutions into the scheme and aim to create a more conducive environment for the exploration of CBDCs in Asia and beyond.The rapid emergence of cryptocurrencies in recent years has forced the hand of numerous governments and central banks to create a digital alternative to decentralized coins like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH),and many others.The inability of governments to control or track the flow of cryptocurrencies will undoubtedly see CBDCs become commonplace in years to come. China is ahead of the curve in regards to CBDC creation and is already testing biometric ID hardware wallets for its digital yuan."
248,"Bitcoin (BTC) extended its losses on Feb. 23 as selling pressure took markets below $47,000 for the first time in over a week. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView painted a gloomy picture for bulls on Tuesday as BTC/USD hit lows of $45,000 on Bitstamp. The losses reverse a rebound that halted Monday's 20% price crash from all-time highs near $58,000. Bitcoin bounced at $47,400 on the day to return to $54,000 before a fresh dip took hold.At the time of writing, $47,000 was again acting as some form of focus for support, with the trajectory still unclear amid heavy volatility.Analysis of buy and sell positions produced little hope for stemming losses should that level fail, with support lacking below $46,500.For analysts, however, even the prospect of a more serious retracement is nothing to fear. Compared with previous price dips, the current one is a drop in the ocean.""We’ve experienced 2018 & 2019. This is nothing,"" Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe summarized to Twitter followers.In an accompanying YouTube update, he forecast that should bears take hold, Bitcoin could be in for what is classic behavior for the month of March, which traditionally sees corrections.""Approaching bounce region for Bitcoin. I think we're close now,"" a further tweet added.As Cointelegraph reported, theories explaining the downturn range from whale sell-offs to natural market cycles. "
249,"Microsoft founder Bill Gates has issued a warning to would-be Bitcoin (BTC) buyers looking to follow Elon Musk’s investment strategy. Speaking to Bloomberg’s Emily Chang, Gates suggested Musk had access to sophisticated trade management techniques that the average investor isn’t privy to.When asked about the susceptibility of Bitcoin to tumble in price in reaction to a mere tweet — undoubtedly a reference to Musk’s own social media posts — Gates said Musk was probably insulated from such market crashes:On Tuesday, a little over two weeks since Tesla’s $1.5 billion acquisition of Bitcoin was announced, the price of Bitcoin fell 20%, from $58,258 to $46,624. At the same time, almost $400 billion was wiped off the global market cryptocurrency market capitalization.Interestingly enough, the crash occurred just hours after Musk himself expressed the opinion that the then-current prices of Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) were “high.” Whether this was a criticism or an attempt to deflect heat from a possible investigation into Musk’s influence on crypto prices, the entire market plunged in the aftermath.Gates said it would be a mistake for the average investor to blindly follow the mania of optimism surrounding Musk’s market moves, telling those who aren’t billionaires to “watch out.” He said:The Microsoft founder raised the point of Bitcoin’s energy consumption, suggesting that the cryptocurrency didn’t return much in the way of output.“There are things we invest in in society which produce output. Bitcoin happens to use a lot of energy. It happens to promote anonymous transactions — they’re not reversible transactions,” said Gates.According to Gates, digital currencies aren’t necessarily a bad thing; he just thinks they should be transparent, reversible and, essentially, centralized. Gates went on to describe some of the work carried out using digital currencies since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that the Gates Foundation had used the technology to enable governments to distribute relief funds to their citizens."
250,"Amid a major downward correction in the cryptocurrency market, the head of South Korea’s central bank is skeptical about digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC).Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol said that crypto assets like Bitcoin have no intrinsic value, local news agency Yonhap reports Tuesday. The official said that he expects more price swings on the market, stating, “It is very difficult to predict the price, but its price will be extremely volatile.”Speaking at the National Assembly, Lee also addressed possible reasons behind the recent sharp crypto rally, which led Bitcoin to become a $1 trillion asset. The BOK governor cited a number of factors including global concerns over excessive inflation, growing institutional interest, as well as a massive $1.5 billion Bitcoin purchase by Elon Musk’s Tesla.“These assets saw a steep rise in the shortest period of time,” Lee stated. “I would say institutional investors’ assessment of using bitcoins as a hedge could be interpreted as another factor.” According to The Korea Times, Lee claimed that the BOK is progressing with its central bank digital currency. “The bank is close to completing our review of designs and relevant technologies regarding bank-controlled digital currencies,” he said. As previously reported, the bank issued a book on legal issues surrounding CBDCs in early February.Bitcoin saw a steep correction on Feb. 22, with its price plunging from above $58,000 to below $48,000. United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen criticized Bitcoin in an interview on Monday, stating that the world’s largest cryptocurrency is “extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions.”"
251,"Bitcoin (BTC) lost 20% in a day, partly thanks to the actions of a single whale, new research suggests. Data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment on Feb. 23 shows that BTC/USD dipped to $47,400 after Bitcoin’s second-largest transaction of 2021 took place.The transaction — 2,700 BTC, worth $156.6 million at $58,000 per token — resulted in a sale that piled pressure on the market, thus snowballing into the largest one-hour candle in Bitcoin’s history.“As we noted yesterday, there was an 11x exchange inflow spike that initiated #Bitcoin's price correction from its $58.3k #ATH,” Santiment wrote in accompanying comments on Twitter.The findings shed light on what exactly was happening as volatility took over Bitcoin, which managed to recover to $54,000 before trading below $50,000 once more at the time of writing.Some believe that the market was overextended, with naysayers, in particular, claiming that a bubble-like process had long been underway. Others argued that it was simply “business as usual” for crypto trading. But as Cointelegraph reported, concerns had mounted about unusual inflows to exchanges.Santiment noted that the same address had also sold immediately before the cross-asset price crash in March 2020. At the time, Bitcoin lost almost 60% of its value and hit $3,600.“This same address also made a 2,000 $BTC import last March right as the Black Thursday correction took place,” it revealed.Suspicions had long been eyeing whales, who had profited from small wallets selling during previous price dips throughout Bitcoin’s recent bull run. As Cointelegraph reported, the number of whale-sized wallets had been growing, while smallholders had been decreasing.“The most interesting side by side tells you how Bitcoin investor profile progress — ‘whales’ diminished as price elevated in the last cycle; new group of whales just keep popping up this time, while shrimps are the weak hands who sold too early,” Primitive founding partner Dovey Wan tweeted last week alongside a chart comparing the 2017 and 2021 bull runs.“THE GREAT WEALTH TRANSFER,” she added. Some responses to the research meanwhile noted that the wallet in question had been responsible for a fraction of total trading volume and that its influence should therefore be limited.""We don't believe that one address alone triggers the price retracement of the largest crypto asset in the world, so we certainly wouldn't want you to believe it either,"" Santiment replied."
252,"In the early morning trading hours Bitcoin (BTC) price abruptly dropped by 17.65% which triggered a major downturn throughout the entire market.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that Bitcoin decreased from a high of $58,274 on Feb. 21 to a low of $47,622 during the early hours on Monday before buyers returned to lift BTC to its current value of $53,350.Despite today’s $1.6 billion liquidation event, Bitcoin bulls remain optimistic about the future of the top cryptocurrency with key indicators suggesting that those buying today’s dip are likely to come out on top.According to ExoAlpha Chief Investment Officer David Lifchitz, recent charts for Bitcoin looked overbought, signaling that a ""15% correction could happen” as part of a normal market cycle before BTC attempts to break out to new highs.Bitcoin went from $10,000 in October 2020 to almost $60,000 in just 4 months, indicating to Lifchitz that a “pause/mild-correction is definitely in the cards.”Lifchitz said:Recent money printing by central banks makes it less likely that BTC will drop as low as $30,000, according to Lifchitz, as Bitcoin is increasingly being seen as a hedge against currency devaluation by investors around the world.Lifchitz also pointed out the recent moves in traditional assets such as the U.S. 10 year treasury yield could “trigger a pullback in Bitcoin as a general deleveraging move across asset classes,” but only “time will tell” how it all plays out.Traditional markets were mixed on Feb. 22 as recent increases in Treasury yields led to expectations of higher inflation and put additional pressure on equities.The Dow was able to overcome early pressure to close the day up 0.09% while the S&P 500 and NASDAQ traded in the red all day and closed down 0.77% and 2.46% respectively.Commodities proved to be the bright spot in markets on Monday, with the price of crude oil increasing by 4.14% to trade at $61.69.  Gold price increased by 1.68% and close the day at $1,807.Despite the market-wide downturn for the crypto community, several tokens saw their prices increase on Monday as positive developments helped elevate them above the negative sentiment.The breakout star over the past 24-hours has been Crypto.com Coin (CRO), whose price exploded by more than 63% to establish a new all-time high of $0.2748 during early trading hours.Other notable performances include NEM (XEM), which is up 16.05%, and Solana (SOL), which has increased by 20.54%.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.63 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 61.2%."
253,"In a report shared with Cointelegraph, institutional crypto trading platform CrossTower asserts that large investors will not let Bitcoin (BTC) fall back below $50,000.According to the report, addresses holding over 1,000 BTC rose to record highs in January on the heels of sizable retracements — evidencing strong dip-buying from whales despite the relatively high price of Bitcoin.Combined with positive business developments in the industry, such as Mastercard’s decision to integrate certain cryptocurrencies and BNY Mellon’s newly launched custody services, CrossTower believes the outlook remains bullish for the digital asset markets. The firm also described the growth of corporate Bitcoin treasuries, such as Tesla’s $1.5 billion BTC acquisition, as strengthening the bullish case.“We believe the record amounts of addresses holding 1,000+ BTC in recent weeks is proof of rising institutional interest and likely reflects the many headlines in January and February of institutional investors becoming active in Bitcoin,” Martin Gaspar, research analyst at CrossTower, told Cointelegraph.He continued:CrossTower also noted a sharp decline in the sum of Bitcoin held on centralized exchanges amid record stablecoin holdings and volume, describing the trend as providing further bullish momentum to the markets. Analyzing data from CryptoQuant, CrossTower found stablecoin held on crypto exchanges totaled $7.4 billion as of February — up nearly 159% from December 2020.BTC price briefly fell below $50,000 on Monday but has since regained its footing above $53,000. Despite the sudden correction, Bitcoin has appreciated by more than 12% over the past week. Year-to-date, the BTC price is up almost 85%, according to CoinMarketCap data. "
254,"Bitcoin seems to be struggling at the $58,000 level, which is leading some traders to fear a more significant correction could take place.While Bitcoin's (BTC) 2021 performance has been incredibly strong, its current 696% gain and comments from United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggesting that cryptocurrencies are used to finance terrorism may be enough to have investors feeling a bit cautious.Reducing open position sizes is usually the method most investors use to reduce exposure, but another way to manage risk is to use BTC options contracts to provide protection. Buying a put (sell) option is the easiest way, but it is quite costly considering the current high volatility scenario.For example, a March 26 put option with a $56,000 strike trades at $5,300, and its holder would only profit if BTC trades below $50,700 in 32 days. That would be 12% below the current $57,500 price. This protection cost depends on the number of days until expiry and the implied volatility, or a traders' expectation of substantial price swings.By using call (buy) options and puts (sell), a trader can create strategies to reduce this cost. There are infinite possibilities, but for now, let's focus on a low-cost bearish one.This bearish strategy consists of buying a protective put in order to profit from the downside while simultaneously selling call options at higher strikes. These additional trades will cover the put option's cost but will result in losses if BTC surpasses a certain threshold.The above trade consists of buying 1 BTC contract of the March 26 put option with a $56,000 strike, while selling 1 BTC contract of the March 26 call option with a $64,000 strike.As the estimate above shows, the end result between $56,000 and $64,000 is neutral. The trader would not incur any losses, but would also not profit from the strategy. On the other hand, if BTC drops to $46,000, or by more than 20% from $57,500, the contract holder would profit by $10,200.In order for the trader to incur a $5,000 loss, BTC would have to reach $69,000 on March 26, which is equivalent to a 20% gain from the current price. Therefore, even though this is a bearish strategy, traders would only incur losses above $64,000, or 11% above the current price level.This strategy provides a good risk-reward for those seeking downside protection. Moreover, there is zero upfront involved for those trades, except from the margin or collateral deposit requirements.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

255,"Every uptrend witnesses periodic bouts of profit-booking as short-term traders tend to unwind positions either on adverse news or at critical technical resistance levels. This occurred with Bitcoin (BTC) today as the price momentarily dropped below $48,000 and traders scrambled to close or top up positions before being liquidated.Elon Musk’s tweet on Feb. 20 that said Bitcoin prices “seem high” and the U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s warning today on Bitcoin being “extremely inefficient” could have dampened short-term sentiment.Another possible factor that may have exacerbated the fall could have been the unwinding of excessively leveraged long positions. About $1.64 billion worth of Bitcoin futures positions were liquidated during today's sharp pullback.However, derivatives data for Bitcoin futures do not show any negative development, as highlighted by Cointelegraph Markets analyst Marcel Pechman.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot the critical levels on the upside and the key support levels on the downside.Bitcoin broke above the resistance line of the ascending channel on Feb. 19, but could not pick up momentum. This showed that the current uptrend was tiring out. Traders aggressively booked profits today, which pulled the price down to the 20-day exponential moving average ($48,081).However, the lower levels continue to attract buyers as seen from the long tail on the daily candlestick. If the price sustains above the midpoint of the channel, the bulls will again try to push the pair above the channel.If they manage to do that, the BTC/USD pair could resume the uptrend. The next target on the upside is $60,974.43 and then $66,000. The upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive territory suggest that bulls are in control.Contrary to this assumption, if the price sustains below the midpoint of the channel, the bears will again try to break the 20-day EMA support. If they manage to do that, the pair may drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($39,885).Ether (ETH) turned down from the resistance line of the ascending channel on Feb. 20, indicating that traders booked profits after the price reached the psychologically important level at $2,000.The selling continued today and the ETH/USD pair dropped to the support line of the ascending channel. However, the positive sign is that the bulls purchased the dip as seen from the long tail on the day’s candlestick.If the buyers can push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA ($1,753), the positive momentum may remain intact.On the contrary, if the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, the bears will try to sink the pair below the channel and the 50-day SMA ($1,465). If they succeed, the correction could deepen to $1,200 and then to $1,000.Binance Coin (BNB) has been witnessing volatile moves in the past few days. After the sharp rally on Feb. 19, traders aggressively booked profits on Feb. 20. The bulls tried to resume the uptrend on Feb. 21, but the higher levels have again attracted profit-booking.The bulls are currently attempting to defend the zone between the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $233.3485 and the 61.8% retracement level at $206.1262. If they succeed, the BNB/USD pair may continue the volatile range-bound action for a few more days.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below $206.1262, the decline could extend to the 20-day EMA ($168). This is an important support to keep an eye on because a break below it will suggest a trend change and a likely fall to $118.Polkadot (DOT) broke above the ascending channel on Feb. 19 and rose to a new all-time high at $42.2848 on Feb. 20. However, the long wick on the day’s candlestick showed profit-booking at higher levels.After forming an inside day candlestick pattern on Feb. 21, the DOT/USD pair slumped back into the channel today. However, the bulls bought the dips and have pushed the price back above the channel.The buyers will now try to push the price above $42.2848 and resume the uptrend. On the other hand, the bears will try to sink the pair back into the channel. If they succeed, the pair may drop to the 20-day EMA ($28.89).Cardano (ADA) surged above the $0.9817712 overhead resistance on Feb. 20 and reached $1.1980811. However, the long wick on the daily candlestick showed profit-booking at higher levels.The selling intensified today and that pulled the ADA/USD pair down to the 20-day EMA ($0.834). However, the long tail on today’s candlestick shows aggressive buying at lower levels.If the price sustains above $1, the bulls will try to resume the up-move. A breakout of $1.1980811 could open the doors for a rally to $1.25 and then $1.50.Conversely, if the price slips below $0.9817712, the pair may again drop to the 20-day EMA. This is an important support to watch out for because if it cracks, the correction may deepen to $0.6879684.XRP continues to trade inside the $0.50 to $0.65 range. The altcoin bucked the trend today and rallied while most other major cryptocurrencies were witnessing sharp selling.The price had rallied to $0.65155 today but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. This shows the bears have not yet thrown in the towel.However, the upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.50) and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the bulls can propel and sustain the price above $0.65, the rally may extend to $0.78608.This positive view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below the $0.50 support. If that happens, the XRP/USD pair may drop to $0.3855.The bulls could not sustain Litecoin (LTC) above the $240 overhead resistance from Feb. 17 to Feb. 21. This failure to resume the uptrend could have attracted profit-booking from short-term traders, which resulted in a sharp fall today.The LTC/USD pair broke below the 20-day EMA ($198) and the $185.5821 support today, but the long tail on the day’s candlestick shows the bulls purchased this dip. The flattening 20-day EMA and the RSI just above the midpoint, suggest a balance between supply and demand.If the price sustains above the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend. On the contrary, if the price again slips below the 20-day EMA, the pair may drop to the 50-day SMA ($165). A break below this support could pull the pair down to $120.Chainlink (LINK) turned down from the resistance line of the ascending channel on Feb. 20 and formed a Doji candlestick pattern on Feb. 21. The uncertainty of the Doji candlestick was resolved to the downside today.The LINK/USD pair plunged below the 20-day EMA ($30) and the support line of the channel today. However, the long tail on the candlestick shows aggressive buying by the bulls at lower levels.If the bulls can sustain the price inside the channel, it will suggest that the uptrend remains intact. On the contrary, if the price again breaks below the channel, it will indicate a possible trend change.The next critical support on the downside is the 50-day SMA ($23.82) and if this support also cracks, the decline may extend to $20.1111.The range-bound action in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) resolved to the downside today when the price dipped below the $670 support. This breakdown showed that the equilibrium had tilted in favor of the bears.The BCH/USD pair broke below the 20-day EMA ($610) and fell to an intraday low at $533.33 today. However, the bulls aggressively purchased the dip below the $539 support, resulting in a sharp rebound.If the price sustains above the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to push the price back into the $670 to $745.39 range. If they succeed, it will suggest that the current correction could be over.On the contrary, if the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, the pair may again drop to $539 and then to the 50-day SMA ($510).Stellar Lumens (XLM) failed to resume its uptrend in the past few days, which showed a lack of demand at higher levels. This could have attracted profit-booking from short-term traders who may have dumped their positions today.The XLM/USD pair broke below the 20-day EMA ($0.44) and the $0.409 support today, but the bulls purchased at lower levels. The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI below 58 suggest the bullish momentum may be weakening.If the bulls fail to sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the bears will again try to sink the price below $0.409. If they manage to do that, the pair could slide to the $0.35 support.On the other hand, if the price sustains above the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend. A break above $0.535 will suggest an advantage to the bulls and may result in a retest of $0.600681.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

256,"Cointelegraph Markets Pro, a data platform designed to level the playing field for cryptocurrency market participants, is now available to the public following a successful live testing period.The platform, which has been in development for a year, is the result of exhaustive analysis of the crypto markets and the key drivers of asset price movements. It was developed jointly by Cointelegraph and The TIE, a leading provider of crypto data, analytics and software that counts major hedge funds, market makers and over-the-counter desks among its clients.At the heart of the platform is the VORTECS Score, which compares current market conditions for over 130 crypto assets to historically similar marketscapes. A proprietary algorithm analyzes those historic conditions, seeking consistent patterns in market behavior in the following days.“Even if crypto markets may seem volatile, the volatility often demonstrates remarkable consistency,” said Cointelegraph CEO Jay Cassano. “While we’re all aware that past performance is not indicative of future results, the Markets Pro platform combines sentiment analysis and social media activity with real-time market conditions in a way that allows us to create very specific models.""VORTECS beta testing delivered compelling results, according to Joshua Frank, CEO of The TIE.“We tested every score that crossed a certain threshold in our live beta phase,” explained Frank. “When the VORTECS score for a particular crypto asset crossed 70, we saw an average price increase of 7.61% over the next 24 hours, and 25.9% over the next seven days.”Frank noted that when scores that crossed the 80 threshold, asset gains were 8.58% over the next 24 hours — and 28.2% over the following week.“Of course, since most crypto traders are rotating into other assets such as Bitcoin, the real measure of success during a bull market is whether or not assets that crossed these thresholds delivered gains against the entire crypto market,” continued Frank. Cointelegraph Markets Pro also features NewsQuakes, a comprehensive headline news aggregator believed to be the fastest in the cryptocurrency industry.“We’ve been working with The TIE for a year to identify and isolate the most important price drivers in the news cycle,” explained Cointelegraph editor-in-chief Jon Rice.“Token burns, exchange listings, partnerships and staking announcements are among the headlines that tend to move markets. The Markets Pro platform uses AI to sift through the thousands of sources we analyze every minute, delivering key insights into these events directly to Markets Pro subscribers — often within seconds.”Rice suggested that when a cryptocurrency asset is listed on Coinbase, for example, it often sees rapid and significant price appreciation. “These announcements can deliver swift returns to traders who pick up on them quickly,” he said.Rice also noted that for many foreign exchanges, the time between an announcement in the exchange’s native language and an English version can be far greater, but that the NewsQuake service supports multiple languages and translates them in real time.Markets Pro subscribers also gain access to community features. Managed by teams from both Cointelegraph and The TIE, members can join the discussion with fellow enthusiasts, share strategies and ideas, and access unique research from the experts.Cassano hopes that the combination of real-time news and algorithmic modeling makes the crypto markets more accessible to investors of all stripes. “We’ve witnessed a global surge in interest in cryptocurrencies, as well as a realization that the information asymmetries inherent in existing financial markets tend to be stacked against the average investor. I hope that Markets Pro can help level that playing field in the crypto industry.”Frank echoed the sentiment, expressing that “When we initially set out to build The TIE more than three years ago, we had one singular goal: to enable millions of everyday investors around the globe to make more informed decisions with trusted and transparent cryptocurrency data. The challenge was synthesizing the billions of data points we captured, and sharing intelligence that is actionable and insightful for everyone.”COINTELEGRAPH MARKETS PRO IS AVAILABLE HERE"
257,"Bitcoin's (BTC) sudden $11,500 drop liquidated more than $1.64 billion worth of BTC futures contracts. This massive figure represents 8.5% of the total $19.5 billion in open interest, which coincidentally had just reached its all-time high.Although these are significant figures, they are proportionally lower than the $1-billion futures liquidation on Nov. 26, 2020. At that time, the 16% correction that followed Bitcoin price testing a $16,300 low reduced the open interest by 17%.In light of today's big price move, investors' positive expectations regarding Bitcoin remain unfazed, as both the futures contracts funding rate and the options 25% delta skew are not flashing any red flags.As the chart above shows, negative price swings and reductions in BTC futures open interest do not impact Bitcoin's long-term growth. Between Jan. 19 and 23, the indicator fell by 20%, but it only took only two weeks to recover to the $13 billion level.Open interest will vary more aggressively when traders are using excessive leverage. When this occurs, normal price fluctuations will cause cascading liquidations, reducing the outstanding number of open contracts.By measuring the futures contracts premium against the current spot levels, one can infer whether professional traders are leaning bullish or bearish. Typically, markets display a slightly positive annualized rate, a situation known as ""contango.""Although the premium toned down after touching 5.7% on Feb. 17, it has since dropped down to 3.5%, which is average. Considering that there are 31 days left for the March 26 contract expiry, this translates to an extremely bullish 50% annualized rate.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the perpetual contracts funding rate has exceeded 2.5% per week. Therefore, arbitrage desks are likely paying a hefty premium on March contracts to profit from the rate difference.The 25% delta skew measures how the neutral-to-bullish call options are priced against equivalent bearish put options.The indicator acts as an options traders' fear and greed gauge, and it is currently sitting at -6%, meaning protection to the upside is more expensive. This further confirms the absence of desperation from market makers and top traders.Today's price action might be surprising to new market participants, but those who remember when Bitcoin's price crashed $11,200 between Jan. 10 and 11 will know that these sharp movements can't be deemed out of the norm, especially considering Bitcoin's six-day volatility at 5.1%.The data suggests that traders buying today's dip will likely come out on top. Bitcoin's positive newsflow and the growing interest of institutional investors growing in BTC will likely just intensify after today's $48,000 retest.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

258,"On Feb. 10, Mastercard announced that it would start supporting a select few cryptocurrencies on its payment network. According to the payments giant, the inclusion of cryptocurrencies will allow customers to “save, store and send money in new ways” while opening up new opportunities for merchants as well. The announcement followed a presentation on Jan. 30 in which Visa reaffirmed its plans to continue to push for cryptocurrency payments and on-ramps, showing that the company has long-term plans for the sector. With both credit card giants on board, it’s safe to say that Bitcoin (BTC) is no longer just an experimental form of “internet money” but rather a new asset class of its own — one that is here to stay.Mastercard’s and Visa’s foray into crypto is just one example of the ever-growing barrage of mainstream technology and payment companies delving into Bitcoin as an investment, form of payment or investment vehicle, but these two companies represent billions of payments carried out every year.So, what does this mean for Bitcoin specifically and for crypto in general? Some are saying the industry may not be there yet but that this latest development could be the very beginning of mainstream adoption. When Mastercard’s announcement was made, Bitcoin was trading at about $46,400. Since then, the cryptocurrency has kept on growing to hit a new all-time high above $58,000, with the news arguably playing a factor.Furthermore, in the week that followed the announcement, the first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund in North America was approved by the Ontario Securities Commission. In its first few hours of trading, it neared $100 million in trading volume.A second Bitcoin ETF was then approved by Ontario’s regulator, and it’s expected to reach $1 billion in assets under management by the end of February. Additionally, the world’s largest custodian bank, Bank of New York Mellon, revealed it will roll out a cryptocurrency custody service. And next, the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, confirmed it has begun to “dabble” in Bitcoin.Not only that, all eyes are now set on Bitcoin, both among traditional finance titans and retail Reddit investors. Ben Zhou, CEO of Bybit, told Cointelegraph that “Crypto Twitter seems to be the happiest corner of the social platform, with laser eyes and whatnot taking over everyone from exuberant crypto accounts to the world’s richest man to two members of the U.S. Congress,” adding further:Mastercard’s announcement came at a time in which the number of confirmed payments per day on the Bitcoin network has been growing steadily. The number of payments on the network is defined as the number of recipients receiving funds in a transaction.The metric highlights the value of the Bitcoin network as a secure way to transfer funds without third parties. Over the last 12 months, confirmed payments per day have gone from an average of around 500,000 to a peak of 869,000.So, what do Mastercard’s and Visa’s endeavours mean for the cryptocurrency world? As of the fourth quarter of 2020, there are 246 million Mastercard credit cards in the United States and 966 million worldwide, while Visa reports it has 3.5 billion cards in use throughout the world and that its network processes over 140 billion transactions per year.Both companies have different plans on how they’ll bring cryptocurrency payments into the world of credit card transactions, and several questions have been left unanswered by their announcements, including how exactly the integration will work.While Mastercard’s announcement made it clear that crypto is coming to the network this year, it does not specify exactly when, and which currencies will be available. The payments giant hinted in its announcement that stablecoins may be first in line for its network but that other coins may follow.In a blog post, Mastercard’s executive vice president of digital asset and blockchain products and partnerships, Raj Dhamodharan, hinted the firm will evaluate potential cryptocurrencies to include using its “principles for blockchain partnerships” framework, which it released after leaving the Libra Association. It emphasizes consumer protection, stability and regulatory compliance.Visa’s and Mastercard’s integration into the crypto world is expected to make it seamless to use cryptocurrencies for everyday payments, which could be considered a step forward in crypto’s quest for mass adoption.While it isn’t clear if merchants will have to opt-in to accept cryptocurrency payments or if these payments will be accepted by default, cryptocurrencies will essentially be available as a payment method at over 60 million merchants throughout the world. But the road to mainstream adoption still has many bricks to be laid. Arbel Arif, founder and CEO of Shopping.io — a online shopping aggregator offering cryptocurrency payment methods for retail shoppers — told Cointelegraph:An increase in demand could further the supply squeeze we’ve been witnessing in cryptocurrency markets and further help prices move up. So far, however, Mastercard is only working with the Bahamian Sand Dollar, the world’s first central bank digital currency.In an announcement, the payments giant revealed a prepaid Mastercard allowing users to pay for goods and services with the Sand Dollar wherever Mastercard is accepted worldwide. It hinted, however, that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will be used in its network in the future.Both Visa and Mastercard have already been working with several cryptocurrency firms to issue cryptocurrency debit cards that allow users to pay for goods and services with their holdings at millions of merchants worldwide.Coinbase, BlockFi, Binance, Nexo, Crypto.com and others have issued crypto debit cards, which often include cashback rewards in the form of cryptocurrency. Last year, Coinbase became a full-standing Visa member, even able to issue its own cards. Eric Stone, head of data science at data analytics firm Flipside Crypto, told Cointelegraph that many such announcements will soon follow, adding:Crypto debit cards differ from normal Visa and Mastercard cards because of the exciting perks offered to users, and cryptocurrencies themselves can act as a bridge between fiat currency exchange rates when travelling.Most crypto debit cards are now already supported by mobile payment solutions such as Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay. It’s possible to manage which cryptocurrencies are used to pay through a mobile app, making it easier to choose what to spend.These existing crypto debit cards, however, often have relatively high fees associated with payments processing and converting crypto assets to the fiat currency merchants receive. On top of that, some crypto debit card providers require users to stake large amounts of their own tokens to unlock the best rewards, but there are some advantages that crypto projects bring to the table. Finally, only citizens of a select group of countries have access to the most popular cards.While there are still a lot of unanswered questions regarding Visa’s and Mastercard’s approaches to processing cryptocurrency payments through their networks, it’s clear that these companies moving into the cryptocurrency space bolsters the legitimacy of the industry.Ever since PayPal started letting users buy, sell and hold crypto on its platform, Bitcoin and other crypto assets have been further legitimized as their own asset class that is now being accepted by traditional finance firms.A few years ago, in the minds of an average consumer, cryptocurrencies were mostly associated with darknet markets selling illegal goods and with out of control speculation. Now, BTC is being recognized as a store of value, so much so that publicly traded firms have been investing in it. So, has Bitcoin finally made it? Is mainstream adoption here? On Yavin, managing partner of Cointelligence Fund, told Cointelegraph that crypto is indeed “gaining more momentum than ever before,” adding:MicroStrategy has invested $1.145 billion to buy 71,079 BTC, now worth around $3.8 billion at the time of writing. Tesla announced a $1.5 billion investment, with the electric car maker believed to have bought 48,000 BTC at an average price of $31,250 a pop. At today’s prices, the company would now hold around $2.5 billion. MassMutual, Square, Ruffer Investment and others have also invested in the cryptocurrency, helping its market capitalization surpass $1 trillion.While Bitcoin now appears to be as popular as it has ever been, data shows otherwise. According to data from Google Trends, search interest for “Bitcoin” is still below the levels seen back in 2017, despite the significant price increase and growing corporate adoption.What this likely means is that large investors and corporations are driving up the market, while retail investors are largely staying on the sidelines. However, when it comes to general public outlook, the acceptance by these giants may change the way retail shoppers look at cryptocurrencies. According to Arif, large companies acting as “a bridge that connects the common shopper to cryptocurrencies like this is pivotal for the entire industry as crypto is being taken seriously worldwide as a form of payment.”"
259,"Tesla’s strategic embrace of Bitcoin (BTC) will have a dramatic impact on corporate adoption of the digital asset, according to Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities. In a Monday interview with CNBC, Ives said Tesla’s exposure to Bitcoin is “not just a fad,” but part of a long-term strategy that’s driven by an investment thesis and business thesis.“I think Tesla is going to double down on its Bitcoin investment,” he said.""No doubt this is something @elonmusk and @Tesla they're going to dive into the deep end of the pool on #bitcoin because they're not just doing it from an investment perspective, but from a transaction perspective,"" says Wedbush's Dan Ives on $TSLA and #btc. pic.twitter.com/0Wt2IHCdZIIves was referring to Tesla’s recent decision to allocate $1.5 billion to Bitcoin and begin accepting the digital asset as a form of payment. At the time of the interview, Tesla had made about $1 billion in paper gains on its BTC trade. “That’s more than they’ve made from a profit in all of EV sales in 2020,"" he said.Wedbush Securities believes that 3% to 5% of publicly listed companies will go down the Bitcoin rabbit hole over the next 12 to 18 months, although their adoption will be limited to investments only, Ives said. The 5% threshold is unlikely to be broken without more regulatory clarity around BTC.Ives’ commentary on Tesla mirrors his recent analysis on Bitcoin, where he described the digital asset as part of a much larger adoption story. Bitcoin mania “is not a fad in our opinion, but rather the start of a new age on the digital currency front,” he said."
260,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $50,000 on Feb. 22 as a correction gathered pace at Wall Street's opening to deliver 20% daily losses prior to a strong response from the bulls. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows BTC/USD falling heavily during Monday trading, hitting lows of $47,400.After reversing at all-time highs of $58,312 on Sunday, Bitcoin fell almost $7,000 in under an hour, sparking intense volatility, which continued at the time of writing.""Almost a $7,000 hourly candle. That has to be by far the largest hourly move in history,"" analyst Scott Melker reacted.Earlier, Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe highlighted the area between $50,500 and $52,000 as being crucial to hold in order to preserve the chances of the bull run continuing in the short term. In fresh analysis on Monday, he noted that historically, this time of year is not when crypto markets put in their strongest performance.At the time of publishing, Bitcoin had recovered to trade back above $53,000.According to reports on Twitter, the action accompanied fresh criticism of Bitcoin from U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who reportedly referred to it as ""inefficient"" while repeating claims that it is used in criminal activity. In a curious coincidence, Sunayna Tutejahe, a Bitcoin proponent and well-known financial innovator, became the new chief innovation officer at the Federal Reserve.""OUCH! #Bitcoin plunges >10% on worries prices are excessive. Elon Musk tweeted on Saturday that prices 'seem high,'"" markets commentator Holger Zschaepitz tweeted, quoting a headline from Bloomberg that focused on off-the-cuff remarks from Musk last week.“The selloff across the board this week is a result of some of last week’s exuberance easing, as well as a much needed unwinding of over-leveraged long positions,” Ross Middleton, co-founder of exchange DeversiFi, added to Reuters.For those familiar with Bitcoin and crypto markets in general, meanwhile, even the precipitous drop was just business as usual.""After a while, you become immune to these price drops. Only makes you stack even harder,"" popular Twitter account Armin van Bitcoin responded.Contributor Joseph Young further pointed to the so-called Coinbase premium returning to positive almost immediately once the $47,400 bottom reversed, reaching an eye-watering $500 — a bullish sign. Melker, in turn, emphasized the amount of buying volume that the dip had unleashed.As Cointelegraph reported, various factors were converging to signal that a correction was imminent even before it gathered pace, among them being suspected plans among whales to sell some BTC."
261,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has been grinding up nicely over the past few weeks, but the past 24 hours have seen a significant correction. BTC price dropped by over $10,000 from $58,000 to under $48,000, a correction of almost 20%.This pullback — which many anticipated as 28,000 BTC was deposited to Gemini — also caused other cryptocurrencies to fall alongside Bitcoin, resulting in Bitcoin's market dominance rising as a result.But will history repeat and produce a dull, corrective March? Let's analyze the charts. Markets never go up in a straight line, and corrections must occur from time to time. This can be considered a ""reset"" for the market, which reverts back to the mean trendline, and the euphoria fades.At the first stage of a correction, people still expect the corrective move to be a tiny correction, while the sentiment slowly starts to shift. The moment the correction continues, the lower the price goes, the worse the sentiment becomes.At the bottom, Bitcoin will be called ""dead"" and a Ponzi scheme once again, after which the price has historically recovered.The critical question now, however, is whether the market will see a prolonged correction or if Bitcoin’s price will hold above the green box shown in the chart above. That green box is the previous period of compression that technically should serve as major support.If the area between $42,000 and $44,000 holds, upward continuation is likely. In that case, the point of interest at $63,000 is still on the table.However, the bearish divergence and the weakness at the start of this week suggest more downside is possible. In that regard, losing the $42,000–$44,000 area could result in a further correction toward $37,000. The weekly chart for Bitcoin shows some beautiful historical data, which shows that March tends to be a period of correction or consolidation. Massive corrections happened in 2017, 2018 and 2020 during this period, while 2016 and 2019 saw sideways price action.Of course, history is not guaranteed to repeat, but history rhymes, and historical data often provides insight into how market cycles work.In that regard, the critical indicator to watch is the 21-week moving average (MA), which should hold Bitcoin’s price from dropping further. From that perspective, the current price level of the 21-week MA is found at $28,000, and this will crawl up to $32,000 to $34,000 in the coming weeks.Thus, the recent higher low is created at $30,000, which means that a further drop toward $38,000 to $40,000 is not unlikelym as that would be a regular 30% to 40% correction.The daily chart of Bitcoin shows some critical levels to watch for the current period. First of all, the recent drop-down brought Bitcoin’s price to a vital support level. It should hold this zone between $42,000 and $44,000 to avoid more downside.If this doesn’t hold, a further drop to the level around $37,000 is likely. This would also grant a retest of the 21-week MA.However, if the green zone between $42,000 and $44,000 does provide support, a rebound is likely toward $63,000, as previously stated.However, this is too early to call, as historically, the end of February and March is a corrective, not a bullish period for the markets in general.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
262,"An important Chicago Mercantile Exchange Bitcoin (BTC) futures gap closed as BTC/USD suddenly dropped below $54,000 on Feb. 22.A CME gap forms when the price of Bitcoin moves either up or down after the CME closes during the weekend or holidays in the United States.Unlike most cryptocurrency exchanges, because the CME Bitcoin futures exchange is not open at all times, a gap forms between CME and many Bitcoin trading platforms.The CME gap is sometimes considered an important gap to fill for the Bitcoin rally to continue in the near term.For instance, the latest gap formed when the price of Bitcoin exceeded $58,000 across major cryptocurrency exchanges, while CME's Bitcoin futures market closed for two days.As such, a gap at $55,504 emerged, which closed as the price of Bitcoin fell steeply after the new weekly candle opened.#Bitcoin CME gap closed finally. https://t.co/JygwzJwClk pic.twitter.com/XYkPgKuBjpBitcoin has a tendency to sharply correct in a short period after a new weekly candle opens. This flushes out overleveraged longs and brings some balance into the market.Prior to the weekly candle open, the funding rate of the Bitcoin futures market ranged between 0.1% to 0.15%. This is 10-fold to 15-fold higher than the default 0.01% funding rate.Although the funding rate of Bitcoin has remained relatively high throughout the bull cycle, a 0.15% funding rate indicates that the market is extremely overcrowded.The combination of a high Bitcoin futures funding rate, the presence of a CME gap and whales depositing to major U.S. exchanges likely fueled the drop.Prior to the pullback, CryptoQuant found that large BTC deposits were transferred to Gemini, one of the leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges.Before the dip, there were significant $BTC inflows into all exchanges, mostly Gemini.

Chart https://t.co/6gPk3Qbg6j pic.twitter.com/j1wDNtqNakWhen whales deposit BTC into exchanges, it typically signals an intent to sell. Hence, it is likely that some whales took profit on their positions, causing the market to dip sharply in a short period.However, whales selling large amounts of Bitcoin can cause a bigger correction than usual because it leads to cascading liquidations in the futures market.Many overleveraged longs can get liquidated consecutively, amplifying the effect of the whale-induced sell-off. Data shows that over $1 billion worth of futures contracts were liquidated in the last 24 hours.After the drop, traders are anticipating a gradual recovery. Scott Melker, a cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst, said that recent history indicates dips do not last long. He wrote:"
263,"21Shares, a Switzerland-based provider of cryptocurrency exchange-traded products, or ETPs, has recorded a 100% growth in assets under management over the past two weeks.The company announced Monday that it has passed the $1 billion mark in assets under management across its diversified 12 crypto-asset ETPs. 21Shares CEO Hany Rashwan said that the company has seen a meteoric rise in its crypto ETP products recently, doubling its AUM in less than two weeks. The company previously announced that 21Shares broke $500 million in AUM on Feb. 8.According to the announcement, the massive surge in 21Shares’ crypto ETP business is mainly attributed to the rapid adoption of crypto by institutional investors and the products’ availability on regulated European exchanges.Rashwan said that institutional investors are able to invest in 21Shares’ crypto ETPs by using the International Securities Identification Number, or ISIN, which is a global standard used to identify specific securities such as bonds, stocks, derivatives and others:According to a product breakdown chart in the announcement, the biggest part of 21Shares’ total AUM came from 21Shares Binance BNB ETP (ABNB) — an ETP tracking the investment results of Binance Coin (BNB). BNB’s dominant share in the total AUM comes amid Binance Coin's recent surge, which saw it become the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency on Friday.As of Thursday, ABNB was apparently still behind 21Shares' Bitcoin ETP, or ABTC, with AUM amounting to around $214 million, while ABTC AUM stood at $272 million, according to official records on the 21Shares website.Formerly branded as Amun AG, 21Shares is known for launching the world’s first multicrypto ETP, listing the product on SIX Swiss Exchange in November 2018. In just over two years after launching its first crypto ETP, 21Shares has been actively diversifying its crypto ETP offering, witnessing a two-hundredfold increase in AUM. In early February, 21Shares launched the world’s first ETP based on Polkadot's DOT."
264,"South Korea will implement a 20% tax on Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency profits starting Jan. 1, 2022. The nation’s Ministry of Economy and Finance announced that profits made from both trading and holding cryptocurrencies will be subject to the tax, reported the Korean Herald on Monday.The tax will be triggered when profits made from cryptocurrencies exceed 2.5 million won, or roughly $2,300. Gains made up to this point will be tax-exempt.South Korea previously aimed to levy the tax starting in 2020, but pushback from cryptocurrency enthusiasts and lobbyists saw the government delay the implementation of the tax several times. A 2022 start date was previously floated by the South Korean regime, however, that date was then delayed until 2023, as previously reported by Cointelegraph.Now, it appears that 2022 is back in the cards once again. Following South Korea’s recognition of Bitcoin as a financial asset, BTC and other cryptocurrencies will no longer be classed as tax-free hobbies.Cryptocurrencies received as part of an inheritance, or those received as gifts, will also be taxed. Referring to crypto gifts and inheritances, the Herald states:Over 38,000 citizens have already signed a petition in protest of the impending tax since Feb. 10. If the number of signatures on the petition reaches 200,000 by the end of March, it will force an official response from the South Korean government.Starting in March, an expected revision to the Specific Financial Transactions Act will also see cryptocurrency exchanges fall under new regulatory scrutiny. In addition to stronger information security procedures, and Anti-Money Laundering measures, the new regulation will also see exchanges forced to implement “real name accounts,” reports the Korea Herald."
265,"Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new high over the weekend in the latest episode of its spectacular 2021 bull run — what’s next for hodlers?As the largest cryptocurrency approaches $60,000, Cointelegraph takes a look at the factors to consider when forecasting this week’s price action.Equities showed no signs of flipping their endless upside on Monday, as buyers continued to pour in to the market.Despite warnings that a bubble may already be about to burst, markets built on all-time highs as anticipation of an economic recovery worldwide stoked enthusiasm.In the United States, it was hope surrounding President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus package that was still providing the basis for growth. Last week, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that the mechanism for the money, which would include a third round of stimulus checks worth $1,400, would be finalized by Congress within the next few weeks.“Everybody is playing out the outlook for better economic growth, the outlook for more fiscal stimulus,” Adrian Zuercher, head of global asset allocation at UBS Wealth Management, told Bloomberg.While Bitcoin has exploded in line with stocks since the crash of March 2020, not everyone was so optimistic.In fresh comments on Monday, investor and hedge fund manager Michael J. Burry delivered an onerous forecast for the global economy, claiming that a major correction in equity markets was due.“People say I didn't warn last time. I did, but no one listened. So I warn this time. And still, no one listens. But I will have proof I warned,” he tweeted.Speaking to CNBC, Ark Invest founder, CIO and CEO Cathie Wood added that a “valuation reset” would likely be the result of a continued sharp increase in rates.With no specific timeframe in mind, the risk was clearly being felt for this March to repeat last March, something which ultimately allowed both Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) to outperform.Any short-term continuation for Bitcoin, meanwhile, could be tempered by middling behavior of the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY), which bounced off lows in recent days.Traditionally, a recovery in DXY spells downward pressure for BTC/USD, and the index spent most of February falling.As Cointelegraph reported, long-term forecasts still see the dollar weakening overall in time, thanks in no small part to the huge expansion of the money supply by the Federal Reserve.“There’s a lot more downside for the dollar, and our longer-term perspective is for dollar weakness, not for dollar strength,” Standard Chartered research lead Steve Englander told Reuters at the start of February.An accompanying poll revealed that only 13% of participants panned for a USD increase in three months’ time, with the vast majority expecting a loss or stagnation in value.“A lot of the exceptionalism of the dollar has to do with its scarcity,” Englander added.For Bitcoin, signs of a possible pullback came in the form of a spike in exchange inflows on Monday.As noted by on-chain monitoring resource CryptoQuant, institutional-focused Gemini saw giant aggregated inflows of 28,004 BTC ($1.63 billion), suggesting that a major investor plans to either sell or have funds ready for sale should prices drop.“Be careful downside risk from whale dumping,” CryptoQuant added in comments to Telegram subscribers.Last week, Cointelegraph reported that stablecoin balances on exchanges had hit all-time highs, something which accompanied BTC/USD reaching a new record of its own — $58,312 on Bitstamp. This was while the so-called Coinbase premium — the difference in price between Coinbase and Binance — was negative.For CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, the nature of the gains was cause for concern despite the resulting euphoria.“One thing that makes me uncomfortable about this $BTC surge is a negative Coinbase premium,” he tweeted.Should Bitcoin retrace, expectations are that altcoins could once again move into the spotlight this week.The weekend produced mixed results for major cap tokens, with some gains while others stagnated. On Monday, Bitcoin’s uncertain behavior came as the largest altcoin Ether had already lost 2% in 24 hours after hitting $2,000 for the first time.Polkadot (DOT), Cardano (ADA) and Chainlink (LINK) were also negative on the day, while XRP put in a surprise move to climb 14% to near $0.60.“Money is flowing into #Bitcoin right now,” popular trader Rekt Capital told Twitter followers last week.Bitcoin’s market cap increased slightly on Monday to 61.4%.It may be time for Bitcoin bulls to get out while they can — because one of the cryptocurrency’s biggest critics might buy a large amount.In a decidedly cryptic tweet over the weekend, gold bug Peter Schiff queried at what point he should look to sell any BTC he might purchase.“If I were to actually buy some #Bitcoin, how would I know when to sell? If your answer is to never sell, then what is the point of buying in the first place?” he asked.Schiff has dabbled in Bitcoin before, complaining about losing his wallet password, but has made a name for himself by shaming its economic basis and promoting gold as the only option to avoid fiat money inflation.Interest in hodling therefore, real or not, put the wind up the trading community, who viewed it as a classic sign of a bull market getting out of control.“Slowly then all at once. If he buys, I’m out,” cryptocurrency trader Scott Melker responded.As Cointelegraph reported last year, Bitcoin hitting $50,000 might indeed be the event that “triggers” Schiff to invest."
266,"American electric car giant Tesla has seen some massive gains from its Bitcoin (BTC) investment, reportedly having made up to $1 billion in profit, according to a new report.An analyst at Wedbush Securities, a private investment firm in the United States, has calculated that Tesla has made “roughly $1 billion” in the aftermath of its $1.5 billion Bitcoin investment. Daniel Ives estimated Tesla’s Bitcoin profits in an investor note on Saturday, CNBC reports.Amid Bitcoin’s parabolic surge to become a $1 trillion asset, Ives said, “Tesla is on a trajectory to make more from its Bitcoin investments than profits from selling its electric vehicle cars in all of 2020.” Ives noted that Tesla’s move is likely to affect other public companies. ""While the Bitcoin investment is a side show for Tesla, it’s clearly been a good initial investment and a trend we expect could have a ripple impact for other public companies over the next 12 to 18 months,"" he wrote. However, Ives expects just a small part of the market to follow the trend due to regulatory uncertainty issues:Tesla officially announced its $1.5 billion Bitcoin investment as part of its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 8. It still remains unclear how much Bitcoin Tesla bought and at what price, as the company did not disclose this information in the filing.As Bitcoin traded between roughly $29,000 and $37,000 in the month of January, a $1.5 billion investment could mean Tesla holds anywhere between 40,000 and 51,000 BTC. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $56,239, up around 15% over the past seven days, according to data from the Cointelegraph Bitcoin price index.In late January, Tesla reported its first full-year profit, stating that the company earned $721 million in 2020 after an $862 million loss in 2019."
267,"The Purpose Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund debuted on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Feb. 18 and has quickly ramped up trading volumes of about $400 million worth of shares in two days. This is quite impressive, considering that the equity market in Canada is only a fraction of the size of the U.S. markets. This shows strong demand for Bitcoin and investor's preference to take the ETF route to establish fresh positions.Last week, Bitcoin reached another important milestone when it hit the critical $1 trillion market capitalization on Feb. 19, making it the sixth asset on the list of top market cap companies in the world. The involvement of institutional investors and a market cap of over $1 trillion could allay the concerns of manipulation and liquidity raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the previous years as it rejected Bitcoin ETF applications. In a recent interview with CNBC, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood said that “the probability of an ETF has gone up.” Wood said the new SEC chairman Gary Gensler, who taught a digital currency class at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, could be more open to crypto, increasing the likelihood of an approved Bitcoin ETF.Although Bitcoin’s fundamental factors continue to improve, the near term could experience some turbulence due to the steepening of the U.S. Treasury curve.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that indicate the possibility of the resumption of the uptrend in the short term.Bitcoin broke above the resistance line of the ascending channel on Feb. 19 and the bulls have managed to sustain the breakout. This suggests that traders continue to buy at higher levels.The BTC/USD pair had formed a Doji candlestick pattern on Feb. 20, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears about the next directional move. That uncertainty has resolved to the upside today and the bulls will now try to propel the price to $60,974.43.The 20-day exponential moving average ($47,450) is sloping up and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the overbought zone, which indicates that bulls have the upper hand.Contrary to this assumption, if the price re-enters the channel, the bears will try to pull the price down to the 20-day EMA. A break below the channel will indicate a possible change in trend and the pair may then correct to the 50-day simple moving average.The 4-hour chart shows the pair remains in a strong uptrend and the bulls have aggressively purchased the dips to the 20-EMA. The bears will try to stall the current uptrend at the resistance line of the ascending channel.If they succeed, the pair may again drop to the 20-EMA. A bounce off this support will suggest that the trend remains strong and the bulls are not waiting for a deeper correction to buy. The momentum could pick up if the bulls can propel and sustain the price above the channel.On the contrary, if the bears can sink the price below the 20-EMA, it will suggest profit-booking by traders. The trend could weaken if the pair plunges below the channel.AAVE has been consolidating between $392.50 and $545 for the past few days. A consolidation after a strong uptrend is a positive sign as it suggests that traders are not rushing to the exit because they anticipate higher levels in the future.The 20-day EMA ($427) is flat and the RSI is just above 56, which suggests that the range-bound action may continue for a few more days.If the buyers can push the price above $480, the AAVE/USD pair may rise to $545. A breakout and close above the $545 to $581.667 resistance zone could start the next leg of the uptrend that may reach $697.50 and then $814.397.On the other hand, if the bears can sink and sustain the price below $392.50, it will suggest that supply exceeds demand. That could start a deeper correction to the 50-day SMA ($297).The 4-hour chart shows that the price has been oscillating between $500 and $392.50. If the bears sink the price below the $392.50 support, the pair could drop to $300 and then to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $267.094.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push the price above the 50-SMA, a move to $500 is possible. A break above this resistance will enhance the prospects of a move to $545 and then $581.667.Cosmos (ATOM) is currently correcting in a strong uptrend. While the pullback is five days old, the bears have not yet been able to pull the price down to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $19.007. This shows a lack of sellers at lower levels.A shallow correction is usually a sign of strength and it increases the possibility of a retest of the $26.55 overhead resistance. The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls have the upper hand.If the bulls can thrust the price above $26.55, the next leg of the uptrend could begin. The ATOM/USD pair could then rally to $32.173. If the bulls can conquer this level, the up-move may extend to $40.On the contrary, if the pair continues to fall, a drop to the 20-day EMA ($18.19) is possible. A strong bounce off this support could keep the uptrend intact but a break below it will suggest a deeper correction to the 61.8% retracement level at $14.347.The 4-hour chart is currently correcting inside a descending channel. The moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover and the RSI is in the negative territory, indicating a minor advantage to the bears.However, if the price rises from the support line of the descending channel, it will indicate accumulation at lower levels. On a break above the moving averages, a move to the resistance line of the channel is possible.A breakout and close above the channel could result in a retest of $26.55. On the other hand, a break below the channel may weaken sentiment. The pair could then decline to the 50% retracement level at $16.677.NEO broke and closed above the $47.444 resistance on Feb. 19. The bears attempted to fake this breakout and trap the aggressive bulls on Feb. 20 when they pulled the price back below $47.444.However, the bulls had other plans. They aggressively purchased the dip and have pushed the price above the psychological resistance at $50 today. This may start the next leg of the uptrend that could reach $60.373 and then $64.95.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought territory indicate that bulls are in control.But if the bulls fail to sustain the price above $50, it will suggest that traders are booking profits at higher levels. A break below the 20-day EMA ($37.80) will signal a possible change in trend.The 4-hour chart shows the formation of an ascending triangle, which has a pattern target at $58.588. Generally, the price turns down and retests the breakout level but sometimes, when the trend is strong, the price only consolidates before resuming the up-move.The bulls are currently defending the $50 support. If the price rises from the current level and breaks above $54.191, the uptrend could resume.This positive view will invalidate if the pair turns down from the current level and breaks below the triangle. Such a move may result in a fall to $36.30.After the sharp rally from $0.026714 to $0.060774, VeChain (VET) has largely held the 38.2% support at $0.047763 on a closing basis, which shows accumulation at lower levels. The rising moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.If the bulls can drive the price above the overhead resistance at $0.060774, the VET/USD pair could start the next leg of the up-move. The target level to watch on the upside is $0.085172 and then $0.10.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls fail to propel the price above the overhead resistance, the VET/USD pair may consolidate between $0.060774 and $0.0424 for a few more days. The trend will tilt in favor of the bears if they can sink and sustain the price below $0.0424.The 4-hour chart shows that both moving averages are flat and the RSI is just above the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand.However, the pair has formed an ascending triangle pattern that will complete on a breakout and close above $0.060774. This bullish setup has a pattern target of $0.079148.On the other hand, if the price slips below the trendline of the ascending triangle, it will invalidate the pattern and open the doors for a fall to $0.042.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

268,"Image a scenario where you need different messengers to send different types of messages — for example, WhatsApp for text messages, Viber for audio, Telegram for video, etc. Rather inconvenient, right? But this is exactly what happens in finance: There is no way to send both digital fiat money and cryptocurrency from a bank account without extra steps. It’s not affecting the masses just yet, but after the issuing of national digital currencies, or central bank digital currencies, in the next few years over the world, the situation is about to become complicated. We need to start looking for a solution now.The traditional financial system can’t brush off new technologies anymore. According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the number of cryptocurrency users has almost tripled from 35 million people in 2018 to 101 million people in Q3 2020. Another study, conducted by researchers from the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, revealed a 78% increase since 2019.Cryptocurrency operations are profitable. In Q4 2020 alone, PayPal increased its number of transactions by 36%, which is worth about $277 billion. The increase began in Q3 2020 when the company introduced crypto transactions. This is one of the best quarterly returns in PayPal’s history.Related: Will PayPal’s crypto integration bring crypto to the masses? Experts answerHowever, central bank digital currencies are going to become a part of our daily lives in three to five years. And we need completely new infrastructure for its mainstream adoption. China was the first to actively promote its digital yuan project — referred to as the Digital Currency Electronic Payment, or DCEP. China is fully focused on the infrastructure because several local banks have already developed or are developing their own e-wallets — the main tool for working with DCEP.Related: China turns up pace on CBDC release, tests infrastructure prior to adoptionSo far, the Chinese digital yuan is the only example of digital money issued by central banks that is actually working. Notably, more than 60 central banks around the world are exploring this opportunity. DCEP is built on centralized blockchain technology fully managed by the Central Bank of China. This technology makes it possible to gain full control over all financial transactions, ensures social spending targeting, increases tax collection, and prevents financial crimes.In turn, international payments system Visa recently introduced a protocol for offline transactions with central bank digital currencies. To pay or accept payments offline simply requires downloading a mobile application. In this case, CBDCs essentially replace cash, leading to an increase in the number of transactions controlled by the issuer, bank or financial intermediary.The monetary multi-format framework is about to become a requirement for financial instruments. Banks will have to make sure that fiat, CBDC and crypto transactions can be made in one place: in a banking application. But there is a catch: The new formats have nothing in common with their predecessors. Moreover, governments view the launch of CBDCs as autonomous. In other words, it doesn’t follow a unified standard with neighboring countries.Cryptocurrencies and CBDCs are relatively new. So, there is a lot of uncertainty around these financial instruments. That being said, fiat and digital money share common functions, and the method and quality of their implementation affect how the multi-format financial solution is going to be created.Building a multi-format financial solution requires a unified approach to compliance. If each service conducts Anti-Money Laundering checks for CBDC and cryptocurrency transactions following its own policy, the bank on the receiving end will not confirm them.People who aren’t deeply involved in crypto might think digital assets cannot be integrated into traditional business processes. But this is untrue. Our experience shows that it is necessary to develop a unified approach to compliance — the same for both traditional fiat and crypto. Public vilification of all digital asset owners stands in the way of that.Moreover, the tools in crypto finance are noticeably more effective in AML than those in the traditional system. For example, Know Your Transaction procedures can show the entire transaction history for a particular cryptocurrency — from the moment the token was created to when it was sent to the user’s wallet, including every operation in between.The differences between “old” and “new” money shown above are just a few examples, but they are significant enough that we can’t anticipate the seamless use of different forms of money. That is why the compatibility between them is especially important for many banks and fintech services.We are entering a new era of many financial intermediaries of all shapes and sizes. They will serve their own niche, combining different types of electronic money, CBDCs and cryptocurrencies, using a variety of services. For example, Visa cards already support fiat, crypto, precious metals and Bitcoin (BTC) cashback.When companies and people can choose among different types of money/currencies/payment systems, only those financial institutions that can work with a wide variety of formats and services simultaneously can be considered universal banks.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
269,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) dipped to as low as $53,905 on Binance overnight, recording a sudden 6% drop. But despite the minor correction, the price of Bitcoin quickly recovered thereafter, reaching a new all-time high above $57,800 on Feb. 21.Although Bitcoin saw a steep drop within merely hours, analysts pinpointed that it fell to the exact bottom of a short-term trendline.John Cho, the Director of Global Expansion at Ground X, noted that the drop was a liquidity fill at a lower price.$BTC just needed a little liquidity that's all. https://t.co/XTeAYPROWz pic.twitter.com/zlkcBAAI4xA liquidity fill simply means when an asset drops after stagnating to fill buy orders at the bottom of the rangeA drop was expected because Bitcoin was consolidating with the futures funding rate at around 0.15%.Across major futures exchanges, the Bitcoin futures funding rate was hovering between 0.1% to 0.2%, and it was particularly high for stablecoin pairs.Bitcoin futures exchanges use a mechanism called funding to incentivize buyers or sellers based on market sentiment.For example, when there are more buyers in the market, the funding rate turns positive. When that happens, buyers have to pay sellers a portion of their position every eight hours.When the funding rate is high but the price of Bitcoin is consolidating, the risk of a big short-term drop increases.This trend is what occurred overnight on Feb. 20, as Bitcoin declined by more than 6%. Although the funding rate remains near 0.1%, it has dropped substantially since.The funding rate for altcoins, including Ether (ETH) and DeFi tokens, reset to around 0.05%. As such, altcoins saw a stronger bounce than BTC.In the near term, Bitcoin faces a major risk due to the U.S. Treasury curve rising. When the Treasury curve rises, historically, risk-on assets like stocks tend to drop.In the past week, the U.S. stock market has corrected quite steeply, demonstrating a clear correlation with the Treasury curve.However, it remains uncertain whether Bitcoin would react the same way given that it is not only considered a risk-on asset but also as an inflation hedge, which means it could counter the risk of the Treasury curve.What's more, the correlation between Bitcoin and other assets including stocks and gold has been declining since September 2020. Thus, there is a possibility that the inflation hedge aspect of Bitcoin counters the rising Treasury curve. If so, BTC could remain unfazed, particularly given the current strength of the bull run. Misa Christanto, an analyst at Messari, said that in a bear market, everything is correlated. But Bitcoin, which is also considered a ""reflation trade,"" has been resilient. She wrote:"
270,"In a recent video debate, Bitcoin skeptic Frances Coppola debated Bloomberg senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone on the economics of Bitcoin, market manipulation and predictions for 2021. Coppola is skeptical that Bitcoin will ever succeed as a store of value because of its high volatility which, according to her, is a direct consequence of the asset’s fixed supply rate.“With a fixed rate of increase of supply (...) the only thing that can adjust to changes in demand is price”, she explained. Demand fluctuations mean Bitcoin's volatility is here to stay.McGlone, on the other hand, thinks that the fixed supply of Bitcoin will lead the volatility to decline over time.“The simple rules of markets is you have supply and demand. Both are uncertain. That's what creates volatility”, he explained. “If you have a certain supply schedule, that means 50 percent of that input for volatility is already gone (...) So, by laws of economics, volatility in Bitcoin should drop”.Another subject of debate were the allegations that stablecoin Tether may be used to manipulate the Bitcoin market. According to McGlone, these allegations “don’t make any sense”, given that the market cap of Tether is only a small fraction of Bitcoin's.“It's like saying that little fish is kicking the whale around”, he argued.Coppola disagreed, pointing out that Bitcoin’s market cap includes a vast amount of coins that are not in circulation. “What Tether is influencing is the flow, not the stock”, she said “So I think that Tether could actually move the price”.Pick your side and check out the full debate on our Cointelegraph Youtube channel!"
271,"While his electric car company announced a Bitcoin purchase weeks ago, Elon Musk finally became a true Bitcoiner last night by engaging in a time-honored cryptoTwitter pastime: dunking on Peter Schiff. Yesterday morning Schiff, the noted gold bug and Bitcoin skeptic, posted a Tweet thread in which he criticized Elon Musk’s comment that Bitcoin is a flawed currency, though still better than fiat alternatives:According to @elonmusk ""Bitcoin is almost as BS as fiat money."" So Musk regards both #Bitcoin and fiat as BS. I agree, I just think Bitcoin, which is digital fiat, is even more BS than the paper fiat issued by central banks. #Gold is not BS. It's real money and better than both!Schiff noted that, “as an engineer” the Tesla founder should know the difference between a “tangible element” and a “string of numbers,” and said that gold has greater utility relative to Bitcoin. “Money isn't data. Data can represent money but can't replace it. Money improved barter, gold improved money, and data improved #gold. Bitcoin is a return to barter. All sellers will accept money. With #Bitcoin you must find a seller who has what you want and wants what you have,” Schiff concluded.In response, the Tesla founder criticized Schiff’s view of third-party gold storage as an additional layer of trust, saying he “might as well have crypto.”An email saying you have gold is not the same as having gold. You might as well have crypto.

Money is just data that allows us to avoid the inconvenience of barter.

That data, like all data, is subject to latency & error. The system will evolve to that which minimizes both.Considering how flippant Musk has been in promoting the Dogecoin meme currency, he also hedged his statement with a perhaps surprising follow-up, warning that prices for Bitcoin and Ether are “high.”While tempered, the Twitter statements are just the latest vote of confidence the world’s richest man has put into cryptocurrencies. Earlier this month Tesla used 7.7% of gross cash on hand to purchase Bitcoin, a sum worth $1.5 billion, and later followed up by saying “only a fool” wouldn’t seek investments beyond fiat.Schiff, meanwhile, continues to be a punching bag so universal that even shawarma restaurants get in on the fun. While he’s recently admitted that Bitcoin isn’t the scam he once accused it of being, he remains resolutely in favor of physical bullion as an investment. His Twitter trash-talking carries on even as his bank remains under investigation."
272,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has been consistently rallying in the past few weeks, reaching its latest new high of around $57,500 on Feb. 20.The week has seen more bullish news such as the first German-listed company allocating its cash reserves to BTC as well as the launch of the first Bitcoin ETF in Canada, which traded over $220 million in its debut. Just for a daySuch news is fueling the price of Bitcoin, while Elon Musk has also embraced the latest “laser eye” meme to the joy of hodlers who are itching for a $100,000 BTC price. However, the next major point of interest is at around $63,000, and this could be reached relatively soon if Bitcoin can hold above a few key support levels.The four-hour chart for Bitcoin shows a clear upward path since it broke out of the range construction between $30,000 and $42,000. Since then, crucial levels at $44,000 and $50,000 held as support, which served as the launchpad for the current highs above $55,000.This run is also being driven by the decreasing reserves on exchanges. This is very similar to the end of 2016 when more Bitcoin was withdrawn from exchanges than deposited. These withdrawals mean that people want to hold their Bitcoin for the long term, indicating strong demand and low time preference.During the recent rally, the first Fibonacci level at 1.618 was reached. Now, Bitcoin is nearing the second point of interest at the 2.618 Fibonacci level around $63,000.On the downside, the $50,000 level is crucial on the four-hour chart. If that sustains support, there’s a high chance Bitcoin’s price will reach that level next. However, if it loses $50,000, more downside to $43,000 can be expected.Meanwhile, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization is approaching the $2-trillion mark in this cycle, which many people wouldn’t have expected last year.However, after breaking the all-time high of 2017, the next level of interest was the $1.2-trillion level, which is also the 1.618 Fibonacci area.That zone was broken to the upside, and the market cap is now aiming for $1.85 trillion, the 2.618 Fibonacci level. The chart also shows a massive gap between the 21-Week MA and the current price, suggesting that the rally might be getting overextended.Historically, the end of February and the month of March have not been bullish for the market, so a correction should not come as a surprise. In that case, a retest of $1.2 trillion is definitely on the table.In trading, it’s all about holding critical support levels for further upward or downward momentum. In this case, the first key levels are found between $43,000 and 44,000 and the second one at $50,000.The same, however, can also now be said about the $55,000 level on low timeframes, specifically the 1-hour candle chart. If that’s lost, there’s a gap to the next area of support, which means that a breakdown to the $50,000 level can then be expected.However, as long as $55,000 is held, there isn’t much that is holding Bitcoin’s price from reaching the next Fibonacci level at $63,000.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

273,"On Jan. 26, the internet came to a screeching halt along much of the East Coast. Email services went down; YouTube videos flickered out midstream; millions were likely affected, if only temporarily. But the outage, attributed to a surge in traffic, underscores the metastasizing vulnerabilities surrounding the way most of the world conducts commerce, consumes entertainment and communicates.The implications of such outages should be seen as particularly alarming for those in cryptoland: namely, for the ever-growing numbers of participants in an emerging decentralized ecosystem for transferring peer-to-peer value with Bitcoin (BTC) who build smart contracts on Ethereum or launch any number of platforms and tokens that perform untold numbers of functions and services.Indeed, such outages highlight a serious challenge to building the hoped-for future of a decentralized web that is more secure, reliable and safer.Every time Gmail or Telegram goes down because of such disruptions to the existing web, it’s a reminder of how exposed this emergent decentralized world is to centralized vulnerabilities. And it’s something of an Achilles heel that has yet to be satisfactorily addressed.In short, the full blossoming of blockchain and other decentralized systems depends on the reliability of an existing web architecture that is not only highly centralized but also in need of a facelift.As beautiful as the original architecture of it — and, believe me, it is beautiful — the internet as we know it has become a tad clunky. It’s been decades since its creation, and it’s showing its proverbial age. The evidence of this is the rising number of outages that have disrupted major cloud services, such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, along with business-critical messaging platforms like Slack. The resulting losses to corporations, as well as to everyday web users and crypto enthusiasts, could be in the billions.Last year, for example, Cloudflare went down and the drop in Bitcoin transactions that resulted was palpable. It’s notable in that case that the Bitcoin network itself was not down. The peer-to-peer consensus-building infrastructure it’s built on was fully intact at all times, but the drop in completed transactions indicates a serious weakness in the system given that so many crypto users depend on centralized storage and exchange options. And many of those services were depending on, in turn, Cloudflare.The above example highlights how, in many cases, the viability of those services boiled down to one single point of failure — utterly contrary to the raison d’être of Bitcoin and blockchains more generally.It’s a problem that has grown far worse during the COVID-19 pandemic, unfortunately, notably because the web has become even more central to our work and personal lives. According to recent data published by ThousandEyes, a network intelligence company, global internet disruptions soared as the pandemic struck last year. Rising rates of usage were cited as a reason behind the outages that increased 63% in March when compared to the pre-pandemic period. By June, there were an estimated 44% more disruptions than that which occurred at the beginning of last year.It’s safe to say that when taking into account that an astounding 25% of all Ethereum workloads in the world run on Amazon Web Services, there should be more than pause for concern. At this moment in time, every single blockchain-based application, whether it’s Bitcoin, Polkadot or Cosmos, is completely powerless without the help of a handful of centralized, internet-based services and infrastructure.This isn’t to convey pessimism or hopelessness, however, because there are solutions to the problem that can be implemented relatively quickly and without radically overhauling what is already in use. One is to leverage the strength of the internet as it currently stands, enhancing the mechanics that underpin it by focusing on the abundance of nodes and redundancies in data that are already built into the system.Think of a node as a conduit for channeling the data you rely on. And with a smarter, more dynamic routing protocol that could easily be layered on top of the existing internet, for example, we can more efficiently route transmissions around the nodes that are blocked or congested and, instead, retrieve data from the nodes through which such data can flow more freely.In addition to this, there’s the issue of resolving underlying security issues. In particular, an examination of the internet’s default routing technology, known as the Border Gateway Protocol, or the BGP, reveals vulnerabilities that are currently being exploited by organized attackers with potentially broad-ranging effects on all forms of internet-based applications. Such attacks are not only increasing in frequency but they also threaten more costly outages and delays.For example, in April 2018, criminal actors exploited weak points in core internet infrastructure to redirect users of an Ethereum wallet developer’s website to a phishing site. This compromised their account credentials and robbed them of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrency. It’s complicated, but during the attack, the internet’s authoritative routing servers were corrupted and told to direct traffic to IP addresses owned by the criminal actors instead of the intended IP destination that would normally have been specified by the BGP.The weakness is rooted in the fact that the BGP was designed when there were far fewer internet users, meaning that its original architects didn’t foresee, understandably so, today’s need to secure the network against so many malicious actors. Thus, this routing protocol is easily manipulated for nefarious ends.Blockchain technology, it should be noted, provides a potentially critical solution to this problem. Though IPs could still be hijacked at the lowest level, a blockchain-powered routing layer would allow enterprises to connect their devices and infrastructures via a private network without publishing their IP addresses — the ones bad actors could use to target their particular services. And within this layer, every connection between devices can be encrypted without using the centralized authorities that have been a key vulnerability in current architectures.Indeed, by more efficiently routing internet data and harnessing the power of blockchain to bolster security, I’m hopeful for new synergies to emerge between the existing web and the nascent decentralized one. It’s only a matter of time, I believe. And when this happens, the sky is the limit for Bitcoin, Ethereum and all the incredible blockchain-based systems being built.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
274,"Notable mainstream attention has shifted toward Bitcoin amid its meteoric rise, with the asset having recently tapped over $52,500 per coin. Bitcoin (BTC) has seen an increasing wave of interest from mainstream companies, gaining status as a hedge, unique from other asset classes. What makes Bitcoin valuable, though? Perhaps one of the simplest answers regarding Bitcoin’s value is that it’s “worth what somebody will pay for it,” as stated by billionaire Mark Cuban in 2019. A number of other components factor into the equation, however, making BTC unique over its competition. Although, Bitcoin is still young when compared to assets such as gold and stocks, so it must continue proving itself and gaining traction. The asset’s failure is still possible and is also prone to volatility.Pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto published the written framework for Bitcoin in 2008. The asset subsequently went into circulation in early 2009, pegged to no specific value. BTC circled around online communities and such through the years, gaining value over time as an online method of payment requiring no involved sensitive user information. Regardless of its historical journey upward in price, Bitcoin is now often seen as a store of value, holding a number of valuable characteristics.People can buy Bitcoin on a crypto exchange and send it to a wallet they personally control on a device or online. One of Bitcoin’s selling points is that users can send the asset virtually anywhere in the world quickly, at any time, without divulging personal information, as well as control their holdings themselves.Over the past year or so, multiple sizable mainstream companies have added significant exposure to BTC. Tesla, one of the 10 largest companies by market cap according to AssetDash, bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, announced on Feb. 8, 2021. In addition to others, Square also announced a $50-million move into BTC in October 2020.Business intelligence outfit MicroStrategy bought over $1 billion of the coin, as led by the company’s CEO, Michael Saylor. A former skeptic, Saylor is now one of the asset’s biggest proponents. He also personally owns more than 17,000 BTC, as of his tweet from October 2020.The recent Bitcoin purchases have seemingly surfaced amid economic unrest after COVID-19 captured the public’s attention in early 2020. The United States government increased the activity of its cash printer in subsequent months after the pandemic’s onset, through quantitative easing, leaving the future value of the country’s dollar a mystery.As a borderless, decentralized asset run by a network of computers around the world (called miners), Bitcoin and its price are not technically tied to any governments, markets or currencies. At times, its price travels in line with other markets, while at other times, the asset’s value moves to the beat of its own drum. Some crypto industry leaders, such as Anthony Pompliano, co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital, posit BTC as a non-correlated asset.Fidelity Digital Assets published a report on Bitcoin in October 2020 that found “almost no relationship between the returns of bitcoin and other assets” between the start of 2015 and September 2020.Since entering the BTC arena, MicroStrategy’s Saylor, who sits in fourth place on Cointelegraph’s list of the top 100 people in blockchain for 2021, has taken numerous interviews in which he has clearly articulated valuable aspects of Bitcoin. Saylor said in a February 2021 interview posted by Cointelegraph:“It’s the first successfully engineered monetary network in the history of the world,” Saylor said after referencing aspects of science and engineering, as well as his studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.“Bitcoin is rotating this year from the old insight narrative which is, it’s an uncorrelated speculative asset traded by retail traders on off-shore exchanges with leverage that’s kind of cool,” Saylor said in a December 2020 interview with HyperChange. “It’s rotating to a new insight, which is it’s the world’s best long-duration investment-grade safe-haven treasury asset,” he added.Saylor continued to mention Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a wealth storage vehicle that sits away from government control, as well as a different mindset that comes with such a use case, leading participants to hold BTC for extended periods of time rather than trading for shorter-term profits.Unlike national dollars, gold or other assets, Bitcoin holds a finite supply. Only 21 million BTC will ever exist, based on the digital asset’s code. At the time of publication, Bitcoin’s circulating supply is around 18.6 million. Through mining, more BTC is released from its maximum supply into its circulating supply, but that maximum supply will not change. Meanwhile, the work and expenses put into creating BTC mark the more tangible point from where Bitcoin derives its value from.With Bitcoin, holders can also store and transfer large sums of money much more easily than other hedge assets, such as gold or real estate. Bitcoin has seen its fair share of comparisons to gold over the years — at times being called digital gold.“You can’t debase it; it’s not a fiat derivative like a bond or a stock,” Saylor said of Bitcoin during a January 2021 interview with Nomad Capitalist. “If you’re looking to the long-term outlook — 10 years, 20 years, 30 years — then owning Bitcoin is like encrypting your monetary energy in a way that will preserve it without any degradation over the long term,” Saylor explained.Investors can purchase fractional parts of a Bitcoin, such as 0.001 BTC, for example. Bitcoin can also be viewed as an industry or ecosystem of activity and development, similar to the internet when it took off decades ago, and buying Bitcoin gives the investor financial exposure to that ecosystem, according to Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, a crypto exchange.“It’s sort of like owning a piece of the race track without having to bet on which horse is going to win,” Winklevoss said during a December 2020 interview with podcaster, YouTuber and entrepreneur Casey Adams. “As long as the races are running, you make some money,” Winklevoss added.Some have expressed numerous arguments against Bitcoin over the past decade or so. The digital asset has endured multiple volatile cycles, rising dramatically in price followed by subsequent retracement periods — sometimes seeing up to 80% or more of price decline over time before resuming its uptrend.Gold advocate and financial commentator Peter Schiff has stated his skeptical position on Bitcoin on numerous occasions. “Now that #Bitcoin has hit $50,000 I must admit that a move up to $100,000 can’t be ruled out,” Schiff said in a February 2021 Tweet, adding:Others have also called Bitcoin a bubble, such as Russian politician Anatoly Aksakov in early 2021. Additionally, Kenneth Rogoff, a professor at Harvard University, proved hesitant on BTC in January 2021. “I’ve been a Bitcoin skeptic, and certainly, the price has gone up, but there’s sort of an ultimate question of what’s the use,” Rogoff told Bloomberg. “Is it just valuable because people think it’s valuable? That is a bubble that would blow up,” he added.Still, even though Bitcoin is not technically “backed” by anything, it is also not tied to the debt or struggle of any specific country. It is run by the people, is borderless, and allows users to hold and control their own funds, as well as transact globally quickly. The asset has endured its fair share of adversities since its inception, growing in adoption with every cycle."
275,"As Bitcoin (BTC) price pushed above $55,300 in the morning trading session, its market cap surpassed $1 trillion for the first time on Feb. 19. The breakout continued throughout the day and within the past hour BTC price hit another all-time high at $56,368. Now that Bitcoin has cemented its status as a trillion-dollar asset among the likes of Amazon, Apple and Google, legacy banks are showing increasing interest in offering cryptocurrency custody services for their customers.According to Treyce Dahlem, an analyst at TheTIE, social media conversations including ‘Bitcoin’ as a keyword have increased by 38% since Feb. 18. More than 102,000 tweets have been sent out in the past 24-hours, and this is only “30,000 tweets shy of setting a new record high.”Dahlem said:Multiple altcoins joined BTC and Ether (ETH) in establishing new all-time highs as both centralized and decentralized exchange tokens experienced strong breakouts.Binance Coin (BNB) continued to benefit from the growing influence of the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) as surging volume lifted the token to a new high of $348.72.This parabolic rally secured BNB’s spot as the third-ranked project by market capitalization behind Bitcoin and Ether.DeFi-related projects like PancakeSwap (CAKE) and Venus (VXS) are two of the top attractions on the BSC and both hit new highs at $20.62 and $101.50 respectively. REN also made waves after its recent integration with BSC helped lift the token to a record high at $1.69.Following a week of new highs for the major indices, traditional markets closed the week mixed on Friday as the U.S. economy faces continued fallout from the pandemic and rising unemployment.The NASDAQ finished the day up 0.07% while the Dow was flat. The S&P 500 declined by 0.19%.As traditional markets close up for the week, the bullish momentum propelling Bitcoin and altcoins high is showing no signs of slowing down. Recent historical data shows that Bitcoin’s rallies in 2021 have a tendency to occur on the weeked and many analysts believe the top-ranked digital asset could attack the $60,000 level over the weekend.The round the clock nature of the crypto sector means that markets are always active somewhere on the planet. As the current bull market attracts wider attention from retail and institutional investors, the trend of trading volume decreasing on weekends seems to no longer be in effect.While Ether (ETH) price has remained pinned below $2,000, it still managed to rally to a new all-time high at $1,974.There are increasing bullish murmurs that institutional investors are deeply interested in the returns being offered through staking on Eth2 as well as participating in the growing DeFi sector, both of which are the driving force behind the growing demand for Ether.Recent price breakouts from top tokens like Bitcoin and Binance Coin and DeFi superstars like REN and CAKE have also helped lift the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency sector to a new record $1.705 trillion. Bitcoin’s dominance currently stands at 61.1%"
276,"At approximately $1 trillion, Bitcoin’s market cap has blown past Tencent, which holds a valuation of roughly $917.8 billion at time of publication, according to AssetDash rankings. Crypto’s largest digital asset is now sixth on AssetDash’s list of top market cap companies across the globe. Google, officially known by its parent entity, Alphabet (GOOGL), holds the fifth spot with a market cap of approximately $1.4 trillion at the time of publication.“After reaching a new all-time high price mark, Bitcoin surpassed Chinese tech giant Tencent, moving it up to the #6 spot in the world among publicly traded companies,” CoinSmart co-founder and CEO, Justin Hartzman, told Cointelegraph, adding:In October, Bitcoin surpassed PayPal, taking the 21st position on the leaderboard with a market cap just shy of $240 billion. The coin has grown substantially since then. Bitcoin has broken past Tencent in market cap rank before, although market caps have changed since then. At the time of publication, BTC ranks above Tencent, Tesla and Facebook. Crypto’s pioneering asset has enjoyed a significant rally since falling to $3,600 in March 2020 during a pandemic-related crash. The coin’s run picked up speed in the latter half of 2020, during which a number of mainstream financial entities announced their Bitcoin purchases. One of the more notable entrants has been MicroStrategy, whose CEO, Michael Saylor, has advocated significantly for Bitcoin."
277,"By now it probably hasn’t escaped your attention that earlier this week the original (and many would argue, still the best) cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, broke through the $50,000 price point for the first time in its history.Whether you are a newcomer to the party or fondly remember mining Bitcoin (BTC) with a GPU rig a decade ago, it can’t help but feel like a pretty momentous occasion. It is the culmination of all of the support, belief, and of course money, that each of you has invested into Bitcoin.To commemorate this, we got our talented artists to put together a piece of art celebrating you, the Bitcoin community, propelling BTC past this significant price point.This has been minted into a strictly limited edition of 50 nonfungible tokens, which are available through our Rarible profile. The price of each NFT will be $1,000 (or to be more precise 0.5 ETH), valuing the entire collection at an entirely appropriate $50,000 at launch.Of course, Bitcoin doesn’t end its journey here. Ultimately, the price of BTC is less important than its power to transform the world of traditional finance. And although in its decade-plus existence it has certainly shaken up the incumbent financial markets, the road to fulfilling its full potential still lies ahead.But nobody would begrudge us taking a quick breather at this point; giving ourselves a little slap on the back in the knowledge that “we were there” when Bitcoin reached this point in its journey.And for 50 of you, there is the chance to commemorate this by owning our NFT. Wear it like a badge of honour for all of the work we have collectively put in so far.Here’s to all of you and the start of Bitcoin’s next chapter."
278,"After a 160% increase over the past 3 months, the open interest on Bitcoin (BTC) options reached a new record-high at $12 billion. While this number might seem unusually high, it makes sense that the figure would increase as Bitcoin’s market capitalization surpassed $1 trillion. Although Friday's $3.2 billion expiry could negatively impact the market, these options are split among calls (neutral-to-bullish) and the more bearish put options.As shown in the chart above, Deribit exchange leads the market by holding an 85% market share. For the Feb. 26 expiry, 58,500 BTC contracts remain open and this is equivalent to $3.2 billion.Before jumping to conclusions on whether the outcome might be bullish or bearish, it's essential to take a more detailed view of the potential buy and sell pressure nearing expiry.Paying for a $38,000 put (sell) option might have made sense three weeks ago, but this trade is now worthless. Therefore, to correctly assess the impact of the upcoming expiry, those should be excluded.On the opposite side from these worthless put options below $40,000 are some ultra-bullish calls up to $88,000. Considering there's less than a week left before the expiry, a 63% BTC price increase seems unlikely.As shown above chart, the neutral-to-bearish put options are vastly concentrated between $18,000 and $40,000. Currently, over 80% of the Feb. 26 put options fall under that range, so they should not be considered for the potential price pressure.The remaining 4,550 BTC put option contracts, currently worth $245 million, present incentives to keep BTC below $52,000.The more bullish call options ranging from $36,000 to $56,000 amount to 17,670 BTC contracts, which is equivalent to $955 million in open interest. Therefore, the most relevant options open interest for Feb. 26 stands at $1.2 billion while holding a 0.20 put-to-call ratio.For bears wishing to roll over the position to March 26, the $44,000 put option is currently trading at $1,970 per contract. That would require a 16% downside from the current $54,000 BTC price to generate some profit.At this moment, bulls are in total control of Friday's expiry, especially considering the heavy imbalance favoring the buy-side. As for the bears' potential roll-over activity, the risk-reward seems unattractive.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

279,"Bitcoin (BTC) price finally reached a $1 trillion market capitalization on Feb.19, which is an important milestone because as BTC gains size, the digital asset will continue to attract new institutional investors who will consider allocating a portion to their portfolios.Glassnode data suggests that high-net-worth individuals are continuing to pump money into Bitcoin. The number of Bitcoin addresses holding more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin has risen to 94,000.According to data from Whalemap, another positive sign is that the number of addresses holding between 1,000 to 10,000 BTC has been increasing throughout the current bull run, whereas in the previous bull phase this figure declined.Ballet crypto wallet CEO and founder Bobby Lee believes the crypto bull market could continue and Bitcoin may “hit $200,000-$250,000 this year.” Lee also expects Bitcoin’s price to reach $500,000 and its market cap to rise above that of gold by 2028.However, everyone is not bullish on Bitcoin. JPMorgan Chase analysts believe that Bitcoin is trading at much higher valuations than its fair value and is behaving like a cyclical asset. They also termed crypto assets as “the poorest hedge for major drawdowns in equities.”As the crypto bull run continues, let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot the critical levels on the upside.Bitcoin broke above the $52,599 resistance today and resumed its uptrend. The bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the ascending channel. If they manage to do that, the momentum could pick up and a rally to $60,974.43 is possible.The upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought zone indicate that bulls are in control.However, if the price turns down from the resistance line of the channel, the BTC/USD pair may drop to the midpoint of the channel where the bulls are likely to provide support. If this level holds, the pair could continue its upward journey towards the target objective.The first sign of weakness will be a drop below the midpoint of the channel. That could drag the price to the support line of the channel. A break below this support will signal a possible trend reversal.Ether (ETH) resumed its uptrend by breaking above the $1,869.473 resistance on Feb. 18. The biggest altcoin is gradually marching towards the psychological level at $2,000 where the bears may again try to stall the rally.However, if the bulls can propel the price above the resistance line of the ascending channel, the momentum could pick up and the ETH/USD pair may rally to $2,515. The rising moving averages and the RSI in the overbought territory signal that bulls are in command.This assumption will be negated if the price turns down from the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day exponential moving average ($1,714). Such a move will suggest that traders are booking profits at higher levels. The trend could turn negative if the bears sink the price below the support line of the channel.Binance Coin (BNB) is witnessing a vertical rally, after having risen sharply in the past few days. The RSI has risen above 94, which suggests the up-move is extremely overbought in the short-term.When traders fear missing a rally, they continue to buy at every higher level. Usually, such a rally ends with a blow-off top after the last bull has purchased. When the price starts to turn down, the momentum traders are the first to jump off the ship and that deepens the correction.The long wick on today’s candlestick suggests traders are booking profits at higher levels. If the price dips below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $260.5707, it will suggest the bulls are not buying the dips anymore. That could pull the price down to the 61.8% retracement level at $206.1262.A break below this support could lead to panic selling from short-term traders. The pair may then complete a 100% retracement of the entire rally, resulting in a drop to $118. Conversely, if the bulls push the price above $348.6969, a move to $400 is possible.The bears defended the resistance line of the ascending channel on Feb. 17 and Feb. 18 and they tried to pull the price down today. However, Polkadot (DOT) reversed the direction sharply from $29.50 and has currently risen above the channel.If the buyers can sustain the price above the channel, the momentum could pick up and the altcoin may rally to $42.If the bulls fail to sustain the price above the channel, the DOT/USD pair may re-enter the channel. If the bears can sink the price below $29.50, the pair may drop to the 20-day EMA ($25) and then to the support line of the channel.If the price bounces off this support, it will suggest the uptrend remains intact, but a dip below the channel will signal a change in trend.Cardano (ADA) is gradually moving towards the resistance at $0.9817712. The rising moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest the possibility of a break above the overhead resistance is high.If the bulls can thrust the price above the $0.9817712 to the $1 resistance zone, the ADA/USD pair could start the next leg of the uptrend. The target objective on the upside is $1.25 and then $1.50.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the pair may drop to $0.8082031 and remain range-bound between these two levels.The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA ($0.74) and the trend will tilt in favor of the bears if the pair plummets below $0.6879684.XRP has bounced off the 20-day EMA ($0.49) and the bulls are currently attempting to push the price to $0.65 where the bears may mount a stiff resistance. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the altcoin may consolidate between $0.50 and $0.65 for a few days.If the price breaks below $0.50, it will suggest that bulls are not buying the dips anymore. That could pull the price down to the next support at $0.38550.However, the upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI above 61 suggest that the bulls currently have the upper hand. If the buyers can drive the price above $0.65, the XRP/USD pair may start the next leg of the uptrend, which could reach $0.78068.Litecoin (LTC) remains in an uptrend as it continues to make new 52-week highs. The bears tried to stall the up-move on Feb. 18 but they have not been able to sustain the price below $230.5305, which suggests the bulls are buying on dips.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought zone, indicating advantage to the bulls. If the buyers can drive the price above $238.8071, the LTC/USD pair may rise to $256 and then $272.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and slumps below $220, it will suggest profit-booking by short-term traders. That could pull the price down to the 20-day EMA ($191). The trend will favor the bears if the pair drops and sustains below $185.5821.The bears could not sustain Chainlink (LINK) below the midpoint of the ascending channel on Feb. 17, which suggests that bulls are buying the dips and attempting to resume the uptrend today.If the buyers can propel the price above $35.6945 and the resistance line of the ascending channel, the LINK/USD pair could pick up momentum and rally to $46. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory favor the bulls.However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They have successfully defended the resistance line of the channel on two previous occasions, hence they will again try to reverse the direction at the resistance line.If they succeed, the LINK/USD pair could drop to the support line of the channel. A strong bounce off this support will keep the uptrend intact, but a break below the channel will signal a possible change in trend.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been range-bound between $670 and $745.39 for the past few days. If the price consolidates after a strong rally, it suggests that traders are not booking profits as they expect the uptrend to resume.If the buyers can propel the price above the $745.39 to $773.32 overhead resistance zone, the BCH/USD pair may start the next leg of the uptrend and soar to $900. The rising 20-day EMA ($589) and the RSI in the overbought zone indicate the possibility of an upside breakout.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below $670, the BCH/USD pair may start a deeper correction to the 20-day EMA ($589). A break below this support will indicate that bears have the upper hand.Stellar Lumens (XLM) has been trading close to the $0.50 resistance for the past four days, which shows a tussle between the bulls and the bears to establish supremacy. If the bulls overpower the bears and sustain the price above $0.517, a move to $0.600681 is possible.The bears may again mount a stiff resistance at $0.600681, but if the bulls can push the price above it, the XLM/USD pair could rally to $0.796804. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.On the other hand, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the XLM/USD pair could drop to $0.50 and remain range-bound between these two levels for a few days. A break below the 20-day EMA ($0.43) will signal that bears are back in the game.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

280,"While the original Bitcoin rallies past a $1 trillion dollar marketcap, two forks of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency have instead lost a source of liquidity as crypto exchange OKCoin delists BSV and BCH. In a blog post today, OKCoin CEO Hong Fang explained the decision to delist as one focused on protecting investors from a “malicious misinformation war.”Fang noted that the exhcange regularly reviews listed assets across a variety of metrics, “including ecosystem development and ethos” as well as “ethical or reputational red flags,” and that the two forks were removed following the most recent review. Given the “unique history and context,” however, the Fang writes that the company felt compelled to explain their decision.“When the news hit that Craig Wright — the infamous self-proclaimed creator of Bitcoin and BSV supporter — was taking actions to enforce copyright claims on the Bitcoin white paper, we found ourselves facing a very uncomfortable dilemma,” the post read.While Fang specified that the company believes “Bitcoin is an open software,” and both disagreements between individuals and hard forks are permitted in an open software context, ultimately “we are just having a hard time ignoring the malicious misinformation war waged by Craig Wright and other high-profile members of [the BCH and BSV] communities.”According to Coingecko, OKCoin is incorporated in the United States and trades $50 million daily, with BTC/USD accounting for 70% of that volume. Leading up to the announcement, BSV only accounted for $30,000 in volume and BCH $150,000, per Coingecko, both in the lower range of the 32 assets OKCoin offers. BCH has had an up-and-down year leading into the delisting. Earlier in the month, Dogecoin’s wild price surge pushed BCH out of the list of top-10 assets by marketcap, though in December of last year entrepreneur Kim Dotcom threw his weight behind the Bitcoin fork, calling a $3,000 price target per coin. BCH is up 70% on the year to $714.BSV has had a rougher year by comparison, trading down 21% to $241. The coin has had some positive press recently, however: following an appearance by Jimmy Nguyen on Fox Business, some have speculated that the network booked the BSV advocate by mistake when trying to bring in an expert on the original Bitcoin."
281,"Reports that legacy banks like BNY Mellon and Deutsche Bank are becoming active in the cryptocurrency space, including through custody services, should come as welcome news for crypto investors.Lost or misplaced private keys, after all, are a bane of the crypto world — just recall the Welshman who lost 7,500 Bitcoin (BTC), worth about $400 million today, when he landfilled his PC’s hard drive, forgetting it was the sole repository of his private key. Meanwhile, traditional banks are society’s safekeepers par excellence, so maybe they can improve the crypto user experience with regard to private keys at the very least.But if major financial institutions are indeed getting involved with cryptocurrencies — and not just in the custody area, as investment bank Morgan Stanley signaled on Feb. 13 a future investment in Bitcoin — why now? Is it just the soaring price of Bitcoin? Or has the evolving blockchain/cryptocurrency industry reached a new level where it’s acceptable even to habitually cautious depository institutions?It appears to be a confluence of factors. In the summer of 2020, the United States Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued an interpretive letter permitting banks to secure their clients’ digital assets, “including holding unique cryptographic keys associated with cryptocurrency.” This led to “a dramatic increase in demand and direct inquiries from banks,” Pete Najarian, chief revenue officer at BitGo — a cryptocurrency custodian — told Cointelegraph.Meanwhile, the recent surge in crypto markets has attracted more traditional big-time investors who expect institutional-grade security for their digital assets. “There is real demand from end users and that is absolutely driving the legacy infrastructure toward participation in these markets,” added Najarian.The current interest from banks has three main drivers, said Nigel Green, founder and CEO of deVere Group, an independent financial advisory organization. He told Cointelegraph: “The first is to meet demand from their institutional clients; the second is that it is becoming increasingly apparent that cryptocurrencies are the future of money; and third, is the Fear Of Missing Out or being left behind.”Tobias Tenner, associate director and head of digitalization at the Association of German Banks, told Cointelegraph that the skyrocketing price of Bitcoin has captured German banks’ interest, as has a new regulatory framework implemented in January 2020 that cleared the way for banks to act as crypto custodians. “Banks could [soon] offer custody, trading and probably advisory services,” he said.But are traditional banks really ready for the cryptoverse? Can they deal with its volatility, hackers and evolving technology? Pablo Agnese, lecturer in the department of economy and business organization at UIC Barcelona, told Cointelegraph: “I think they [the banks] are learning and trying to find their role in this ‘brave new world.’ History however proves that the traditional banking sector is not precisely one prone to substantial technological breakthroughs.”Bryan Routledge, associate professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University, told Cointelegraph that crypto custody is not that different from what legacy banks are doing now and have been doing for years. Storing a public and private key pair is important, “but it’s not that difficult,” or shouldn’t be for most banks.Legacy institutions would also have their business reputations at stake should they enter the crypto arena, which might bring comfort to new users who might otherwise be wary about dipping a toe into the crypto waters. Can banks manage the challenge? “Absolutely,” Perianne Boring, founder and president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, told Cointelegraph, adding:If so, could this come at the expense of crypto-focused firms like BitGo or crypto exchanges like Gemini that also provide custody services? “We believe there is room for both traditional financial services companies, as well as crypto native companies,” answered BitGo’s Najarian, who sees new opportunities for collaboration with traditional banks.Large institutions recognize that crypto custody is a “complex and highly-specialized” endeavor that “revolves around securing a private cryptographic key required to sign transactions,” and many will choose to engage specialty firms like BitGo as subcustodians while wrapping the custody service in the bank’s brand, a process sometimes referred to as “white labeling.”What about the time frame — could legacy banks, or at least some of them, become major players in cryptocurrency custody, trading and/or asset management over the next year or two? “Yes,” according to Boring:“I think it is almost inevitable that global banks become major players in the crypto ecosystem as digital currencies become ever-more dominant in the wider global financial system,” said Green. “In an increasingly digitized, tech-driven world, large banks will have no choice but to support digital, borderless currencies. They will need to adapt to survive.”Tenner told Cointelegraph that global banks could be a big player in the business, provided they embrace euro-denominated crypto tokens — i.e., a “programmable Euro” — in accordance with the Association of German Banks’ 2020 position paper, though “It’s premature to foresee how strong a role banks could play.” For now, the crypto-asset business remains a niche product in bankers’ eyes, Tenner added.Clearly, not all banks are ready to charge in. When asked in a 2020 survey by the Royal United Services Institute and the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists if they consider the use of cryptocurrency as a risk or opportunity, only 19% of financial institutions said that they viewed crypto as an opportunity.By comparison, more than three-quarters (80%) of cryptocurrency industry respondents viewed crypto as an opportunity. When asked about specific cryptocurrency risks, the financial institutions identified money laundering as the most prominent risk (cited by 88% of respondents), followed closely by the “use of cryptocurrency on the dark web” (87%) and the “use of cryptocurrency for procurement of illicit goods and services outside the formal financial system” (87%).Najarian, for one, deems these worries about crime and illicit goods as somewhat overdone. “We do not believe there is greater criminal risk in holding crypto vs. other assets. Statistics have shown that the volume of illicit or suspicious activity involving crypto is much smaller than that of traditional finance.”With respect to the study, Kayla Izenman, research analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, told Cointelegraph: “It’s worth remembering that financial institutions are likely to view crypto as a risk in terms of compliance, but equally will see the opportunities from an investment perspective.”She went on to add that the survey also asked financial institutions about crypto “use cases,” both present and future, and “They ranked investment as the top use case in both answers, but indicated day-to-day payments would be more prevalent than illicit purposes in the future. So perhaps the future is closer than we thought.”When asked if traditional banks really understand the criminal risks in holding crypto, Izenman answered: “They’re likely to be much more cautious at the start of their crypto journey than virtual asset service providers originally were.” Her sense is that banks are well aware of the potential pitfalls: “In fact, the reason it took this long in the first place to get here is because they do know what they’re getting into, and are worried about it.”Meanwhile, some of the world’s prominent legacy banks still appear to be sitting on the fence. JPMorgan Chase, for example, will get into Bitcoin “at some point,” co-president Daniel Pinto said recently, adding that current crypto demand on the part of customers “isn’t there yet.”Agnese told Cointelegraph: “I keep thinking that banks and cryptos are NOT compatible as the latter implies complete decentralization of ‘banking,’ and traditional banking is anything but decentralized.” Moreover, traditional banking is a historically protected sector that has always fought to maintain its privileges — though, “sooner or later banks will have to recycle themselves and offer something of value. Crypto custody might as well be the alternative” because it’s like what banks used to do with gold and other assets.Routledge said that it isn’t really that surprising that some big banks are beginning to invest significant money into the crypto space. The mere fact that Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, is worth anything “more than zero” after 12 years in existence — i.e., that it has survived — is a “remarkable” development. It shows that decentralized finance is working, and banks now want to be part of it, he told Cointelegraph.In sum, “We are at a critical tipping point now,” Boring informed Cointelegraph, “with more and more diversified financial service offerings being launched by digital asset companies, including crypto retirement plans, lending services, high yield savings plans and custody services.” She went on to say further:"
282,"Within the last hour, Bitcoin's market capitalization pushed above the $1 trillion level. This milestone occurred less than a year after its market cap dipped below $100 billion on Black Thursday and the move to a new all-time high took place right as BTC price is on the verge of overtaking $55,000.The significance of this event will not be lost of those working in financial as only a handful of assets ever achieve this status. While Bitcoin may have started as a mere curiosity in 2009, it only took it 12 years to become a global asset with a $1 trillion market capitalization.For those unfamiliar with Bitcoin's unique price history, 10,000 BTC were auctioned at the Bitcointalk.org forum in March 2010 for $50, but no buyer was found.Two months later, Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC, and the rest is history. Thus, during its first sixteen months of existence, Bitcoin was something between a collectible with no monetary value and an experiment among enthusiasts.According to 8marketcap, besides Bitcoin, there are only seven tradable assets with a market capitalization surpassing $1 trillion. Naturally, gold and silver are on this list as they are synonyms of money and have served as a store of value for over 4,000 years.Although extinct from coinage and reserve requirements to back fiat currency, gold remains widely used by central banks, mutual funds, and retail investors. While precious metals have the advantage of having a relatively constant supply, many company's abilities to generate profits are evolving.Amazon, for example, was founded in July 1994 as an online marketplace for books. Today, the giant conglomerate profits from cloud computing, digital streaming, film and television productions, gadgets, supermarkets, e-commerce and artificial intelligence.In June 1996, Amazon raised $8 million in seed money from Kleiner Perkins and in that same year the company had lost $5.8 million even though its fourth-quarter revenue doubled from the previous one. Amazon's IPO in May 1997 had an initial $12-to-$14 pricing range but settling at $18, which valued the company at $438 million.It took Amazon 27 years to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization took 27 years. Meanwhile, Microsoft, which was founded in April 1975, crossed the $1 trillion milestone 45 years later (June 2019). Google launched in September 1998, and 22 years later (January 2020) the company crossed the $1 trillion mark.Gold's market capitalization crossed $1 trillion in 1972 according to inflation-adjusted numbers. That price would be equivalent to $450 per ounce, breaking a downtrend that was initiated in 1939 by World War II.Before speculating on whether BTC will overtake gold's market cap and its status as a global store of value, it's important to consider that valuing a multi-faceted technology asset such as Bitcoin is a rather unfair comparison with traditional investments.BTC is a digital store of value that simultaneously functions as a peer-to-peer payment network. Moreover, its censorship-resistant characteristics can't be mimicked by third-party dependent assets.Lastly, unlike gold, Bitcoin is a protocol and a programmable shared database. If somehow quantum computing becomes capable of breaking SHA-256 cryptography, the network can auto-arrange a solution, even if it is a temporary one.In August 2010, 92 billion BTC were mined after an overflow error was exploited. The solution involved the entire network agreeing on a rollover, which proved that the ultimate security consensus lies in its user base.How would gold enthusiasts react if asteroid mining becomes a reality? What if an extremely 'authentic' and expensive fake gold supply entered the market, causing mass testing to become a necessity for every trade? These are issues Bitcoin investors will never have to worry about.Moreover, companies run risks of frauds, sizable follow-on offers, liabilities, and potential regulatory changes. Meanwhile, decentralized protocols are virtually free of those perils, thus justifying a much higher valuation in Bitcoin's case.Bitcoin's path to becoming a multi-trillion dollar asset seems to have a much easier route than gold, silver, or tech stocks. For example, the world's real estate market is estimated to be worth north $280 trillion, according to data from Visual Capitalist.How much of the real estate and debt (bonds) market could shift to Bitcoin remains an open question.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

283,"Bitcoin has rallied into new all-time highs above $53,700, pushing its market cap above $1 trillion for the first time.Bitcoin’s late 2020 rally appeared to be sparked by an unprecedented wave of demand from institutions and billionaires, with the trend set after the world’s largest publicly traded business intelligence company, MicroStrategy, revealed it had converted $250 million of its treasury into BTC on Aug. 11.By the end of January 2021, MicroStrategy had invested $1.095 billion to accumulate 71,079 BTC or 0.38% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply. In early February, the firm hosted a free webinar providing strategies for incorporating Bitcoin into corporate treasury reserves and MicroStrategy is currently in the process of raising a further $900M to buy more BTC.Institutional asset manager, Grayscale also aggressively ramped up its Bitcoin accumulation during 2020, with its Bitcoin Trust reporting an 872% increase in assets under management from $1.8 billion at the start of the year to $17.5 billion at the start of January. To date, Grayscale has purchased Bitcoin at a rate that is faster than new BTC supply being created.On Feb. 8, news that Tesla CEO Elon Musk had invested $1.5 billion or 7.7% of the electric vehicle maker’s treasury into BTC sent the Bitcoin price soaring to new all-time highs above $43,000.And the bullish institutional news just keeps coming, with rumors suggesting Twitter may become the next major firm to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet, and mega banks like BNY Mellon and Deutsche Bank announcing moves to introduce BTC custody services. Major funds like BlackRock, and Morgan Stanley are considering whether an investment into Bitcoin is warranted.The $1 trillion milestone follows 12 months of extreme volatility for Bitcoin, with BTC’s capitalization increasing by more than 10 times since the depths of the “Black Thursday” crash in March 2020.Amid the increasing threat of the coronavirus pandemic, former U.S. president Donald Trump introduced a travel ban from Europe to the United States on March 11, with many nations across the world entering into total lockdowns.The rising panic caused chaos in the cryptocurrency and legacy financial markets as the price of Bitcoin crashed more than 50% on March 11 to less than $4,000 by March 13 — triggering wholesale liquidations across leveraged exchanges. On March 13, Bitcoin’s market cap was sitting below $100 billion for the first time since May 2019.Despite the carnage, opportunistic buyers steadily pushed prices back up while accumulating in anticipation of Bitcoin’s third block reward halving in May 2020. BTC briefly reclaimed $10,000 during May after it was revealed that renowned billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones had invested in BTC as a hedge against inflation.While 2020’s third-quarter DeFi bull market and the excitement for Ethereum’s Eth.2 overhaul would steal the spotlight away from BTC, many of the profits gleaned from the DeFi boom appeared quickly to make their way into Bitcoin — with BTC rocketing past $12,000 at the end of October. It tested its record highs from 2017 towards the end of November after PayPal launched crypto trading services in the United States.Due to its increased supply since 2017,  Bitcoin posted a new record market cap on Nov. 18, with the capitalization of BTC pushing above $326.5B for the first time its price rallied past $18,000.Bitcoin’s market cap has since more than tripled in roughly three months, with BTC’s December push into new all-time price highs driving the rally into high gear.It took Bitcoin just 12 years to grow from an obscure academic whitepaper to a $1 trillion dollar decentralized network, becoming the eighth tradable asset to currently boast a thirteen-figure market cap. By contrast, it took Microsoft 45 years for its capitalization to exceed $1 trillion. Amazon took 27 years and Google achieved the $1 trillion mark in just 22 years.Now the question is, how long will it take before Bitcoin approaches the market cap of gold?"
284,"The start of February has brought yet another batch of evidence supporting the notion that the ongoing surge of crypto prices has deep institutional roots. Ignited by market whisperer Elon Musk and his Tesla’s announcement of a $1.5-billion Bitcoin position, the bullish cycle was reinforced by further news coming from the likes of Mastercard, Amazon and BNY Mellon. The level of interest around the industry is certainly rising, as Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is rapidly becoming a widely discussed topic on most finance-oriented TV stations. With large corporate players at the helm of the rally, is the public firmly in the back seat, or does it have a say in how long the party will last?The power of corporate players to move crypto markets comes from two interrelated sources: their own capital invested in digital assets and the capacity to lead public sentiment, often by their own example.Some companies wield greater social clout than others due to factors such as founders’ personal charisma or the brand’s public visibility. In Tesla’s case, these two have come together, resulting in the explosive effect we observed last week.According to Nisa Amoils, partner at tech-focused rolling fund A100x, the fact that Tesla’s move was so consequential for the digital asset markets is no coincidence. Amoils told Cointelegraph that “Tesla and Bitcoin have more in common than meets the eye, and it’s not only volatility,” adding further:Amoils anticipated more corporate copycats emerging in the short term, along with continued price movement. In the long term, in her opinion, the recent parade of institutional validation will contribute to solidifying Bitcoin’s status not as just an investment tool but as a medium of exchange as well: “A unique asset with multiple functions.”Speaking to both “retail and institutional” appears to be central here. Tesla’s move has been so impactful because of the automaker’s unique position as both a high-cap tech firm and a popular brand with a significant social following. This is a reminder that institutional forces can elicit the largest effects in today’s financial markets when they sweep the crowd along.Main street investors are not just a bunch of movie extras silently watching as financial institutions and big corporations inflate asset prices as they will. For one, potential retail investors in the United States alone are sitting on a pot of money roughly equal to the entire crypto market’s capitalization, and that money is waiting to be deployed.Pat LaVecchia, CEO and co-chairman of digital securities marketplace Oasis Pro Markets, commented to Cointelegraph that the combination of disposable savings and the fear of missing out on the price move could instigate more people to enter the industry:Taking this line of reasoning even further, a direct consequence of the current institutionally driven rally, or the next one, could be the influx of new individual investors on a large scale. Sooner or later, many iterations of this process should result in digital assets reaching the holy grail of mass adoption.Following public sentiment around crypto is, therefore, no less integral than tracking institutions’ moves. So far, things have been looking good on this front. Joshua Frank, co-founder and CEO of crypto data provider The Tie, told Cointelegraph that Twitter activity on Bitcoin has surged to an all-time high in the wake of the Tesla news.Furthermore, Bitcoin’s daily sentiment score, which measures how positive or negative conversations on a subject have been over the last 24 hours compared to a rolling 20-day average, reached a yearly high. These metrics show that in the short term, Twitter users’ mood has been extremely bullish.Metrics of long-term sentiment looked promising as well. Frank went on to add that Bitcoin’s long-term sentiment score, which measures how positive investors have been on the asset over the last 50 days compared to the past 200, jumped markedly, reaching the value of 75 out of 100. Frank explained to Cointelegraph:If Tesla’s example will indeed inspire a stampede of big corporate followers, the future of money might come even sooner than expected. On the other hand, the crypto market may still be too volatile and unpredictable for some of the legacy firms to enter. As such, it could be the case of a gradual entrance rather than a one-day revolution."
285,"BCB Group, a global digital financial services firm, is planning to help corporations navigate cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) by launching a dedicated service.According to a Feb. 19 announcement, BCB Group has launched BCB Treasury, a new service designed for corporate treasury departments seeking to get involved in Bitcoin à la Tesla. The new service aims to provide a specific solution enabling access to treasury management for companies willing to invest their capital into Bitcoin and other digital assets. With BCB Treasury, executives can enter, hold, manage, and report on a Bitcoin-focused treasury strategy, the announcement states.BCB Group founder and CEO Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie said that the launch of BCB Treasury comes in response to growing demand triggered by the recent Bitcoin moves of companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla. The exec said that lots of companies are looking to invest in crypto to hedge against weak fiat currencies:Last year, BCB Group’s core business BCB Payments received regulatory approval from the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority.Headquartered in London, BCB Group is a major European crypto payment services provider, serving some of the world’s largest crypto companies like Coinbase, Gemini, Galaxy Digital, Bitstamp and Kraken. In early February, the firm appointed former Coinbase UK CEO Zeeshan Feroz as an advisor."
286,"Analysts at American investment bank JPMorgan Chase have delivered another skeptical statement on Bitcoin (BTC), arguing that its current price is much higher than its fair value.In a regular memo for investors, JPMorgan argued that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are an “economic side show” and the poorest hedge against a decline in equity prices, Reuters reports Friday.The analysts said that the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin increases its correlation with cyclical assets, which makes it a less attractive asset for portfolio diversification:In January 2021, JPMorgan strategists John Normand and Federico Manicardi argued that Bitcoin has been becoming a cyclical asset, opposed to a hedge against market stress.A cyclical asset refers to stocks that follow a trend depending on a certain business cycle. For example, companies in discretionary industries like restaurants, hospitality, airlines, furniture, automotive and others. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the question of whether Bitcoin is a cyclical or non-cyclical asset is still debatable, with many industry players strongly believing that the cryptocurrency is a great hedge against a market crisis.The latest comments from JPMorgan come shortly after the company’s co-president Daniel Pinto said that the bank would eventually have to get involved in Bitcoin following growing client demand. In October 2020, when Bitcoin was trading around $13,000, JPMorgan predicted that Bitcoin's price would double or triple in the long term.At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $52,764, up more than 70% over the past 30 days. After breaking the $50,000 price level on Feb. 16, Bitcoin briefly hit a new all-time high of above $53,000 earlier today, according to data from crypto monitoring website CoinGecko."
287,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has alleged that Ripple Labs executives Bradley Garlinghouse and Christian Larsen manipulated the XRP price by ramping up or slowing down their coin sales depending upon market conditions.In an amended complaint filed Feb. 18, the plaintiff — the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission —reiterated its stance that Ripple Labs, Christian Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse violated securities laws with the sale of XRP coins starting in 2013:The complaint claims that Ripple received legal advice as early as 2012 that its coin could represent a security offering and it chose to ignore it. From a financial perspective, the complaint notes, the strategy worked, with Ripple going on to raise “at least $1.38 billion” in the following years.The filing alleges that Larsen and Garlinghouse then profited to the tune of $600 million from their unregistered sales of XRP. The SEC notes that these sales took place while Garlinghouse repeatedly affirmed that he was “very long” on XRP — suggesting investors were being misled as Garlinghouse and Larsen cashed out:The complaint describes an instance in 2015 where one of Ripple’s market makers, whom it also paid in XRP, temporarily halted the sale of Garlinghouse and Larsen’s XRP holdings because the coin price was already falling.According to the filing, Larsen directed the market maker to “keep [sales] paused for now ” and “[w]ait until [the] market had recovered from this mistake.”A similar incident from 2016 described how the defendants were forced to adjust their net sales targets in the hope that they could “stabilize and/or increase” a struggling XRP coin price. Larsen and Garlinghouse agreed to reduce the rate of their XRP sales, but with Garlinghouse adding that he was “marginally inclined to be more aggressive when we do this.""The SEC notes that the “information asymmetry” created by the defendants still exists, allowing them to continue selling off XRP at a “substantial risk to investors.”General counsel at Ripple Stuart Alderoty said he was disappointed by the SEC’s late attempt to bring action against Ripple Labs after years of inaction. On Feb. 18, Alderoty said the latest amended complaint raised nothing new, reiterating that only one legal question remains to be settled. Alderoty tweeted:In 2020, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Chris Giancarlo argued that XRP should not be deemed a security offering, arguing that it did not fit the criteria laid out in the Howey test.Giancarlo had previously declared that neither Bitcoin (BTC) nor Ether (ETH) represented security offerings, gaining him the nickname of “Crypto Dad” in the cryptosphere.However, a conflict of interest might be at play. As reported by Forbes at the time, the law firm that Giancarlo represented — Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP — was also acting as legal counsel to Ripple. Giancarlo’s assessment that XRP is not a security also “relied on certain factual information provided by Ripple,” stated the article."
288,"Luzboa, a small energy trading company in Portugal, will soon start accepting Bitcoin (BTC) as payment for electricity.The company’s president Pedro Morais Leitão announced the news to Portuguese publication Expresso on Wednesday, stating that the new payment option should become available this month.According to the executive, Luzboa will create a Bitcoin wallet in the coming days, allowing residents to pay for electricity under a new payment system known as “Bit Spot.” According to Leitão, the firm plans to instantly convert received Bitcoin into euros to protect its business from unstable prices. “We are aware of currency volatility, but we are prepared to take some risk,” the exec said.Leitão explained that the main idea of the initiative is to “capture a niche market” rather than make its customers move into Bitcoin payments. “There is a new generation with an interest in cryptocurrencies. We are looking to give an opportunity to use new means of payment,” he said.Headquartered in Viseu, a city and municipality in the Centro Region of Portugal, Luzboa reportedly has around 5,000 residential customers. Nexus Energía Group, the fifth-largest independent energy company in Spain, is the majority stakeholder of Luzboa after acquiring a 51% stake in the firm in 2017.Portugal has been slowly emerging as a crypto-friendly country despite industry awareness among local regulators staying relatively low in recent years. The country is specifically known for charging zero taxes from retail cryptocurrency trading after the Portuguese finance minister announced that retail trades of Bitcoin were not taxable in late 2017."
289,"Bitcoin (BTC) hit yet another all-time high on Feb. 19 as the largest cryptocurrency set its sights on becoming a trillion-dollar asset.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and Tradingview showed BTC/USD reaching $52,932 on Bitstamp at the time of writing after rising % in an hour.Holding $50,000 support over the past two days, Bitcoin was primed for further gains in the short term, analysts believed, with one area in particular capturing hodlers' imagination.At around $53,600, Bitcoin's total market cap will pass $1 trillion for the first time in history.""It is simple. In the old world your money loses value, because governments debase currencies to fund their warfare & welfare state,"" quant analyst PlanB summarized on Friday.Cryptocurrency investment giant Grayscale has added another $87 million to its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), data confirms.According to data from on-chain monitoring service Bybt, Feb. 19 saw a 1,672 BTC top-up of Grayscale's flagship fund, which now contains a total of just over $34 billion.With the latest buys, Grayscale's total assets under management (AUM) passed $40 billion for the first time. Second to Bitcoin is the firm's Ethereum Trust, which contains almost $6 billion of ETH.""AUM has doubled since 1/1/2021,"" CEO Michael Sonnenshein confirmed on Twitter this week. Grayscale's Bitcoin purchases have cooled off in recent weeks, failing to match the size or frequency seen at the start of the year. At the same time, Ether purchases reappeared in February after a two-month hiatus.The moves come as the activity among institutions shows no sign of abating more broadly. MicroStrategy, which already owns over 70,000 BTC, confirmed this week that it would raise $900 million specifically to increase its holdings further.Comments from BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager with around $7 trillion AUM, also appeared to suggest that it was interested in interacting with Bitcoin in some capacity.""It's really about recognizing the benefits of owning Bitcoin. There's certainly the diversification angle,"" Sonnenshein told CNN earlier this month."
290,"In its latest effort to revive the Kingdom’s pandemic-battered tourism industry, Thailand’s tourism authority is targeting cryptocurrency holders from Japan.The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) wants to establish the country as the first to go out of its way to welcome cryptocurrency holders, specifically those from Japan which it views as a regional hub of crypto activity. The authority has conducted a feasibility study on implementing cryptocurrency payments at tourism destinations.Thailand has been angling for well-heeled tourists ever since the collapse of the industry in the first quarter of 2020 when Asian nations began closing their borders in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak.According to the Bangkok Post, TAT governor Yuthasak Supasorn said that cryptocurrency could be the key to attracting the high rollers:He added that the use of cryptocurrency must comply with regulations from the central bank and measures must be designed to deter money laundering.The authority cites three-year-old figures for Japan as having an 11% crypto ownership rate, however more recent 2020 figures from Statista suggest that it is closer to 4%.Mr. Yuthasak even suggested that Elon Musk may want to visit the Kingdom with his firm having recently invested heavily in Bitcoin.Although Thailand has been relatively open to cryptocurrency trading and has a number of exchanges such as Bitkub and the recently opened Upbit, there are very few places around the country that actually accepts digital currencies as a payment method.Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the tourism ministry was reporting tourist arrival figures close to 40 million per year. This number has plunged, decimating the once-thriving industry as the country has remained largely closed to foreigners. The TAT has revised its foreign arrival goal down to just 8 million."
291,"Bullishness in the cryptocurrency market continued on Feb. 18 as Bitcoin (BTC) trades near $51,000 and Ether (ETH) is within reach of the $2,000 level for the first time as retail traders remain long while pro traders are less optimistic in the short term.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows Bitcoin price has pulled back slightly from recent all-time highs to a current value of $51,924 while ETH price has increased 5.66% to a record high of $1,950.Investors in Canada showed their healthy appetite for access to the top cryptocurrency as the debut of the Canadian Bitcoin ETF saw nearly $100 million in volume during the first few hours of trading.Meanwhile, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates indicated that he has taken a “neutral view” on Bitcoin and is neither short nor long on the asset, feeling that BTC “can go up and down just based on the mania or whatever the views are.”Chad Steinglass, Head of Trading at CrossTower, has identified the next wall of resistance for Bitcoin around $53,000 while its current support level is around $51,000, creating a “narrow channel” that is unlikely to “hold for very long.”In a private conversation with Cointelegraph, Steinglass stated:When it comes to Ether (ETH), Steinglass indicated that the recent selloff in altcoins “dragged ETH down along with them,” but as the selloff subsided on Feb. 18 Ether was able to “break free and drive higher.”Steinglass took the resilience shown by Ether during a turbulent market in altcoins as a “sign that the story behind ETH is more broad and robust than the recent frenzy in altcoins that utilized ETH for staking purposes.”Traditional markets fell under pressure on Feb. 18 as the economic recovery from the Covid pandemic sputters in the U.S. and unemployment claims increased following several weeks of a downward trend in the metric.The S&P 500, Dow and NASDAQ all finished the day in the red, down 0.44%, 0.38% and 0.72% respectively.Altcoins bounced back from their recent dip to see healthy price gains on Thursday, with Binance Coin (BNB) outperforming the rest of the top ten as it increased more than 20% over the past 24-hours to a new all-time high of $218.94Dogecoin (DOGE) and IOTA (MIOTA) have also increased by roughly 16% to a price of $0.059 and $1.52 respectively, while REN gained 20.75% to notch a new record high at $1.21.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.57 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 60.6%."
292,"The first Bitcoin ETF in North America, TSX’s Purpose Bitcoin ETF, had a gangbuster debut today, trading nearly $100 million in volume. A Bloomberg Law report noted that the ETF saw over $80 million in volume in the first hour of trading, though it’s since slowed significantly with roughly another $15 million in volume between BCTCC.B, the Canadian dollar-denominated units, and BTCC.U, the American dollar-denominated ticker. As of publication, BTCC.B has traded 7,905,000 units priced at $10.28, and BTCC.U 1,312,000 units at $10.27, per the TSX.In a press release today, ETF provider Purpose Investments founder and CEO Som Seif said that his company believes Bitcoin has a promising future.“We believe Bitcoin, as the first and largest asset in the emerging cryptocurrency ecosystem, is poised to continue its growth trajectory and adoption as an alternative asset, further cementing the investment opportunity it presents,"" said Seif. ""Driving forward to be the leader in cryptocurrency investing is a testament to Purpose's goal of providing investors with alternative investment solutions that are not based off of traditional benchmarks.""Purpose Investments website notes that the fund is currently backed by 85.34569077 BTC, and more Bitcoin will be bought proportionately to the quantity of purchased shares. Curiously, Purpose’s website lists EtherCapital, an Ethereum-focused hedge fund, as a partner in the ETF offering.While the Purpose ETF is the first Western exchange-traded fund to hit North America, it certainly won’t be the last. Ontario regulators approved a second Bitcoin ETF from Evolve Funds Group last week, and there have been multiple other unapproved filings with regulators as well. Progress towards an ETF on an American exchange remains stalled, however. While experts believe that the new administration increases the chances of an offering and multiple institutions have filed for BTC and other crypto products, there has been no green light as of yet.For now, American investors will have to settle for exchange-traded trust products such as Grayscale’s line of Investment Trusts, which continues to consistently mark record inflows."
293,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been outperforming Ether (ETH) in the past several days as BTC surged above $50,000 for the first time in history. Meanwhile, one popular cryptocurrency trader explains that this is ""simple math"" given the growing institutional demand for BTC. While ETH is beating BTC in USD terms year-to-date, Bitcoin is gaining steam in February, up 60% compared to Ether's 50%. Ether did rally by roughly 6% over the last 24 hours as Grayscale added 20,000 ETH to its Ethereum Trust. However, Grayscale's BTC stash is worth $34 billion, which dwarfs its ETH holdings of $5.8 billion.Meanwhile, a pseudonymous trader known as Bitcoin Jack noted that despite these latest ETH inflows, one single entity, namely MicroStrategy, is adding 20,000 BTC worth almost $1 billion to its balance sheet.According to data compiled by Bitcointreasuries, companies are currently holding over 1.2 million BTC worth over $48 billion dollars — and that figure does not yet include Tesla. In other words, there is a big difference between the amount of Bitcoin that is being acquired by institutions compared to Ether. Based on this trend, the trader said BTC outperforming ETH is not a surprise. He said:In the near term, one variable that could catalyze a larger accumulation trend for Ether is the listing of Ethereum futures by CME. As Cointelegraph reported, CME listed Ethereum futures on Feb. 9, the day ETH broke out and achieved a new all-time high.It has been less than two weeks since the CME Ethereum futures market launched, and many trading desks and institutions are likely still in the process of preparing their infrastructure. Hence, the actual demand and trading volume for ETH in the CME Ethereum futures market will likely take time to grow, as seen with Bitcoin, until funds begin actively trading the asset.At the same time, with the cryptocurrency bull market is in full, major investment funds and retail investors may be experiencing FOMO, according to Paolo Ardoino, the CTO at Bitfinex. He explained:Lastly, one major factor that underpins Bitcoin's ""digital store of value"" proposition is the capped supply of BTC contrary to the unknown total supply of Ether. Therefore, besides the brand image, this digital scarcity aspect is likely what's driving institutions first and foremost to Bitcoin.Meanwhile, other cryptocurrencies like ETH remain alternatives or ""altcoins"" and are typically considered for the purpose of diversifying, albeit in much smaller amounts if any, as exemplified by Grayscale's holdings.

294,"Bitcoin (BTC) has seen ""unreal"" price consolidation since the start of February 2021 — and fundamental support is now at $48,000.According to on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode, the second month of the year has been a formative period for Bitcoin like no other.Discussing the current state of the Bitcoin network, co-founders Yann Allemann and Jan Happel said that many price indicators had been allowed a ""reset"" in February.""The amount of consolidation Bitcoin has seen since January is unreal. It really allowed fundamentals to catch up and indicators to reset,"" they wrote in a tweet on Feb. 17.The buoyant perspective adds fuel to the bulls hoping that $50,000, a level Bitcoin took for the first time this week, will form a solid foundation without a major correction.Despite wobbling around the $50,000 mark, any drops were quickly bought up, indicating solid buyer support in place at higher levels regardless of the pace of price gains or any negative external narrative surrounding Bitcoin.""Under capital flow models, it would take a black swan to break $36k on a daily close,"" statistician Willy Woo added in response to the Glassnode findings.He described Bitcoin's current position as being in the ""middle phase"" of a bull market.Allemann and Happel were meanwhile not alone. In his latest appearance on the podcast series from ""The Bitcoin Standard"" author Saifedean Ammous at the weekend, Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, claimed that Bitcoin would not see another 80% price pullback like in 2018.""The volatility is not the same; if you look at the drawdowns, they're not the same,"" he told Ammous.As Cointelegraph reported, MicroStrategy plans to purchase another $900 million of BTC in the short term as per an announcement this week."
295,"The Swiss canton of Zug now allows its residents to pay taxes in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).Bitcoin Suisse, a local crypto broker that enabled the new opportunity in partnership with the canton, announced Feb. 17 that the crypto payment option has rolled out this week.The administration of the canton of Zug placed an official memo for the new tax payment option on its official website, providing detailed video instructions for paying tax bills with crypto.“This step forward for crypto adoption has been enabled by the pioneering work from the Zug cantonal tax office using the Bitcoin Suisse Crypto Payments solution. It is yet another sign of innovation in Blockchain Nation CH,” Bitcoin Suisse wrote.The canton of Zug initially announced its plans to start accepting crypto for tax payment in September 2020, offering the new payment option to local companies and individuals.Widely referred to as the “Crypto Valley” for its positive stance towards crypto, the canton of Zug started experimenting with crypto payments about five years ago. In May 2016, the city of Zug piloted Bitcoin payments for public services with a payment limit of up to 200 francs.Zug is not the first location in Switzerland to support crypto tax payments. Zermatt, a municipality in the district in the canton of Valais, rolled out a Bitcoin tax payment option in partnership with Bitcoin Suisse in January 2020."
296,"A major United States-based cryptocurrency exchange has halted all XRP trading on its platform in the wake of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s ongoing lawsuit against Ripple Labs.The PayBito exchange, which processed $1.1 billion worth of trades in 24 hours leading up to the time of publication, will suspend all XRP trading pairs, as announced on Feb.18. Four XRP trading pairs have historically been available on PayBito, with XRP/USDT trades proving the most popular.Notably, the trading suspension will not affect users’ holdings, and those with coins held on the exchange will still be able to transfer them out of the platform, said PayBito managing director Raj Chowdhury:PayBito said it would continue to monitor the ongoing legal dispute between the SEC and Ripple Labs, suggesting it could reinstate XRP trading depending on the outcome of the lawsuit.In December 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs, alleging that the sale of XRP coins constituted a violation of securities laws. Ripple Labs continues to deny the allegations and has since demanded that the SEC explain why XRP is classed as a security, while Ether (ETH) isn’t. Officials from the SEC had previously stated publicly that coins like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether were sufficiently decentralized so as to not represent security issuances.PayBito joins a long list of major exchanges that have opted to steer clear from XRP while the lawsuit is underway. Binance.US, eToro, Coinbase, Bittrex and OKCoin have all either halted XRP trading or delisted the coin completely."
297,"The number of whale addresses holding Bitcoin (BTC) have hit a new all-time high, the latest data shows. This can be considered bullish, particularly as the price of BTC is showing staying power above  $50,000.The increase in the number of whales indicate that high-net-worth investors are actively accumulating Bitcoin as the bull market continues.During bull cycles, the price of Bitcoin could be at risk of a severe sell-off if whales begin to sell or take profit on large positions.When this happens, it creates a massive downturn because the overleveraged futures market begins to fall, seeing cascading liquidations.But when whales continue to accumulate, as the on-chain data shows, the foundation for an extended rally strengthens.Analysts at Glassnode explained that there are now 94,000 BTC addresses holding over $1 million worth of Bitcoin. They said:Meanwhile, researchers at Whalemap, a data analytics platform that tracks whale activity, spotted a similar trend.The researchers said that in previous bull cycles, the number of addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC decreased. But, during the recent bull cycle, the number of whales have noticeably spiked. They said:Currently, Bitcoin has the components to see a continuation of the ongoing rally. Whales are buying, the trading volume is rising in general, and there is large institutional interest in Bitcoin.However, there is one major risk in the market and that is the overleveraged futures market. As of Feb 18, the futures funding rate for both Bitcoin and Ether surpassed 0.15%.The normal funding rate for cryptocurrencies is around 0.01%. When the funding rate spikes, it signals that the majority of the market is buying or longing.The problem occurs when Bitcoin or Ether (ETH) sees a minor drop. Since the market is highly-leveraged, it can cause an intensified downturn, often resulting in a steep correction.Due to the high funding rates, the probability of a correction in the near term remains high. Considering that the crypto market often sees corrections during the weekend, a pullback in the next few days remains likely despite the bullish market structure of BTC and ETH."
298,"Global cryptocurrency mining operators are increasingly moving their equipment to Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States as they chase lower energy prices.Igor Runets, founder and CEO of Russian crypto mining firm BitRiver, told local news agency Kommersant Thursday that the company is actively building up its power capacity to meet increasing demand from American and European investors.According to the executive, BitRiver has run out of spare capacity at its data centers, having fully reserved all of its power for the next 18 months. During this period, the company expects to co-locate mining equipment of total mining power estimated at 1 GWh.BitRiver, which operates the largest colocation services for Bitcoin (BTC) mining in Russia and the CIS region, is now building two new data centers in Russia, including an 80 MWh facility in Krasnoyarsk and a 300 MWh center in the Republic of Buryatia. The company expects to deploy 100 MWh by fall 2021, meeting only half of expected demand. The CEO noted that the growing demand is mainly coming from the United States and Europe, with investors partly moving their operations from China, Africa and Latin America, seeking lower energy prices. But the main reason for the increasing demand is the ongoing crypto rally with prices hitting new records, Runets stated. BitRiver has been already aggressively tapping the demand, setting up a massive batch of Bitcoin miners in December 2020.Nikita Vassev, founder of CIS mining market-focused forum TerraCrypto, said that many miners are actively moving their operations from China and the U.S. to CIS countries. The exec suggested that the growing demand is coming from investment strategies intending to distribute power among different continents. Vassev said that mining operations in the U.S. and Canada are more expensive due to logistics and energy costs.Amid a parabolic spike in mining-generated rewards, crypto mining has become more popular than ever, which has caused a significant surge in crypto's energy consumption. As previously reported, Bitcoin energy consumption has been at its highest historical levels since late 2020, with the estimated annual consumption level staying above 75 TWh for a record period of time."

1. We believe it will store value more effectively than gold over the long term.
2. We believe it may become a medium for transactions, as/if pricing stabilizes in the decade ahead.
3. We believe it can act as a productive hedge against inflation.The firm will be investing in Bitcoin through its 10X real-money portfolio as one of 40 assets that it predicts will provide a 1,000% return over the next 15 years. The firm has recommended the digital asset as a core holding to all its 10X members and has provided time for them to purchase BTC before The Motley Fool initiates its own purchase.

301,"Bitcoin (BTC) is gradually gaining ground on gold, the traditional store of value. Data shows that one ounce of gold can only buy 0.0352 Bitcoin as of Feb. 17, the lowest amount of BTC ever. This shows that Bitcoin has been rewarding its investors much more than gold.Bitcoin has massively outperformed gold over various time frames. Even if the latest one-year data is considered, Bitcoin’s risk-adjusted return is 270%, while gold's is only 24% as of Dec. 28, 2020.The result further skews hugely in favor of Bitcoin if longer time frames of four years or eight years are compared.In the past few years, Bitcoin has matured as an asset class. During the previous bull run in 2017, Bitcoin’s 60-day volatility was at 32%. But in the current bull phase, Bitcoin has recorded lower volatility at 14.25%. Analysts believe that as institutional adoption increases, volatility could drop further.And there are no signs of a slowdown in the number of institutions showing interest in Bitcoin. Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson told The Telegraph that many United States financial institutions “are seriously considering launching some type of cryptocurrency service.”If institutional adoption continues to grow, the sentiment is likely to remain positive. Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to spot the levels on the upside that may act as significant resistance.The psychological level at $50,000 saw only minor resistance to Bitcoin, which shows that the bulls are firmly in command and not hurrying to book profits, as they anticipate the bull run to continue.A new all-time high above $51,000 is a sign of strength. The upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($43,451) and the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought zone suggest bulls are in control.If the bulls can sustain the price above $50,000 for three days, the BTC/USD pair could rally to $60,974.43 where the bears may step in.On the downside, the first support is the 20-day EMA, and if the bears can sink the price below it, the decline could extend to the 50-day simple moving average ($37,415). This is an important level to watch because a break below it will suggest a momentum shift to the bears.Ether (ETH) is currently range-bound between $1,658.572 and $1,869.473. The long tail on the Feb. 15 candlestick shows the bulls are buying on every minor dip. The buyers will now try to propel the price above $1,869.473.If they succeed, the ETH/USD pair could start the next leg of the uptrend, which has a target objective of $2,000. This is an important resistance, but if the bulls can drive the price above the channel, the momentum could accelerate. The next target objective on the upside is $2,515.Contrary to this assumption, if the price fails to rise above $1,869.473, the pair may consolidate in the range for a few more days. A break below the 20-day EMA ($1,658) will be the first sign of weakness, and a trend change will be signaled if the bears sink the price below the support line of the channel.Polkadot's DOT rose to a new all-time high on Feb. 16 and followed it up with another new high on Wednesda, which shows that the bulls are firmly in command. However, the bears are defending the resistance line of the channel.If the bulls can thrust the price above the ascending channel, the momentum could pick up and the DOT/USD pair could rally to $42. On the other hand, even if the price sustains in the upper half of the channel, the uptrend may gradually continue.The first sign of weakening momentum will be a break below the midpoint of the channel. If that happens, the pair may decline to the support line of the channel. This is an important support level because a break below it could indicate a trend change.After the sharp rebound from the lows on Feb. 15, Cardano's ADA formed an inside day candlestick pattern on Feb. 16 and a Doji candlestick pattern today, which shows a balance between supply and demand.The bulls will now try to push the price to $0.9817712. This level is likely to act as a stiff resistance, but if the bulls can drive the price above it, the ADA/USD pair could rally to $1.25 and then to $1.50.On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance, the pair may drop to $0.687. A bounce off this level could keep the price range-bound between $0.687 and $0.981.XRP price attempted to bounce off $0.50 on Feb. 14 and 15, as seen from the long tails on the candlestick, but the bulls could not sustain the rebound. This suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.The failure to achieve a strong rebound off a critical level suggests the momentum has weakened. The XRP/USD pair could now consolidate between $0.50 and $0.65 for a few days. A breakout of $0.65 could push the price to $0.78068.Contrary to this assumption, if the price dips and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($0.48), the pair may decline to the 50-day SMA ($0.35).Binance Coin (BNB) broke out of the $117.7289–$141.32 range it had been stuck in for the past few days. The momentum picked up today, and the buyers easily propelled the price above the all-time high at $148.40.A breakout to a new all-time high after a shallow correction shows that traders are buying on every minor dip and not waiting for a deeper correction to get in. The BNB/USD pair could now rally to $200.However, traders should keep an eye on the RSI, as it has been trading in the deeply overbought levels for the past few days. This suggests that the pair remains vulnerable to a correction or further consolidation.The first sign of weakness will be a break below $141.32, and the trend may favor the bears if the $117.7289 support cracks.Litecoin (LTC) completed a successful retest of the $185.5821 level on Feb. 15, and the bulls are now attempting to resume the uptrend by pushing and sustaining the price above $230.5305. If they manage to do that, the altcoin could rally to $256 and then $272.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone indicate that bulls are in command. However, if the bears defend the overhead resistance, the LTC/USD pair may consolidate between $185 and $230 for a few daysThis positive view will be invalidated if the pair turns down and breaks below $185.5821. Such a move would suggest that the supply exceeds demand. The next support on the downside is the 50-day SMA ($156).Bitcoin Cash (BCH) formed a long-legged Doji candlestick pattern on Feb. 15 and an inside day candlestick pattern on Feb. 16. Both these formations indicate indecision among traders about the next directional move.If the uncertainty resolves to the upside and the bulls drive the price above the $745.39–$773.32 overhead resistance zone, the BCH/USD pair could resume the uptrend and rally to $900. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought territory suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside.Conversely, if the price turns down and slips below $670, the next stop could be the breakout level at $631.71. If this support also cracks, the decline may extend to the 20-day EMA ($563).Chainlink's LINK recovered sharply from the intraday lows on Feb. 15, but the bulls could not build upon the strength and push the price above the resistance line of the ascending channel. This attracted profit-booking from short-term traders, and that pulled the price down to the midpoint of the channel.The long tail on today’s candlestick shows the bulls are buying on dips. If they can sustain the recovery, the price may again rise to the resistance line of the channel. A break above the channel may start the journey toward the next target objective at $44.On the contrary, if the price again turns down from the resistance line, the LINK/USD pair may continue its journey inside the channel. A breakdown and close below the channel would tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.Stellar's Lumen (XLM) also formed an inside day candlestick pattern on Feb. 16, which shows indecision among the bulls and the bears. The bulls are currently attempting to push the price above $0.517.If they succeed, it will suggest that demand exceeds supply, and that could result in a retest of $0.600681. A breakout of this resistance will indicate the resumption of the uptrend. The rising moving averages and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest that bulls have the upper hand.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and slips below $0.409, it will suggest weakness and open the doors for a possible drop to $0.35 and then to the 50-day SMA ($0.31).The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

302,"While 2020 was a significant year for Bitcoin (BTC), the just-begun year of 2021 is already full of great surprises. On Feb. 8, Bitcoin’s price jumped by almost $3,000 in minutes, then it surged 20% in 24 hours — all due to the news of Elon Musk’s Tesla allocating $1.5 billion of its balance sheet to BTC. The same week, the oldest bank in the United States, Bank of New York Mellon, announced plans to hold, transfer and issue Bitcoin. Mastercard is also planning to support cryptocurrencies in 2021 for its almost 1 billion users. And SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, commonly referred to as “Crypto Mom” in the crypto community, even underlined the urgent necessity for regulatory clarity due to the recent events in the space.With PayPal, Tesla, Mastercard, BNY Mellon and others entering the cryptosphere, isn’t it becoming more clear than ever before that digital assets are now part of the mainstream? That their mass adoption has started and it is a matter of the present, not the future?Last year, Cointelegraph asked experts in the crypto and blockchain industries for their opinions on PayPal’s crypto integration and mass adoption and on the importance of 2020 in Bitcoin’s history. This time, the question is: What does Tesla’s recent $1.5 billion investment into Bitcoin mean for the crypto space in terms of the financial markets, for crypto adoption and brand building, and for the whole industry in general?“Tesla’s purchase of Bitcoin no doubt sent a shockwave through the corner offices of every chief financial officer and corporate treasurer in America and beyond. One of Bitcoin’s many benefits is that it acts like digital gold, diversifying corporate holdings and lowering currency risk. Every financial executive ought to be sharpening their pencils to understand if and ultimately when they should be buying it.While Tesla is not the first public company to buy Bitcoin for its treasury, it is by far the most important. How poetic it is that Elon Musk, a space entrepreneur, pushed Bitcoin to its escape velocity in corporate America!The decision by Tesla follows a slew of high-profile announcements by large companies, which fits a pattern of accelerating institutional and corporate adoption. Equally consequential to the treasury allocation was Tesla’s decision to accept Bitcoin. This follows in the footsteps of several other large innovative firms such as PayPal, Visa and others that are building a superhighway to Bitcoin mass adoption, enabling not only Bitcoin buying and selling but integration into their merchant networks. By the end of 2021, I’d expect many more firms to not only hold Bitcoin but have a real Bitcoin strategy.”“This is a very promising sign for mainstream interest and its increasing willingness to embrace blockchain. Moreover, it affirms that blockchain and Bitcoin are here to stay for the future.Throughout 2020, increasingly more financial institutions invested in Bitcoin, and I am confident that blockchain adoption is accelerating as the global financial paradigm shifts to fully embrace digitization and decentralization. Moving forward, we must continue pushing for effective standards across the industry as well as greater integration to fully deliver on blockchain’s game-changing potential.”“Tesla’s purchase of $1.5 billion in Bitcoin not only continues the momentum of public companies purchasing crypto but could be a watershed moment that establishes some allocation of digital assets as a cornerstone of a healthy, diversified treasury.Regardless of industry, businesses should follow these early adopters establishing in-roads to the payment rails and financial infrastructure of the future. That starts with Bitcoin and will steadily expand to projects that are just outside the frame and focused on the programmable, smart asset side of the ecosystem where enterprises can find more use cases beyond digital gold.”“The embrace of Bitcoin and Ether by institutional investors and corporate treasury departments in recent months represents a watershed moment for the global economy — the early concrete signs of a paradigm shift in how global business, financial and economic systems will be constructed. They are being rearchitected on a new real-time automated, objective trust foundation, as represented by the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks.Today, corporate finance departments are learning how to manage BTC and ETH tokens for value preservation, transaction friction reduction and upside, as these systems will grow in size and value dramatically with adoption over the next few years. Tomorrow, their treasuries will plug into the decentralized finance protocols being built largely on Ethereum for borrowing, lending, trading, equity and bond issuance, full lifecycle token management, insurance, prediction markets, trade finance, tokenization and factorization of invoices, loyalty tokens and NFT art that can be projected on the walls of their board rooms. They will do this because they will be able to configure and issue financial instruments without the need for intermediaries, and they will be able to wire up financial flows to suit their needs in real time. And they will do this because that’s where the liquidity is.”“Tesla’s bold move to invest $1.5 billion of its treasury into Bitcoin, as well as to accept Bitcoin as payment for Tesla vehicles in some jurisdictions, blows the doors wide open for corporate America and high-net-worth families to seriously consider putting a small part of their net worth in Bitcoin as a store of value, instead of bonds, gold, dividend stocks and commercial real estate, which have been underperforming historical standards.With only 18.6 million Bitcoin in the world — and perhaps as much as 4 million to 5 million lost or not being offered for sale — there isn’t enough to satisfy the demand of 46.5 million global millionaires, nor 1% to 5% of the estimated $4 trillion of cash on corporate balance sheets in the U.S. alone. Add in 1.8 billion millennials, mostly in countries with broken currencies or banking systems, and one can see that the supply of and demand for Bitcoin are not in balance.Over time, this demand will trickle down to Ethereum, which already has a large part of the Fortune 500 developing applications on it, as well as innovative cryptocurrency platforms in DeFi and NFTs — and numerous billionaires, including Mark Cuban, have recently hopped on those bandwagons. We are in the year after the halving — what I call ‘Bitcoin summer’ — and parabolic growth has occurred following every four-year halving event so far. This year will likely not be an exception.”“In the face of the pandemic, domestic inflation and global uncertainty, mainstream businesses have jumped into digital assets with newfound enthusiasm. From public companies like Tesla and Square to funds like Grayscale and the Tudor Group, prominent institutions are increasing their exposure to Bitcoin. In aggregate, these institutions are estimated to be holding over 6% of the 18.6 million Bitcoin in circulation, amounting to over 1.2 million BTC. After Bitcoin surpassed an all-time high of over $48,000 in early February, the total value of these institutional holdings eclipsed $55 billion.In the last six months, BitGo has onboarded many corporate accounts through the process of education, intelligent market access, asset accounting and reporting, and more — all while keeping assets stored in regulated, qualified custody with the highest levels of security for deep cold storage.Bitcoin’s mainstream acceptance stands to only grow exponentially as more institutional investors embrace cryptocurrencies, clearing the way for future entrants to follow them. This escalating market demand from large entities will likely continue impacting Bitcoin’s value and may even serve to mitigate its volatility. With the final Bitcoin expected to be mined in 2140 and over $2 trillion of monthly trade volume, there’s still plenty of time to enter Bitcoin — for businesses and individuals alike. Despite the tremendous acceleration of institutional investors, we are likely only at the tip of the iceberg when it comes to mass adoption. Additional corporations and funds are soon to see the success that these first-movers have enjoyed and thus will begin to follow their lead.”“The recent announcement by Elon Musk of Tesla’s investment in Bitcoin is yet another example of the broadening acceptance of Bitcoin, and of digital assets as an asset class in its own right. We are quickly getting to the point where announcements like this will no longer be viewed as ‘news’ and will no longer cause reactions in the market.Take for example the recent announcement by BNY Mellon, which we think is more important but caused not a stir in the market. Taking a step back, we think the success of Bitcoin, and of digital assets more broadly, is a strong harbinger of the power of global retail-driven innovation in financial markets. Look at the recent activity in GameStop as another example. We think this trend will continue and will raise important policy and regulatory issues that will need to be addressed by governments and central banks around the globe.”“When I tweeted at Elon about accepting Bitcoin three weeks ago, I had no idea he would be so responsive, first by accepting Bitcoin and next by managing his cash by buying some Bitcoin. I expect that the action he has taken will be pervasive, first for the early adopter companies that use OpenNode or the Lightning Network to accept Bitcoin, and next for the chief financial officers of the world to recognize the need to own some Bitcoin to hedge against coming inflation and against further printing of fiat currency by politicians.”These quotes have been edited and condensed.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors’ alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

303,"Wedbush Securities, a prominent wealth manager based in Los Angeles, believes Bitcoin (BTC) is becoming a permanent fixture in the global financial marketplace.Managing director Dan Ives informed clients on Wednesday that corporate adoption of Bitcoin represents a much bigger story than merely predicting the digital currency’s future price.“We believe the story and theme here is much larger than just investing in Bitcoin and predicting its future price, but rather around the potential ramifications that crypto, blockchain, and bitcoin could have across the technology and corporate world for the next decade,” he said in a note that was obtained by CNBC.He also explained why so-called Bitcoin mania is not a fad:Wedbush Securities has been at the forefront of Bitcoin adoption since at least 2014. A Wedbush report released the following year touted Bitcoin as a potential disruptor of existing financial infrastructure, which should lead to its value appreciating over time.Bitcoin’s adoption story accelerated last year after major institutions and corporations sought exposure to the digital asset. That trend appears to be intensifying after Tesla confirmed it had allocated $1.5 billion of its cash reserves to BTC.Although Bitcoin has earned a reputation for being extremely volatile, its price swings appear to have ebbed from the previous bull cycle that peaked in 2017. As Cointelegraph reported Wednesday, Bitcoin’s 60-day volatility is significantly lower today than it was when the cryptocurrency topped out near $20,000 in December 2017.BTC price peaked at $51,721 on Wednesday, a new all-time high, according to TradingView data."
304,"The current Bitcoin (BTC) price bull run seems almost unstoppable right now as BTC just notched another new high on Feb. 17.The psychological barrier of $50,000 finally broke on Tuesday after multiple tests of this level in the previous week. In addition, banks are revealing their interest in BTC, and more public companies are starting to hop on the Bitcoin bandwagon, with the first German company revealing its position today.This rally could now extend to $63,000. Meanwhile, altcoins are feeling some pain in their BTC pairs as a result while Bitcoin dominance is crawling back up. The primary questions are if Bitcoin can sustain this run and if altcoins will drop in their BTC pairs.Bitcoin’s price has been grinding up in the past few weeks, establishing some potential areas of support in the event of a pullback.After the breakout above $40,000, the $43,000–$43,500 area quickly became the new level of support as a launchpad for more upside.The chart above shows this continuation is seen as BTC rallied toward the next point of interest. This area is found at the 1.618 Fibonacci level around $50,000. This key level is also an important psychological barrier. Bitcoin’s price has successfully cleared this resistance zone and is currently trying to climb higher.Now, the critical area to watch is between $47,250 and $48,000. As long as that sustains support, Bitcoin’s price can continue running towards$54,000 to $55,500.The daily chart for Bitcoin shows the next points of interest if the rally continues. During such an upward grind in price discovery — as the current price of Bitcoin is 150% higher than the all-time high in 2017 — the Fibonacci extension tool is useful for determining the next key levels to watch.The first 1.618 Fibonacci level has been reached, while the second is at the 2.618 Fibonacci level. If the price of Bitcoin continues moving up, a rally toward $63,000 to $66,000 is on the table as long as $47,000 to $47,750 holds, as previously mentioned.The weekly Bitcoin dominance chart shows a clear breakdown since the peak high in December 2020. Historically, Bitcoin dominance tops out in December, after which altcoins rally in January and February.This is exactly what happened in January and so far in February. However, after such a monster run, a correction in altcoins is very likely. The BTC pairs of those altcoins should now see a consolidation period for some potential support/resistance flips.However, altcoins may see a pullback if BTC continues to climb. In other words, the altcoins' U.S. dollar values may stay the same, but they’ll go down in value against BTC. Traders and investors should be aware of this cryptocurrency market phenomenon. A heavy correction for altcoin-BTC pairs is very possible, especially if Bitcoin’s price runs to the next target at $63,000.The four-hour chart for Bitcoin shows one critical level to watch. Once again, the region between $47,250 and $48,000 is a must-hold area for higher prices. If that level fails to sustain support, a significant correction is likely to happen, possibly to the next major support zone between $43,000 and $44,000.For the bulls, $55,000 and possibly even $63,000 to $65,000 will be the next targets if BTC price continues its rally.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

305,"Cryptocurrencies are typically pseudonymous, but not necessarily private. Bitcoin (BTC) and other assets run on blockchains, with each transaction posted publicly online. During a transaction between two or more parties, assets move to different wallets, each represented by a string of characters. With these addresses and transactions visible to all, however, a certain level of trackability exists, especially if a wallet transfers funds to an exchange requiring Know Your Customer verification.Certain crypto assets, which are often referred to as privacy coins, private coins or anonymous coins, attempt to hide information about transactions, giving users more privacy. Why might someone need privacy if they are not doing anything illegal? It could be preference or a view of privacy as a basic human right could be two reasons. Cash is largely private. Every transaction is not recorded somewhere for all to see with the click of a button.A number of possible methods exist for adding privacy to Bitcoin, including peer-to-peer trading, although multiple crypto assets focus on privacy more directly via their technology. Some familiar privacy assets in the crypto space include Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), Verge (XVG), Beam and Grin. Dash also makes it on the list, as it allows for added anonymity, although the coin is not technically classified as a privacy asset.One of the industry’s most well-known privacy-focused assets, Monero came on the scene about seven years ago, having spurred numerous headlines in the years since. Monero prides itself on decentralization, touting origins that back such stated values. “It was a fair, pre-announced launch of the CryptoNote reference code,” Monero’s website says. “There was no premine or instamine, and no portion of the block reward goes to development.”Monero, a coin based on its own proof-of-work blockchain, touts multiple different privacy technology features, per its website, including stealth addresses and RingCT. Added to XMR in 2017, “RingCT, short for Ring Confidential Transactions, is how transaction amounts are hidden in Monero,” Moneropedia, the explanatory section of the asset’s site, explains.Monero piqued the interest of the United States government in the latter part of 2020. The Internal Revenue Service put out a bounty on the asset’s head, promising as much as $625,000 in exchange for cracking the coin’s privacy tech. Two blockchain analytics outfits, Integra FEC and Chainalysis, took home the prize just a few weeks after the IRS announced the bounty.Zcash hails as another popular privacy-focused asset in the crypto space. It started in 2016 and was initiated by the Electric Coin Company, which is headed up by cypherpunk Zooko Wilcox. Zcash stems from the same code as Bitcoin, according to the asset’s website. ZEC operates on its own blockchain with PoW mining consensus, separate from Bitcoin.ZEC allows both private transfers, called shielded transactions, and public transactions. “Zcash gives you the option of confidential transactions and financial privacy through shielded addresses,” Zcash’s website explains, adding: “Zero-knowledge proofs allow transactions to be verified without revealing the sender, receiver or transaction amount. Selective disclosure features within Zcash allow a user to share some transaction details, for purposes of compliance or audit.”Dash is another well-known cryptocurrency hosting privacy features. The entity managing the coin’s development, the Dash Core Group, however, clarified on several occasions that Dash is not a privacy asset, although it comes with elective characteristics for added anonymity.“Dash is a payments cryptocurrency with a strong focus on usability, which includes speed, cost, ease of use and user protection through optional privacy,” the group’s chief marketing officer, Fernando Gutierrez, told Cointelegraph previously.“Dash is not an AEC!” Ryan Taylor, CEO of DashPay, said in a January 2021 tweet referring to anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies, or AEC — a term used by U.S. regulating bodies. “As a literal fork of Bitcoin, all Dash transactions are completely transparent,” his tweet added: “All inputs, outputs, addresses, and amounts are recorded on each and every transaction and viewable - by anyone - on its public blockchain.”XCoin joined the crypto world as a 2014 Bitcoin fork, later rebranding as Darkcoin, and subsequently Dash. The asset is based on its own proof-of-stake blockchain.The coin lets users transact anonymously, if they so choose, through what is referred to as PrivateSend. “The technology that Dash utilizes in our PrivateSend function is CoinJoin, which is a technique for complicating transactions to the point that they’re more difficult for analytics firms to analyze those,” Gutierrez explained, as previously reported.A PoW asset running on its own blockchain, Verge exists as yet another cryptocurrency touting privacy capabilities. Verge started with a different name. “Verge Currency was created in 2014 under the name DogeCoinDark,” the asset’s website states, but was later rebranded into Verge Currency.An open-source asset, Verge enables private transfers through I2P and Tor tech, which conceal transactors’ locations (IP addresses), according to information from BitDegree, as well as previous Cointelegraph reporting.Verge gained significant price traction in late 2017, hitting highs around $0.31, based on TradingView data. The asset currently trades at roughly $0.023.Grin and Beam burst onto the crypto market in 2019, touting a different technology called Mimblewimble. A type of blockchain technology, the concept of Mimblewimble went public in 2016 as a PoW variation, according to a community submission article from William M. Peaster on Binance Academy.Grin and Beam launched based on Mimblewimble, although Litecoin (LTC), a long-time prominent asset in the crypto space, has been working on implementing the technology.“In a MW blockchain, there are no identifiable or reusable addresses, meaning that all transactions look like random data to an outsider,” the Binance Academy article reads. “A Mimblewimble block looks like one large transaction rather than a combination of many,” the article adds, subsequently diving into other aspects of the technology.Government overwatch on privacy coins has grown in recent years, as shown in part by the IRS’ efforts against Monero’s technology. Privacy coin references also surfaced in the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s proposed regulation on self-hosted crypto wallets in December 2020.“Several types of AEC (e.g., Monero, Zcash, Dash, Komodo, and Beam) are increasing in popularity and employ various technologies that inhibit investigators’ ability both to identify transaction activity using blockchain data,” the December document said referring to anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies. Additionally, South Korea outlawed anonymity assets in November 2020.Some crypto exchanges have delisted the abovementioned assets. In October 2019, OKEx Korea ceased trading on its platform for Monero, Zcash, Super Bitcoin (SBTC), Dash and Horizen (ZEN). BitBay removed Monero near the beginning of 2020. Bittrex removed Zcash, Dash and Monero from its exchange in January 2021. A number of other crypto platforms have also delisted privacy-enhanced assets over the past year or two, including ShapeShift."
306,"Bitcoin (BTC) is now worth more in gold than at any time in its history as the largest cryptocurrency passes $50,000.Data noted by markets commentator Holger Zschaepitz on Wednesday confirms that one ounce of gold now buys just 0.0352 BTC.Since hitting new all-time highs on Wednesday, the price of gold in Bitcoin terms became even cheaper, with one ounce costing $1,794, or 0.0349 BTC, at the time of writing.""Bitcoin is eating gold in one chart!"" Zschaepitz declared in comments.Responding, analytics account Ecoinometrics added that gold's underperformance versus Bitcoin simply increases if longer time frames are taken into account.Bitcoin's one-year risk-adjusted returns topped 270%, compared with 24% for gold, as of Dec. 28, 2020. Four-year returns contain an even starker contrast, with 2,675% versus 64% for Bitcoin and gold, respectively. ""When looking at Bitcoin vs. gold don't zoom out too much or gold will turn into the horizontal axis,"" Ecoinometrics commented, presenting accompanying charts.Despite the figures, gold bugs continue to pit Bitcoin against the precious metal and predict disastrous consequences for those holding BTC as the correlation between the two assets has noticeably decreased since September 2020. Among them is Peter Schiff, who in his latest Twitter spat with proponents — including his son, Bitcoin hodler Spencer Schiff — maintained that BTC/USD is destined to go to zero.When asked whether the process would take thousands of years or longer by Bitcoin Foundation founder Charlie Shrem, Schiff replied that it should be a lot sooner.""Serious answer — I doubt it will take anywhere near that long,"" he claimed.A $1 million Bitcoin, he added, was ""highly unlikely.""Spencer subsequently reminded him of a prediction he made in June 2020 in which Schiff claimed that Bitcoin was ""highly unlikely"" to hit $50,000."
307,"Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank, recently announced that it has extended an ongoing pilot aimed at creating a digital version of the Swedish krona until 2022.In combination with professional services firm Accenture, the “e-krona” pilot program was created to address what the Riksbank sees as “the marginalization of cash”:The recent announcement states that no decision has been made on how, or even if, the e-krona will be issued. But a brief whitepaper from 2020 details the use of R3’s Corda blockchain — a private distributed ledger created for business and enterprise. Unlike public blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, projects built on Corda will be accessible via invite only.Central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, are digital currencies issued and overseen solely by the central bank of a given country. Unlike coins on open-source, decentralized, public blockchains, CBDCs don’t pretend to be alternatives to the current fiat system. Rather, they are being devised as a possible safeguard against the spread of digital currencies, acting as a mere digital version of existing national monies.The pilot program will continue over the course of the coming year and is set to end in February 2022. The recent announcement notes that the testing of offline functionality and onboarding of external participants will be prioritized in the coming months:"
308,"Bitcoin (BTC) has hit a new high above $51,300 in a continuation of its bullish advance that begun in October 2020.According to Bloomberg, the current run is different from the 2017 bull rally that topped out below $20,000 in terms of volatility.Indeed, data from Woobull Charts puts Bitcoin’s 60-day volatility at 14.25%, a significant decline from the over 32% recorded at the zenith of the 2017 bull run.However, in terms of realized volatility, Bitcoin’s price swings are still orders of magnitude higher than gold. Data from crypto analytics provider Skew puts Bitcoin’s current three-month realized volatility at 90% — more than five times the actual price move for gold, as reported by JPMorgan Chase analysts.In a note to investors, JPMorgan Chase analysts argued that Bitcoin’s current price rally is unsustainable unless volatility decreases significantly. Part of this assessment likely comes from the rollercoaster January where BTC rallied 46% to almost reach $42,000 before declining over 30% to fall below the $30,000 price mark.For Bloomberg strategist Mike McGlone, the current Bitcoin price swings are only temporary, with the market expected to calm down. According to McGlone, the growing institutional BTC adoption will force Bitcoin’s volatility below even that of gold.Tesla recently announced a $1.5-billion Bitcoin purchase, while business intelligence firm MicroStrategy continues to expand its BTC ownership.Earlier in February, U.S. crypto exchange Kraken issued a report predicting that Bitcoin’s continued upward advance will be accompanied by reduced volatility.According to Peter Brandt, Bitcoin is in yet another parabolic advance, with the largest crypto by market capitalization printing about 75% in year-to-date gains thus far."
309,"Global banking institutions have been expressing more interest in Bitcoin (BTC) as the cryptocurrency consistently breaks new all-time highs, according to a new report.Tom Robinson, co-founder of major British crypto firm Elliptic, told The Telegraph on Wednesday that his company saw a massive surge in Bitcoin-related inquiries from global banks.The executive noted a wave of Bitcoin-associated demand from United States-based banking institutions over the past two months. According to Robinson, several financial institutions in the U.S. “are seriously considering launching some type of cryptocurrency service.” British banks were the most reserved in terms of the demand’s uptick, the executive reportedly said.Founded in 2013, Elliptic provides crypto intelligence services to high-profile customers like government agencies and cryptocurrency exchanges. The company works with state authorities including the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.Megan Prendergast Millard, managing director at risk and compliance firm Guidepost Solutions, believes that the growing Bitcoin trend among traditional financial institutions is natural amid surging adoption. Prendergast Millard reportedly said that it was logical for banks to begin opening up to digital currencies in a similar way as crypto exchanges in order to keep millennials and Generation Z on board.“Financial institutions are looking to keep their customers and they need to think about who those people are,” Prendergast Millard noted.The new report comes shortly after Bank of New York Mellon, the oldest bank in the United States, announced plans to hold and trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as an asset manager on behalf of its clients. Roman Regelman, senior executive vice president and head of digital at BNY Mellon, believes that the full incorporation of digital assets into the traditional banking infrastructure will take another three to five years."
310,"Polkadot's DOT token is seeing an impressive 180% gain in 2021 so far, surpassing XRP for fourth place by market capitalization. Polkadot is a multichain protocol that has several ""parachains,"" similar to Ethereum shards. DOT works on its proprietary technology called Substrate.The platform is fully interoperable between different blockchains while maintaining the ability to process thousands of transactions per second. Substrate 3.0, which will bring Ethereum compatibility, is expected to launch in the first half of 2021.According to Polkadot creator Gavin Wood, the emergence of projects like Acala and Moonbeam, focusing on Ethereum compatibility, helped fuel the growth in DOT's value. Acala is Polkadot's gateway into decentralized finance, while Moonbeam is an Ethereum-compatible toolkit for smart contract deployment.Binance Labs announced on Feb. 9 a $2.4 million investment in Plasm Network, a Polkadot-based smart contract platform. Plasm is a leading parachain candidate supporting Ethereum and layer-two scaling solutions.A week earlier, on Feb. 2, Manta Network closed a $1.1 million funding round to create a fully private decentralized exchange on Polkadot. It uses zk-SNARKs with Groth16 proofs, the same cryptographic technology used in Zcash (ZEC).On that same day, the cryptocurrency provider of exchange-traded product 21Shares replaced Bitcoin Cash (BCH) with DOT. Those investment vehicles are tradable on the Swiss SIX exchange.Despite being listed on major exchanges less than six months ago, Polkadot's token activity and price growth are mind-blowing. Its $700 million in daily transparent volume has matched major altcoins like Chainlink's LINK and Litecoin (LTC), according to Nomics data.What's more intriguing is that DOT's price action has seemed to somehow anticipate Bitcoin's over the past two months.Usually, there is a very high intraday performance resemblance between Bitcoin and altcoins. That being said, occasional differences ought to be expected, but it is quite unusual for a pattern to repeat itself more than three times in a month.Nevertheless, sometimes one of these altcoins anticipates BTC movements. For DOT, this effect can be partially explained by its lower trading volumes and the fact that 68% of the total supply is locked in staking wallets.In the above example, the DOT price hike happened a whole three hours ahead of Bitcoin. More interestingly, its local top and subsequent rally also followed the same pattern.Although decreased volume usually brings more volatility, this is not a reason for any given altcoin to front-run Bitcoin.As shown above, DOT was the first to make new highs on Jan. 25. It was also the first one to initiate a downtrend. Sure enough, the two events displayed could have been an exception.Oddly, this pattern seems to have repeated, although varying from three hours up to 22 hours in advance.The above chart depicts another DOT rally and subsequent top that happened earlier on Dec. 29 and 30. Again, numerous factors could be behind these predictive Bitcoin movements by smaller cryptocurrencies, and some will not be replicated, thus creating false alerts.Nevertheless, DOT's assertive movements have seemed unusual over the last two months.Once again, DOT was able to front-run a BTC rally on Dec. 24 and 25 assertively. This time around, it failed to predict BTC's top afterward. Nonetheless, it has served as a good pump indicator in the past few months.It's almost impossible to pinpoint the cause and effect of such short-term trading distortions. Some large investment funds participating in diversified crypto baskets could explain the current unique price action.The above correlation seems to be an odd coincidence rather than the result of a structured strategy, however. The same can be said for the many false positives and opposing movements that happened exclusively to DOT that Bitcoin did not replicate.Of course, no one knows whether the Polkadot indicator will continue to be helpful moving forward, but keeping a close eye on it seems to be paying off for now.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

311,"It's been roughly 11 days since the Central Bank of Nigeria banned all regulated financial institutions from providing services to cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. At the risk of stiff penalties, all banks and institutions were directed to close crypto-related firms' accounts immediately. In the wake of the controversial move, public interest in Bitcoin (BTC) in Nigeria continues to outstrip other countries, according to the latest available data from Google Trends. Even more stark is the hefty 36% premium on Bitcoin's price as of the time of writing, Feb. 16.The premium translates into a $71,150 price tag per Bitcoin, as compared with the average spot market price of $51,314 calculated in Cointelegraph's price index. The premium is also incomparable to the five next largest premiums globally at present: 3.24% in South Africa, and between 1% and 3% in Argentina, Peru, Malaysia and Vietnam.As a Cointelegraph analysis outlined last week, the immediate impact of the central bank ban appears to have done little to quell what its author dubbed the ""hyperbitcoinization"" of retail trading culture in the country. Blockchain.com published a report back in Aug. 2020 revealing that Nigeria had been the best-performing country on its platform since April of that year. Google Trends at the time likewise reflected the country's persistent top ranking in terms of global search interest in Bitcoin.Citing the consequences of the central bank ban, Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission halted its planned regulatory sandbox for crypto firms last week.Nigeria senator Sani Musa remarked during a plenary Senate on Feb. 11 that Bitcoin posed a significant threat to the national fiat currency, the naira, although other lawmakers countered his argument with an argument in favor of cracking down on rogue actors using crypto, rather than preventing citizens from doing ""great business"" and benefiting from opportunities in the cryptocurrency industry.Representatives from one cryptocurrency business in Nigeria declined to comment to Cointelegraph on the premium, citing a sensitive climate following the Central Bank of Nigeria's ban on bankings services to crypto firms.

312,"SynBiotic SE, a German cannabis company, has announced that it is following the lead of companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla in shifting part of its liquid cash holdings into Bitcoin (BTC).In a Feb. 16 update on its website, the company stated that the move was spurred by “legitimate concern about a massive devaluation of fiat money,” due to an “excessive increase” in both euro and U.S. dollar money supply.CEO Lars Müller went further, stressing that the decision was not driven by recent price appreciation, but that, “we have more long-term confidence in bitcoin than in euros or dollars, where a central institution, influenced by politicians, can expand the money supply immeasurably.”He went on to say that the cannabis industry in particular has had “very positive experiences with Bitcoin as a simple and digital means of payment,” and that several SynBiotic subsidiaries already accept Bitcoin as a means of payment.Synbiotic SE is building a diverse group of companies in the cannabis sector, with a focus on the synthetic production of cannabinoids and wellness products. It claims to be the first publicly-traded company in Germany to invest in Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat devaluation.As Cointelegraph reported, Tesla’s announcement of a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin earlier this month caused the price to jump $3,000 in mere minutes.Meanwhile, business services company MicroStrategy has been steadily investing in Bitcoin since mid-2020. It recently had 1,400 firms sign-up for a webinar advising other companies who wish to follow its lead."
313,"Microsoft, the second-largest company in the United States, does not apparently have any short-term plans to put Bitcoin (BTC) on its balance sheet, according to the firm’s president Brad Smith.In a Feb. 16 interview with CNN’s Julia Chatterley, Smith still hinted that Microsoft could still change its mind about a Bitcoin investment.When asked whether Microsoft is discussing any cryptocurrency diversification plans following Tesla’s $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin, the Microsoft president said that he is not aware of such discussions:Bitcoin's market capitalization is inching higher to overtake some of the largest American companies. As previously reported, Bitcoin market cap surpassed Tesla’s at around $808 billion shortly after the company announced its massive Bitcoin investment.Following Bitcoin’s historical move to hit above $51,000 on Feb. 17, 2021, Bitcoin’s market capitalization stands at $948 billion at the time of writing. Bitcoin would need to double its market cap to reach Microsoft’s, which amounts to $1.8 billion at publishing time.On Feb. 12, JPMorgan Chase co-president Daniel Pinto claimed that the company will eventually have to get involved in Bitcoin due to surging demand. Previously, JPMorgan strategists argued that Tesla’s BTC purchase will not necessarily trigger a ton of similar investments due to Bitcoin’s high volatility."
314,"Bitcoin (BTC) hit new lifetime highs of more than $51,200 on Feb. 17 as it tackled what trader Peter Brandt confirms is a “parabolic advance.”Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView showed BTC/USD passing the $50,000 resistance level again on Wednesday, this time continuing into uncharted territory.Tuesday had seen Bitcoin hit $50,000 for the first time ever, that level nonetheless failing to hold for more than a matter of minutes.With its return, the largest cryptocurrency is in a ""parabolic advance"" — the fourth in its twelve-year history, analysts say.""Big picture $BTC Bitcoin is undergoing its third parabolic advance in the past decade,"" Brandt tweeted alongside an annotated price chart.Responding, Kraken growth lead Dan Held noted that if counting its initial phase prior to 2012, there have in fact been four parabolic advances.Brandt added that should the advance be violated, a correction of 80% is ""most common"" as a bearish consequence. Such behavior was observed in 2018 after Bitcoin peaked at near $20,000 — the market bottomed out at $3,100 one year later.As Cointelegraph reported, various indicators nonetheless suggest that Bitcoin is far from violating any uptrend, being at the start, rather than the end of its bull run.""$50,000 #Bitcoin is the new normal,"" Blockstream CSO Samson Mow declared on Wednesday.Discussing the new price highs, others noted that macro factors could converge to create a chain reaction of adoption, which would push Bitcoin further still into price discovery.""If you think $50,000 a bitcoin is expensive, wait until you hear that the government is about to print $1,900,000,000,000 out of thin air,"" popular Twitter account Documenting Bitcoin added.Data meanwhile showed that Bitcoin had taken the momentum out of altcoin growth with its moves over the last few days, with all of the top ten cryptocurrencies except Polkadot (DOT) seeing sideways price action."

The top 1,026 crypto markets gained an average of 9.56% this past week, compared to the 31.44% average gain seen by Fair Launch projects over the same period.Over the past 30 days, Fair Launch tokens are up 145.33% compared to the collective crypto average of 49.50%, while the last 90 days have seen Fair Launch projects gain 296.46% compared to 112.41%.Fair Launch tokens are also outperforming the averages of Ethereum-based assets, which gained 1.90%, 43.82%, and 248.45% over the past seven, 30, and 90 days respectively.The data shows that all but one of the top 20 Fair Launch tokens have posted gains this week, with only DOGE sliding by 20%.However, DOGE is the top-performing Fair Launch asset of both the past 30 and 90 days, gaining 515% and 1,815% respectively after being pumped by the notorious subreddit r/Wallstreetbets at the end of January.After a vicious dump, DOGE again rallied after its hypothetical CEO, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, tweeted about the meme-coin in early February.The performance of Fair Launch tokens has also been bolstered by Bitcoin’s meteoric run into all-time highs since breaking above $20,000 for the first time in December. The consolidation of the Yearn Finance ecosystem has also contributed to the strong performances from Yearn and SushiSwap recently."
316,"A Honda enthusiast has released a YouTube video revealing how he spent a bunch of Bitcoin on two used sports cars.Known on social media as “NSXTRA”, Chris Cut’s Feb. 16 YouTube video titled “Idiot Spends $1.8 Million of Bitcoin on Old Hondas” reveals how much he regrets spending large amounts of Bitcoin at today's prices on the classic sports cars.The first car in question is a Honda NXS Targa which he bought on Valentine’s Day in 2017, claiming to have got it for a “great price” of $30,500, which he paid in Bitcoin, calling it “a steal”.On the day he bought the Targa in 2017, BTC was trading around a thousand dollars a coin so the car cost him 30.5 BTC. At today’s Bitcoin prices, the car set him back almost $1.5MHe added that he parted with 6.5 BTC to pay for another Honda on Black Friday 2018 when Bitcoin was trading at $4,300. That amount of Bitcoin would have been worth $293,000 using BTC prices on Feb 14 when the video was shot.Cut revealed that he was not bothered about paying in BTC for the cars at the time. But four years later the realization of his lost gains has set in:At current Bitcoin prices, he spent the equivalent of $1,773,000 on two used Hondas … Ouch.Cut is not the first person to prematurely sell his crypto or even to buy a Honda with it. Dogecoin founder Billy Markus revealed that he sold off his DOGE stash in 2015 for an amount equivalent to a used Honda Civic, though he didn’t confirm actually making the purchase.The most famous regretful sale though would be the Bitcoin pizza which was the first tangible asset ever bought using BTC in 2010. Today, Laszlo Hanyecz’s Pizza would be worth a staggering $500 million."
317,"Revenue from crypto-related crime dropped by more than half in 2020 according to Chainalysis’ annual report on the subject.Cybercriminals netted around $5 billion less than the $10 billion plus they got away with in 2019, representing a 53% fall.Transactions involving illicit funds have decreased even more rapidly than the total volume of those funds, falling from 2.1% of all transactions analyzed in 2019 down to just 0.34% last year.Among the eight categories of transactions deemed “illicit” by Chainalysis, the dollar amount of crypto taken in by scams decreased the most, by 71% to $2.6B, largely due to the fact that 2019’s multi-billion dollar PlusToken scandal dwarfed anything seen in 2020 so far. Overall crypto crime volume — including the proceeds of crime and the attempts to launder it — fell from above $20B in 2019 to around $10B last year.But it’s not all good news and possibly the most alarming part of the report is the finding that ransomware-related theft rose 311% from 2019 to 2020, representing an additional loss of more than $250 million in 2020 compared to 2019. Even with a year-over-year increase in ransomware and darknet market activity, Chainalysis says the outlook on crypto crime “has never been better,” thanks to recent advancements in regulatory and compliance processes.Chainalysis’ conclusions broadly echo those put forth in a recent report by security firm CipherTrace, which found that crypto-related crime dropped by 57% in 2020.""Cryptocurrency-related crime is falling, it remains a
small part of the overall cryptocurrency economy, and it is comparatively smaller to the amount of illicit funds involved in traditional finance""

from @chainalysis 2020 report: [pdf]

https://t.co/yhC5dc2kOI pic.twitter.com/azpIcKjLMPAccording to Chainalysis, the big rise in ransomware is due to the introduction of “new strains taking in large sums from victims,” which, when combined with pre-existing ransomware strains, accounted for nearly $350 million of cryptocurrency theft in 2020.Although the origins of ransomware attacks may seem disparate and random, Chainalysis believes that the infrastructure attackers need to launder crypto into cash “may be controlled by just a few key players,” similar to the origins of the ransomware itself.THREAD: Here's a quick summary of the our takeaways on money laundering in cryptocurrency. https://t.co/Ca9piHaAL8 https://t.co/eMaztAmZplChainalysis also notes that the increasing collection of personal identifying information from exchanges has effectively forced criminals to “rely on a surprisingly small group of service providers” to exchange ill-gotten crypto holdings into fiat.Last month, the Department of Justice announced it had confiscated $454,000 in cryptocurrency from a ransomware operator; the bust being the result of a collaboration with Chainalysis."
318,"A small scale study of financial executives has found that 5% of companies intend to invest in Bitcoin (BTC) as a corporate asset this year, with a further 11% stating they could do so by 2024.The survey conducted by Gartner comes on the back of news that Tesla invested 8%, or $1.5 billion of its cash reserve, into Bitcoin. MicroStrategy Inc. who has also invested large sums into the token announced a $600 million convertible bond offering Tuesday with the intent of using the proceeds to acquire additional Bitcoins.The 77 respondents, including 50 CFOs among other executives, showed highly differing views based on the industry the company works in. The technology sector showed the most attraction towards Bitcoin with 50% of respondents from this industry anticipating holding the cryptocurrency in the future, with no difference based on the organization’s size.Although the majority of those surveyed (84%) stated their main concerns about investing revolves around the financial risk that comes from Bitcoin’s high volatility, it also appears many are adopting a wait and see approach a the landscape develops.More than 70% stated that one of the top things they want to know is what others are doing with Bitcoin. Almost the same number want to hear more from regulators on the matter to aid in their understanding of the inherent risks with holding the digital asset.Gartner chief of research Alexander Bant noted that, “Finance leaders who are tasked with ensuring financial stability are not prone to making speculative leaps into unknown territory,” addingOther concerns expressed included board risk aversion (39%), slow adoption as an accepted form of payment or exchange (38%), lack of understanding (30%), cyber risks (25%), and complex accounting treatment (18%).While it’s difficult to draw statistically significant results from such a small sample size, it is worth noting how increased corporate investment would impact Bitcoin. In the second half of 2020, companies outside of the financial and utility sectors in the S&P Global held approximately $2 trillion in cash reserves. This is currently more than double Bitcoin’s current market cap, and as such, there is plenty of money available to flow into Bitcoin.The technology sector alone could have at least $640 billion to invest — though most companies so far have allocated only a small percentage to Bitcoin.Investment firm ARK Invest suggested earlier this month that if “all S&P 500 companies were to allocate 1% of their cash” to BTC, the digital asset’s price would increase by roughly $40,000, driving the price to just shy of $90,000.Should the corporate investments rise to 10% of cash reserves, ARK claims Bitcoin will increase by $400,000.The study represents a stark increase of awareness from Gartner's 2018 survey in which only 66% of CIOs even knew about blockchain technology."
319,"North America’s second Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund received regulatory approval on Tuesday, offering another potential entry point for institutional investors to access digital assets.Less than three weeks after filing a preliminary prospectus for a Bitcoin ETF, Evolve Funds Group Inc announced Tuesday that its fund has been approved by the Ontario Securities Commission, or OSC.The ETF has two ticker symbols: EBIT for Canadian-denominated units and EBIT.U for U.S.-denominated units. EBIT is said to provide ""unhedged exposure to the daily price movement"" of Bitcoin in Canadian dollars, whereas EBIT.U provides exposure to the daily price movements in U.S. dollars. Notably, the fund will track price data using CF Benchmarks’ Bitcoin Reference Rate, which aggregates data from several BTC/USD markets into a one-a-day benchmark index.An updated prospectus submitted to the OSC on Frida outlines the fund's investment objective:To achieve this goal, the Evolve fund will invest in long-term holdings of BTC purchased through Gemini NuSTAR LLC and other platforms. The prospectus was filed under a passport system, which allows the fund to be accessed in all of Canada's 10 provinces and three territories. Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, told Cointelegraph that the Evolve ETF has “developed a true first — giving investors an easy-to-understand product that is available through their existing brokers and advisors that gives ownership of Bitcoin.”Chung continued:The Evolve fund is the second Bitcoin ETF to be approved by Canadian securities regulators this month. The Purpose Bitcoin ETF received approval last week, becoming the first physically settled North American ETF.An ETF-style product from 3iQ was approved in Canada last year and is currently listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. However, unlike the Evolve ETF, the EiQ fund doesn’t continually issue new shares."
320,"New York Digital Investment Group, or NYDIG, has submitted paperwork with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a new Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund. NYDIG filed a Form S-1 registration statement for a Bitcoin ETF with the SEC on Tuesday. The submission lists NYDIG Trust Company LLC as the fund’s Bitcoin custodian and Morgan Stanley as an authorized participant.As an authorized participant, Morgan Stanley is expected to sell shares to the public at prices that reflect the fund’s assets, supply and demand, and underlying market conditions. The shares will trade on the NYSE Arca exchange under a yet-to-be-determined ticker symbol.According to the prospectus summary:It continues:NYDIG has been highly active in the crypto space, as it seeks to provide more institutional exposure to digital assets like Bitcoin. In November and December 2020, the company raised $150 million through two separate cryptocurrency investment funds. NYDIG was granted a BitLicense by the New York State Department of Financial Services in 2018.Stone Ridge, NYDIG’s parent company, is one of the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin.The quest for a Bitcoin ETF has been elusive, at least in the United States, where several fund issuers have tried unsuccessfully to get regulatory approval.Canada recently approved the first publicly traded Bitcoin ETF in North America, allowing institutional investors to access BTC investments directly without derivatives."
321,"Bitcoin (BTC) breached the $50,000 level on Feb. 16. But while failing to cleanly break the psychological barrier, it undoubtedly displayed the potential for even higher valuations.Meanwhile, futures and options indicators are misaligned, signaling excessive buyers' leverage, while options markets remain calm. After analyzing both markets, one might theorize what has caused this apparent incongruence.When analyzing options, the 25% delta skew is the single-most relevant gauge. This indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options side by side.It will turn negative when the put options premium is higher than similar-risk call options. A negative skew translates to a higher cost of downside protection, indicating bullishness.The opposite holds when market makers are bearish, causing the 25% delta skew indicator to gain positive ground.A skew indicator between -10% (slightly bullish) and +10% (somewhat bearish) is considered normal. Over the past three months, there hasn't been a single occurrence of a 10% or higher 30-day skew, which is usually considered a bearish event.This data is very encouraging, considering that Bitcoin saw a 24% correction on Jan. 11, in addition to a 19% sell-off 10 days later. Yet, there is no evidence that options traders demanded more significant premiums for downside protection.By measuring the expense gap between futures and the regular spot market, a trader can gauge the level of bullishness in the market.The three-month futures usually trade with a 6% to 20% annualized premium (basis) versus regular spot exchanges. Whenever this indicator fades or turns negative, this is an alarming red flag. This situation is known as ""backwardation"" and indicates that the market is turning bearish.On the other hand, a sustainable basis above 20% signals excessive leverage from buyers, creating the potential for massive liquidations and eventual market crashes.The above chart shows that the indicator bottomed at 1.5% on Jan. 27 but later reverted to 4.5% and higher as Bitcoin rebounded above $35,000. Even during its darkest periods, the futures premium held above 10% annualized rate, indicating optimism from professional traders.Meanwhile, the current 5.5% level, equivalent to a 50% annualized rate, indicates excessive buyers' leverage. Perpetual futures (inverse swaps) could be the root of this issue, and retail traders more widely use those contracts.Take notice as the funding rate has exceeded 2.5% per week, thus more than compensating the 50% annualized premium of the March contracts.Therefore, arbitrage desks and market makers are likely happy to pay such a hefty premium on fixed-month contracts while simultaneously shorting the perpetual future and profit from the rate difference.To conclude, this movement perfectly explains why options markets are relatively neutral while futures markets show excessive buyers' leverage. While institutional clients and whales dominate options volumes, retail traders seem to be the root of such a mismatch.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Both the domain name and the wallet are operating under BTC.com but belong to Bitdeer, which is the parent company of Blockchain Alliance.According to the announcement, the first transaction under the share exchange agreement is expected to occur on or before April 15.500.com and Blockchain Alliance have also made certain agreements related to net operating profits. If BTC.com records a net operating profit in the fiscal year ending in December, 500.com will have to issue additional shares to the Blockchain Alliance. Assuming that the minimum amount of the net operating profit is $20 million, a maximum of 22 million additional Class A ordinary shares can be issued.In contrast, if the BTC.com mining pool business records a net operating loss during the same period, 500.com will be entitled to repurchase certain Class A ordinary shares held by the Blockchain Alliance.500.com is a New York Stock Exchange-listed company (WBAI) offering a range of online lottery services. The company has been moving into the crypto industry recently. In early February, 500.com purchased 5,900 Bitcoin mining devices at $8.5 million.

323,"Bitcoin (BTC) surged to new all-time highs on Feb. 16 following a week of bullish news including Tesla accepting BTC and MicroStrategy planning to raise another $600 million to buy Bitcoin.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView showed BTC/USD climb over 5% in hours on Tuesday days after BNY Mellon confirmed that it would store crypto for asset management clients and rumors also swirled around Morgan Stanley. The move put Bitcoin on course to hit the psychologically significant $50,000 mark once again after several days of sideways movement as a tussle between whales emerged.Bulls had initially taken control of BTC after Tesla's $1.5 billion Bitcoin buy-in, which it revealed on Feb. 8. At the same time, the European Central Bank was among the naysayers, claiming that central banks as a whole would not interact with Bitcoin in the future.In an update, analysts at derivatives platform Deribit noted that the BNY Mellon news had already managed to reshape investor perspectives.""While BTC pulled back 10% from ATH, Feb Implied Vol pruned, suggesting gamma impacted players flat-long post-Tesla news,"" they stated.Sellers were lined up between $49,500 and $50,000, according to order book data from major exchange Binance, with increasing support at $46,500.In analysis this week, Cointelegraph Markets' Michaël van de Poppe highlighted other factors contributing to the bull case for Bitcoin in the short term.Bitcoin had shown signs that its overall momentum would not be halted throughout this month.With Tesla and then Mastercard as catalysts, market participants were already convinced of the strength of its current bull run. Last week, Cointelegraph Markets contributor Filbfilb gave a short-term target of $63,000 for BTC/USD, being checked by a possible consolidation at around $52,000.Tesla’s buy and Mastercard’s acceptance announcement were made public days after MicroStrategy’s dedicated ""Bitcoin for Corporations"" summit attracted an audience of around 8,000 executives. While Tesla made arrangements months prior, the implications of the event were clear — companies wanted and planned to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets.Even formerly skeptical mainstream commentators were more and more in favor of Bitcoin outperforming cash as a treasury asset in the long term.“I think it’s almost irresponsible not to include it — every treasurer should be going to boards of directors and saying, ‘Should we put a small portion of our cash in Bitcoin?’” CNBC host Jim Cramer said last week.Simon Peters, a crypto-asset analyst at multiasset investment platform eToro, told Cointelegraph that he forecasts Bitcoin hitting $70,000 in 2021.“While we may see short-term upside in the price of Bitcoin and other cryptoassets as a result of this, Mastercard's announcement — coming so soon after Tesla's own comments earlier this week — has real long-term implications for Bitcoin and its peers,” he said."
324,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed $50,000 for the first time in history across major futures exchanges, including Binance Futures.However, on spot exchanges, like Coinbase and Binance, the price of Bitcoin rejected closely below $50,000.On Feb. 16, the price of Bitcoin reached as high as $49,556 on Coinbase, marking its second attempt at breaking past the $50,000 resistance area.Shortly after hitting $49,556, BTC saw a steep pullback, declining by around 3.5% within several hours.CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju explained that Bitcoin’s struggle to break past $50,000 is about “Coinbase whales (USD) vs. Stablecoin whales (USDT).”Ki emphasized that there was a negative Coinbase premium at the time Bitcoin rejected $50,000 in the morning. For BTC to cleanly break past it, he explained, the negative premium has to be “cooled down.”Since the initial rejection, the Coinbase premium has stabilized, reaching parity with Binance’s BTC/USDT price.Coinbase typically has a higher Bitcoin price than Binance on most days, but the premium has recovered from negative to neutral.With the Coinbase premium recovering, Lex Moskovski, a quantitative trader and cryptocurrency investor, said the United States session could catalyze Bitcoin’s new rally.Theoretically, the Coinbase premium should return during the U.S. session, as buyers in the U.S. would be more active during market hours.Hence, if the premium returns as the U.S. market opens, the probability for the continuation of a Bitcoin rally would increase. Moskovski said:Furthermore, popular pseudonymous cryptocurrency trader ""Mac"" said Bitcoin is likely to surpass $50,000 and build a new support area.The trader said a potential scenario would be BTC rising above $50,000, correcting to around $42,000 and establishing a new support level. He said:Generally, both traders and on-chain analysts seemingly anticipate the price of Bitcoin to surpass $50,000 in the near term.However, with the funding rate indicating an overcrowded futures market, traders expect Bitcoin to correct shortly after reaching $52,000.If this scenario plays out, it would be akin to BTC’s reaction at $42,000 when it first broke above it. This was followed by a sharp correction to around $29,000 before the price rebounded to new highs."
325,"Russian lawmakers are actively preparing new legislation for taxing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC).According to an official announcement by the Russian State Duma, the Duma’s Committee on State Building and Legislation has approved a bill on cryptocurrency taxation on Feb. 15. The new bill represents a set of amendments to the Russian federal tax code.As part of the draft bill, the Russian government officially recognizes cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as property, aiming to tax profits from crypto trading by Russian residents. The bill targets all domestic residents including citizens and foreigners, as well as Russian and international organizations established in the country.According to the bill, the listed entities will have to report their crypto transactions if a total amount of incoming or outgoing transactions exceeds 600,000 rubles ($8,100) on an annual basis.The bill establishes penalties for violations like late reporting as well as providing inaccurate information, suggesting fines of up to 10% from incoming or outgoing transactions. The suggested fine for non-payment or incomplete tax payment is 40% of the unpaid taxes, the draft bill reads.Following the committee’s approval, the Russian Duma is expected to consider the new crypto legislation on Feb. 17, according to official state records.Russia officially enforced its first crypto law “On Digital Financial Assets” in January 2021, prohibiting local residents from making payments in cryptocurrencies. Despite providing legal status to the crypto industry in Russia, the bill does not address certain areas of digital assets, such as taxation and mining, leaving the regulatory landscape relatively uncertain."
326,"Bitcoin (BTC) has already hit $50,000 on some exchanges but needs to get whales on its side to flip it to definitive support, data suggests.In a tweet on Feb. 16, Ki Young Ju, CEO of on-chain analytics service CryptoQuant, highlighted the so-called ""Coinbase premium"" as one of the final hurdles for BTC/USD.On Tuesday, a clear battle was emerging within Bitcoin trading as $50,000 stayed de facto out of reach for bulls.Analyzing the premium, which pits the Coinbase BTC/USD price against the Binance BTC/USDT pair, Ki argued that the until it neutralized, higher levels would remain unlikely.Currently, the premium is negative, meaning that it is cheaper to buy Bitcoin on Coinbase. The result is that traders, and particularly whales, will continue to accumulate. Only once the balance stabilizes will momentum appear to tackle $50,000 more convincingly.""This $50k battle is about Coinbase whales(USD) vs. Stablecoin whales(USDT),"" Ki wrote.Exchange stablecoin balances reaching new all-time highs in recent days point to a readiness to exchange for other assets. The biggest stablecoin Tether (USDT) meanwhile has been accelerating its ""minting"" in recent months with USDT market cap now nearing $33 billion. Nonetheless, at the time of writing, whales were still lined up to sell at and above $50,000. A look at Binance orderbook data showed incremental sell orders appearing every $1,000 up to $55,000.Meanwhile, one analyst warned against misinterpreting a drop in another premium, this time in institutional investor circles.Since the start of 2021, the Grayscale Bitcoin premium, which is the price paid by investors for shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), has fallen. Far from signalling reduced interest in Bitcoin, the more competitive buy-in opportunity is a result of more shares being available.""A large $GBTC premium is a sign of strong demand for bitcoin. Institutional inflows into $GBTC have been one of the largest drivers of this bull market, so everyone's eyes are on that premium. And now that the premium has collapsed, this has had many market participants worried,"" macro analyst Alex Krueger explained on Monday.As Cointelegraph reported, Grayscale has been continually upping its BTC holdings, also restarting buys for Ether (ETH) in February after a nearly two-month hiatus. As of Feb. 12, it had Bitcoin assets under management worth $31.1 billion. "
327,"On-chain analytics provider, Glassnode, has published data revealing that Bitcoin miners are accumulating while long-term investors are taking profits.Despite January seeing heavy selling from miners, Glassnode’s report shows that miner outflows have dried up during February so far.The report asserts that miners and longer-term investors are the two principal sellers of Bitcoin during bull markets. According to Glassnode, declining miner outflows can be inferred as bullish, with miners either having already covered their costs of operation or stockpiling coins in response to Tesla’s $1.5 billion Bitcoin investment:With miners now hanging onto their BTC, Glassnode concludes the majority of coins being sold in the markets are being off-loaded by longer term investors.The report notes last week’s ‘Elon Candle’ — with the single-largest daily candle in the history of BTC being posted the day after Tesla’s investment was announced, driving a 24-hour price gain of $7,162 or 18.5% on Monday, Feb. 8.Looking at Bitcoin’s Average Spent Output Lifespan (ASOL), an indicator that measures the average age in days of all spent transaction outputs, Glassnode concluded that long-term investors capitalized on Tesla’s news to realize profits.The firm noted that Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), which is a measure of economic activity giving more weight to coins that haven't been spent for a long time, also shows that older coins are getting redistributed. Glassnode concludes that long-term investors have been taking profits since October — when BTC broke back above $12,000.Tesla’s investment has also driven record social signals for Bitcoin, with Twitter activity surging to new highs after the vehicle manufacturer’s investment was publicized.Despite the profit taking, Bitcoin's price continues to make gains, with BTC testing its recent all-time high of roughly $49,600 on Feb. 16. "
328,"A large part of the current crypto bull run has been driven by institutional demand. But for the first time, the institutions may be stepping back. According to CryptoQuant, the Coinbase Premium Index — the difference in Bitcoin’s (BTC) price on Coinbase Pro and Binance — has turned negative, which suggests that pro traders may be taking profits.The institutional selling needs to be monitored closely because roughly 3% of the Bitcoin in circulation is held by these investors. If they start to dump their positions, that could result in an exodus by other traders, leading to a sharp pullback.In the past 24 hours, about $1.89 billion worth of crypto futures positions has been liquidated on various exchanges. However, most liquidations have happened on Binance, considered to be dominated by retail, while Bitfinex has seen the least. This prompted Bitfinex chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino to suggest that Bitfinex traders “use leverage slightly more carefully.""One of the main reasons for the sharp fall in altcoins could be attributed to the sharp rise in funding rates on Binance Futures, which surged to 0.3% to 0.7% from the average of 0.01%, which shows rampant speculation by novice traders.However, after the shakeout, have the altcoins changed direction? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin's (BTC) price rallied to $49,689 on Feb. 14, just missing the psychologically important level of $50,000 by a whisker. Although the bears tried to start a correction today, the long tail on the day’s candlestick suggests the bulls are in no mood to relent.A shallow correction that could not even reach the breakout level at $41,959.63 indicates strength. The upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought zone suggest that bulls are in control.If the bulls can sustain the buying pressure and push the price above $50,000, the BTC/USD pair may witness a short squeeze that could quickly propel the price to $60,974.43.Contrary to this assumption, if the price again gets rejected near the $50,000 level, it will suggest that the bears are aggressively defending this resistance.That could attract profit-booking from short-term traders, resulting in a fall to $44,000 and then to the 20-day exponential moving average ($41,975). A bounce off this support will suggest that the sentiment remains positive.But if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair may drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($36,502). A break below this critical support may signal a possible change in trend.Ether (ETH) has been consolidating between $1,680.173 and $1,835.554 for the past few days. The bulls pushed the price above $1,835.554 consecutively over the past three days but could not sustain the breakout, which suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.As the bulls failed to achieve a breakout, the bears tried to start a correction today. The ETH/USD pair dipped below $1,680.173, but the bulls aggressively bought the decline, resulting in a sharp rebound, as seen from the long tail on today’s candlestick.If the bulls can now thrust the price above the $1,835.554 to $1,869.473 resistance zone, the pair may rally to the resistance line of the ascending channel at $2,000. This is a psychologically critical level where the bears may again mount stiff resistance.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest that bulls are in command. This positive view will invalidate if the price again turns down from the overhead resistance and plummets below the 20-day EMA ($1,631).Cardano's ADA fell to the 20-day EMA ($0.66) today, but the bulls purchased this dip, which shows that sentiment remains bullish. The buyers will now try to push the price above the $0.9817712 resistance.If they succeed, the ADA/USD pair may resume its uptrend, with the next target objective at $1.25 and then $1.50.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the pair may consolidate in a large range between $0.981 and $0.687 for a few days.This positive view will be negated if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that supply exceeds demand and will signal a possible change in trend.XRP price turned down from the overhead resistance at $0.65 on Feb. 14 and plummeted to the breakout level at $0.50. The retest was successful, as the altcoin bounced back sharply and has formed a long tail on the day’s candlestick.If the bulls can push the price above $0.65, the XRP/USD pair could rally to $0.78068. The bears are likely to defend this level aggressively, but if the bulls can propel the price above the resistance, the pair may rally to $1.On the other hand, if the price turns down from $0.65 once again, the pair may fall to $0.50 and then remain range-bound between these two levels for a few more days. A break below the 20-day EMA ($0.47) will be the first indication of a deeper correction to $0.3855.Polkadot's DOT turned down from the resistance line of the ascending channel on Feb. 13 and dipped to the 20-day EMA ($22.37) today. However, the sharp rebound from the 20-day EMA suggests strong demand at lower levels.The DOT/USD pair may now again move up to the resistance line of the ascending channel. If the price breaks above the channel, the DOT/USD pair could pick up momentum and rally to $41.However, if the bears defend the resistance line of the channel, the pair may gradually continue to move up. The trend will turn in favor of the bears if they can sink and sustain the price below the support line of the channel.Binance Coin (BNB) has been range-bound between $117.7289 and $141.32 for the past few days. A consolidation after a sharp uptrend is a positive sign, as it shows that traders are not hurrying to close their positions.If the bulls can push the price above the $141.32 to $148.40 overhead resistance, the BNB/USD pair could resume the uptrend. The pair could then rally to the psychological resistance at $200.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the $117.7289 support, the pair could drop to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $105.7886. If this support also cracks, the decline may extend to the 20-day EMA ($92).Litecoin (LTC) broke out and held above the $185.5831 resistance on Feb. 12. This resumed the uptrend, and the bulls easily pushed the price above the psychological barrier of $200 on Feb. 13.The LTC/USD pair turned down from $230.5305 on Feb. 14 and dropped to the breakout level at $185.5821 today. The long tail on the day’s candlestick suggests the retest of the breakout level was successful.If the bulls can now thrust the price above $230.5305, the uptrend could extend to the next target at $256 and then $272.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance, then it may drop to $185.5821 and consolidate for a few days. The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA ($174).Bitcoin Cash (BCH) broke above the $631.71 resistance on Feb. 13 and rose to $750 on Feb. 14. The bears pulled the price below $631.71 today, but the bulls bought the dips aggressively.The buyers have sustained the momentum and pushed the price to a new 52-week high at $773.32. The next target objective on the upside is $900.However, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above $750, the BCH/USD pair may again turn down to $631.71 and remain range-bound for a few days.A break below $631.71 will indicate weakness and may result in a fall to $539. Such a move could delay the start of the next leg of the up-move.Chainlink's LINK broke above the resistance line of the rising wedge pattern on Feb. 13. This is a positive sign, as it invalidated the bearish setup. The bulls had pulled the price back into the wedge today, but the long tail on the day’s candlestick suggests the bulls aggressively bought the drop to the 20-day EMA ($27).If the bulls can sustain the price above the wedge, it will indicate strength. A break above $35.6945 could resume the uptrend, with the next target objective at $41.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price back into the wedge, it may catch several aggressive bulls off guard. That may pull the price down to the support line of the wedge. A break below this support could signal a trend change.Stellar's Lumen (XLM) corrected sharply today, but the long tail on the candlestick shows the bulls aggressively purchased the dip to the 20-day EMA ($0.409). In an uptrend, a strong rebound off the 20-day EMA suggests the bulls are accumulating on dips.If the buyers can propel the price above the $0.600681 resistance, the XLM/USD pair may resume its uptrend. The next target on the upside is $0.79.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above $0.50, the pair may again slide down to the 20-day EMA ($0.40). A break below this support could result in a fall to $0.35.A deep correction in an uptrend usually indicates a loss of momentum. If that happens, the price may remain range-bound for a few days before starting the next trending move.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

329,"While the naysayers continue to wish for the so-called “Bitcoin bubble” to burst, the premium cryptocurrency continues to scale to new heights, seemingly with each passing day. For example, within the same week of Tesla announcing its foray into the crypto market, Bitcoin (BTC) proceeded to surge by almost $10,000. And even though the market subsequently faced a correction, things took a turn for the better as soon as news broke that BNY Mellon, the United States’ oldest private bank, entered the crypto fray, sending the largest digital currency by total market capitalization on an upward trajectory once again.In this regard, the banking giant, with $2.2 trillion in assets under management and $41.1 trillion in assets under custody and/or administration, announced its decision to hold, transfer and issue Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as an asset manager on behalf of its clients, potentially exposing this asset class to an entirely new section of investors.Another reason for the current momentum could be payments giant Mastercard announcing its decision to allow its user base to use crypto assets across its 30 million merchants. Additionally, on Feb 11, PayPal announced its plans to expand its recently introduced cryptocurrency offering into the United Kingdom market. Not only that, the company’s mobile service subsidiary, Venmo, also revealed that it’s looking to roll out digital asset services to its 29 million users sometime over the next few months.As per reports, BNY Mellon is looking to manage cryptocurrencies using a platform that is currently in its prototype phase. In this regard, it has also been reported that the system will in addition be capable of handling a wide array of traditional holdings such as Treasurys and stocks.It also appears as though the financial institution has not outlined which crypto assets it will be providing its custody services for. Furthermore, BNY Mellon has already deployed a team of executives, led by Michael Demissie, to spur the integration of cryptocurrency custody and management into the bank’s existing product suite.Speaking with Cointelegraph, Hank Holland, founder and managing partner of private equity firm Pegasus Growth Capital and former managing director of Merrill Lynch, opined that as an established, trusted private bank and one of the largest custodians servicing registered investment advisers, BNY’s commitment to custody digital assets is a necessary, predicated step for broader investor acceptance and adoption of BTC and other crypto assets:The first exposure for most of BNY’s clients, according to Holland, will be to buy BTC in order to incorporate the asset into their overall strategic allocation outlook. However, initial client purchases may be followed by other investments into an actively managed portfolio of diverse digital assets, as well as borrowing/staking strategies to supplement their regular income streams.Similarly, Marcos Benítez Rubianes, client relationship manager for Gazprombank, told Cointelegraph that the news confirms the traditional financial system’s overall growing acceptance of Bitcoin — the oldest, most liquid crypto asset — adding:Additionally, Rubianes is confident that in the near future, more traditional players will embrace Bitcoin as an asset, maybe even as a payment means, especially because their clients will feel the need to stay abreast with the times and will pressure these institutions to provide them with increased crypto exposure.With Bitcoin now beginning to target the $50,000 threshold, it’s worth delving into the question of whether a rally may be looming on the horizon. On the subject, Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner of Nexo — a crypto exchange and lending service — told Cointelegraph that it’s one thing when a tech firm like Tesla embraces BTC, but it’s a whole new ball game when the oldest lender in the U.S. does it, adding: “Generational clashes are always fascinating to watch. Banks that follow suit, and many inevitably will, will simply be second.”Rubianes believes that another surge may be in the cards if more financial incumbents take the step toward integrating crypto. If that happens, he believes that interest in the space could potentially increase tenfold. “Those in the crypto space understand quite clearly that one of the most significant barriers to crypto adoption has been, perhaps ironically, the self-custody part,” he added.However, not everybody shares this narrative. Alexander Suhobokov, head of fintech at Switzerland-based Dukascopy Bank, told Cointelegraph that even though a gradual integration of the crypto and traditional financial industries is actively ongoing, and banks that don’t get with the times in the next one to two years will face a real risk of losing their competitive edge, it's highly unlikely that this news will have any major impact on BTC:Following BNY’s, Mastercard’s and PayPal’s commitment to exploring the crypto landscape more closely in the near future, Twitter — home to Jack Dorsey, the man behind financial services firm Square — recently confirmed that it is looking to offer its employees the possibility of receiving their salaries in Bitcoin.Not only that, the social media giant’s chief financial officer, Ned Segal, stated that the company is exploring the option of adding BTC to its existing balance sheets. However, he believes that much of this will depend on whether or not enough people are interested in conducting BTC transactions with the tech firm.Lastly, Daniel Pinto, co-president of major U.S. investment bank JPMorgan Chase, stated in a recent interview that the company too will eventually have to get involved in Bitcoin.“The demand isn’t there yet, but I’m sure it will be at some point,” he added.Overall, looking at the sentiment surrounding the space, it seems that there is confidence growing surrounding BTCs chances of reaching the all-important $50,000 psychological barrier, especially as the premier cryptocurrency continues to successfully stave off the bearish momentum that sent the digital asset’s value to as low as $46,110 over the course of the last 24 hours. As a result, BTC is once again sitting comfortably at around the $48,000 mark."
330,"A major financial regulator in Thailand is looking to determine qualifications for cryptocurrency traders to ensure investor protection.The Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand has scheduled a public hearing this month to address specific requirements for investors who want to open a crypto trading account, local news agency The Bangkok Post reported Monday.By initiating the new qualification system, the Thai SEC intends to ensure that new retail investors moving into crypto trading have sufficient financial resources to absorb risks from the highly volatile prices of crypto.The Thai SEC’s secretary-general, Ruenvadee Suwanmongkol, hinted that Thailand’s upcoming crypto investor qualification could involve requirements such as age, trading experience and financial knowledge as well as certain wealth levels:The official also noted crypto investors should be well informed about the risks of cryptocurrency trading. “Digital assets are a big challenge, not only in Thailand but for global regulators,” she added.The new qualification system apparently came under the impetus of Thai Finance Minister Arkhom Termpittayapaisith, who asked the SEC to supervise local digital exchanges to protect new investors. Local authorities are specifically concerned about novice crypto investors moving into the industry amid a massive surge of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC).Last week, Termpittayapaisith expressed concerns about surging crypto trading volumes in Thailand, warning investors of the massive risks associated with crypto trading. “Cryptocurrencies have enormous risk,"" the official said. ""Risk awareness will help those investors in avoiding excessive speculation on those assets.”According to data collected by The Bangkok Post, crypto purchases by Thai retail investors have been consistently increasing, from 500 million baht ($16.7 million) in November 2020 to 1.1 billion baht ($40 million) in January. The SEC reportedly said that the number of new crypto investors surged by 124,000 accounts in the first week of February, totaling nearly 600,000 accounts as of Feb. 8.According to the data, Bitcoin was the most traded cryptocurrency on Thai exchanges in January, accounting for over 40% of the total trading volume. The cryptocurrency is followed by Ether (ETH), with about 24%, and Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP, accounting for 19% and 12%, respectively."
331,"Former Coinbase chief technology officer Balaji Srinivasan thinks India’s impending cryptocurrency ban would be akin to banning the internet and could cost the country trillions of dollars in potential profits.Speaking in an interview with The CapTable, Srinivasan said a blanket ban on Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies would simply redirect trade revenue to nearby Asian markets, amounting to a “trillion-dollar” mistake for India:On Thursday, an anonymous senior Finance Ministry official told Bloomberg that the upcoming ban was very likely to occur, revealing that crypto holders will have three to six months to convert their funds back into legal tender.The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill was introduced in late January, and it also lays the groundwork for an official digital currency issued and overseen by the Reserve Bank of India.Now an angel investor and entrepreneur, Srinivasan suggested that India could end up 20% poorer than it otherwise would be over the next five years, should the ban go through. The former general partner at Andreessen Horowitz said that a cryptocurrency ban would effectively stop the “financial internet” from taking root in India:Although the ban targets all cryptocurrency holders, its effect on individuals could be less impactful than its effect on traders and businesses. With the use of cold storage wallets, and by retaining control of their own private keys, Indian citizens on the ground level could still potentially skirt any anti-crypto legislation but would naturally face difficulties when trying to cash out."
332,"In the last 24 hours, $1.89 billion worth of futures positions have been liquidated after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) sharply fell, with BTC reaching below $46,000 on Binance.Most of the liquidations came from Bitcoin and Ether, which accounted for $555 million and $336 million, respectively. But altcoins like XRP, EOS and Litecoin (LTC) also saw large liquidations as the market plummeted.The lion's share of the liquidations happened on Binance, while Bitfinex saw the least. This suggests that the former may have the biggest share of novice traders, according to Bitfinex chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino.""Bitfinex has almost 1B in open interest but extremely low liquidation rate compared to competition,"" explained Ardoino.Bitcoin was relatively resilient compared with the rest of the market during the correction. Mostly, large-cap altcoins and decentralized finance tokens saw the biggest losses, such as Cosmos' ATOM and SushiSwap's SUSHI dropping by over 20% in a single day.The market likely corrected as a result of the altcoin futures market being extremely overheated for a prolonged period.In recent weeks, many altcoins on platforms like Binance Futures saw funding rates spike to around 0.3% to 0.7%. This is 30 to 70 times higher than the average 0.01%.This is likely the reason behind Bitcoin’s relatively small drop of around 7% compared with the 20% to 30% corrections in the altcoin market.But unlike Bitcoin, Ether showed short-term weakness even as Bitcoin was rallying to a new all-time high, as Cointelegraph reported.Hence, when BTC began to fall, Ether saw a much larger loss compared with Bitcoin, dropping by 9% in the same period.Throughout February, especially when the ETH/BTC pair was showing strength, ETH saw a smaller pullback compared with Bitcoin as it entered price discovery. The weakness of ETH against Bitcoin has had a negative impact on the altcoin market in the last 24 hours.According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, there are enough stablecoin reserves in the cryptocurrency exchange market to trigger another leg up for Bitcoin.In the crypto market, sidelined capital is often stored in stablecoins rather than cash or in bank accounts because they are much easier and faster to deploy on exchanges. Ju said that it is an ideal time to buy Bitcoin, given that a newfound rally is more likely. He wrote:In addition to favorable fundamentals, altcoins have begun to recover quickly after a capitulation-like correction.Following the strong relief rally of altcoins, Bitcoin and Ether followed suit, recovering to $48,000 and $1,800, respectively.The combination of the swift recovery of large-cap altcoins and the abundance of stablecoins on exchanges raises the probability of the BTC rally to continue."
333,"Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies look nothing like the tulip mania of the 17th century, even after their rapid gains, one macro investor says.In a tweet on Monday, Dan Tapeiro, co-founder of 10T Holdings, argued that in terms of price relative to average income, Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) still have a long way to go before challenging tulips.Tulip mania was a brief but intense speculative bubble in what is now the Netherlands that lasted only a matter of months between late 1636 and February 1637.While only impacting a tiny section of the economy, at its height a single pound of bulbs cost a reported 1,500 guilders — roughly equivalent to four years’ salary for a skilled carpenter. The implosion, which had unknown origins, caused a 90% price drop.Bitcoin naysayers frequently compare bull runs in the cryptocurrency to tulip mania, arguing that the  “intrinsic value” of the two assets is essentially all but absent and speculation rules the market.In terms of raw numbers, however, BTC/USD hardly trades at 10 times the average salary in the United States, Tapeiro says.“No mania in #bitcoin yet,” he summarized.12 years on, Bitcoin has already outlasted the speculative bubbles of both tulips and the South Sea Company.A $320,000 price for Bitcoin lies beyond most estimates of near- and mid-term price potential. 2021, according to the popular, hitherto accurate stock-to-flow-based price models, should produce an average of either $100,000 or $288,000 per coin.Even if the mythical tulip level should hit, Bitcoin is already heralded as a revolution in money, arguably better at performing the job of a store of value than gold itself.Bitcoin’s scarcity versus gold — and of course, tulips — also allows it to function as a solid store of value regardless of how high its price becomes and how many people invest in it.“There’s no such thing as being ‘too late’ to #bitcoin, it’s going to pump forever,” Pierre Rochard, Bitcoin strategist at major U.S. exchange Kraken, said on Monday.At the time of writing, BTC/USD is already up 62% this year, while ETH/USD is up 144%."
334,"Japanese financial conglomerate SBI Holdings is reportedly planning to set up a joint cryptocurrency venture with foreign financial companies.SBI CEO Yoshitaka Kitao said that the Japanese company is in talks with other financial firms to launch a crypto venture, Reuters reported Monda. The executive said that SBI currently has two potential deals.As part of the initiative, SBI is considering large-scale mergers and acquisitions. Kitao stated that such a deal would be necessary for SBI to maintain its position as a leading financial services company:SBI’s plans for the upcoming global crypto venture were apparently pushed by major financial institutions like Tesla and Mastercard announcing their crypto-related plans last week. “Institutional investors, mainly hedge funds, have recently started investing in cryptocurrencies,"" Kitao said. ""Not just institutional investors but also Elon Musk has.”Kitao did not specify the potential partners. SBI did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.In December 2020, SBI announced a joint crypto-related venture with Switzerland’s principal stock exchange, SIX Swiss Exchange. As part of the initiative, SIX Digital Exchange and SBI’s crypto arm, SBI Digital Asset Holdings, were launching a new crypto platform in Singapore."
335,"As institutions move into the cryptocurrency space, the need for clear rules regarding digital assets is critical, an official at the Securities and Exchange Commission said.SEC commissioner Hester Peirce believes that clear cryptocurrency rules are needed now more than ever due to firms like Tesla and Mastercard actively embracing the alternative asset class.Peirce discussed the implications of institutional crypto adoption with Reuters on Saturday, following a series of massive crypto-related events in the last few weeks. After Elon Musk’s Tesla hinted at payments in Bitcoin (BTC), more companies including the United States’ oldest bank BNY Mellon and payment giant Mastercard announced plans to introduce crypto services as well.“That adds to the urgency of us taking some sort of action in this area to provide more clarity,” the commissioner said. Widely referred to as “Crypto Mom” in the crypto community, Peirce has been consistently advocating for clear crypto rules, calling on the SEC to provide more clarity in order to allow the crypto industry to thrive without fear of breaking the law.Peirce noted that the new presidential administration combined with the crypto push from institutional investors could provide a new perspective on crypto regulation:Peirce also weighed in on the GameStop saga, stating that it is still too soon for regulators to make policy-defining conclusions from the meme-fuelled stock pump, though she reportedly supports the new generation of traders participating in the market. As previously reported, U.S. regulators have been looking into popular trading app Robinhood for suspending GameStop trading after Reddit group r/WallStreetBets performed a short squeeze, pumping the price above $370.Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev and Citadel CEO Ken Griffin will testify before Congress alongside other involved parties on Thursday."
336,"The value of Dogecoin (DOGE) sank 23% in a matter of hours on Monday after Elon Musk drew attention to the vastly unequal distribution of DOGE tokens and urged major holders to sell off their holdingsDogecoin has one of the most unequal coin distributions in the cryptocurrency space, with 28.7% being held by just one person and the top 12 holders possessing almost 50% of the supply. On Sunday, Just before midnight UCT, Musk tweeted:A little over seven hours later, Dogecoin's price had plunged 23% from $0.063 to $0.048. While Musk’s tweets have previously been credited with moving cryptocurrency prices, not least Dogecoin, his role in Monday’s drop was less clear given that over $105 billion departed the rest of the global market capitalization at the same time.Losses in excess of 20% were a common sight among the crypto market cap rankings, with altcoins, in particular, subject to an enormous pullback. Analysts suggest this was caused by Bitcoin’s (BTC) push to a new all-time high just hours earlier, which pulled volume out of the altcoin market.Calculating the exact distribution of a given cryptocurrency can be difficult because public blockchains tend to be either pseudonymous or anonymous. But data from several available sources shows that almost 70% of the entire Dogecoin supply is held in just over 100 addresses.The founder of Dogecoin recently revealed that he sold all of his DOGE holdings in 2015 in the midst of financial difficulties after losing his job. Billy Markus started Dogecoin as a joke in 2013 based on the then-popular Shiba Inu dog meme. Markus said he struggled to comprehend, let alone explain, the meteoric rise of something that appeared to offer no real utility or value.Musk's flirtation with Dogecoin appears to be largely in the name of humor. The Tesla founder once proclaimed himself the self-appointed CEO of Dogecoin — an open-source cryptocurrency — and his interactions with the coin thus far have mostly been based around memes, rather than any kind of investment strategy."
337,"Bitcoin (BTC) is riding high on a wave of positive sentiment as it prepares to take on $50,000.After a volatile weekend that saw a new all-time high, expectations are putting Bitcoin back in the spotlight as a fundamental level comes into play — what’s in store?Cointelegraph considers five factors that could serve to move the market in the coming days.Stocks are climbing, building on a record-breaking rally that has seen many indexes already shoot higher than ever.Despite warnings that the good times may soon end, including from Warren Buffett’s market indicator last week, markets began Monday in the green.Japan’s Nikkei touched 30,000 points for the first time since 1990 on 1.6% growth.At the same time, the strength of the U.S. dollar continues to falter. The U.S. dollar currency index, which measures the dollar against a basket of trading partner currencies, abandoned its latest attempt at a rebound over the weekend to test support at 90 once again.The index has been in a bearish mood for much of the past year, and Bitcoin has, in turn, gained from periods of express weakness and seen retreats during trend-bucking comebacks.Long term, however, central bank money printing is ensuring that in many jurisdictions, the economic environment will not revert to its former character any time soon.Responding to a Valentine’s Day post from the European Central Bank Saifedean Ammous, author of popular book The Bitcoin Standard, had little sympathy. The institution had promised to “keep financing conditions favourable ‘Til the crisis is through.”“This is why fiat people spend their pathetic lives hyperventilating over one imaginary crises to another,” he responded.When it comes to Bitcoin specifically, it’s (mostly) about the short term for investors this week.One event in particular — how and when the largest cryptocurrency will break $50,000 — is a talking point across the industry.The weekend produced a concerted effort to crack the latest psychologically significant level, with a classic “out-of-hours” bout of volatility producing new all-time highs of $49,714.With sellers lined up at the final hurdle, however, $50,000 eluded the bulls and BTC/USD retreated lower before continuing to consolidate at around $47,000.“Huh? #Bitcoin market doesn’t go up in a straight line?” an unsurprised Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe summarized on Monday.Van de Poppe had frequently warned that Bitcoin’s vertical upside could not sustain without multiple, and sometimes intense, pullbacks.In his own forecast, meanwhile, fellow analyst Filbfilb produced a new chart with a potential end-of-month BTC price as high as $78,000.“The continually good news narrative we have seen makes me think this is entirely possible,” he added in comments on Twitter.The target expands filbfilb’s previous expectations of $52,000 forming the next point of consolidation before a run to $63,000.Filbfilb’s “good news narrative” refers to an ongoing phenomenon reminiscent of a domino effect among major institutions reevaluating and flipping bullish on Bitcoin.Last week alone, Tesla bought in bigtime, while America’s oldest bank, BNY Mellon, announced that it would offer cryptocurrency support for institutional clients. Now, anticipation focuses on Morgan Stanley making official the rumors surrounding its new Bitcoin punt that allegedly involves its investment arm.At the same time, opponents of its success appear to be increasingly despairing at their lack of ability to stop it via traditional means.A key case in point is Nigeria, which last week saw its own politicians admit that Bitcoin had destroyed the value of its national fiat currency, the naira.“Cryptocurrency has become a worldwide transaction of which you cannot even identify who owns what,” Senator Sani Musa said.The picture could not be more different than the fortunes of those already, to a greater or lesser extent, on a “Bitcoin standard.”Even Tesla, which bought in at the start of 2021, is already up 40% on its $1.5 billion treasury conversion. On the back of fellow pioneer MicroStrategy’s dedicated “Bitcoin for Institutions” summit earlier this month, similar stories are likely to follow.As Cointelegraph often reports, various indicators, both simple and complex, point to the potential for considerable Bitcoin price upside across time frames.Zooming out, however, new data simply governing spot price highlights what one analyst believes is almost a carbon copy of the previous bull cycle.“It's pretty mindblowing that the Bitcoin chart is damn near IDENTICAL to Aug. 2017,” Jack Purdy, a researcher at data provider Messari, tweeted on Sunday.Responding, Glassnode chief technology officer and co-founder Rafael Schultze-Kraft calculated that based on its current position in the cycle, BTC/USD has the postential to go to $274,000 — an increase of 471%, in line with 2017 behavior.At the same time, Glassnode highlighted a distinguishing factor since Bitcoin’s most recent block subsidy halving last year. Miners, apart from some conspicuous occasions, are selling less than during previous bull runs despite spot price being far higher.“Previous #Bitcoin bull markets are characterized by fingerprints of increased miner outflows of $BTC that had been acquired throughout prior years,” the firm noted on Monday.Finally, to put last week’s price action in context, Bitcoin has seen its biggest weekly candle in history.At 25%, or $9,800, Bitcoin added a quarter of its value again over the past seven days. That follows various similar feats, including the largest ever daily candle earlier in February.Against such strong performance, even the correction lower at just before $50,000 was of little concern to analysts beyond the mainstream press on Monday.“Aggressive selling by larger derivatives traders have lead to a big CVD div while $btc price has drifted up. (absorption of sellers by buyers),” Filbfilb explained in a tweet.Filbfilb was referring to the funding rate on major exchanges increasing, causing long traders to pay more to maintain their positions near psychologically significant price points.Quotes in this article taken from previously published sources have been lightly edited."
338,"When BitMEX launched its Bitcoin (BTC) perpetual futures market in 2016, it created a new paradigm for cryptocurrency traders. Although this was not the first platform to offer BTC-settled inverse swaps, BitMEX brought usability and liquidity to a broader audience of investors.BitMEX contracts did not involve fiat or stablecoins and even though the reference price was calculated in the U.S. dollar, all profits and losses were paid in BTC.Fast forward to 2021, and Tether (USDT)-settled contracts have gained relevance. Using USDT-based contracts certainly makes it easier for retail investors to calculate their profit, loss and the required margin required, but they also have disadvantages.Binance offers coin-margined (BTC-settled) contracts, and in this case, instead of relying on USDT margin, the buyer (long) and the seller (short) are required to deposit BTC as margin.When trading coin-margined contracts, there is no need to use stablecoins. Therefore, it has less collateral (margin) risk. Algorithmic-backed stablecoins have stabilization issues, while the fiat-backed ones run risks of seizures and government controls. Therefore, by exclusively depositing and redeeming BTC, a trader can bypass these risks.On the negative side, whenever the price of BTC goes down, so does one's collateral in dollar terms. This impact happens because the contracts are priced in dollars. Whenever a futures position is opened, the quantity is always in contract quantity, either one contract equals one dollar at Bitmex and Deribit, or one contract equals 100 dollars at Binance, Huobi and OKEx.This effect is known as nonlinear inverse future returns, and the buyer incurs more losses when BTC's price collapses. The difference grows wider the further the reference price moves down from the initial position.USDT-settled futures contracts are easier to manage because the returns are linear and unaffected by strong BTC price moves. For those willing to short the futures contracts, there is no need to buy BTC at any time, but there are costs involved to keep open positions.This contract doesn't need an active hedge to protect collateral (margin) exposure, thus it’s a better choice for retail traders.It is worth noting that carrying long-term positions on any stablecoins has an embedded risk, which increases when third party custody services are used. This is one reason why stakers can obtain over 11% APY on stablecoin deposits.Whether an investor measures returns in BTC or fiat also plays a massive part in this decision. Arbitrage desks and market makers tend to prefer USDT-settled contracts, as their alternative investment is either staking or low-risk cash and carry trades.On the other hand, cryptocurrency retail investors usually hold BTC or switch into altcoins aiming for higher returns than a fixed APY. Thus, by being the preferred instrument of professional traders, USDT-settled futures are gaining more traction.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
339,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) definitive breakout above $50,000 may have to wait longer to materialize as spot buying pressure on Coinbase Pro shows signs of weakening — at least in the short term. The Coinbase Premium Index, which measures the gap between BTC price on Coinbase Pro and Binance, has flipped negative, according to CryptoQuant. In other words, selling pressure on Coinbase appears to be strengthening compared with other exchanges like Binance.A negative reading on the Coinbase Premium Index could be a precursor to short-term resistance. On the other hand, when the premium is high, it indicates strong spot buying pressure on Coinbase.Based on the index, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju believes that topping $50,000 “looks pretty tough” in the near term.Breaking 50k looks pretty tough as Coinbase premium becomes -$45

Chart https://t.co/gC1Jqrbn9b pic.twitter.com/LyVzZamlta“Current buying power doesn’t come from Coinbase,” he added. “No more Coinbase premium compared to Binance/Huobi/OKEx. Be careful.”Coinbase has become a major bellwether for Bitcoin demand due to its popularity among large institutional buyers. These market participants acquire their BTC via over-the-counter markets on Coinbase Pro. Although these large purchases don’t immediately impact BTC price, they signify growing demand for the digital asset and, in turn, diminishing supply. The Coinbase Premium Index, therefore, is one way to gauge institutional demand for BTC in the short term.A short-term fluctuation in the Coinbase premium doesn’t appear to have any bearing on Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. The digital asset remains in a strong uptrend, having peaked well north of $49,700 on Sunday, according to TradingView data.Bitcoin's price has gained a whopping 28% over the past week, thanks in large part to Tesla’s planned acquisition of the asset. Based on the electric vehicle maker’s most recent 10K filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, it plans to allocate roughly 7.7% of its gross cash position to Bitcoin.Publicly traded companies and fund managers hold roughly 6% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply — a figure that doesn’t include Tesla’s $1.5 billion position."
340,"Demand and supply metrics determine the price of an asset and data from Glassnode, an on-chain data firm, shows that Bitcoin’s (BTC) liquid supply has been decreasing since June 2020. This signals that traders owning Bitcoin are not selling their holdings.While the supply is shrinking, demand has been going up in the past few months as an increasing number of institutional investors have been buying Bitcoin.Bloomberg recently reported that Morgan Stanley Investment Management’s subsidiary Cointerpoint Global “is exploring whether the cryptocurrency would be a suitable option for its investors.”According to Morgan Stanley’s website, Counterpoint Global chooses to invest in assets “whose market value can increase significantly for underlying fundamental reasons.” This suggests that the bank believes Bitcoin may be undervalued compared to its fundamentals. JPMorgan Chase also hinted that it might eventually introduce Bitcoin services. JPMorgan’s co-president Daniel Pinto believes that if investors and asset managers start using Bitcoin, the bank “will have to be involved.” Pinto however said that the current demand was not strong enough, but conceded it may grow in the future.Even though Bitcoin has risen sharply in the past few months, its dominance has fallen from about 69.71% on Jan. 4 to 60.9% currently. This shows that altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the past few weeks. With an eye on altcoins, let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may trend in the next few days.Bitcoin broke above the $41,959.63 resistance on Feb. 8 with a strong up-move, but since then, the momentum has weakened. Although the price has been nudging higher, the leading cryptocurrency is facing profit-booking at intermittent levels.If the price turns down from the current levels and slips below $46,000, the correction could deepen to the strong support at $41,959.63. If the BTC/USD pair rebounds off this support, it will suggest the bulls continue to accumulate on dips, which is a sign that the uptrend is intact.The bulls will then try to drive the price above the psychological barrier at $50,000 and resume the uptrend with the next target objective at $60,974.43. On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day exponential moving average ($41,349), the pair may drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($36,070).This is an important support to watch out for because the price has not dipped below the 50-day SMA since Oct. 9. Hence, a break below it will indicate a possible change in trend. The next support on the downside is much lower at $28,850.The 4-hour chart shows the pair has formed a rising wedge pattern that will complete on a breakdown and close below the support line. If that happens, the pair may drop to $43,720.85 and then to $41,959.63.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the current levels or the 20-EMA and rises above the wedge, it will invalidate the bearish setup. A breakout above $50,000 could attract short-covering from the aggressive bears and may result in a quick up-move to $55,000.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) broke above the $539 resistance on Feb. 12 and this attracted buying from the bulls. The altcoin picked up momentum and soared above the $631.71 resistance on Feb. 13The long wick on today’s candlestick suggests short-term traders may be booking profits after the recent runup. The BCH/USD pair may now correct to $631.71 and if the bulls can flip this level into support, it will indicate buying on every minor dip.If the bulls can push the price above $730.02, the uptrend could reach $900. Both moving averages are sloping up and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the overbought zone, suggesting an advantage to the bulls.Contrary to this assumption, if the price dips and sustains below $631.71, the correction could deepen to $539.The 4-hour chart shows the bears are defending the $720 resistance and the bulls are buying on dips to $650. If the buyers can propel the price above $730.02, the uptrend could resume.On the other hand, if the price again turns down from $720, the bears will try to pull the price down to $631.71. If this support cracks, the decline could extend to the 20-EMA and then to the 50-SMA.EOS broke out of the long basing formation and started a new uptrend when it soared above the $3.95 overhead resistance on Feb. 9. The altcoin picked up momentum and the bulls pushed the price above the $5.4861 resistance on Feb. 13.However, the failure to sustain the price above $5.4861 may have attracted profit-booking from the short-term traders. This has started a correction that could extend to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $4.5014.If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will again try to push and sustain the price above the $5.4861 to $5.6118 overhead resistance. Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below $4.5014, the EOS/USD pair could drop to $3.95.Such a deep correction will suggest that the momentum has weakened and the pair could then consolidate in a wide range between $3.95 and $5.6118 for a few days.The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls have purchased the dip to the 20-EMA. If the pair sustains the rebound, the bulls will again try to push the price above $5.6118. If they succeed, the uptrend could resume.The next target objective on the upside is $6 and if that level is also scaled, the uptrend could reach $7.50. On the other hand, a break below the 20-EMA could extend the correction to the 50-SMA.Monero (XMR) broke above the $190 resistance on Feb. 12 and resumed the uptrend. The 20-day EMA ($174) has turned up and the RSI has moved into overbought territory, which suggests the bulls are in command.The bears are currently defending the psychological level at $250. The first support on the downside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at 213.6152. If the price rebounds off this level, it will suggest that traders are viewing the dips as a buying opportunity.A break above $254.45 will open the doors for a rally to $300 where the bears may again mount a stiff resistance.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below $213.6152, the correction may deepen to $190. Such a deep fall may delay the start of the next leg of the uptrend.The 4-hour chart shows the bears are defending the $240 to $254.45 resistance zone but the positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground. If the price rises from the current level or rebounds off the 20-EMA, it will signal strength.If the bulls can push the price above the overhead resistance, a rally to $268 and then to $300 is likely. This bullish view will invalidate if the XMR/USD pair dips and closes below the 20-EMA.Tezos (XTZ) broke above the previous all-time high at $4.4936 on Feb. 12 and has made a new high at $5.6471 today. Whenever an asset hits a new high, it indicates that bulls are in control.Another thing that usually happens when a major resistance is broken is that the price turns down and retests the breakout level. In this case, the price could dip to the breakout level at $4.4936.If the price rebounds off this level, it will suggest that traders are buying on dips and have flipped the previous resistance to support. The bulls will then attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $5.6471.If they succeed, the XTZ/USD pair could rally to $7.1407. This bullish view will invalidate if the pair breaks and sustains below $4.4936.The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls could not sustain the price above $5.40, which may have attracted profit-booking from short-term traders. The bulls are currently attempting to defend the 20-EMA.If the price rebounds off this support, it will signal strength. A break above $5.6471 may resume the up-move. On the other hand, if the price dips below the 20-EMA and the $4.4936 support, the correction could deepen to the 50-SMA.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

341,"Altcoins plunged steeply on Feb. 14 after the price of Bitcoin (BTC) achieved a new all-time high above $49,000.The timing of the altcoin market’s drop was noteworthy because it corrected as BTC was rallying, which typically does not happen.There are two main reasons why the altcoin market pulled back despite the strength of the dominant cryptocurrency.First, when the price of Bitcoin rallied to a new record-high, it sucked out most of the volume in the cryptocurrency market. This naturally caused the market to sway towards BTC, contributing to the pullback of altcoins.Second, Ether (ETH), which often leads the momentum of the altcoin market, fell sharply against Bitcoin.The combination of these two factors, combined with the uncertainty around Bitcoin at the $50,000 resistance level, has amplified the selling pressure on the altcoin market.A pseudonymous trader known as “Kaleo” emphasized that predicting Bitcoin’s rally to $50,000 was arguably straightforward.But, whether BTC breaks past $50,000 remains an important question that would decide the direction of the crypto market’s near-term price cycle. He said:If Bitcoin consolidates first before breaking out of $50,000, theoretically, this trend would likely benefit altcoins in the foreseeable future.During a Bitcoin uptrend, altcoins tend to surge when BTC is consolidating after an initial impulse rally. However, when BTC is rallying or seeing a slight pullback, altcoins often see large price drops against both BTC and the U.S. dollar.For now, Bitcoin is maintaining its bullish market structure, which would relieve some of the selling pressure on the altcoin market in the foreseeable future.Scott Melker, a cryptocurrency trader and analyst, said that Bitcoin is continuing to see consecutive bull flags.Bull flags are a market structure in technical analysis that materialize when the asset breaks out after consolidating within a range.This typically demonstrates a staircase-like rally that is sustainable over the longer term. Melker said:As long as Bitcoin defends the newly established $48,200 support area and consolidates between $48,200 and $49,700, another breakout is more probable.If Bitcoin sees another breakout, this time, the altcoin market is likely to rally in tandem with Bitcoin after seeing an initial dip on BTC’s first impulse rally."
342,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) achieved a new record above $49,000 on Valentine's Day on Feb. 14, rising to as high as $49,344 on Coinbase.There are three main reasons Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high, namel high stablecoin inflows, clean break of the $38,000 resistance area, and a prolonged consolidation phase.Throughout the past several days, despite Bitcoin’s consolidation below $38,000, on-chain analysts pinpointed the continuous increase in stablecoin inflows.According to data from CryptoQuant, a data analytics platform, the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) rose significantly as it rallied from the mid-$30,000 region.The SSR indicator shows the ratio of the market cap of Bitcoin relative to the aggregated market cap of stablecoins.When the price of Bitcoin rises in tandem with the SSR ratio, then it means it is likely being driven by sidelined capital re-entering the market.This trend is highly optimistic because it shows that the rally was not just driven by an over-leveraged futures market. In fact, it was genuine demand from the spot market that led the uptrend.Atop the high stablecoin ratio, analysts also pinpointed the decline in selling pressure coming from miners.What is also interesting is that miners are not so eager to sell their #Bitcoin the last two weeks.

Either they are convinced it is going up or simply are out of bullets. pic.twitter.com/GDYzP33948The combination of the lower selling pressure from miners and the increasing stablecoin inflows into exchanges catalyzed the ongoing Bitcoin rally.Bitcoin was consolidating under the $38,000 resistance area for a prolonged period. This presented a risk to the short-term bull cycle of Bitcoin.When the price of Bitcoin hovers under a key resistance area for a long time, it increases the probability of BTC dropping to a lower support area to tap lower liquidity.This is partially the reason why Bitcoin regularly dropped to around $44,000 before its eventual impulse rally above $38,000.A relatively long consolidation period normally leads to two scenarios: a severe breakdown or a major breakout.If Bitcoin rallies without strong fundamentals to support the rally, there is a bigger chance that the consolidation leads to a deep correction.But, in the case of Bitcoin in the last three days, its consolidation phase under $38,000 was backed by rising stablecoin inflows, a high Coinbase premium, and a generally high trading volume across both spot and futures markets.Hence, even though the futures market remains highly leveraged and overcrowded, BTC has been able to push through the resistance area despite the risk of a long squeeze.In the foreseeable future, there are several reasons that make the rally sustainable. First, the stablecoin inflows are not slowing down.Second, today’s rally reversed the bearish market structure to a bullish short-term trend across lower time frames.As long as Bitcoin remains above the $38,000 level, which has turned into a support area, its near-term bullish market structure would remain intact."
343,"Users can send cryptocurrencies virtually anywhere globally via the blockchains on which they are based. By sending crypto assets, however, fees are incurred. Transactions may take longer for certain assets, depending on their related blockchains. Certain crypto wallets and platforms give users the option to choose a transaction fee. Higher fees typically result in faster transactions. Over the years, however, some asset holders have put their coin or token values into the wrong fields, resulting in exorbitant, albeit accidental, fee payments. For example, a holder might intend to send 12 Bitcoin (BTC) at a fee of 0.01 BTC, although they might accidentally put 12 BTC into the fee box, spending 12 BTC on fees while sending just 0.01 BTC to the intended destination.A number of fee mishaps have occurred involving Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin. Here are a few painful fee stories.In February 2019, one industry participant mistakenly paid a grand sum of 2,730 ETH for fees as part of three Ethereum-based transactions. The sender paid fees of 420, 210 and 2,100 ETH in the triad of transactions. According to ETH prices at the time of reporting in March 2019, the transaction costs totaled approximately $365,800.Fortunately, this sender received an act of good will from SparkPool, the mining pool on the other end of the transaction. “Thank you SparkPool and your miners for helping us to recover our loss,” the accidental ETH transactor noted as part of a blockchain message. “We are willing to share half of 2100 ETH with the miners to thanks the miners’ integrity,” the transactor added.Ether is now valued at $1,850 per coin at the time of publication, making this event worth just over $5 million in total.In the summer of 2020, three Ethereum transactions surfaced, incurring more than $5 million worth of total combined fees, based on ETH prices at the time. Someone sent 0.55 ETH, valued near $134 total back then, in a transaction on June 10, 2020, spending a whopping $2.6 million worth of ETH on gas — an industry term for the funds paid for transactions on Ethereum’s network.Following the multi-million-dollar fee event, two more hefty transactions surfaced. One saw another $2.6 million paid to send 350 ETH. The other transferred 3,221 ETH, tallying close to the same amount for gas — 2,310 ETH to be exact. All three moves occurred between June 10 and 11, 2020.This saga may not have been the summation of a few mistakes, however. Subsequent reporting revealed the third transaction — the one costing 2,310 ETH to move 3,221 ETH — was the result of a “malicious attack” involving a victim’s wallet.The pair of multi-million-dollar gas transfers remain without conclusive explanation, although theories have included simple user error, hacker-related blackmail efforts, and a suspected Ponzi scheme losing money. However, in today’s market, the three transactions are worth over $43.6 million.The decentralized finance boom of 2020 came with stories of significant profit, but also at least one instance of fee turmoil. DeFi took off as another likely crypto industry bubble, complete with surging prices, suspicious project activity and other drama. Largely based on Ethereum’s blockchain, the DeFi sector began seeing high transaction fees.Even given the high fees, however, one user paid far too much to send one of his trades through on Uniswap, a popular exchange in the DeFi niche. As reported in November 2020, this trader accidentally typed his gas amounts in the wrong places on his MetaMask wallet, pushing through a $120 trade while spending $9,500 on gas.“I thought that this kind of things happen to others, but I was wrong,” the trader said on Reddit.“Metamask didn’t populate the ‘Gas Limit’ field with the correct amount in my previous transaction and that transaction failed, so I decided to change it manually in the next transaction,” he explained. “But instead of typing 200000 in ‘Gas Limit’ input field, I wrote it on the ‘Gas Price’ input field, so I payed 200000 GWEI for this transaction and destroyed my life.”Although multiple Ethereum fee bumbles have arisen, crypto participants have also suffered Bitcoin fee woes. One particular painful transaction surfaced on Bitcoin’s blockchain in December 2020. The transaction shows about 3.49 BTC paid to send just 0.00005 BTC — a fee multitudes higher than would have been necessary to send that amount of Bitcoin.Based on TradingView data, Bitcoin’s price fluctuated between roughly $22,765 and $24,205 on Dec. 19, the day of the transaction, making the fee worth at least $79,000 back then. At the time of publication, such a transaction currently values approximately $170,000.A seemingly similar transaction hit Bitcoin’s blockchain on Nov. 18, 2020, revealing about 2.66 BTC spent on fees for the transfer of roughly 0.01 BTC. Based on Bitcoin’s price range for Nov. 18, the sender spent at least $45,000 to transfer a comparatively paltry sum of the asset. This fee is now worth around $130,000.Many of these transaction fee tales were likely mistakes. In crypto, taking caution is important. Rushing and distraction can sometimes lead to costly mistakes. Education is also vital. Lack of knowledge on crypto wallets, transactions and assets can yield harmful consequences when sending funds."
344,"Institutional investors are rapidly gobbling up Bitcoin, and at the time of writing, nearly 3% of the Bitcoin (BTC) in circulation are locked up in long-term holdings by these investors.Data shows that 24 entities have amassed more than 460,500 BTC, which is equivalent to $22 billion at Bitcoin's current price.According to Michael Novogratz, this figure excludes the 3 million BTC forever lost, who estimates that a supply shortage could occur shortly if institutions keep up their current buying spree.The current list of holders includes MtGox K K, which has close to 141,690 BTC ($6.6 billion). Next is Block.one with an estimated 140,000 BTC $6.5 billion). MicroStrategy also has about 71,000 BTC ( $3.3 billion) and this week Tesla bought 38,500 BTC (about $1.8 billion).Analysts now expect that holding Bitcoin in treasury will soon become a corporate standard as there are multiple technical reasons for viewing Bitcoin as an inflation hedge.First, BTC has a finite supply in circulation, mimicking gold's store of value use. Furthermore, there is no way to accelerate Bitcoin's new supply through additional mining.Large holders further reduce the circulating supply by buying significant quantities from the market and placing them in cold storage. This long-term holding culture among most crypto participants reduces the already small supply, creating a vicious circle.For savvy chief financial officers, having a portion of Bitcoin's treasury provides some regulatory hedge and arbitrage as governments cannot freeze funds.What is surprising about Tesla's decision to buy Bitcoin is the timing, as the decision happened after the BTC price hiked 250% in four months.This week's move caused BTC's market capitalization to surpass Tesla's, reaching the ninth position among all tradable assets.In the past, buying Bitcoin may have been viewed as an incredibly bold move, but now it's becoming common sense for institutional investors.With about a rough estimate of $10 trillion of corporate treasury worldwide, even a 3% allocation into BTC represents $300 billion, which is about a third of Bitcoin's aggregate value in liquid cash.Considering that over 60% of the Bitcoin supply hasn't moved in more than a year, a $300 billion inflow is nearly unimaginable for an asset with a $355 billion free float.Moreover, newly minted BTC by miners adds up to 341,640 annually, a mere $16.3 billion. Therefore it is safe to conclude that the steady allocation of BTC to corporate treasuries could more than double the current price of Bitcoin.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

345,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) abysmal December 2017 futures launch quickly fell short of investors expectations and even though the CME BTC market has surpassed $2.5 billion in open interest, the initial launch has reinforced the narrative that this week’s CME ETH futures launch will be equally bearish in the short term. Prior to the CME BTC futures launch, Bitcoin had already gained 1,900% for the year, a rally which some analysts argue was propelled by the expectation of regulated futures.Now that the CME ETH futures have launched, investors are watching closely to see if Ether (ETH) will face a similar situation as it has already gained 600% over the past year.To date, there is no way to estimate how Bitcoin would have fared without the existence of the CME and CBOE futures. Nevertheless, traders still tend to connect the CME launch to the 70% crash in BTC price that occurred in the first 3 months following the launch.Analyzing an assortment of commodities and FX contract launches over the past two decades might provide a better perspective on the matter so we will review data from the CME's historical first trade dates index to see if there is a discernible price trend that occurs after CME listings.When crude palm oil futures launched at CME in May 2010, they did not affect its ongoing price recovery as the above data indicates. Similar contracts had already existed for nearly a decade at NYMEX, thus the above event might have held lesser importance as both exchanges handle institutional clients.Multiple factors could have caused palm oil prices to hike after the CME launch, including WTI oil's 23% positive performance over the next five months.On a similar tone, the South Korean won futures listed in September 2006 and in this instance the launch did appear to have an immediate impact on price.Despite not having a futures contract, Non-Deliverable Forwards (NDF) for the South Korean won already existed ahead of the CME listing. These NDF contracts are usually traded over-the-counter (OTC) and are seldomly transferable between investors. This means that the listed futures contract had a broader number of institutions that might take part.Once again, it is impossible to estimate whether this futures contract launch had an immediate impact on price. It’s possible that the South Korean won devaluation followed the trend of emerging or Asian economies. Therefore, pinning this movement to CME futures launch seems a stretch.Both Ether and Bitcoin are usually considered scarce digital commodities, thus it makes sense to compare it against other previous CME launches.Going back to commodities, Diammonium phosphate (DAP), a widely used fertilizer, held its CME futures contracts debut in June 2004.Prior to the CME launch, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) held these contracts since 1991. Nevertheless, there’s potential evidence of a price dump ahead of the listing. However, for those analyzing a broader time frame, the listing itself seemed like a price catalyst rather than something negative.Coal futures started trading in July 2001 at CME, and unlike the previously discussed examples, it did not have a listed proxy on other exchanges. Similar to Bitcoin, a 50% hike occurred over the year and a half that preceded its debut.The result mimics Bitcoin's listing, as the commodity dropped 33% during the next twelve months.To conclude, there is no set trend which allows anlayts to predict an assets performance after a CME listing. Multiple historical events have been lined up, and a concrete pattern has not been found.Not every futures contract gathers relevant liquidity and the CBOE Bitcoin futures delisting proves this point.At this point, it’s safe to conclude that Ether’s future price performance will depend on a range of factors like the performance of Eth2 and its crucial role in the DeFi sector.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

346,"Morgan Stanley, one of the biggest investment banks in the U.S., is reportedly considering investing in Bitcoin (BTC), according to reports.Bloomberg reported that Morgan Stanley’s $150 billion investing arm called Counterpoint Global could place Bitcoin to “its list of possible bets.”Hours before the news was released, the price of Bitcoin dropped by nearly 4% from $48,000 to as low as $46,252 on Binance.The price of Bitcoin began to recover when the news broke, rising from around $46,300 to above $47,300, by nearly 3%.Morgan Stanley’s Counterpoint Global considering Bitcoin as an investment is noteworthy because of two main reasons.First, Morgan Stanley is a top financial institution in the U.S., and its influence in the banking sector is immense. Second, it comes after the bank boosted its holdings in MicroStrategy, which has accumulated over a billion dollars in Bitcoin to date.Bloomberg reported that Counterpoint Global is “is exploring whether the cryptocurrency would be a suitable option for its investors, according to people with knowledge of the matter.”The firm would still need approval from relevant parties and regulators. As such, even if the bank’s investment arm decides to invest in Bitcoin, it could still take a while for it to materialize.The news comes just a month after Morgan Stanley increased its stake in MicroStrategy to nearly 650,000 shares, equivalent to over 10% of the firm.MicroStrategy, a publicly-listed business intelligence firm in the U.S., has moved the cryptocurrency market by storm after its aggressive accumulation of BTC as its treasury asset. Its stock price has also seen incredible growth over the past few months, which has even outperformed BTC. Since late 2020, MicroStrategy, led by its CEO Michael Saylor, have been continuously investing in Bitcoin and leading seminars to assist other corporations to follow suit.On Feb. 4, for example, MicroStrategy conducted a seminar with 1,400 companies to discuss the “Bitcoin Corporate Strategy” and ways to gain exposure to BTC as a corporation.The combination of large institutional capital inflows into the Bitcoin market and the vocal support for cryptocurrencies from financial institutions is improving the public’s perception of Bitcoin.As a result, banks and public corporations are facing pressure to either explain why they aren't investing in BTC or get on board.Speaking to CNBC, JPMorgan co-president and COO Daniel Pinto said that the bank could support Bitcoin trading if it sees sufficient demand. He said:Generally, more financial institutions have begun to support Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency sector, which benefits the overall infrastructure of the market.As Cointelegraph reported, BNY Mellon is also planning to custody Bitcoin in the foreseeable future."
347,"According to a report from Bloomberg news this morning, Morgan Stanley is the latest major financial institution to consider an investment in Bitcoin. Citing “people with knowledge of the matter,” the report says that Cointerpoint Global, a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Investment Management with $150 billion in assets under management, “is exploring whether the cryptocurrency would be a suitable option for its investors.”Morgan Stanley’s website describes Counterpoint Global as a fund specializing in investments “whose market value can increase significantly for underlying fundamental reasons.” The fund is up 72.7% on the year, significantly outperforming the MSCI All Country World Net Index returns of 16.25%.The growing interest in Bitcoin shouldn’t necessarily come as a surprise, given that the company has made significant investment in Microstrategy. In Janurary, Cointelegraph reported that Morgan Stanley had purchased a 10% stake in Microstrategy, whose stock has been on a tear and whose CEO has become a Bitcoin icon since announcing a strategic investment in Bitcoin last year.Morgan Stanley isn’t the only major banking institution looking to get involved with cryptocurrencies, either. On their q4 earnings calls, both JP Morgan and Visa reaffirmed plans to maintain crypto payment services, and representatives of both companies expressed interest in further development if clients and market conditions demanded."
348,"At the time of publication, one Bitcoin (BTC) values $47,247, while one Dogecoin (DOGE) is worth around $0.068. If you are new to crypto or markets, you may initially think: Hey, DOGE is cheaper than Bitcoin, and if it picks up enough steam, maybe it could catch up to BTC and rise over $20,000, too. This way of thinking, however, is illogical. Why? Market capitalization and asset supply. Market cap is the combined dollar value of an asset’s circulating supply. It changes as the value of a given asset rises and falls. Crypto metrics websites, such as CoinMarketCap, rank each cryptocurrency in order of market cap. Bitcoin is the long-standing front runner in this category, holding a market cap of about $879 billion at the time of publication.Market cap takes each asset’s circulating supply into account. Circulating supply is the amount of any given asset freely moving around the market. Multiply the circulating supply by the asset’s price and you get its market cap.Assets with more circulating supply often trade at cheaper prices in terms of dollar value per coin or token. BTC currently holds a comparatively low circulating supply of about 18.6 million, and even though this number increases slowly based on mining, its maximum supply is still relatively small at 21 million coins. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has a circulating supply of about 128.3 billion, based on CoinMarketCap numbers.Given DOGE’s circulating supply, its market cap would hit approximately $800 billion if each coin were priced at roughly $6.23. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is worth more than $40,000 per coin near that same market cap due to its lower circulating supply.Reaching a price of even $1,500 per DOGE would require the asset to have a market cap of roughly $192.4 trillion. At the time of publication, the entire crypto market has a market cap of about $1.46 trillion.Generally, assets with low circulating supply can rise higher in price per coin than assets with large supply counts. Yearn.finance’s YFI, for example, holds a very small circulating supply of just 36,635. YFI went from approximately $900 in July 2020 to $40,000 in September 2020. A multitude of other components factor into price rises, but typically, if an asset has a comparatively larger circulating supply, its price per coin cannot be directly compared to the price of coins with a smaller supply.Crypto assets also often hold a maximum supply programmed into their code. Each asset’s available supply grows continuously through various forms of blockchain network validation — i.e., mining or staking — until it reaches its maximum supply. Prices can dilute as coins or tokens flow into their related circulating supply, as validators tend to sell their rewards for supporting the network to pay off their costs of doing business.What is the difference between total supply and maximum supply? “Total supply refers to the number of coins or tokens that currently exists and are either in circulation or locked somehow,” writes Henrique Erhardt in an article for Binance Academy, adding: “It is the sum of coins that were already mined (or issued) minus the total of coins that were burned or destroyed.”Meanwhile, the maximum supply is an asset’s entire all-time supply or, more specifically, the total amount of coins or tokens that have or can be created. This means that once the maximum supply is reached, there would be no way to produce any more coins or tokens.Understanding the concept of market cap as it relates to any given asset’s price can be important, allowing you to assess the crypto space more realistically. You may look at the price of a single Bitcoin and view it as too expensive, immediately shifting your focus toward something cheaper.A plethora of information goes into crypto investing. Assets vary in their use cases, adoption, profit potential and associated risks, among other factors. Viewing each asset in light of its particular market cap, price and supply, however, can help in evaluating the market."
349,"Bitcoin (BTC) price posted a 25% gain after this week’s news of Tesla’s $1.5 billion BTC investment came out. Prior to this reveal, BTC was lagging behind Ether’s (ETH) performance by 7.5% but the numerous bullish events of the past few days helped BTC to hit a new all-time high at $48,900.Previous to Tesla’s announcement, BTC price was trading in the $30,000 to $41,500 range for nearly 3 weeks and once the price broke out one would expect pro traders and arbitrage desks to follow the bullish trend.Rather than flipping long, many of the top traders opened short positions as BTC commenced its 25% move. This seems risky given that this week Bitcoin received praises from JPMorgan’s co-president and regulators approve a BTC ETF approval in Canada.Historical data shows that Bitcoin price actions tend to trade in tandem with Ether, which has been strongly bullish for months. Adding to this bullish scenario, Bitcoin's Lightning Network announced a record node count and the total value locked (TVL) surpassed $42 million.Mastercard also announced that it would support cryptocurrency payments on its network by the end of 2021.These bullish signals contrast with the long-to-short net positioning metrics provided by major cryptocurrency exchanges.This indicator is calculated by analyzing the client's consolidated position on the spot, perpetual and futures contracts and it provides a clearer view of whether professional traders are leaning bullish or bearish.It is important to note that there are occasional discrepancies in the methodologies between various exchanges, so viewers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.Since Feb. 8, when the Tesla announcement took place, exchanges' top traders have kept their net positions relatively unchanged.Before Bitcoin's 25% rally, Binance had a 1.33 ratio favoring longs, which is in line with the previous week. This indicator peaked at 1.53 on Feb. 10, but has since then returned to 1.31.On the other hand, Huobi top traders had a 0.74 indicator ahead of Feb. 8, which remained flat for three days. On Feb. 11 as BTC rallied from $44,000 to $48,000, these traders began increasing net longs, reaching the current 0.80. Although this level is still favoring net shorts by 20%, it remains above the 0.75 level from Jan. 29.Lastly, OKEx top traders held a 14% net long position before the Tesla news came out. Although they've reverted to a 47% net short position on that same day, over the last four days the indicator has come back to 1.03. Currently, OKEx traders remain well below the 52% net long position from two weeks ago.Top traders could have also moved their BTC off-exchange in search of better yield opportunities. Therefore, assuming that they've entered short positions solely by monitoring centralized exchanges' could be a brash conclusion to reach.As things currently stand, the long-to-short indicator does not show extreme net long positions from arbitrage desks, market makers, and whales. A balanced derivatives market suggests that there’s ample room for buying activity if BTC continues to rally to $50,000 and above.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

350,"On Feb. 12 Bitcoin (BTC) price hit a new all-time high at $48,985 before pulling back to the $46,000 level. A quick glance at the 4-hour chart shows the top-ranked cryptocurrency trading in what appears to be a brief phase of consolidation but BTC is still maintaining its bullish momentum through a pattern of higher highs and higher lows.If BTC can maintain its current pace and structure, a move to the $50,000 level could possibly occur before the weekend ends.A report released by analysts at Decentrader shows that as Bitcoin’s liquid supply has been decreasing, demand for the top cryptocurrency has been increasing as the number of BTC that have not moved on-chain for an extended period of time also rises.As can be seen on the chart above, BTC currently has a liquid supply of roughly four million coins and the figure has been steadily decreasing since June 2020 as whales and institutional investors increase their exposure to this nascent asset class.Further evidence of the growth of big-money players can be found by looking at the surge in wallets holding more than 1000 BTC.As the number of large wallets grows, the number of smaller wallets has remained flat or decreased, indicating that “larger players are scooping up bitcoin off smaller players.”Additional bullish news for the cryptocurrency sector came as PayPal announced that it plans to extend its crypto services to residents of the United Kingdom.This marks the first time users outside of the U.S. will be able to purchase crypto through the platform which should be available on the PayPal and Venmo apps by the end of Q2 2021.In an effort to keep up with the likes of PayPal and the Cash App, Apple Pay has unveiled a new partnership with BitPay that will allow Apple Wallet users to use their BitPay card to make purchases.It has also emerged that Grayscale Investments may soon bring a new level of exposure to decentralized finance as a newly filed corporate registration in the State of Delaware shows that the asset manager is considering Yearn Finance as a potential future offering.Traditional markets faced early pressure on Friday following the Feb.11 announcement that federal regulators have launched probes into Robinhood and Reddit for signs of market manipulation related to the recent wild moves seen in stocks like GameStop and AMC.After weathering the early downturn, all three major indices managed to climb higher and finish the day in the positive with the S&P 500 and NASDAQ closing out the session at record levels, up 0.47% and 0.50% respectively. The Dow also managed to squeeze out a positive gain of 0.09%.The wider cryptocurrency market continued its bullish upsurge as multiple projects saw double-digit gains and new all-time highs.Ether (ETH) ventured deeper into uncharted territory on Friday by setting and set a new all-time high at $1,863, while Polkadot (DOT) was the best performing top-10 coin, experiencing an increase of 21% overnight for a new high at 29.52.Other notable performers include the pure proof-of-stake protocol Algorand (ALGO), which increased 38% for a 2021 high at $1.84, and Tezos (XTZ), which saw its price increase 23% for a new record high of $5.41.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.48 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 60.4%."
351,"Bitcoin has gained significant media attention in recent days, in line with its price rise to nearly $50,000, the institutional implications of Tesla’s recent $1.5B purchase. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who previously worked as a risk analyst and options trader, views Bitcoin (BTC) less than optimistically, however.“I've been getting rid of my BTC,” Taleb said in a tweet on Friday, as reported by BNN Bloomberg. “Why? A currency is never supposed to be more volatile than what you buy & sell with it,” he explained, also noting:Taleb’s logic keys in on Bitcoin as a currency, not a store of value — though the latter has redefined the digital asset’s role in some ways in recent years, at least according to multiple crypto industry players. Some folks, such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH) advocate Roger Ver, have argued that BTC was meant to serve as a payment method. Ver often posits that Bitcoin’s current framework does not allow for such a transactional role, echoing some of Taleb’s concerns.Gold advocate and finance commentator Peter Schiff also often speaks out against Bitcoin, although a growing number of mainstream companies obviously think differently, seeing value in the digital asset.One of Bitcoin’s biggest recent proponents, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, views Bitcoin as a method of preserving value while other assets and currencies become worth less."
352,"Bitcoin hit just shy of $50,000 in the past 24 hours, following news earlier this week that Tesla had purchased $1.5 billion worth of the asset. Despite Bitcoin (BTC) rising more than 100% past its 2017 high near $20,000 over the course of the past few months, Cheds, a crypto analyst and trader on Twitter, thinks the scene remains bullish. “I think many people are looking for a local top here, or perhaps reasons for one because the price has risen so far so fast,” Cheds told Cointelegraph. Cheds is CMT level I certified, which indicates a specific level of expertise in technical analysis.Bitcoin broke its 2017 all-time high of $19,892 in December 2020. In January 2021, BTC rose to $41,981, based on TradingView data. After a brief pull back, Bitcoin hit $48,911 on February 11.“In my view bulls are still in complete control, and every day we get more news of institutional adoption and demand, and that more than anything will be the driving force,” Cheds said. The crypto space is in the midst of a wave of mainstream big players allocating capital to Bitcoin. Aside from Tesla, MicroStrategy has put over $1 billion into BTC, while a number of other players have put various, albeit, smaller amounts of capital toward the digital asset.“If you think the BTC price will go down because of a Canada ETF or Chinese new year, you were just looking for an excuse to sell anyway,"" Cheds explained. Canada recently greenlit a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or ETF.""Yesterday we witnessed another All-time high Bitcoin day candle close ~$49K,” crypto trader and analyst on Twitter, CryptoWendyO, told Cointelegraph. “However, we are currently struggling a bit to kiss $50K,” she said, adding:Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, has tweeted about crypto a number of times in recent days, giving particular attention to Dogecoin (DOGE)."
353,"Financial regulators across the world finally seem to be warming up to the idea that cryptocurrencies can trade in tandem with stock markets and also in exchange-traded funds (ETF).  On Feb. 11, Canada’s Ontario Securities Commission approved the proposal of a Bitcoin ETF by Accelerate Financial, which marks the first approval of a Bitcoin (BTC) ETF in North America.The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has also softened its stance toward a Bitcoin ETF. ASIC commissioner Cathie Armour said a Bitcoin ETF may get the green light if the particular market has proper rules in place.The approval of Bitcoin ETFs by several countries will put pressure on the regulators in the U.S. to consider future proposals favorably.Bitcoin soared above a $900 billion market capitalization today, bringing it within a striking distance of the $1 trillion figure.The growing popularity of the crypto derivatives market is another added advantage as it shows the asset class has matured. Even in legacy markets, derivatives are one of the key components that are used for the price discovery of an asset.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the trend and spot the critical levels that may signal a trend change.During strong uptrends, pullbacks usually last only for one to three days because the bulls buy every minor dip as they expect higher levels in the future. The same was seen in Bitcoin as the price bounced back sharply on Feb. 11.The psychological level at $50,000 may act as a resistance but if the bulls can drive the price above it, the BTC/USD pair could rally to $60,974.43.However, the failure of the pair to pick up momentum after making a new all-time high on Feb. 11 and today shows hesitation to buy at higher levels. If the bulls do not resume the up-move in the next few days, short-term traders may book profits.The pair could then drop to $41,959.63 and the 20-day exponential moving average ($39,895). This is a critical zone to keep an eye on because a break below it will signal that the momentum has weakened.The bears will be back in the game if the pair slides below the 50-day simple moving average ($35,180).Ether (ETH) is currently attempting to break out of the $1,680.173 to $1835.554 tight range it had been stuck in for the past few days. A breakout will suggest that the bulls have overpowered the bears.The rising moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) just below the overbought level suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the bulls can sustain the price above $1,835.554, the ETH/USD pair could move up to the resistance line of the ascending channel.A breakout of the channel will indicate a pick up in momentum. There is a psychological resistance at $2,000 but if the bulls can push the price above it, the pair may move up to $2,500.Contrary to this assumption, if the price slips below $1,680.173, the pair may dip to the 20-day EMA ($1,568) and then to the support line of the channel. This is an important support to watch out for because if it cracks, the pair may signal a trend change.Cardano (ADA) is currently witnessing a minor correction in a strong uptrend. The shallow pullback shows that traders are not booking profits in a hurry as they expect the uptrend to resume.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 87 suggest the trend remains firmly in favor of the bulls. The first support on the downside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.7230669.If the price rebounds off this support, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend. A breakout and close above $0.9817712 could push the price $1.25 and then to $1.50.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($0.593), the ADA/USD pair may signal a possible change in trend.XRP rallied to close above the $0.50 overhead resistance on Feb. 11 and the altcoin followed it up with another up-move today. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.425) and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest bulls have the upper hand.The bulls will now try to push the price to $0.65 and then to $0.78068. The bears may mount a stiff resistance at $0.78068 but if the bulls can thrust the price above the overhead resistance, the XRP/USD pair may pick up momentum and rally to $1.This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and drops below $0.50. Such a move will suggest that traders are dumping their positions on rallies.Polkadot (DOT) is in a strong uptrend. The price has currently reached the resistance line of the ascending channel where the bears may mount a stiff resistance. Previously, when the price had reached the resistance line of the channel, the altcoin had entered a minor correction and dropped to the support line of the channel.However, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the channel, the momentum may pick up. The first target on the upside is $33 and then $40. The rising moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest bulls have the upper hand.This bullish view will invalidate if the DOT/USD pair turns down and breaks below the support line of the channel. Such a move will indicate the start of a deeper correction.Binance Coin (BNB) witnessed profit-booking on Feb. 10, but the correction was short-lived as the bears could not even pull the price down to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $105.7886. A shallow correction after a sharp rally is a positive sign as it suggests that traders are not hurrying to close their position.The bulls are currently attempting to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above the $148.40 overhead resistance. If they succeed, the BNB/USD pair could start its journey towards $200.However, the RSI is already above 88 levels, which suggests the rally is overextended. Any rise above $148.40 is likely to push the RSI deeper into the overbought zone, increasing the risk of a melt-up that may be followed by a sharp reversal.On the contrary, if the price turns down from $148.40, the pair may remain range-bound or enter a meaningful correction.Litecoin (LTC) formed a Doji candlestick pattern on Feb. 10 and 11, which showed indecision among the bulls and the bears. If the bulls can push and sustain the price above $185.5821, a rally to $200 is possible.The gradually upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.Contrary to this assumption, if the price again fails to sustain above $185.5821, it will suggest that demand dries up at higher levels. The LTC/USD pair could then drop to the 20-day EMA ($158).If the price rebounds off this support, it will indicate that bulls are buying the dips. They will then again try to propel the price above the overhead resistance and resume the uptrend.On the other hand, if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages, a drop to $120 is possible.After sustaining above $25.7824 for the past three days, Chainlink (LINK) has resumed its uptrend today. The price has currently reached the resistance line of the rising wedge pattern, which may attract selling from the bears.But if the bulls can push the price above the rising wedge pattern, the LINK/USD pair could pick up momentum and rally to $33 and then $36.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the current levels, the pair may drop to the $25.7824 support. A break below the support line of the wedge will complete the bearish setup and open the doors for a fall to $20.1111.Stellar Lumens (XLM) is in an uptrend. The rising moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest the bulls have the upper hand. However, the altcoin could face resistance at the $0.50 psychological level.If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the XLM/USD pair could drop to $0.409 and then to the 20-day EMA ($0.36). A strong bounce off this support will suggest accumulation at lower levels.The bulls will then once again try to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $0.50. If they succeed, the uptrend could pick up momentum and reach $0.58. Conversely, a break below $0.35 could suggest a deeper correction to the 50-day SMA ($0.27).The bulls are attempting to sustain Bitcoin Cash (BCH) above the $539 overhead resistance. If they succeed, the altcoin could rally to $631.71 and if this level is also scaled, the up-move may reach $745.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 65 suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current levels, it will suggest the bears are aggressively defending $539. A break below the moving averages could keep the price stuck inside the $539 to $370 range for a few more days.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

354,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) achieved a new all-time high on Feb. 11 as it surpassed $48,500 across major exchanges. Since then, the dominant cryptocurrency has been consolidating, showing no real momentum to break out of the record-high in the near future. But analysts are not fazed by the consolidation after breaking past a new peak.Generally, market commentators say that when an asset moves slowly or consolidates after an explosive move upward, it is a sign of a healthy market. For Bitcoin, stabilizing following a strong impulse rally to a record-high is critical at this current juncture due to the overcrowded futures market. If the price of Bitcoin continues to increase without a proper reset pullback, it would increase the probability of a major long squeeze in the short term.A long squeeze happens in the futures market when the market is overwhelmed with buyers or long contracts, and as a result, the funding rate turns highly positive. When the funding rate is above 0%, buyers have to pay a portion of their position as a fee to their short-seller counterpart every eight hours. This mechanism is used by futures exchanges to achieve balance in the market so that the market is not swayed to one side for a prolonged period.Considering the negative effect of an imbalance in the futures market and the fact that the Bitcoin futures funding rate is consistently hovering above 0.1%, which is 10 times higher than the normal 0.01%, longer consolidation is optimistic for Bitcoin. But this is given that BTC remains above crucial support areas, which has seemingly been established at $44,214, acting as a crucial whale cluster support level in the near term.In an interview with Cointelegraph, Guy Hirsch, U.S. managing director at eToro, emphasized that Tesla’s $1.5-billion BTC purchase took the market by storm. The news caused a significant sentiment shift, leading many investors to perceive this as a turning point in the history of the crypto market and how public companies would perceive crypto assets. The news also broke as MicroStrategy conducted a seminar with over 1,400 corporations to discuss Bitcoin.Hirsch explained that the synergy between Tesla buying Bitcoin and MicroStrategy continuing to spread awareness about the merit of BTC as a store of value and a corporate investment would propel more public companies to follow up with similar announcements. If this trend occurs, Hirsch emphasized that a push toward $50,000 is plausible before the end of the second quarter, adding:Traders are also generally expressing optimism toward both the short-term and medium-term trajectory of Bitcoin’s price. A pseudonymous trader known as Loma said that the “relative downside on BTC is so slim” at the moment, considering the strong market sentiment around it. The trader noted that “$50k is inevitable,” and whether BTC drops “a bit beforehand” is not a major issue.A “black swan” event could in theory cause a 30%–40% correction in the price of Bitcoin, as seen throughout its past bull cycles. However, Bitcoin is seeing an unprecedented level of buyer demand from high-net-worth investors and institutions who were not as active in the past few years.The inflow of new institutional investors presents a major variable that could buoy BTC’s momentum toward the $50,000–$70,000 range. The continuous increase in liquidity in the traditional financial market is further catalyzing the appetite for inflation hedge assets, which include the likes of Bitcoin and gold.A crypto whale known as Waro said that there is one scenario where Bitcoin could see a potential pullback in the short term. The trader explained that if BTC struggles to break out of $48,000, it could see its momentum dwindle and see a 5%–15% drop in the foreseeable future.According to him, this would be a positive trend for BTC, as it would allow it to access some of the liquidity and large buy orders in the low $40,000 range: “I was one of the first to call for 52k about a week ago and now everyone is euphoric and screaming for 50+ while bitcoin is having trouble with this resistance. Not a bear, it just needs more fuel, that’s all.”One fundamental factor that could counter a potentially bearish market sentiment around Bitcoin is the declining selling pressure from miners. In the past two weeks, miners sold large amounts of BTC, placing pressure on the short-term price trend of Bitcoin. Since miners are one of the few external sources of selling pressure in the cryptocurrency market, heightened levels of selling activity can suppress the uptrend of Bitcoin.Lex Moskovski, a cryptocurrency investor and a quant trader, found that miners “are not so eager to sell their #Bitcoin the last two weeks.” He said that either miners are anticipating the price of Bitcoin to increase substantially in the foreseeable future or have run out of BTC to sell in the near term. Either way, this trend is a positive catalyst for Bitcoin that could counter the bearishness around the crypto market and push BTC toward a new all-time high above $50,000."
355,"A growing number of business leaders and celebrities — e.g., Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey, Alex Ohanian and, most recently, Ricardo Salinas — have added the Bitcoin hashtag to their Twitter biographies. It hasn’t gone unnoticed. When Elon Musk added #Bitcoin to his bio in late January, Bitcoin soared by 20%.If indeed a succession of billionaires and tech moguls have taken the Bitcoin pledge — whatever that might entail — what is their motivation? Are they trying to manipulate the market, for instance — or promote their brand?Could they be just looking to pull the collective leg of crypto’s true believers? The CEOs, on the other hand, could be deadly earnest: signaling the technological future they believe is coming to pass — e.g., global and decentralized.Whatever the reason, it seems fair to say that social media has been tilting Bitcoin’s (BTC) value proposition recently, and it raises some questions. For example, are cryptocurrencies more susceptible to social media messaging than other financial assets?Rightly or wrongly, many users judge BTC’s success by its daily market price, and that price seems more entangled than ever with social media activity.“Absolutely,” Feng Mai, an assistant professor at Stevens Institute of Technology’s School of Business, commented to Cointelegraph. “My research has shown that Twitter posts from influencers have an immediate effect on BTC pricing.” This is for two reasons, Mai explained: “Its lack of intrinsic value compared to other financial assets, and its adopters’ demographics overlapping with social media users.”Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com trading, added that cryptocurrencies — like some other assets that occupy relatively small pockets within the overall investing market, e.g., GameStop — seem particularly vulnerable to social media because they are relatively illiquid with large holdings in the hands of comparatively few people, and also because they have “a crowd/cult following.”Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds — a crypto index fund provider — told Cointelegraph that while social media doesn’t change BTC’s “foundational value proposition,” which remains solid, “the tweets act like accelerators.”Finn Brunton, professor of science and technology studies at the University of California, Davis and author of Digital Cash: The Unknown History of the Anarchists, Utopians, and Technologists Who Created Cryptocurrency, told Cointelegraph BTC and social media have been intertwined since Bitcoin’s origins.According to him, “Bitcoin has always been a social media movement first and a working currency second — driven by testimonials, stunts, memes and exhortations to HODL and believe.” In that sense, the price of BTC skyrocketing because a voguish CEO modifies their Twitter bio “is completely on brand.”On the face of it, the timely addition of #Bitcoin to the Twitter bios of tech CEOs, such as Dorsey, Ohanian and Musk, would seem to be a plus, garnering more attention for Bitcoin and eventually increasing acceptance and adoption. Wilson told Cointelegraph:“Musk and Tesla embracing Bitcoin is good news for the cryptocurrency,” Mai added, “in that it lends credence to cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange, which is one of the key functions of money according to economists.”But don’t these social-media turbo charges also make BTC’s price more erratic — with volatility long being cited as one of the cryptocurrency’s main drawbacks? When billionaire Salinas, Mexico’s third-wealthiest man, added #Bitcoin to his Twitter bio at the start of February, for instance, the price of the top crypto asset surged over $40,000 for the first time in 23 days.Mai answered that the entry of large firms like Tesla more than offsets any short-term volatility, and the large corporations will make Bitcoin less volatile: “The firms that accept BTC should now have more incentive to stabilize the value of BTC — they do not want their revenue fluctuating significantly day-to-day.”Regarding the recent hash-tagged bios, Brunton, not exactly a BTC bull, commented: “It’s good for Bitcoin in that more buy-in from rich guys equals more parties invested in keeping this leaky raft afloat.” In his view, a better long-term outcome, however, would be for users to migrate from BTC to cryptos “that work better, are better engineered, or have superior implementation.” Bitcoin, he added, “is the alpha rollout of what cryptos could be, so the more sunk cost there is, the longer we’ll be stuck with it.”When Elon Musk added #Bitcoin to his Twitter bio on Jan. 29, the effect on BTC was flammable — the price rallied 14% in the first 30 minutes. But not all followers were entirely clear about the world’s richest man’s intent. Was he just joshing with his 43 million Twitter followers? The addition of a cryptic tweet — “In retrospect, it was inevitable” — only deepened the ambiguity.The picture became clearer, however, on Feb. 8 when it was widely reported that Tesla had recently purchased $1.5 billion of Bitcoin, which is yet to be revealed. Obviously, Musk’s interest in BTC had been genuine. Musk has since removed #Bitcoin from his Twitter bio. Wilson told Cointelegraph:Brunton was less tolerant of Musk, whom he called an “A-1 s---poster who also happens to be a billionaire.” That said, according to him, “#bitcoin is definitely part of the Reddit-style starter pack of tech-baron lifestyle trappings and displays. That’s about a culture and a scene, though. It has nothing to do with ‘technology’ as such.”Elsewhere, it’s been suggested that Bitcoin-hash-tagging CEOs were just using social media to promote “their brand as a crypto-friendly firm and getting a ton of free publicity.” Neo, for his part, believes that markets are currently overextended, “and there are definitely revolters out there who are just tweeting for ‘fun’ at people’s expenses.” During such times, “it is even more crucial that we exercise caution, invest rationally and not emotionally,” he told Cointelegraph.Meanwhile, Balaji Srinivasan, angel investor and co-founder of Coin Center — a nonprofit crypto policy advocate — in the past has suggested that Bitcoin is becoming the new “flag of technology” representing high-echelon economic values such as decentralization and internationalism.Among the implicit values in Bitcoin’s technology, as he wrote elsewhere, are: “internationalist, capitalist, decentralized, hyperdeflationary, networked, encrypted, digital, volatile, ambitious, and quietly revolutionary.”So, is that what is going on with the #Bitcoin movement: CEOs just waving the new “flag of technology,” eager to identify themselves with a still coalescing decentralized future?“It [BTC] is the flagship of all cryptocurrencies and represents the many values inherent in the technology,” answered Jay Hao, CEO of OKEx crypto exchange, though it often means different things to different people:Wilson told Cointelegraph: “I think Bitcoin has always been a movement to an extent — it’s about decentralization and ‘taking back control’ from central banks, governments, etc.” Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban went even further, telling Forbes in December that Bitcoin is “more religion than solution to any problem.”A social movement with shared high-level beliefs? Brunton remained skeptical: “Bitcoin is — and has always been — multiple conflicting social movements awkwardly kludged together around a currency and a transaction infrastructure.” He further added that beliefs around what Bitcoin is are different for people like speculators, libertarians, anti-statists and so on, concluding: “To say that anyone holds common beliefs by holding BTC is a category error.”Neo told Cointelegraph: “Flag or not, to the masses out there, it isn’t just a matter of investment but also a statement that they support the particular ecosystem or an asset.”Whatever the explanation behind the proliferation of #Bitcoin in Twitter bios, most Bitcoinists are probably encouraged by it, while acknowledging that it remains a sideshow at best.As Hao told Cointelegraph, BTC “has been gaining traction steadily over the years — long before leading business executives arrived ‘late to the party.’” The hashtags are a “nice gesture,” another sign that BTC is becoming a movement, but in the end, Hao added, this is just another step along the “journey to mass adoption.”"
356,"Major U.S. investment bank JPMorgan Chase will eventually have to get involved in Bitcoin (BTC), co-president Daniel Pinto believes.The executive told CNBC Friday that JPMorgan’s decision to introduce Bitcoin services would depend on the client demand to trade Bitcoin. Although the current demand is not strong enough, Pinto is confident that it could grow further:Pinto’s latest remarks follow some bullish signals that have been circulating around JPMorgan for a while. During an internal Zoom call in January, JPMorgan’s global markets head Troy Rohrbaugh reportedly acknowledged that the bank’s own employees were increasingly asking about the bank’s Bitcoin plans. Pinto was already saying that he was open-minded about Bitcoin, people familiar with the matter reported.JPMorgan’s potential move into Bitcoin appears somewhat ironic, considering that the company’s CEO Jamie Dimon is known for his negative stance toward Bitcoin. In September 2017, Dimon called Bitcoin a “fraud,” comparing the world’s largest cryptocurrency to ""tulip mania"" and predicting a massive collapse. At the time, Bitcoin was trading around $3,500. Three months later, the digital coin hit $20,000 — though it did enter a multi-year bear market shortly thereafter.Bitcoin overtook JPMorgan in terms of market capitalization at $352 billion in November 2020. The milestone came shortly after Dimon compared Bitcoin to proprietary blockchain networks with regulatory controls, stating, “Bitcoin is kind of different and it’s not my cup of tea.”JPMorgan strategists have provided mixed signals about Bitcoin in the past. In October 2020, JPMorgan reportedly suggested that Bitcoin's price would double or triple in the long term. A few months later, JPMorgan strategists John Normand and Federico Manicardi argued that Bitcoin was the least reliable hedge during periods of acute market stress."
357,"A little-known blockchain project more than doubled in value overnight following the announcement of its involvement in a European Union digital economy research program.The spot price for the Ethereum-based Streamr (DATA) token increased 116% leading into Feb. 12, after it was revealed the project would be used as part of an EU pilot aimed at creating a new kind of money.Announced on Feb.11, the ATARCA Consortium was awarded €2.75 million ($3.33 million) by the European Commission as part of an initiative to address the “economic inefficiencies” incurred by artificially limiting the supply of digital goods.In a radical left-turn away from one of the economic principles said to give Bitcoin (BTC) some of its value, the program will try to construct a medium of exchange that gains value through being shared, rather than being scarce.ATARCA claims to offer an alternative to mainstream economics with its concept of “anti-rival goods” which become more valuable the more they are used. ATARCA, led by Professor Pekka Nikander from the Finnish Aalto University’s Department of Communications and Networking, stated:ATARCA proposes the creation of “anti-rival tokens,” which will be tested in the upcoming two-part pilot in conjunction with Streamr, a peer-to-peer blockchain live data streaming network. Streamr will reportedly be used to test-drive the concept of sharing as a means of payment, using its real-time data-sharing network as a sandbox:The first part of the pilot program will initially take place in Barcelona, using the city’s own digital social currency, the Real Economy Currency. Streamr, an open-source project founded in 2017, saw the value of its native DATA token climb to a three-year high upon announcement of the news, climbing from $0.08 to $0.18 in less than 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap."
358,"Telecoms provider T-Mobile has become the latest corporate name to come under fire for its alleged negligence and failure to protect customer information, which indirectly enabled a ""SIM swap attack"" that led to the successful theft of $450,000, or 15 Bitcoin (BTC).A SIM swap attack — also referred to as a port-out scam — has proved to be a popular tactic with criminals in recent years. Such an attack involves the theft of a victim’s cell phone number, which can then be used to hijack the victim's online financial and social media accounts by intercepting automated messages or phone calls that are used for two-factor authentication security measures. The lawsuit filed against T-Mobile on Feb. 8 in the Southern District of New York by plaintiff Calvin Cheng — the victim who alleges he lost $450,000 in Bitcoin following such an attack — explains exactly how it is that telecoms firms come to play such a crucial role in this particular kind of fraud: The incident at issue in the lawsuit occurred, according to Cheng, after a SIM-swap was successfully carried out in May 2020 against a T-Mobile customer and co-founder of crypto-focused investment fund Iterative Capital, Brandon Buchanan.Cheng had conducted several successful transactions with Iterative to purchase Bitcoin in the months prior to the incident, communicating with Buchanan and others in Iterative via Telegram and using a crypto exchange administered by the fund.After the SIM-swap, the perpetrators allegedly impersonated Buchanan on a Telegram chat with Cheng, reaching out to him asking him whether or not he wanted to sell Bitcoin for an Iterative client at an attractive premium. Having been lulled into thinking the communications were from Buchanan, Cheng agreed to the deal and transferred the Bitcoin to a digital wallet he believed to be controlled by Buchanan and/or Iterative — a mistaken belief, as it soon turned out.A couple of days later, Buchanan reached out to Iterative's exchange clients to inform them that several of his accounts had been compromised by SIM-swappers, who had falsely assumed his identity and used it to initiate trades on Iterative's supposed behalf. The rest of the complaint details Cheng's appeal to the FBI, which is investigating the incident and attempting to identify the perpetrators. Buchanan has also attempted to intercede directly with T-Mobile on behalf of Cheng, but has failed to secure a refund on his behalf.  As the lawsuit underscores, SIM-swapping is hardly a new phenomenon and has been actively discussed by federal agencies since 2016 at the latest. Nor is this the first time T-Mobile has been embroiled in SIM swap-related lawsuits involving cryptocurrency investors.The lawsuit accuses T-Mobile of failing implement to adequate security policies to prevent unauthorized access to its customers' accounts, failing to train or supervise its employees to prevent successful fraud, and of wrongful conduct in its ""reckless disregard"" for various obligations and duties under federal and state law. The carrier is thus accused of knowingly violating the Federal Communications Act the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the New York Protection Act, as well as two counts of negligence. "
359,"The latest findings by Santiment, published in Cointelegraph Consulting’s biweekly newsletter, indicate that the total amount of BTC held by addresses with 100+ Bitcoin has seen a particularly strong uptick since the news of Tesla investing $1.5billion in BTC, growing by an additional 20,490 BTC.This brings the total amount of Bitcoin located in whale addresses to a new all-time high of just over 11.6 million, a number likely reflecting the increase in institutional participants over the recent time period.The lunar calendar ended with a flurry of news that drove Bitcoin (BTC) annualized volatility to 125%, a figure not seen since April of last year. This has not deterred investors from buying BTC up to an all-time high, as the price flirts with breaking the $50,000 mark for the first time. A portion of this volume has been initiated from larger whale accounts, which should come as positive news for the retail investors.Based on text data collected from over 1,000 crypto social channels, the amount of Bitcoin-related mentions surged to its highest level since 2019 when Facebook’s Libra announcement fueled more frantic buying from retail. This recent surge is easily dwarfing the chatter around BTC’s previous all-time highs from closer to the start of the year. With this increase comes a strong boost to investor confidence, as the average mood of Bitcoin-related messages had quickly shifted from ‘ambivalent’ on February 1st to ‘overwhelmingly bullish’ at the time of writing.Overwhelmingly bullish can be a bad sign for the asset, especially when futures funding rates, such as on Bitmex, are pushed to the highest levels since June of 2019. When investors are all in agreement on the direction of the market, volatility in the opposition can cause cascading liquidations and panic-fueled selling.Investors who monitor correlations with other asset classes will notice the moving average of BTC moving away from the S&P 500, ETH, and Gold moving averages. Even Ether (ETH), which has increased by 28% since Jan. 26 and reached $1,745, fails to compare with BTC’s 50% increase over the same time period.Read the full newsletter edition here for more news and signals, complete with detailed charts and images.Cointelegraph’s Market Insights Newsletter shares our knowledge on the fundamentals that move the digital asset market.

360,"The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic, or NBKR, is reportedly planning to introduce a licensing regime for cryptocurrency exchanges in a move to protect local investors.NBKR chairman Tolkunbek Abdygulov announced that the country’s central bank is planning to start regulating exchange operations involving cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), local economic publication Tazabek reports Feb. 12.Abdygulov said that the regulatory initiative aims to safeguard crypto operations in the Kyrgyz Republic and provide investor protections similar to those that are already in place for traditional finance:Despite the NBKR’s ambitious plans to help local people safely invest in crypto, the central bank is still warning the public about the high risks of crypto investments. “If Bitcoin hit $50,000 yesterday, it could drop to $20,000 tomorrow. And then all your invested money will be burned,” Abdygulov cautioned. After introducing a draft crypto bill in November 2020, the Kyrgyz government presented two bills, “On the Processing of Cryptocurrencies” and “On Amendments to Legislative Acts in the Field of Virtual Assets,” to public discussion in January 2021. Kyrgyz authorities expect to finalize the bills by the end of 2021, Abdygulov said.Apart from general legislative efforts around crypto, Kyrgyzstan also sought to regulate crypto mining activities in the country. However, no associated regulation has been adopted so far, according to Abdygulov."
361,"The crypto derivatives market is dominated by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), with the main platforms being Huobi, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, OKEx, Bybit and Deribit. The CME has also dipped in the Ether pool by launching its Ether futures on Feb. 8, which amounted to $30 million notional volumes on the first day.Prior to this launch, there was a huge $1-billion options expiry on Feb. 5, which lead to bulls targeting the $40,000 price range, according to the underlying options data. But this expiry was superseded by Elon Musk tweeting in support of Bitcoin just after the expiry event; this did indeed allow Bitcoin to pass the $40,000 mark before going into new all-time highs due to Tesla’s purchase of $1.5 billion worth of BTC.Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer of crypto derivatives exchange Deribit, told Cointelegraph: “The usage and popularity of options is growing, which can be seen from the ever-increasing open interest numbers, volumes and number of clients trading.” He further added: “The bigger the expiry, the higher the likelihood of an impact on the underlying market.”In the traditional markets, derivatives play a leading role in spot prices and the price discovery of an asset, but that’s largely due to the fact the traditional spot markets are only a fraction of the size of the derivatives market.Meanwhile, in the cryptocurrency markets, the spot markets are way bigger than the size of derivatives markets. But with the derivatives market burgeoning in size, the relation to the spot markets seems to be getting stronger.One such metric that points to whether the market is bullish or bearish toward BTC is the 30% to 20% delta skew. It refers to the premium difference between neutral-to-bullish call options against similar put options.Jay Hao, CEO of crypto exchange OKEx, outlined to Cointelegraph that the growing influence of the derivatives market over the spot markets is a positive development, saying: “As the derivatives market grows in size and importance, this is a pattern that we would expect to see.”However, contrary to the patterns that are expected to be emerging in the derivatives market in relation to the spot markets, the price impact is often unclear. Shane Ai, responsible for product research and development of crypto derivatives at Bybit — a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange — told Cointelegraph:Ben Caselin, head of research and strategy at AAX — a digital asset exchange — told Cointelegraph that the extent to which the spot price of BTC is impacted by the derivatives market is overstated. However, he also pointed out to functionality of derivatives markets to the spot markets, saying: “Derivatives play a role in raising a more sophisticated infrastructure around Bitcoin as an asset. It attracts different investors who otherwise might not be ready to engage Bitcoin directly.”Institutional investors often look to derivatives to hedge other risks that their portfolios carry. This could be said for the cryptocurrency markets as well, especially since institutional investors now seem to be getting highly interested in Ether, too. A report from CoinShares stated that out of the $245-million institutional inflow seen in the crypto market in the first week of February, $195 million (80%) was invested in Ether products leading up to the launch of CME Ether futures contract on Monday, Feb. 8.This suggests that institutional investors are beginning to diversify their crypto exposure further by investing in other cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin. This perception is only furthered by the fact that Elon Musk has brought a lot of positive attention to Bitcoin and even other smaller cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin (DOGE).His vocal support of Bitcoin through Twitter, combined with his firm Tesla buying $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin and even possibly accepting Bitcoin payments for Tesla products will only push forward the market and cause more institutional investors to follow. Hao further spoke on how this will impact the derivatives markets:Strijers pointed to how the price impact of such announcements move the derivatives market as well: “Events like this have an immediate price impact and, thus, an effect on the prices of all derived instruments (price and IV surge >150%). We have seen the short-dated (daily) options moving 1,000+% in a few minutes.” Strijers also shed some light on the perspective that institutional investors have a higher need for derivatives products than average retail investors:With the world’s largest derivatives exchange in CME listing Ether futures on its platform, it signifies a new push for institutional investors to get into a fast-growing Ether market. Considering that the highly lucrative returns of 303% for Bitcoin over 2020 is one of the main reasons for mainstream attention, while ETH witnessed 469% gains in 2020, also becoming a sought-after asset for institutional and retail investors alike.In fact, the open interest in Ether futures recently hit an all-time high of $6.5 billion, with the underlying futures premium pointing out that investors aren’t necessarily keen on liquidating the Ether they own amid the ongoing bull run.Strijers elaborated further about the growing interest in Ether even surpassed Bitcoin at the moment: “CME launching the ETH futures is another indicator of institutional interest in ETH as an investable asset.” Furthermore, he added that on some days, Grayscale ETH Trust attracts more inflows than BTC, indicating that the interest in ETH derivatives is rising.Ai takes it a step further by suggesting that investors are more keen on Ethereum’s fundamentals than CME’s Ether futures launch: “Compared to BTC in 2017, ETH today has far more avenues for institutional hedging; the CME listing is a non-event in reality. The ongoing narrative of EIP-1559 and Grayscale’s acquisitions are far more instrumental in attracting institutions.”Compared to Bitcoin, which is seen as a decentralized store of value, the Ethereum blockchain offers a lot of use cases for various applications in the decentralized finance space. This opens up more opportunities for ETH to be utilized within the industry.Furthermore, due to the increased focus on the possible inflationary impact from COVID-19 support packages, various assets, including commodities, are trading at all-time highs. Retail rebellion observed in the GameStop fiasco is also helping to bring more initiated retail investors to diversify through crypto assets than just allocating toward Bitcoin.Hao highlighted the popularity of perpetual swaps among these investors: “Instead of waiting for a contract's expiry and delivery, perpetual swaps save time by rolling over the contracts regularly. This would be a plus to retail investors at convenience.”Futures trading is also increasingly popular among retail investors since the trading is done on margin. This is leading to increased activity on centralized exchanges, the rise of option and prediction markets in DeFi, better educational resources than ever before, and more hype proliferated by various social media platforms. These positive changes are making it easier for retail traders to diversify their trading strategies across assets, instruments and time frames."
362,"Bitcoin (BTC) is looking increasingly like it is in a “supercycle,” not just a bull cycle, statistician Willy Woo suggests.In a Twitter exchange on Feb. 12, the popular analyst joined Dan Held, growth lead at U.S. exchange Kraken, calling the current BTC market a bull run like no other.Held had previously explained his theory about the state of Bitcoin in 2021 — that price gains cannot be compared to past bull phases, and do not even match the end of 2017 when BTC/USD neared $20,000.Instead, this year is looking like a bull run on a wholly different magnitude — a “supercycle” in the making for Bitcoin.In his own observations, Woo confirmed that data pointed to retail investors returning to Bitcoin in January.“Retail has arrived. The last 4 weeks. Welcome to the middle phase of the bull market. This one is like no other,” he wrote.When Held suggested that the supercycle had arrived with them, he responded that 2021 would provide confirmation.“Can answer that with more confidence in Q4. Right now it’s only fundamental narrative, need to see if the capital flows validate it,” he continued.Search interest in ""Bitcoin"" spiked in the first portion of 2021, but still has noticeably more ground to cover in order to match the peak of 2017.With Bitcoin poised to tackle $50,000 resistance next, longer-term price indicators continue to point upwards even after the heavy upside of the past few months.As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin so-called “thermocap” is one such metric suggesting that the gains are only getting started and a top is still far off.In an update this week, Rafael Schultze-Kraft, CTO of on-chain analytics resource Glassnode, estimated that should Thermocap repeat its 2017 performance, BTC/USD could hit $110,000.“Last bull market, $BTC was at ~$8,500 when Marketcap to Thermocap was at the current levels – and surged another 135% to the top in just a month. Things can go fast,” he tweeted.Macro pointers likewise continue to provide the perfect backdrop for increased interest in Bitcoin across the board. Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve added to its balance sheet to the extent that it broke all-time highs once again.“#Fed balance sheet has hit a fresh ATH of $7.44tn last week, equivalent to 34.7% of US GDP,” Holger Zschaepitz, market commentator at German news outlet Die Welt noted."
363,"The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has clarified its position regarding Bitcoin (BTC)-linked exchange-traded funds. According to a Feb. 12 report by the Australian Financial Review, the commission addressed the subject after previously rejecting a Bitcoin ETF initiative by local company Cosmos Capital.Per the report, Cosmos CEO James Manning claimed that ASIC “have a policy — which they have not released — which says they do not want an exchange traded product, an MIS, listed on an exchange.”However, ASIC commissioner Cathie Armour told the Senate select committee on financial technology Friday that a Bitcoin ETF is possible, so long as there are appropriate rules in place in the market on which it is traded:Armour said that a Bitcoin ETF could fall under Australian Securities Exchange's AQUA Rules, which are specifically designed for investment schemes like managed funds, ETFs and other products.Armour noted that the National Stock Exchange of Australia, on which Cosmos attempted to list its product, does not have such rules. Australian Securities Exchange CEO Dominic Stevens said that the ASX has taken a cautious approach toward cryptocurrency-related products, but is considering them. “The world of bitcoin has changed since the last run, and my gut feel is this dominated by more corporate activity and institutions,” he said. Steve Vallas, head of the Blockchain Association of Australia, told Cointelegraph that the shift in regulators' attitudes represents a major signal for the crypto adoption in the country:Cosmos Capital is now reportedly planning to list its Bitcoin ETF on ASX, which could potentially become Australia's first ETF linked to Bitcoin. Cosmos did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment."
364,"According to data from Glassnode, Bitcoin (BTC) miners made over $4 million in just under an hour on Feb.  12, making it the biggest hourly revenue in history.In May 2020, Bitcoin underwent the third block reward halving in its history, cutting the amount of new Bitcoin mined in half.At the same time, the hash rate of the Bitcoin network is also at new all-time highs with the fourth consecutive upward difficulty adjustment by roughly 2.5% expected in seven days.A block reward halving occurs every four years to decrease the rate the remaining supply of Bitcoin is introduced to the market.As Bitcoin nears its fixed supply at 21 million, the pace at which new BTC is mined is reduced through a halving. But the halving can put immense pressure on miners that depend on the BTC they mine to cover operational costs in the short term.Theoretically, when a halving occurs, the price of Bitcoin is expected to rise because of the lower supply of new coins entering the market. Therefore, a higher BTC price can make up for the lower number of BTC miners are rewarded with for mining a block.This week, Bitcoin miners generated the biggest hourly revenue in history, despite mining half the BTC they used to mine compared to last year.This shows that Bitcoin is working as designed with its value increasing following the block reward halving, incentivizing miners to increase their hash rate and invest in the security of the network. Analysts at Glassnode said:Another reason behind the rising miner revenue is the increasing number of transactions on the network and the accompanying fees paid to miners as a result. Miner revenue is comprised of the transaction fees plus the block rewards collected by miners, with the former comprising roughly 13.5% of the total revenue, according to data from Clarkmoody.PlanB, a pseudonymous Bitcoin researcher behind the popular price model Stock-to-Flow (S2F), said Bitcoin is on track to reach $288,000.The S2F model largely relies on BTC’s supply (the stock) and the new Bitcoins mined (the flow), predicting the price trend of BTC based on its scarcity. PlanB wrote:Currently, Bitcoin is consolidating after reaching a new all-time high above $48,500. If the price of BTC nears $60,000, it would cause the market capitalization of the cryptocurrency to surpass $1 trillion.Moreover, at around $56,000, analysts say that there is a big options gamma squeeze awaiting for Bitcoin. Hence, the probability of BTC rising to around $53,000 to $56,000 remains high in the first half of 2021.Lex Moskovski, a cryptocurency researcher and a quant trader, also emphasized that the market sentiment remains positive due to rising institutional interest. He said:"

The world’s second-most populated country could soon move to ban all crypto-assets, giving users a 3–6 month grace period to liquidate their holdings, according to an anonymous source who spoke to Bloomberg.On Feb. 10, Jack Dorsey donated $1 million to the Washington D.C-based nonprofit organization Coin Center which also received a $2 million donation from asset management firm Grayscale. Dorsey’s ongoing infatuation with Bitcoin recently saw him set up a Bitcoin full-node from his Macbook, meaning he now has a hand in verifying the Bitcoin blockchain."
366,"Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has proposed an official resolution that would see Bitcoin (BTC) become an acceptable payment instrument in various parts of the city's administration.Announcing the news on Twitter, the Mayor said that the city commission has supported the resolution, and is now taking next steps:The resolution would also put a proposition before the state legislature that, if successful, would see Bitcoin as an acceptable investment for municipal funds.Suarez said, “It’s wonderful to be a very crypto-forward city, and I wanna thank my commission colleagues for allowing that to happen.” Although the commission approved the resolution 4-1, it significantly reworded its original call, according to a Feb. 11 report by Bloomberg. The commission only agreed to study the feasibility of these steps rather than taking action, as the original proposal reportedly suggested.Some city commissioners reportedly cautioned against moving into Bitcoin without a close study of the risks. “Maybe you’re ahead of your time, maybe you’re right, but let’s analyze it,” commissioner Manolo Reyes said. Ken Russell, vice-chairman of the city commission, reportedly claimed that he is “certainly not opposed” to the idea of Miami embracing Bitcoin. However, it’s still important to ensure “we all know what we’re getting into,” he said.Suarez, who is up for re-election in 2021, has been steadily establishing himself as an advocate of new technologies like crypto. The official previously announced his intention to make Miami have “the most progressive crypto laws,” and overtake Silicon Valley as the most Bitcoin-friendly place in the United States."
367,"An anonymous source claiming to be a senior Indian Finance Ministry official has claimed that the use of crypto assets will soon be completely banned in the world’s second most populated country.Speaking to Bloomberg, the source claimed that the use of cryptocurrency in all its forms will be banned under a new law expected to soon be introduced in the parliament. Transacting with crypto via foreign exchanges will also be prohibited.Crypto investors are expected to be given a three-to-six month transition period to liquidate their holdings after the new law comes into effect, the source said.The official emphasized that crypto assets have been targeted by India’s lawmakers due to their lack of backing from the Reserve Bank of India, or RBI.In January, India’s parliament introduced 'The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021' for discussion during the ongoing parliamentary sessions on the country’s budget.The Bill’s purpose was described as creating a facilitative framework for a central bank digital currency issued by the RBI, and to “prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India.”Sathvik Vishwanath, the co-founder and CEO of major Indian cryptocurrency exchange Unocoin, told Bloomberg the local crypto industry are anxiously “waiting for details to come out to determine [their] next course of action:”In March 2020, India’s Supreme Court overturned the RBI’s April 2018 blanket ban on local banks providing services to businesses dealing with crypto, effectively legitimizing cryptocurrency companies across the country.However, the Indian Ministry of Finance proposed legislation that would again ban crypto assets nation-wide in June 2020."
368,"Bitcoin is closing in on a trillion dollar market cap, with the total value of all Bitcoin crossing $900B for the first time today as the price hit new record highs.Bitstamp, one of the oldest Bitcoin exchanges still in operation, recorded a peak price of $49,000, resulting in a fleeting market cap of $912.69 billion. Bitcoin is currently priced at $47,250 per coin, up 5% over the last 24 hours and 28% in the last seven days.A market cap of $900 billion represents the addition of $354 billion in 2021 alone. The previous all-time high for Bitcoin’s market cap was set on Feb. 8, when it topped out at $888 billion.Bitcoin currently accounts for 61% of the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies, which also reached all-time highs as the majority of top altcoins moved up alongside Bitcoin. The market cap of all cryptocurrencies peaked at $1.463 trillion today – gaining 88.5% in 2021 so far after starting the year at $776 billion.According to CompaniesMarketCap, a website that ranks the world’s most traded assets by their market capitalization, Bitcoin is now the ninth biggest asset in the world, overtaking Facebook and Tesla in the last week. When placed on a list of nations by GDP, Bitcoin’s $900 billion falls in between the countries of Mexico ($1.04 trillion) and the Netherlands ($886 billion).The fresh highs for Bitcoin come on the day of the approval of the first Bitcoin ETF in North America, the same week as news emerged Tesla bought $1.5B of BTC, and amid a regulatory atmosphere that has been increasingly friendly toward cryptocurrency-related developments in fintech.Earlier this month, the Biden administration created a buzz in the crypto community by appointing some crypto-friendly personalities to high positions, potentially signaling the opportunity for a greater degree of cooperation between regulatory forces and blockchain-based enterprise."
369,"Electric car manufacturer Tesla has seen more than $55 billion wiped from its market cap since announcing the purchase of $1.5 billion in Bitcoin four days ago — but Twitter and MasterCard have headed in the other direction.Since Tesla’s announcement on Monday, the electric car giant’s stock price has dropped 7% from $869.52 ($834.6 billion market cap). It is currently trading at $811.66 ($779 billion market cap).While there may be other factors behind the share price drop, some investors, such as Baker Avenue Wealth Management chief strategist King Lip, are concerned that holding 8% of the company's cash reserve in a volatile asset is an unnecessary risk, stating:Tesla stock has been known to disregard the opinion of financial analysts in general with financial magazine Barron’s stating no more than 40% of analysts have rated its shares a ‘Buy’ since 2018.Former Bernstein analyst and Bitcoin skeptic Gary Black stated two weeks earlier that he would sell his Tesla stock if they added Bitcoin to the balance sheet. True to his word, he announced his exit on Twitter, but also added that he will get back in:3/ I’ve made a lot of money on $TSLA over the past 18 months, and will look for a lower entry point to get back in. I will continue to post my views on Twitter about TSLA volumes, earnings and other developments. I thank everyone for your past and hopefully continued support.Only 90 minutes later he revised his prediction for the carmaker’s stock to $960 dropping only $40 from the previous estimate of $1,000. This led some Twitter users to question if he really believes his figures since he had just exited his position.Included in the sell-off was Elon Musk’s younger brother and Tesla director Kimbal Musk, who sold 5% of his shares for $25.6 million. Another director, Antonio Gracias, also sold more than 150,000 shares one day after the Bitcoin announcement, according to securities filings.Despite the timing, there is no evidence that these sales are related to the recent Bitcoin news. And for that matter, it's unclear of what impact the Bitcoin buy had on the share price, given news also broke this week that Tesla had been called in by Chinese government regulators for talks over quality issues in its electric cars.It's also clear that not all stock investors are Bitcoin-adverse. Social giant Twitter’s stock surged following comments that the firm might soon buy into Bitcoin. During an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box on February 10, the tech firm’s chief financial officer Ned Segal said the company is considering adding the cryptocurrency to its own books and using it for Twitter employee’s salaries.""We've done a lot of the upfront thinking to consider how we might pay employees should they ask to be paid in #bitcoin, how we might pay a vendor if they asked to be paid in #btc and whether we need to have #btc on our balance sheet,"" says @NedSegal $TWTR. pic.twitter.com/KjIgnqDmYCIn the two days following the interview, Twitter stock rose almost 15% from $59.88 to $68.56, just shy of its all-time high of $69.Similarly, MasterCard stock surged 4% following the announcement that it will support multiple cryptocurrencies on its network this week.Big companies investing in Bitcoin will not necessarily translate to a much higher market cap: if Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, MasterCard, and Google were to invest 8% of their cash reserves in Bitcoin, this would only translate into less than US$8 billion investment in total. That's less than 1% of Bitcoin’s current market cap. However, the signal it sends would likely drive other companies and retail investors to jump on the bandwagon."
370,"Andrew Yang, the Democratic Party front-runner in the race to be New York’s next mayor said he would transform New York City into “a hub for BTC and other cryptocurrencies” noting the city to be “the world’s financial capital.”The former presidential candidate made the comment in a tweet earlier today which drew a flurry of mixed reactions, with some proclaiming it to be a campaign-selling maneuver and others equating it to political suicide.The most unifying reaction, however, was the demand that Yang use his powers, if elected, to end the BitLicense, enacted by the New York Department of Financial Services. Meltem Demirors, CSO of digital assets management company CoinShares, suggested Yang would need to deal with bo high state taxes and the Bitlicense to make his plan a reality.no one wants to pay NYC's absurd taxes + the tax of the NYDFS bitlicense

unless there's a plan to cut the city budget drastically, i don't see how any crypto company wants to operate in an environment with high income, corporate, and real estate taxes + sales tax on top https://t.co/f7VGB7fyh2In a recent interview with Forbes, Miami mayor Francis Suarez discussed the possibility of paying city employees in Bitcoin to encourage cryptocurrency adoption in the area. Yang actually floated a similar idea in a Sept. 2019 interview, describing the benefits of a government-issued, digitally-based “social currency” which could be exchanged 1:1 with the U.S. dollar.Yang is currently is leading the Democratic field in popularity and name recognition among voters according to recent polling that saw him streets ahead of Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams and City Comptroller Scott Stringer.In sharp contrast to most of his political peers, Yang has vocalized his support for Bitcoin several times in the two years he has been on the mainstream media’s radar. His outspoken beliefs have earned him the title of “Best President for Bitcoin” from some in the cryptocurrency community.yang's policy advisor is the front page of askreddit https://t.co/ffjkwnFyLHNew York has a tumultuous relationship with Bitcoin. The introduction of the BitLicense in 2015 was initially regarded as something of a disaster, potentially stifling the innovation of fintech by imposing draconian restrictions on cryptocurrency use. By 2020, however, the fruits of regulation were paying off with the regulatory clarity under the Bitlicense enabling corporate giants like PayPal, Gemini and Coinbase to attract the deep pockets of Wall Street.In 2019, during the lead up to his presidential run, Yang argued that congress lacks the basic knowledge required to enact effective cryptocurrency legislation, and that countries which are ahead of the U.S. in regulation will eventually “(dictate) the rules that we’ll need to follow once we catch up.”Andrew, I love you, but even New York can only fit so much speculative grift https://t.co/WinZnqV7STYang was reportedly on the short list of potential nominees to fill the Secretary of Commerce position under the Biden administration.

371,"A Bitcoin exchange traded fund for investment firm Purpose Investments has been approved in Canada after the Ontario Securities Commission gave the green light for the institutional fund.The Purpose Bitcoin ETF is reportedly the first in the world to be physically settled using BTC, the firm stated clarified;An ETF style product from 3iQ was approved by Canadian regulators last year and listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, however it was a closed end fund rather than one continually issuing units.The decision document was approved on Thursday, Feb. 11, and covers the following territories; British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories, Yukon and Nunavut.It stated that the fund will offer units denominated in both United States and Canadian dollars with a 0.7% management fee, adding that it had applied to list ABTC units on the Toronto Stock Exchange.Speaking to Reuters, Arthur Salzer, chief executive officer of Northland Wealth Management stated he ""thinks the OSC is doing the right thing allowing for an ETF,” adding “it gets rid of some of the negatives of the current funds.”Accelerate Financial Technologies has also filed and obtained a receipt for a preliminary prospectus with Canadian securities regulators for the Accelerate Bitcoin ETF (ABTC) on Feb. 2.In mid-January, Canadian investment fund manager Arxnovum also filed a prospectus for a Bitcoin ETF with the Ontario Securities Commission.This article has been updated to specify that it was the first physically settled ETF, clarify the name of the fund as Purpose Bitcoin ETF and add reference to 3iQ's product."
372,"Powers On... is a new monthly opinion column from Marc Powers, who spent much of his 40-year legal career working with complex securities-related cases in the United States after a stint with the SEC. He is now an Adjunct Professor at Florida International University School of Law, where he teaches a course on 'Blockchain, Crypto and Regulatory Considerations.'Dear Readers: Here is my first opinion piece for Cointelegraph since my retirement a month ago from law firm practice (and prior to that, the SEC) after a 40 year career. It is an exciting opportunity for me, and hopefully an interesting one for you. The shackles of politically correct, business sensitive communications are now gone, and I no longer have to ‘pre-clear’ or worry about the potential of my words offending regulators, politicians, colleagues, or clients of my law firm.You will be hearing my personal and (mostly) objective views, which will be free from material conflicts. I seek no business from you for this endeavor. I only seek to be read, and perhaps stimulate dialogue to influence the actions of others — whether regulators, businesses, or legislators — to promote the advancement and adoption of blockchain technology, its use cases for businesses and banked and unbanked populations, and the safe and responsible regulation of cryptocurrencies.My first column is on where I see the United States in comparison to the rest of the world in its accommodation, acceptance and adoption of blockchain, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.I start on this important topic because I worry that the United States, and its institutions and regulators may, by their actions and inactions, and whether by design or otherwise, be undermining the development, use and availability of digital assets for citizens of this country. And this could be to the detriment of us all.These actions include generally hostile Congressional hearings on blockchain and Facebook’s Diem, née Libra; as well as SEC enforcement actions which continue to target the ICOs of 2017 and 2018; and FinCEN regulations proposed the week before Christmas seeking to require regulated financial institutions and MSBs to disclose virtually all cryptocurrency transactions and information on the institution’s customers and counterparties involving unhosted digital wallets.The only bright spots have been the thoughtful writings and speeches by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce and actions by the recently departed acting Comptroller of the Currency, Brian Brooks, in allowing financial institutions to custody digital assets and use blockchains for financial transactions.What most politicians and regulators in the U.S. fail to appreciate is that while we stifle blockchain advancement and the use of cryptocurrencies for capital formation, there are other countries and jurisdictions which welcome and embrace it. In failing to adapt, the U.S. faces the real risk that this new technology will be “owned” by other countries, some of which may be adversaries and competitors.In China, there is the People’s Bank of China’s digital currency and electronic payments project. That pilot, using digital currency and wallets issued by China’s Central Bank, has reportedly processed over three million transactions totaling over $160 million as of last November.In Switzerland, not only has the country encouraged blockchain adoption, but the city of Zug implemented blockchain for both government and residential use.In Sweden and Georgia, land registries are on the blockchain.Capital raising is the lifeblood of many developers, entrepreneurs and blockchain companies. It is essential for the health and expansion of blockchain projects and their communities. The mechanism of choice is often an offering of digital tokens. Yet, many U.S. politicians and regulators have a myopic and provincial view embracing the thought that all which occurs in blockchain transactions must be adopted by, or guided by, U.S. policy views.But guess what? As many regular readers of this publication, or investors in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies know, every day there are financial transactions occurring worldwide over the internet and various blockchains, with no government oversight or approval. Immune to, and regardless of, what Congress, the SEC, CFTC, FinCEN and the U.S. Fed says or wants. These currencies represent living entities and businesses that have vibrant lives beyond these shores.At the time of writing, CoinMarketCap lists thousands of cryptocurrencies on its platform. These tokens are traded on dozens of exchanges, many of which are not registered in or regulated by the United States. And while the U.S. equity markets primarily trade from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. EST Monday through Friday, tokens never stop trading. They don’t know the difference between weekdays and weekends. They’re bought, hoarded, traded and shared between both sophisticated and unsophisticated investors and traders all around the world.The U.S. has sought, and may continue to seek, to stop this with new laws and regulations: But this is an exercise in futility. The cat is not only out of the bag, it is feasting lavishly at the table.In the process of attempting to stifle innovation, the U.S. will lose world dominance for the U.S. Dollar and the power and influence of its political and economic institutions. Acting Comptroller Brooks aptly wrote parting words and advice to the new Biden Administration in The Hill last month: “[i]f the United States focuses on the risks and not the benefits [of cryptocurrency and decentralized finance], we will fall behind as the global financial system is rewired.”So, where does that leave us, with the new Biden Administration and Congress? What can we expect and what should Americans be doing to make sure the U.S. continues as the dominant player for capital formation, trading and world affairs?A quick glance at Congress is hardly encouraging. On January 15th, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi named Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashid Tlaib to the important House Financial Services Committee, chaired by Representative Maxine Waters. Waters has not shown any obvious friendliness toward, or deep understanding of, blockchain, digital currencies and their useful applications. Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib will likely have other issues which they will prioritize. In the U.S. Senate, neither Senators Mike Crapo nor Sherrod Brown of the Senate Banking Committee have been standouts for advancing cryptocurrencies. Although at least Brown had embraced a Central Bank digital currency and the maintenance of digital wallets for Americans at the onset of the pandemic as part of the relief bill.The SEC will likely be under the leadership of former Goldman Sachs partner and CFTC Chairman, Gary Gensler. It is less apparent what will occur. Gensler has been a professor at MIT and has taught a class on blockchain, banking and cryptocurrencies in the business school. In reviewing some of his lectures and materials for the class, there is no question he has a full and helpful grasp on the subject matter and issues that arise from an evolving political and regulatory framework. He also wrote an opinion piece for CoinDesk a year ago on December 15, 2019, entitled “Even if a Thousand Projects Don’t Make it, Blockchain is Still a Change Catalyst.”The Gensler writing concludes with some thoughts of encouragement:“Though literally thousands of projects have yet to land on broadly adopted use cases, I remain intrigued by Satoshi’s innovation’s potential to spur change-either directly or indirectly as a catalyst. The potential to lower verification and networking costs is worth pursuing, particularly to lower economic rents and data privacy costs, and promote economic inclusion. Further, shared blockchain applications might help jumpstart multiparty network solutions in fields that historically have been fragmented or resilient to change.”Yet, elsewhere in the piece he ruminates that “the question remains what uses will cryptocurrencies and blockchain have beyond acting as a catalyst of change? Beyond Bitcoin providing a scarce digital speculative store of value, and niche applications in digital exchanges, gaming, and gambling, what applications will be sustainable for cryptocurrencies as a new form of private money?”Gensler also had a reputation as an aggressive regulator. While he accomplished much at the CFTC in fulfilling the mandates of Dodd-Frank, especially in the creation of a swaps exchange, he ruffled some feathers with other regulators and abroad. He also sued large financial institutions in enforcement actions. So it is not clear where he will set the priorities of the SEC as Chairman. One thing does seem certain, though. As an apparent believer in regulation and its enforcement, we can expect Gensler to seek broad regulation over as much of the blockchain ecosystem as his fellow Commissioners, the courts and Congress will allow.From my point of view, over-regulation is not a good thing for blockchain and its adoption and broad acceptance. Nor is regulation by prosecution, a phrase coined many years ago in a book title by former SEC Commissioner Roberta Karmel. Reasonable and thoughtful regulation is needed.Yes, I accept and agree that investor protection is important. But a major element in the development of blockchain technology and philosophy is to allow all people — sophisticated and unsophisticated, banked or unbanked, wealthy or poor — to interact, peer-to-peer, without government or other third-party interference.I do not adhere to the philosophical belief which some regulators and Congressional staff have that most retirees are simple idiots and will blow their savings on cryptocurrency scams by foreign exchanges and issuers. We should not claim that for the protection of the few we must over-regulate and kill innovation in this nascent technology and industry, and thus become the enemy of the many. Smart regulation, and laws that stop crime, protect investors and businesses, and promote the best uses of blockchain technology seems right here.In any event, education and disclosure are two of the important hallmarks of the Federal securities laws and best way to stop fraud. Not prohibiting the conduct entirely, or making it so difficult to proceed.It will be interesting to see how things go in the coming year. Are we marching toward a coherent and sensible regulatory framework for this industry? Or toward a stifling environment that will drive innovation and economic growth overseas?I know where I’m placing my hopes.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.The opinions expressed are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of the University or its affiliates.

373,"The price of Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, has been stagnating against Bitcoin in recent days after a strong few weeks against BTC.In the past few weeks, ETH and BTC have shown some inverse correlation as ETH rallied strongly when BTC consolidated, and vice versa.In the last several hours, Bitcoin has seen a decent rally after BNY Mellon said it would begin offering Bitcoin services later this year.Roman Regelman, the CEO of BNY Mellon’s asset servicing and digital, said:The announcement almost immediately uplifted the momentum of Bitcoin, causing it to rally from around $45,500 to around $47,400. It eventually reached an all-time high hours after, rising to above $48,500.During the same period, the ETH/BTC pair pulled back despite their respective USD remaining in relative lockstep. But in recent weeks, ETH typically rallied harder than Bitcoin during uptrends, alongside both large-cap altcoins and DeFi tokens.But, in the last 24 hours as Bitcoin gained significant short-term momentum, ETH has been lagging behind BTC.Willy Woo, a popular on-chain analyst, said that historically, Bitcoin is a better “multi-cycle HODL” while ETH is a “better mid-macro” swing trade.This trend is shown during short-term cycles as well, as Bitcoin tends to increase steadily most of the time while ETH either accelerates against BTC or stagnates. He said:In the near term, traders and analysts generally remain optimistic around the short-term cycle of ETH.For instance, there has been no sell-the-news reaction to the CME ETH futures listing, which is a positive factor that may boost the chances of ETH’s rally continuing.Additionally, on the first day of trading, the CME ETH futures market traded over $30 million in volume, which is relatively high for the first day of trading. Thus, if the institutional demand for ETH rises similar to Bitcoin in late 2020, ETH could see a broader rally in the weeks to come.A trader known as “Pentoshi” said that altcoins and ETH should have much stronger momentum, suggesting that they are currently stagnating. He said:For now, $1,800 remains the key level to break for ETH to regain momentum against both Bitcoin and the U.S. dollar in the foreseeable future."
374,"Even though Tesla has made its way into the crypto market recently, it generated an immense amount of publicity surrounding the announcement. On Feb. 8, the car manufacturer caught the crypto world off-guard by committing a cool $1.5 billion into Bitcoin (BTC), as well as announcing that the company will soon be looking to accept payments in crypto. As a result of the news, BTC shot up to as high as $48,000 only to subsequently cool down and settle around the $44,500 region.In the wake of this development, it has also come to light that the above-stated surge was, in large part, driven by whales who took Tesla’s announcement to be a buy signal. In this regard, as per data available on Binance, whales have been dabbling in “unusually large BTC buy volumes.”Analysts believe that anytime a major publicly listed company makes its way into the digital asset space, a frenzy begins that creates positive market sentiment around BTC. For example, Filbfilb, a pseudonymous Bitcoin trader, stated that as things stand, an increasing number of companies will now be forced by their shareholders to provide them with some level of crypto exposure.According to Hunter Merghart, head of United States operations for cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp, told Cointelegraph that while Square paved the way for everyone, Tesla adopting Bitcoin on its balance sheets will be viewed as a watershed moment for the industry, adding:A similar sentiment is shared by Sam Tabar, former managing director for Bank of America Merrill Lynch and co-founder of Fluidity — the firm behind P2P trading platform AirSwap — who believes that this is the moment the crypto industry has been waiting for — i.e., receiving an institutional stamp of approval for Bitcoin from an S&P 500 company.Also, taking a dig at the naysayers, Tabar highlighted to Cointelegraph that just a few years ago, people would scoff at Bitcoin and crypto in general as being a tool for drug dealers and other miscreants. “Then they would claim that Bitcoin takes too much electricity, but if you compare BTC electricity use versus all the electricity that is used in traditional finance, you’d be quite surprised,” he added.Lastly, Ben Zhou, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bybit, told Cointelegraph that Tesla embracing Bitcoin has reduced carrier risk calculations for corporate treasurers and that he now foresees a small but sustained trickle of corporate adoption, including that of multinationals, the cumulation of which will eventually serve a backstop against significant volatility.In addition, he also believes that as Bitcoin continues to gain acceptance in the eyes of institutions and corporations, the crypto community may become more incentivized than ever before to drive innovation within this nascent space. For example, Merghart believes that in the near future there will see more multinationals exploring Bitcoin and eventually even other crypto assets through borrowing/lending or faster cross-border payments through stablecoins.While MicroStrategy, Square and PayPal’s recent moves helped garner a decent amount of traction for crypto, there is no denying that Tesla’s acquisition has been the one that has brought the most attention to the industry in its decade-old existence. For proof, one only needs to look at various mainstream media outlets and how pretty much every news platform has covered the story since it broke.Stephen Stonberg, chief operating officer for Bittrex Global exchange, told Cointelegraph that he believes that the announcement has and will continue to raise awareness for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market in general, adding:The same outlook is shared by Paolo Ardoino, chief technical officer for digital asset trading platform Bitfinex, who told Cointelegraph that Tesla’s announcement may very well bring “cryptocurrency to a new level” and that there may be “no going back” for the industry from here on out. He continued: “I expect Bitcoin to be added to the balance sheet of many corporations as its quality as a form of digital gold becomes only more relevant.”Lastly, another company whose name has come up recently in regard to Bitcoin is Apple, especially as the multinational is uniquely positioned as a leader within the domain of consumer technology. Kris Marszalek, CEO of digital currency payments platform Crypto.com, told Cointelegraph that if Apple Pay were to extend its support to crypto, the move would be extremely bullish for the firm.Furthermore, even Marc Benioff, CEO of American cloud-based software company Salesforce, recently tweeted out a cryptic message that read, “Trust is the currency of the realm,” leading many to speculate that the $200-billion company with almost $10 billion in cash may also be considering or has already invested in Bitcoin.On the subject of diversification, Marszalek opined: “Our world today is one of zero interest rates and endless debasement of fiat currencies. In order to keep up, institutions will have to look towards alternative stores of value, of which Bitcoin is one of the best.”As the crypto market continues to experience an unparalleled amount of positive traction in recent months, there are also many players from the traditional finance sector who believe that Tesla’s move is just a one-off phenomenon and that people should not expect many other big-name players to follow in the company’s footsteps.For example, strategists for investment bank JPMorgan Chase, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, believe that Tesla’s $1.5-billion Bitcoin purchase will not necessarily trigger similar investments, with Panigirtzoglou claiming that BTC’s volatility will still continue to keep mainstream corporate treasurers away from crypto.Similarly, perennial gold backer Peter Schiff also highlighted the fact that Tesla’s new investment policy allows for the purchase of gold bullion and gold exchange-traded funds, even going as far as suggesting that the company is already offloading its BTC investment as the market responds to the news by pumping its value up.Lastly, Matvey Voytov, chief marketing officer at Waves Enterprise — an enterprise-grade blockchain platform — told Cointelegraph that it is quite unlikely that other enterprises will blindly follow Tesla, saying: “I expect that most big companies will wait, as there are still solid entry barriers in most countries regarding crypto legislations.” He also believes that investors would prefer to take a safe route to invest since “many corporate finance leaders remember being burned in 2008 by higher-yielding choices.”Even though the crypto market continues to face daily volatility swings, from a macro perspective, it’s worth remembering the fact that over the course of the last nine months, central banks all over the world have continued to print their local currencies, leading to the unprecedented dilution of most fiat assets.Related: Coincidence? Company stocks rise after they buy Bitcoin as a reserveFor example, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States Federal Reserve has rolled out a number of stimulus packages, with the most recent one being valued at close to $3 trillion. What’s more, the central bank has also vowed to keep printing a total of $120 billion per month for the foreseeable future to help the American economy back on its feet.Stonberg elucidated that such high levels of quantitative easing “might well lead to multinationals hedging on harder assets, such as limited supply digital assets, gold and silver as a hedge.”"

376,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price broke through the crucial level at $40,500 as news of Tesla adding $1.5 billion in Bitcoin to their balance sheet. This news event pushed the price to new all-time highs, putting the next major resistance level at $50,000. What's more, other cryptocurrencies are accelerating left and right as the landscape is ideal for altcoins to start moving. All-time highs are being established daily across many altcoins while Bitcoin is consolidating. But how long will this consolidation last? Let's take a look at the charts. The 4-hour chart shows an apparent breakthrough of the $40,500, which was crucial for more upside as the Tesla news resulted in the biggest daily green candle ever for Bitcoin. As the chart shows, the next level of interest is the psychological barrier around $50,000. It’s also the next major Fibonacci level. The 1.618 Fibonacci level is often used as a crucial indicator to predict levels in price discovery.Another important level to watch for Bitcoin is the order block around the $43,300-$43,700 area. Continuation to the upside is likely as long as that area holds. However, a sharp drop is likely to happen if Bitcoin’s price can’t hold this level. Falling through the $43,300-$43,700 area would generate a cascade of stop/loss triggers as the price of Bitcoin drops back in the range it acted in for several weeks. The next level of support can be found between $37,800-$38,500 if $43,300 fails to hold.The Dollar Strength Index (DXY) shows weakness after a temporary bottom at 90 points. This bottom formation was marked by a bullish divergence, resulting in a small relief rally. This rally ended at the 91.60 points level and made a U-turn.The primary question for the DXY now would be whether the 90 points level can hold. If that is the case, then the bullish divergence is still valid and a renewed test of 92 could occur. Such a rebound would likely lead to a pullback for the crypto market.However, if the DXY index continues its downtrend, then there won't be much to stop the cryptocurrency market from making higher highs and BTC hitting $50,000. The total market capitalization of crypto shows strength as it broke through the previous high. Only a minor retest of $730 billion occurred, which was followed by a nearly vertical move.The Fibonacci extension tool now shows that the new point of interest is now at $1.5 trillion, as the chart shows.The question is whether the market is ready to continue from here to the next potential point of interest at $2.1 trillion. If the market corrects, which may happen if Bitcoin loses the $43,300-$43,700 level, then traders should watch the $1.05 trillion level for a potential bounce.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

377,"Bank of New York Mellon, America’s oldest bank, has announced plans to hold, transfer and issue Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies as an asset manager on behalf of its clients.The impetus for the decision reportedly came from institutional investors — the top brass of BNY Mellon’s clientele — amid the 2021 bull season for the asset class. As the Wall Street Journal notes, BNY Mellon is hardly the first household name in traditional finance to embrace digital assets, the likes of Fidelity Investments have long been in the game. Yet it is the first national custody bank to commit to the introduction of cryptocurrency custody for its clientele in the short-term i.e. “later this year.”Roman Regelman, chief executive of the bank’s asset-servicing and digital businesses, is cited by the WSJ as saying that “digital assets are becoming part of the mainstream.” According to the report, BNY Mellon plans to manage cryptocurrencies using a platform, now in prototype version, that will also be used to handle traditional holdings such a Treasuries and stocks. Nor has BNY Mellon put any limits on which kinds of cryptocurrencies it’s ready to custody. A dedicated team of bank executives, led by Mike Demissie, has reportedly been tasked with overseeing the integration of cryptocurrency custody and management into all of the bank’s businesses.While BNY Mellon is pressing forward with its plans, Regelman nonetheless anticipates that full incorporation of digital assets into traditional banking infrastructure will take another three to five years."
378,"Not all analysts are convinced that Tesla’s recent acquisition of $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) will prove to be as beneficial for the tech giant as it was for the BTC coin price.Head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, Peter Garnry, wrote in a research note that Elon Musk had exposed Tesla and its investors to “immense risk”, as reported by Reuters on Feb. 11.“Elon Musk has exposed Tesla to immense mark-to-market risk,” wrote Garnry, adding that the main concern for investors was valuing Bitcoin’s worth over the long term, given the intense market volatility it’s been subject to since its creation.Elsewhere, former Goldman Sachs executive Gary Black announced to Twitter followers on Feb. 8 that he had closed out positions held in Tesla Inc ($TSLA), quoting the firm’s “more risky capital allocation” among his reasons.The value of Bitcoin increased 20% in the 24 hours immediately after news broke concerning Tesla’s $1.5 billion acquisition, sparking a renewed surge in the cryptocurrency market resulting in new all-time highs for Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) and many others. Meanwhile, the value of Tesla stock dropped 7.5% over the course of the subsequent trading days.Reported concurrently was the response by Brett Winton, director of research at ARK Invest, which allocates 8.75% of its portfolio to Tesla stock, who said the investment represented an “appropriate use of cash,” adding, “We are comfortable with the way in which we are forecasting the positions we are putting our clients in front of.""The CEO of Grayscale, Michael Sonnenshein, recently suggested that Elon Musk’s public vindication of Bitcoin would spark a “race” to invest by institutional buyers and other tech ""visionaries"". Sonnenshein said Grayscale, which has a vested interest in the matter at hand, had witnessed stronger inflows moving into 2021 than were recorded during the record-breaking year of 2020."
379,"The head of the European Central Bank (ECB) thinks that central banks worldwide will not be holding Bitcoin (BTC) any time soon.In a conference call with The Economist on Feb. 10, Christine Lagarde showed herself to be firmly risk-off when it came to decentralized cryptocurrencies.""It's very unlikely — I would say it's out of the question,"" she responded when asked about central bank Bitcoin uptake.Lagarde has long derided Bitcoin, which has surged at a time when the ECB prints huge amounts of liquidity in an attempt to shore up its financial jurisdiction after a year of government-imposed lockdowns.The ECB is nonetheless ""doing its best"" to promote Bitcoin by accident, bestselling author of ""The Bitcoin Standard"" Saifedean Ammous says.He referenced another ECB event this week which yielded signs that consumers throughout the Eurozone bloc may be grappling with negative interest rates within years.Quoted by Bloomberg, one executive board member said that should the the institution create a digital euro, it should charge people who refuse to spend it.The reason, Fabio Panetta argued, is that should the Eurozone experience another financial crisis, consumers might drain their bank accounts and bank directly with the digital euro's issuer.“For example, in times of crisis it could be necessary to adjust the remuneration of the digital currency, but this could signal that the central bank is anticipating financial tensions, leading to self-fulfilling instability,” he added.As such, in order to keep banks afloat, the digital euro, somewhat ironically, should punish those who attempt to avoid to safeguard their financial integrity.According to Bloomberg, Panetta said that a tax of 2% would be insufficient to halt a bank run, and that the remuneration he spoke of should be ""highly penalizing."" Perhaps unsurprsiingly, his comments drew derision from Bitcoin proponents who have long enjoyed the ability save without paying for the privilege via negative interest rates. ""The ECB really doing its best to emphasize and advertise Bitcoin's value proposition,"" Ammous summarized.It is not the first time that the central bank has inadvertently advertised the benefits of using a currency not under its control. As Cointelegraph reported, various officials have unmasked the unattractiveness of the euro as a financial proposition on multiple occasions.   The digital euro is thought to be at least four years away, far behind experiments by China, which is already rolling out its digital yuan."
380,"Sandeep Biswas, managing director and CEO at Newcrest Mining, believes crypto investors should consider buying some gold to protect themselves against highly unstable prices of cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC).“If you’re into cryptos, you want to consider having some gold,” Biswas said on Bloomberg TV Thursday, stressing that gold is less volatile than crypto.The exec emphasized that gold is a different class of investment. “It’s a tangible asset: you can see it, you can touch it, you can feel it, you can mold it, you can make it into jewelry, whatever you want.” Biswas noted the scarce nature of gold, stating, “There's only so much that will be found [...] whereas cryptocurrencies, we see them proliferating all over the place.“ The mining exec said that the overall trend of gold prices remains strong amid the global inflation and money printing triggered by government stimulus programs to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.Biswas’ remarks come amid a slight spike in volatility on crypto markets. After breaking its new all-time high of over $48,000 on Feb. 9, Bitcoin subsequently saw a correction, with BTC price pulling back below $45,000 the next day. As reported by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin’s annualized volatility surged amid rallying prices recently, nearly touching the volatility levels recorded amid “Black Thursday,” when Bitcoin price plunged 40% in a matter of days from $9,000 to $5,200.Amid highly volatile moves on the crypto market, gold has been steadily inching up amid a weaker United States dollar triggered by hopes for a U.S. stimulus package. At the time of writing, spot gold is trading at $1,842, slightly up around 0.1% over the past 24 hours.In December 2020, American investment bank Goldman Sachs suggested that Bitcoin’s parabolic surge in late 2020 should not hurt traditional assets like gold. “We do not see evidence that Bitcoin’s rally is cannibalizing gold’s bull market and believe the two can coexist,” the bank stated."
381,"Bitcoin (BTC) whale cluster data shows that $44,214 is the key near term level that the dominant cryptocurrency needs to defend.As Cointelegraph reported, in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin saw a sell-off after reaching a new all-time high at around $48,000, with the price shedding almost 8% and dropping to as low as $43,750 on Binance.Whale clusters form when whales or high-net-worth investors purchase Bitcoin at a certain price level and do not move them.These levels often act as support or resistance levels because whales are more likely to buy more BTC at the level they are holding from or sell at breakeven.Analysts at Whalemap said that losing the $44,214 support level would likely result in a drop to $39,843 in the short term.But, if the level holds, then it would mean that it has become a new support area following the rally driven by Tesla purchasing $1.5 billion worth of BTC. The analysts said:There are several arguments to support a near term bullish trajectory for Bitcoin. First, according to the researchers at Santiment, the number of active Bitcoin addresses and the exchange supply of Stablecoins are high.The combination of these two metrics suggest an overall healthy uptrend for Bitcoin backed by strong fundamentals. They wrote:Additionally, the number of non-zero Bitcoin addresses is also at record highs, suggesting that an influx of new buyers is rushing into BTC. #Bitcoin $BTC Number of Non-Zero Addresses just reached an ATH of 34,724,050

382,"United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is concerned about crypto's supposed criminal element. In Feb. 10 remarks to a financial sector innovation roundtable, United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stated that the misuse of cryptocurrencies and virtual assets has been a growing problem alongside cyber attacks triggered by the global pandemic.Secretary Yellen said that despite the potential of new technologies like crypto, such assets are still associated with major risks. “I see the promise of these new technologies, but I also see the reality: cryptocurrencies have been used to launder the profits of online drug traffickers; they’ve been a tool to finance terrorism,” Yellen stated.According to the official, the private sector has been making a significant contribution to the government’s efforts to combat these crypto-related crimes. “From my time at the Fed, I know the crucial role your institutions play in combating crimes like these. The private sector invests enormous resources, finding ways to stop bad actors from misusing existing technologies. You also develop new ones,"" Yellen.In the statement, Yellen also stressed the need of “equitable innovation” to help “bring the benefits of the financial system and modern IT to more people.” She said that the equitable innovation approach can be symbiotic with the Treasury Department’s existing motto of “responsible innovation.”Despite Yellen claiming that misuse of crypto has been a “growing problem,” the amount of crypto-related crimes has apparently dropped in 2020. According to Chainalysis — one of the largest crypto intelligence firms in the U.S. — the criminal share of all crypto activity in 2020 fell to just 0.34%. In 2019, criminal activity represented over 2% of cryptocurrency transaction volumes, according to the firm.In January 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice seized half a million dollars in crypto from major malware operator with help of Chainalysis."
383,"The Lightning Network has grown 75% in size over the past year, hitting a record high 8,900 nodes for the first time on Feb. 8, according to LN monitors at Bitcoin Visuals. A significant proportion of the increase occurred more recently, suggesting that some Bitcoiners are gravitating toward the layer-two solution, potentially as a means of escaping ever-increasing transaction fees.The total BTC locked in LN channels has remained in the 1,000 to 1,100 range since Aug. 2020 — however the total dollar value has risen 250% in the intervening months, translating to a record $42.72 million currently locked on the network.The total number of channels between nodes currently stands at about 38,600, which is the highest since May 2019. This count does not represent channels between private nodes.I've been using the lightning network for 2 years. I already use it for monthly payroll.

I'm still focused on economic inclusion, which requires decentralized unstoppable money, which requires a fee market.

Stoppable money with low fees gets... stopped.Three years after launch, the Lightning Network is still facing an uphill battle to on-board new participants, and is yet to achieve a meaningful level of adoption. Many regular users of Bitcoin are off-put by the technical requirements of funding a Lightning node and maintaining a channel, preferring to stick with on-chain transactions until the experience becomes less daunting.However big exchanges have begun to adopt the network. In Dec. 2020, Kraken shared its plans to integrate the Lightning Network during the first half of 2021. OKEx made a similar announcement early last week and expects to roll out LN support “in the coming quarter.”Bitfinex, which has offered fee-less conversions of LN funds for over a year, has taken the additional step of also supporting Liquid BTC, which is Blockstream’s competing smart contract-driven L2 solution. Both Lightning and Liquid BTC can readily be exchanged for BTC on-chain at Bitfinex.As more exchanges onboard second layer based deposit and withdrawal options for BTC, inter-exchange fund transfers are predicted to become much faster and cheaper, with standard transaction fees being replaced with Lightning’s median base fee of 1 satoshi.The Lightning Network was originally conceived by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja, who published their white paper on the subject in Jan. 2016. Recognizing the limitations of Bitcoin’s (then) 1MB block size cap, Poon and Dryja set out to create a way in which BTC transactions could be made off-chain. The result was an independent, smart contract-based network that has the potential to help Bitcoin scale to a much higher throughput of transactions per second.You need to read what Ross Stevens, Executive Chairman of NYDIG, said to @michael_saylor yesterday about how he's leveraging the #LightningNetwork, @ln_strike and @lightning. ⚡

384,"Legal advisors have warned that Tesla chief executive Elon Musk could come under scrutiny from the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission over his social media activity and public statements around Bitcoin.On Monday, Feb. 8 Tesla announced in an SEC filing that it had purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin and will soon start accepting BTC payments. Shortly afterwards, prices of the asset skyrocketed to a new all-time high of a little over $48,000.Partner at Linklaters and former branch chief of the SEC's division of enforcement, Doug Davison, told the UK’s Telegraph newspaper:Former vice president of the European Central Bank, Vitor Constâncio, echoed the sentiment concluding that the “SEC will look into this,”It was not disclosed when Tesla had made this investment. In December, Musk said that Tesla could buy bitcoin, and this was followed by many statements that he supported bitcoin. Bitcoin kept going up & Tesla investment has appreciated. The SEC will look into this 5/The SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have the ability to investigate should they suspect market manipulation.Musk has been vocal on Twitter about Bitcoin and DOGE on a number of occasions which contributed to Bitcoin activity on the social media platform spiking to its highest levels.Bitcoin surged 20% in late January after Musk added #Bitcoin to his Twitter bio and tweeted ""In retrospect it was inevitable"" and in late December he posted an explicit meme suggesting he was strongly tempted to buy Bitcoin.There is little doubt that Tesla’s public foray into Bitcoin has contributed to this latest price spike, with Musk’s influential tweets about crypto to his 46.5 million followers also able to move markets.He is still currently shilling Dogecoin with this recent tweet late on Feb. 10 stating he is buying the asset. DOGE spiked 13% following that particular tweet a few hours ago.Bought some Dogecoin for lil X, so he can be a toddler hodlerMusk is no stranger to Twitter controversy; he has been previously accused of posting misinformation on the platform regarding Covid-19 and the closure of one of his factories.In another incident he suggested that Tesla stock price was too high, resulting in a subsequent price slide. The SEC sued Musk for fraud, charging the Tesla chief with making “false and misleading tweets,” but he settled with the regulator soon after."
385,"Mastercard has announced plans to support cryptocurrencies in 2021, paving the way for its nearly one billion users to spend digital assets at more than 30 million merchants.The firm believes this may open merchants up to new customers and build loyalty with existing customers who are already migrating to digital assets over traditional fiat options.While the global payments giant noted it is planning to support stablecoins due to their “reliability and security,” Mastercard declined to name any specific cryptocurrencies it will integrate.However, Mastercard offered four core criteria by which it will be assessing prospective assets: robust consumer protections including consumer privacy and security, strict KYC compliance, adherence to local laws and regulations, and stability as a means of payment.Mastercard also noted it is “actively engaging with several major central banks around the world” to support central bank digital currency initiatives, or CBDCs.Last year, the firm released a ""virtual sandbox"" tool to demonstrate how a CBDC can be used to settle consumer purchases using Mastercard’s infrastructure.Mastercard’s announcement also reported increasing demand for digital assets among its customers, noting that many users have been buying crypto assets with their Mastercards amid the current bull market.“Digital assets are becoming a more important part of the payments world,” Mastercard concluded.Mastercard already devoted significant resources into exploring distributed ledger technology, with the company currently holding 89 blockchain patents while a further 285 applications are pending.The payments provider has engaged in crypto payments for some time now, partnering with Wirex and BitPay to create crypto cards, although no cryptocurrencies moved through Mastercard’s network.Mastercard’s announcement is the latest of a series of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies that have come in the last few weeks. This week Tesla announced a purchase of $1.5 billion Bitcoin from its cash reserve adding that it will soon accept Bitcoin payments for its cars.Last week, PayPal doubled down on crypto announcing that it will offer crypto payments for its 26 million merchants after its limited crypto trading services “exceeded expectations.”One week prior to this, Visa chairman and CEO Al Kelly reaffirmed its commitment to crypto payments and onramps during its Q1 earnings call.Speculation on which other tech firms will be the next to enter the cryptocurrency rabbit-hole has also started emerging, with financial services provider RBC Capital Markets stating that Apple should follow in Tesla’s footsteps. RBC analyst Mitch Steves wrote to clients that developing a crypto exchange into the Apple Wallet would create a sizeable new market for growth."
386,"According to analysis by Mark “Murch” Erhardt of Chaincode Labs, 88% of all Bitcoin transaction inputs pay higher fees than are necessary. Erhardt bases his conclusion on data showing just 12% of transaction inputs use the SegWit format, which is less fee intensive than transacting with legacy inputs.Erhardt believes that a reliance on legacy transaction fees keeps Bitcoin blocks smaller than they could otherwise be, contributing to a seemingly growing backlog of unconfirmed transactions.A clogged up Bitcoin mempool containing 107 blocks worth of transactions at one point yesterday serves as a reminder that it is possible to save money on fees by creating less costly transactions. The easiest way to do this, according to Erhardt, is by adopting SegWit for all future transactions.Erhardt pointed out that switching from legacy to data efficient SegWit transactions is necessary to minimize bloating of the blockchain:Erhardt believes that integration of SegWit into major wallet provision services is long overdue, contributing to unnecessary mempool and blockchain bloat. “It's been almost 3.5 years since SegWit activated,” he noted at the end of a thread about the state of the mempool.The mempool has not cleared in 57 days. BTC is estimated to facilitate more on-chain payments than ever before. BTC has 98.3% of the SHA256d hashrate. The average blocksize is 1,320.39 kB for the past 30 days. Fees made up 16.13% of the past day's mining rewards.#mempoolreport pic.twitter.com/ldJsnETeK8Employed for years as a cryptocurrency wallet developer before being hired at Chaincode Labs in 2020, Erhardt is a specialist in UTXO management for commercial Bitcoin wallets, helping them save money on business-related transaction and maintenance costs in a variety of ways.SegWit transactions currently account for approximately 51% of all Bitcoin transactions; a statistic that is deemed likely to grow in size as commercial wallet providers face rising demand for SegWit address support.The estimated minimum fee for inclusion into the next block is currently 149 sat/byte, which equates to a fee of $14.97 at a price of $44,870 per BTC.While SegWit transactions are technically no smaller in size than legacy transactions, the components of their data are weighted differently when it comes to including them in a block.Data pertaining to the witness component of a transaction is considered to be non-essential to a functioning blockchain and therefore discounted when totaling a transaction’s size. This makes SegWit transactions appear smaller and therefore require less of a fee to process — they are quicker to confirm than a legacy transaction with the same feeAfter finding a competent and trustworthy wallet that supports SegWit transactions, the most important component to using SegWit is moving funds designated to be spent from legacy addresses (begins with a “1” or “3”) to SegWit addresses (begins with a “bc1”).One of the most popular and battle-tested Bitcoin wallets with SegWit support is Electrum, which also supports multi-signature transactions and the import/export of private keys. A growing number of major exchanges are adopting SegWit support, including Bitstamp, BitMEX, and most recently, Binance. This means transactions to exchanges can also be made cheaper by sending them from a SegWit address."
387,"On Feb. 10, Bitcoin (BTC) price pulled back 5% from its newly established $48,220 high and a number of altcoins also underwent slight corrections. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows Bitcoin has declined 4.96% since yesterday’s highs and currently trades at $44,900.The pullback to the $45,000 level could simply be the result of traders taking recent profits from Bitcoin and altcoins as the rally appeared to be losing momentum around the $48,000 level.A recent announcement from JPMorgan analysts saying that they don’t expect to see any large firms follow Tesla’s recent $1.5 billion Bitcoin purchase could have caused jitters among some investors but data from Grayscale Investments shows most institutional investors are keen to learn more about investing in BTC.A bit of positive news came from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who doubled down on his support for the crypto sector by donating $1 million to Coin Center, a Washington D.C.-based advocacy group. Dorsey also revealed that Twitter is exploring the option of how it could pay employees in BTC.Congestion and high transaction fees on the Ethereum network have put a spotlight on layer-2 and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible protocols as projects and traders alike flood to Matic (MATIC) and Avalanche (AVAX).This steady inflow of funds to each project resulted in price rallies of more than than 200% over the past week.Binance Coin (BNB) has also seen significant price appreciation in recent days, reaching a new high at $148 on Feb.10. The move to a new all-time high comes as the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) grows in prominence and competes with Ethereum and DeFi platforms.The three major stock market indices established new record-highs in today’s early trading hours before falling under pressure to close the day mixed.The S&P 500 and NASDAQ spent most of the day in the red and despite a late surge closed down 0.03% and 0.25% respectively while the Dow was able to hold bears off and finish up 0.20%.While there was no specific news prompting market pressure, all three indices have seen surging prices during the first week of February, so a modest pullback is expected in a normal market cycle.A new wave of selling hit the crypto market just as traditional markets closed and the top-25 altcoins fell under pressure.Notable exceptions to the bearish downturn include Cardano (ADA), which is currently up 28.11% and trading at a price of $0.892, and AVAX which is up 85.39%and trading for $58.26.Celo (CELO) is also put on a strong showing, up 40% to trade at $5.00 while The Graph (GRT) has seen its price spike 26% to a new all-time high of $1.26.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.37 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 61.3%."
388,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) market capitalization topped $889 billion on Feb. 9, pushing BTC above the value of Tesla and the Russian ruble, according to data from AssetDash.The current rally is longer limited to Bitcoin as several altcoins have been surging in the past few days. This shows the buying interest is broad-based and today the total crypto market cap surpassed $1.4 trillion.While the positive news flow and price rise in most cryptocurrencies may give the impression that the bull run will never stop, traders should be careful because every bull phase witnesses periodic corrections.Another important thing to note is that every bull phase usually has a different set of leaders. The altcoins that have performed exceedingly well in the current bull run may not lead the next one. Therefore, traders should study their portfolio and close the positions that may not be fundamentally strong but could have risen only due to positive sentiment.It is difficult to time the top because it is only in hindsight that one can say with conviction that a top has been made. Therefore, traders may consider keeping appropriate stop-losses on their positions to protect their paper profits.Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the strength in the trend and the critical levels to watch out for.After the sharp rally on Feb. 8, Bitcoin formed a Doji candlestick pattern on Feb. 9, which suggests the bulls and the bears were undecided about the next move. The indecision has resolved to the downside today, indicating profit-booking by traders.The BTC/USD pair may now drop to the breakout level at $41,959.63. If the price rebounds off this support, it will suggest that the sentiment remains bullish and traders are not waiting for a deeper correction to buy.If the bulls can push the price above $48,152.84, the uptrend may resume, with the next target objective at $60,974.43.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair breaks and sustains below $41,959.63, it will suggest that traders are booking profits aggressively.A break below the moving averages will be the first sign that supply exceeds demand. The bears will gain an upper hand if the pair drops below $28,850.Ether (ETH) made a new all-time high today, but the long wick on the candlestick suggests that traders are booking profits at higher levels. The failure of the biggest altcoin to pick up momentum after breaking above $1,757.338 indicates that demand dries up at higher levels.The ETH/USD pair may witness a minor correction or consolidation that could pull the price down to the 20-day exponential moving average ($1,514). This is an important support to watch out for because the bulls have not allowed the price to sustain below it for the past several weeks.If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that traders continue to view the dips to this level as a buying opportunity. The bulls will then try to resume the uptrend and push the price to $2,000.This positive view will invalidate if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA for more than two days. Such a move will signal that traders are booking profits aggressively and that could pull the price down to the 50-day simple moving average ($1,194).Cardano (ADA) is witnessing a vertical rally that pushed the price to $0.8871889 today. This strong up-move of the past few days has pushed the relative strength index (RSI) deep into overbought territory.Vertical rallies are rarely sustainable and if the uptrend stalls, several momentum traders may rush to the exit, resulting in a sharp drop.The first support on the downside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.6646150 and then the 50% retracement level at $0.5958618.If the price rebounds off either support, it will suggest that bulls continue to look for buying opportunities on dips. They will then try to resume the uptrend and drive the price to the psychological level at $1.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below $0.5958618, the correction could deepen to the 20-day EMA ($0.51).XRP has been a laggard during the current crypto bull run but the bulls are trying to make amends. The buyers are currently trying to push and sustain the price above $0.50. If they manage to do that, a new uptrend is likely.The rising 20-day EMA ($0.39) and the RSI just below the overbought level suggests that bulls have the upper hand. The first target objective on the upside is $0.65 and if this level is scaled, the uptrend may reach $0.75.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above $0.50, it will indicate that traders continue to lighten up their positions on rallies. Such a move could keep the price range-bound between $0.3855 and $0.50 for a few days.Polkadot (DOT) remains in an uptrend but the momentum is weakening. The altcoin formed a Doji candlestick pattern on Feb. 9 and has again made one today, which suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears.If the uncertainty resolves to the downside and the price sustains below $22, the DOT/USD pair could drop to the $19.40 support. This is an important level to keep an eye on because a break below it could pull the price down to $14.7259.On the other hand, if the price turns up from the current level or $19.40, it will suggest traders continue to buy the dips. If the bulls can resume the uptrend, the pair could rally to $30.Binance Coin (BNB) is in a strong uptrend. The vertical rally of the past few days has pushed the RSI above 91, which suggests the markets are overheated in the short-term. Such gravity-defying rallies are rarely sustainable and a correction could be around the corner.The long wick on today’s candlestick suggests traders are booking profits after the recent up-move. The first support on the downside is 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $105.7886 and then the 50% retracement at $92.6259.If the price rebounds off either support, it will suggest that traders continue to buy on dips. The buyers will then try to resume the uptrend. On the other hand, if the price breaks below $92.6259, the BNB/USD pair could drop to the 61.8% retracement level at $79.4632.Litecoin (LTC) broke above the $185.5821 overhead resistance today but the bulls are finding it difficult to sustain the breakout. This suggests the bears are selling at higher levels and are attempting to trap the aggressive bulls.If the LTC/USD pair fails to sustain above $185.5821, the short-term traders may book profits and that could sink the price to the moving averages.If the price bounces off the moving averages, the bulls will again try to propel and sustain the price above $185.5821. If they succeed, the pair may rally to $200 and then to $250.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the moving averages, a drop to $120 is possible. A rebound off this level could keep the pair range-bound for a few days. A break below this support could tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.Chainlink (LINK) rose to a new all-time high on Feb. 9 and the up-move extended today, but the bulls are not able to sustain the momentum. This could have resulted in a few short-term traders booking profits.However, the long tail on today’s candlestick shows the bulls have not given up and are buying on dips.If the price rises from the current levels and breaks above $28.6412, the LINK/USD pair may rally to $30 and then $33.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($23.85), the pair could drop to $20.1111.Dogecoin’s (DOGE) volatility has been reducing and that has resulted in successive inside day candlestick patterns in the past three days. This suggests the bulls and the bears are not taking large directional bets.If the uncertainty resolves to the upside and the bulls push the price above the $0.0875 overhead resistance, the uptrend could resume, with the next target objective at $0.102412 and then $0.13.Contrary to this assumption, if the price slips below $0.0625, the DOGE/USD pair could start a deeper correction that may reach the 20-day EMA ($0.44).Bitcoin Cash (BCH) turned down from the overhead resistance today and has formed a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern. The bears will now try to sink the altcoin to the moving averages.A strong rebound off the moving averages will suggest the bulls are buying on dips. They will then try to once again push and sustain the price above $539. If they succeed, a rally to $631.71 is possible.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below the moving averages, the BCH/USD pair may drop to $370. A strong bounce off this critical support may keep the pair range-bound between $539 and $370 for a few days.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

389,"Strategists at JPMorgan Chase, one of the largest investment banks in the United States, believe that Tesla’s $1.5 billion Bitcoin (BTC) purchase will not necessarily trigger a ton of similar investments.A group of JPMorgan strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou reportedly argued that Bitcoin’s highly volatile nature could keep mainstream corporate treasurers away from Bitcoin. “The main issue with the idea that mainstream corporate treasurers will follow the example of Tesla is the volatility of Bitcoin,” the strategists wrote in a note to investors, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.According to JPMorgan, even a small portion of Bitcoin in corporate treasures’ portfolios would be associated with a high level of risk as such companies usually maintain their portfolio volatility at around 1%. Even if Bitcoin makes up 1% of total allocations, it “would cause a big increase in the volatility of the overall portfolio,” potentially driving the portfolio’s volatility up to 8% due to Bitcoin’s 80% annualized volatility, the strategists said.Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors made the headlines on Feb. 8 by announcing a $1.5 billion Bitcoin purchase in a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The news fueled a parabolic spike in an already rallying crypto market, with Bitcoin subsequently hitting a new all-time high of above $48,000.Following the huge move, a number of major crypto figures including Galaxy Digital founder Michael Novogratz expressed confidence that “every company in America” will follow Tesla’s decision to allocate a part of their balance sheets to Bitcoin. Grayscale Investments CEO Michael Sonnenshein also predicted that the world will soon see a lot of “other visionary leaders and disruptive companies actually realizing it has really moved from why to why not.”Some crypto players also speculated that U.S. tech giant Apple could be the next institutional player to adopt the crypto asset."
390,"The financial and economic narratives surrounding Bitcoin (BTC) barely scratch the surface of what makes the digital asset so unique, according to Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy. In an exclusive interview with Austin Davis for Cointelegraph, Saylor calls Bitcoin “a masterpiece of monetary engineering,” and one that will likely go down in history as the world’s “first engineered monetary network.”That “leak,” Saylor says, is inflation, something Bitcoin has been mathematically designed to resist.  Saylor gave the interview in front of his now-famous 17th century Spanish Galleon, which was intricately crafted in the 19th century. Saylor described the model as a ""work of art,"" and one that provides him with added motivation. The fact that such vessels transported gold across the ocean in days of yore is certainly not lost on him.Bitcoin has become an $850 billion asset following its latest price surge, but that’s only the beginning of its market impact, according to Saylor. He explains why Bitcoin will eventually “subsume gold” to become a $10 trillion asset before reaching $20, $30, $50 and even $100 trillion in value. At that point, Bitcoin will be the “core of the monetary planet.”SEE THE FULL INTERVIEW HERE!Saylor recently pitched Bitcoin to 1,400 corporate executives, where he discussed strategies for incorporating the digital asset into treasury reserves. In his interview with Davis for Cointelegraph, Saylor had a few words of wisdom about what hodlers should do with their Bitcoin if they hope to achieve generational wealth.""You should buy it and hold it forever,"" he opined. ""My advice would be to borrow against it tax-free, never take capital gains, never take an operating income."" Saylor's outlook reflects his own strategy of perma-hodling the digital asset as part of a deliberate campaign to adopt the Bitcoin Standard. His conviction is not only based on Bitcoin's underlying technology, but on the rapidly declining value of fiat currency. His now-famous analogy comparing fiat money to a melting ice cube appears to be resonating with his peers. Check out the interview to learn more. "
391,"Bitcoin (BTC) lost almost 8% on Feb. 10 as the first significant correction after Monday's price pump set in.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView tracked BTC/USD as it fell from local highs of $47,360 to briefly touch $43,750 during trading on Wednesday.The pair had been on course to hit $50,000 after clocking new all-time highs earlier in the week thanks to news that Tesla had converted $1.5 billion of its balance sheet to Bitcoin.Corrections had already been expected, a necessary part of Bitcoin's steady upwards grind, which Cointelegraph Markets analyst filbfilb, believes will see $63,000 hit in the short term. $52,000, he said earlier on Wednesday, may also produce temporary consolidation.On the topic of current market behavior, fellow analyst Michaël van de Poppe likewise advised Twitter followers to adapt to what has been a protracted period of upside.""'Why are you scaling out?' Well, markets are going up heavily, but we'll be seeing some downwards momentum as well. Nothing goes up in a straight line,"" he wrote.The downturn nonetheless amused some, coming just minutes after actress Lindsay Lohan tweeted a surprise Bitcoin endorsement.""Bitcoin to the moon,"" she suddenly proclaimed.bitcoin to the moonAmong longtime market participants, celebrities and other non-industry figures suddenly engaging with Bitcoin is a ""classic"" signal that the cryptocurrency has gone mainstream too quickly and that a correction is imminent.""Tops in, time to sell,"" Cointelegraph's Keith Wareing responded just before the 7.6% dip, which buyers quickly halted.As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin's overall strength is apparent, which on the back of Tesla's buy-in and interest in MicroStrategy's dedicated summit last week seems destined to see higher highs thanks to a domino effect of corporate exposure.In a fresh update on the day, quant analyst PlanB reiterated that Bitcoin was still on track to hit $100,000 by September. Progress a year after the most recent block subsidy halving, he said, was in between what happened after the 2012 and 2016 halving events."
392,"A new non-profit aiming to fund Bitcoin development education and research has been approved for special tax status, conferring benefits on donors.Brink, which launched in the fall, has been approved as a 503(c)(3) organization according to a Feb. 10 blog post. The status both exempts Brink from federal taxes and provides some interesting benefits to donors, especially considering their use of Bitcoin. Donations to 503(c)(3) organizations in the U.S. have always been an important tax write-off, but considering the long-term confusion over the IRS seemingly asking for Bitcoin users to pay capital gains taxes on any use of Bitcoin as a payment. In its announcement, Brink says that it offers an alternative:Headed by Bitcoin core developer John Newberry, Brink runs fellowship and educational programs for new devs. Newberry told Cointelegraph that Brink had looked for the designation since its beginning: ""We always planned to be a 501c3, and our corporation bylaws are completely consistent with that designation.""The legal status as a 503(3)(c) non-profit will also open Brink up to new disclosure requirements, which Bitcoin's innate transparency may make simpler.However, the BTC address that Brink advertises on its Twitter feed appears to be unused. Newberry told Cointelegraph that the wallet was for a one-time donation, saying that those interested can now donate in Bitcoin and fiat here. The firm's Bitcoin donation window actually leads to an Open Node API. Open Node offers instant conversion from crypto to fiat, which raises the question: Does Brink not actually hold BTC donations in BTC?The confusion over having to pay capital gains taxes on any payment in Bitcoin had led many to call for a de minimis on the value of those payments before the IRS can come for them. "
393,"It seems to be the season of giving, and Bitcoin is doing just that, at least for its institutional backers, such as MicroStrategy, Galaxy Digital, Square and Marathon Patent Group, which got in somewhat early on the BTC gravy train.In this regard, PayPal revealed on Feb. 4 that its fourth-quarter profits for the year 2020 had increased by 200% as compared to the previous fiscal cycle, citing its two new offerings — i.e., a cryptocurrency tool and a “buy now pay later” feature — as being the primary drivers for its monumental growth.And even though PayPal did not reveal the exact figures as to how much of its growth was spurred by the firm’s foray into Bitcoin (BTC), the fact that the payments giant is looking to offer a new crypto remittance tool to 29 million of its affiliated merchants worldwide in the near future just goes to show the faith the company has in its crypto vision.If that wasn’t enough, company CEO Dan Schulman noted in a recent interview that the aforementioned development was just a “small sign” of things to come and that this is just the “beginning of an extensive road map around crypto, blockchain, and digital currencies” for PayPal.What this seems to suggest is that firms from the traditional finance space that are actively investing in crypto have been exhibiting monetary trends that are significantly different from their contemporaries. In this vein, even Tesla’s stock market perception could now change drastically after the company recently made its way into the crypto market by purchasing $1.5 billion worth of BTC.There’s no denying that an increasing number of companies from the realm of traditional finance are making their way into the crypto sector. For example, according to Ross Stevens, CEO of NYDIG, his crypto asset management firm already has enough institutional buy orders lined up to push its Bitcoin holdings over $25 billion by the end of 2021.In light of such data, Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and CEO of quantitative crypto trading firm Alameda Research, which currently has $2.5 billion worth of assets under management, told Cointelegraph that the link between company stocks rising in line with the company’s BTC acquisition moves is very real, adding:Similarly, Justin Barlow, research analyst for The Tie — a provider of social media data for digital assets — also believes that this ongoing surge in equities of certain firms is strongly related to their BTC acquisition strategies:“For evidence, all you need to do is look at the market cap of the companies before and after a BTC announcement,” he added, pointing to examples of MicroStrategy, Square (NYSE:SQ), and Marathon Patent Group (NASDAQ:MARA), which are all up well over 50% since their respective announcements.He further opined that it’s safe to assume that an increasing number of companies will look to capitalize on this ongoing trend, especially as possessing “BTC reserves” is becoming more common among firms and the demand for increased crypto exposure, from retail as well as institutional investors, is also rising at a rapid pace.As everyone would have probably heard by now, it was recently unveiled that car manufacturer Tesla, had invested big in crypto, having acquired $1.5 billion worth of BTC via various monetary avenues, thus sending the currency’s value up by $3,000 within a matter of minutes.Not only that, Tesla — one of the world’s top 10 largest companies by market cap and a member of the S&P 500 — will now also be accepting payments for its products in BTC, potentially sparking an unprecedented wave of corporate and institutional ownership in Bitcoin. On the subject, Sheraz Ahmed, head of business development for the Crypto Valley Association — a blockchain ecosystem backed by the Swiss government — told Cointelegraph:As of Feb. 8, MicroStrategy’s stock value has skyrocketed by +670% since the company made its initial investment into Bitcoin. Not only that, the stock’s correlation with BTC, too, has increased by +300% over the same time frame.In the wake of this unprecedented market movement, the firm has continued to purchase additional Bitcoin, with its most recent acquisition coming on Dec. 21, when the business analytics and mobility provider added an additional 29,646 BTC (estimated to be worth roughly $650 million) to its reserves.A similar trend was also witnessed in relation to Square’s stock value, which, on Oct. 8, 2020, the day the company purchased 4,709 BTC, was at $183.50 only to increase by 30% over the next three months to currently sit at $258. To really put things into perspective, over the same time period, the S&P 500 rose by a meager 4%.On the heels of Tesla’s big crypto announcement, a report by Reuters claims that Apple might also be looking to get on board the crypto bandwagon in the near future, especially since the multinational giant has a “clear opportunity” to offer a buying and selling mechanism for cryptocurrencies to its massive clientele — a move that could propel the company into the heart of the current crypto gold rush.In this regard, Apple already has a Wallet app as well stringent Know Your Customer protocols in place, which, if employed within the context of cryptocurrencies, could make the United States a global leader in crypto assets, even hampering any possibility of a government shutdown of the industry. In regard to the subject, Ahmed said:Also in 2017, a number of startups tried to trick investors by adding the terms crypto and blockchain to their names, suggesting that they were using these technologies actively. However, this time around, there are a number of live examples of firms buying heavily into BTC and Ether (ETH).Lastly, it stands to reason that with the continued rise of the cryptocurrency industry, a number of companies are now able to show that their diversified treasury tactics are paying off, thus, in turn, forcing other companies to follow in their footsteps. “Just recently, an early adopter of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy, welcomed 6,917 enterprises on their corporation’s program — showing the significant interest in this space,” Ahmed pointed out.Since the start of February, Bitcoin has gained an immense amount of traction, surging by a whopping 20%. This has once again rekindled hopes of the premium asset surging past the $100,000 barrier as many experts had previously suggested. That being said, one thing that history teaches us is that such rapid increases in the value of BTC may likely be followed by one or more heavy corrections.Thus, on the subject of whether this current upward momentum will be able to spur BTC’s value to twice its current value, Cointelegraph reached out to CryptoYoda, an independent cryptocurrency analyst, who opined that the market is still not ready to rise because “supply outweighs demand,” adding:Also, with crypto being the extremely volatile market that it is, it would be unsurprising to see a heavy correction in the coming few days, especially since the market has been on a tear, with gains across the board.This could potentially result in the stock prices of companies that have invested big in crypto being affected adversely since volatility fears may once again grip investors, causing large sell-offs. That being said, big companies buying into crypto is still a new occurrence, so it’s difficult to predict how the stocks will behave when a BTC correction happens."
394,"Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnnenshein says institutional demand for Bitcoin (BTC) has only increased, moving into 2021, following a record-breaking year that saw Grayscale’s assets under management soar to new heights.Sonnenshein told CNBC’s Squawk Box on Feb. 10 that the record inflows witnessed last year have continued, and interpreted this as a sign that Bitcoin’s current upsurge could continue.Contrary to narratives emanating from government entities, Sonnenshein says regulation is not a concern for would-be investors, many of whom, he claimed, are satisfied that enough regulatory clarity has been provided.Sonnenshein said, “Conversation point number one starts around regulatory concerns, and actually, a lot of those conversations are characterized by a lack of regulatory concerns. A lot of the folks making decisions around this realize how much regulatory clarity has been provided around this.”In the same week that Tesla invested $1.5 billion into Bitcoin, Sonnenshein says most institutional investors are happy to edge into Bitcoin over time, rather than throwing all their eggs into one basket.“I think the second piece of the conversation is around sizing and timing. So you’re seeing corporations think about anywhere from, on the low end, 25 basis points, to, on the higher end, maybe 100 or 200 basis points over time. And they recognize that they don’t need to get invested all at once.”For context, Tesla recently invested roughly 770 basis points, or 7.7% of its gross cash holdings, into Bitcoin. Sonnenshein said the investment strategy taken by MicroStrategy might be more typical of future buyers. MicroStrategy bought $1 billion worth of Bitcoin across the span of 2020.“They’ve seen other corporations like MicroStrategy legging into this trade over time, and they ultimately believe in the growth of this. So buying Bitcoin whether it’s here, ten percent higher, or ten percent lower, ultimately, is not going to matter if they think Bitcoin is going to have the type of growth they think it is going to have over time,” he stated.According to Sonnenshein, the question surrounding Bitcoin is changing from “why?” to “why not?,” as the leaders of major tech companies like Tesla and Twitter flood into the cryptocurrency market. Sonnenshein thinks more “visionaries” will follow the likes of Elon Musk in buying Bitcoin. He said:The signals all look good for 2021, according to Sonnenshein, who says institutional inflows have already gained momentum since the start of the new year.“If flows are any indication of investor interest on the heels of a record-breaking 2020, I’m very pleased to say, and encouraged that that momentum is not only continuing this year, but is actually accelerating. So we’re seeing very very sustained and growing demand from a lot of institutional players at the moment,” he concluded."
395,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to above $48,000 on Feb. 9, and has been consolidating since. Analysts from Material Indicators found that whales were the primary driver of the rally.This is largely considered a bullish sign. The probability of a Bitcoin top would increase when retail investors enter into the market en masse, as both the spot and derivatives markets get overheated.In recent months, so-called “mega whales” sold large amounts of Bitcoin between $33,000 and $40,000.Orders ranging from $1 million to $10 million rose significantly across major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance.But as the price of Bitcoin began to consolidate above $33,000 after the correction from $40,000, the buyer demand from whales surged once again.Analysts at “Material Scientist” said that whales have been showing unusually large volume, around $150 million in 24 hours.This metric shows that whales are consistently accumulating Bitcoin in the aftermath of the news that Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of BTC. They said:Analysts say that the frenzy around public companies owning Bitcoin creates a positive market sentiment around the dominant cryptocurrency.Filbfilb, a pseudonymous Bitcoin trader, said that in the current economic environment, shareholders would likely demand pubic companies to secure exposure after Tesla derisked holding Bitcoin. Additionally, Raoul Pal, the CEO of Real Vision Group, also emphasized that Bitcoin is still early in its rally.In terms of mainstream awareness, there is still generally a low level of awareness of Bitcoin among casual investors. In 2017, many retail investors were rushing to purchase Bitcoin. Pal explained:"
396,"Cryptocurrency markets have hit a significant milestone shortly after Elon Musk’s Tesla officially announced their investment in Bitcoin (BTC).For the first time in history, the crypto market has surpassed Alphabet’s GOOG and GOOGL in terms of market capitalization.On Feb. 10, the total crypto market cap hit $1.413 trillion, overtaking the market cap levels of Google class-A and class-C shares. At the time of writing, the market capitalizations of GOOGL and GOOG amount to $1.39 trillion and $1.404 trillion, respectively.Crypto market capitalization has been gaining momentum amid an ongoing crypto rally this year, breaking the $1 trillion mark in early January.Total crypto market cap previously surpassed the market cap level of Tesla, which amounts to around $815 billion at the time of writing. Soon after crypto markets broke Tesla’s market cap, the company made a massive announcement on Feb. 8, reporting a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin to the United States’ Securities and Exchange Commission.Crypto's recent pump now puts the market behind Amazon, Microsoft and Apple in terms of market cap. Ahead of the record-breaking crypto market cap, Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) hit new all-time highs of above $48,000 and $1,800, respectively.Following Tesla’s official move into Bitcoin investment, some in the industry speculated that Apple could be the next institutional player to adopt the crypto asset."
397,"Bitcoin (BTC) will never be the same and it's too late to use Tether (USDT) as an excuse to be bearish, Cointelegraph Markets analyst filbfilb says.In a series of tweets on Feb. 10, the popular analyst and co-founder of trading suite Decentrader said that the cat was out of the bag for Bitcoin going mainstream.Bitcoin's mainstream presence has exploded since Tesla purchased $1.5 billion of BTC, but not everyone is convinced. Within crypto circles, some still point to stablecoin Tether's emission and backing as reasons to be bearish.As Cointelegraph reported, rumors continue to circulate about the financial buoyancy of Tether's issuer, despite multiple backlashes and USDT supply increasing at unprecedented rates.""The game has changed"", filbfilb summarized, noting that daily printing alone had reached $1 billion.As such, short-term price targets are not only $50,000, but as high as $63,000 including some consolidatory moves along the way.""IMO the target from the consolidation is c. 52k where I'm expecting a bit of a correction but the measured move overall should take us towards. 63ish,"" he added in a post to subscribers of his Telegram trading channel.""Aggressive"" sellers have already been outmaneuvered by demand, he noted.On the topic of corporate adoption, he added that there are implications that few have considered, further making the bearish take on Bitcoin redundant. Consumers are already indirectly in on Bitcoin, and the performance of stocks from firms which have already made allocations will fuel the fire.""I really dont think people understand that S&P500 companies owning Bitcoin means that by default people's pensions are exposed to Bitcoin. The % of people invested in Bitcoin has already reached the masses, they just dont even know it,"" he wrote.The view directly rebuffs cautious words from JPMorgan analysts this week, who claimed that few companies will follow Tesla and MicroStrategy on Bitcoin due to its volatility. Speaking to CNN, however, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor himself took volatility bears to task.""If you're looking out for the long-term interest of your shareholders, I think they'd prefer if you double their money every six months than lose 75% of their money with a guarantee over the next eight years,"" he told the network."

The new venture will give Southampton fans the chance to take in the matchday experience during the COVID-19 lockdown via virtual reality headsets, while influencers will reportedly be granted sums of Bitcoin (BTC) to create unique VR experiences.Sportsbet.io became the main club partner of Southampton FC at the beginning of the 2020–2021 season, and the United Kingdom-based betting site now aims to utilize its matchday rights in the virtual realm. Sportsbet.io also signed a three-year partnership with Arsenal at the start of the season, becoming the club’s official betting partner in the process.The betting site has at various times accepted deposits in the form of Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), XRP, Tron TRX), Tether (USDT), and more.Tim Heath, founder of Coingaming Group, which operates Sportsbet, said he foresaw a growing relationship emerging between football and cryptocurrency. “We think cryptocurrency has a big future in football and we’re right behind it. Alongside fan experiences like this, we’ve just seen the first Bitcoin transfer take place where a footballer was purchased using cryptocurrency and signed for DUX Internacional de Madrid, and earlier this year NFL pro footballer Russell Okung said he’s getting his salary in Bitcoin,” said Heath, adding, “We’re likely to see more of the same — from clubs finding new ways to engage with fans on a match day to the way business is done at the top of the game.”The connection between cryptocurrency and football blossomed in the past few years. Sportsbet has also formed sponsorship deals with Championship team Watford FC, as well as major Brazilian team side Flamengo.The year 2020 also saw footballers launch their own cryptocurrency tokens, while more major clubs got involved with blockchain or crypto in some way. These include German footballing giants Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, in addition to the historic Italian club S.S Lazio, and Spanish titans FC Barcelona.David Thomas, chief commercial officer at Southampton FC, said the club was excited to be part of an ongoing process that could shake up the status quo. “As a club our digital approach has always looked to redefine the content status-quo and we were excited at the shared values between ourselves and the Sportsbet.io team,"" he said."
399,"The Monero community has posted a proposal to add XMR as a payment option on the Tesla website.Shortly after Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors hinted that they may start accepting Bitcoin (BTC) payments its electric cars, the Monero community suggested that XMR could also be a good payment option.After posting a CCS proposal on Feb. 9, the Monero community has raised 890 XMR ($155,000) in a move to add Monero as a payment option for a new Tesla alongside Bitcoin. As part of the proposal, the community will strive to get Musk’s attention during a 21-day period starting on Feb. 9. Should Tesla accept the initiative, the Monero community will select three charities to receive brand-new Teslas. The community promised to refund the contributors in case there is no response or engagement from Musk within the twenty-one days of a fully funded proposal.The effort was supported by a total of just 11 contributors, according to the Monero website.According to the proposal, Tesla fans could benefit from the XMR payment option due to its unique privacy features compared to public and traceable blockchains like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH). The community suggested that some Tesla owners would be comfortable with making their expensive vehicle holdings more private.“You wouldn’t want your server at a restaurant to know the entire balance in your wallet when you pay would you? Why should your purchase of a car broadcast to the world all of the information that is leaked in a Bitcoin transaction,” the proposal reads. ""Plus, the effect of showing up to a party in a brand new Tesla is diminished somewhat if all your friends already knew the moment you bought it because they were able to see the transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain,"" the proposal stated.The proposal comes amid some existing controversy around Monero’s privacy features and the ability to track XMR transactions. In November 2020, CipherTrace filed two patents for technology that was supposed to be cable of track Monero transactions. The Monero community previously criticized and questioned CipherTrace’s ability to trace XMR."
400,"Russia has reportedly imported thousands of cryptocurrency mining devices amid a massive surge in the crypto market.A senior executive at BitRiver, the largest crypto mining colocation services provider in Russia, claimed that a local client received over 20,000 crypto mining devices, Russian news agency Kommersant reports Feb. 10.BitRiver founder and CEO Igor Runets said that the total mining power of the imported hardware amounts to 70 MWh, which is reportedly estimated to make up the largest single batch of crypto mining hardware in Russia. Runets said that the hardware was delivered in December 2020 and was immediately set up for Bitcoin (BTC) mining in Bratsk — a city in Russia that has one of the country’s largest hydropower stations.Runets noted that the mining rigs were imported from Asia. A spokesperson from BitRiver told Cointelegraph that the company cannot disclose either the name of the Russian client or the exact country that exported the hardware. The representative added that the mining data center was established at one of BitRiver’s locations.BitRiver did not disclose the exact type of crypto miners imported. According to Kommersant, the imported batch was priced between $40 million and $60 million.Despite Russia adopting its crypto law “On Digital Financial Assets” in January 2021, there is a certain level of uncertainty about crypto mining in the country as the law does not provide a clear regulatory framework for the industry. In September 2020, local authorities even proposed to prohibit Russian crypto miners from receiving payment for mining crypto."

402,"The exponential rise in Bitcoin’s price and hash rate is driving critics to once again question the largest blockchain’s energy efficiency — with calls for “green hackers” to band together to mount an attack on the network.A self styled “developer and ecologist” who goes by the name of Franck Leroy created Twitter and Medium accounts this month to advocate the destruction of the Bitcoin network through “ethical hacking.”In a post titled “Green hackers around the world, let’s destroy Bitcoin” Leroy states that Bitcoin is an “irrational and destructive financial bubble” that is hugely damaging to the climate due to its exorbitant use of electricity.A third of the article calls on hackers to “destroy Bitcoin,” stating that the network can be undermined by mounting something similar to a DDOS attack with fake transactions to clog the network, and linking to three other sources for other attack ideas, adding:But it’s not just fringe Medium posts attacking Bitcoin’s power consumption, the mainstream media has embraced the narrative too. A recent article by Bloomberg “Bitcoin is an incredibly dirty business” suggested that the majority of Bitcoin’s energy use comes from coal and other non-renewable sources, comparing the network’s carbon footprint to that of New Zealand.And Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Zweig wrote today that “Bitcoin mining is on track to consume almost as much electricity in 2021 as all the world’s transportation systems combined did in 2018.”https://t.co/Y1UKW4JbH9

If I understand this correctly, bitcoin mining is on track to consume almost as much electricity in 2021 as all the world's transportation systems combined did in 2018 https://t.co/z7rWPzwSOM.

Tesla will need to sell a lot of cars to offset that. pic.twitter.com/wmIuioZCqjLooking behind the figures used by Zweig paints a different picture. In the Tweet, he references a graph on Bitcoin’s electricity consumption by the University of Cambridge. The three lines refer to the upper (grey) and lower bound (light yellow), and the actual estimated consumption (Yellow).Zweig has used the upper bound currently sitting at 290 TWh, stating that this figure is on track to reach the 2018 global transportation systems consumption (390 TWh). However, if one were to take the actual estimate of 120 TWh, the Bitcoin network is on track to account for around 30% of the energy used by the transportation industry in 2018.Many critics refer the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, or BECI, on the Digiconomist website. The BECI states that Bitcoin’s annualized carbon footprint, electrical energy consumption, and electronic waste compares to that of New Zealand, Chile, and Luxembourg respectively.However, Bitcoin proponents such as Marty Bent point out that much of the electricity used to power the Bitcoin network is excess and otherwise unused . In a post today he wrote:Other proponents note the power used in mining is frequently renewable. Up to half of mining activity occurs in China’s Sichuan region and these miners use the region’s hydroelectric power stations where possible. However, these plants rely on seasonal rains and when there isn’t enough to power them, Sichuan turns to coal.A study shared by Head of Growth at Kraken Dan Held, suggests that mining in the Sichuan region is more than 90% renewable, resulting in Bitcoin’s entire network being almost 78% renewable.But figures vary and the University of Cambridge suggests the actual figure is much lower. Although the university states that 76% of cryptocurrency miners use electricity from renewable energy sources, it found that only 39% of the total energy consumption by Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies comes from renewable energy."
403,"The administrator of dark.fail, a website providing verified links to darknet markets, claims that exchanges are unfairly closing accounts donating Bitcoin to the service after implementing a Chainalysis transaction flagging system.The admin alleged in a tweet that two donors of Bitcoin to the website had their accounts blocked by exchanges that recently implemented Chainalysis’ new KYT — or Know Your Transaction — blockchain monitoring service.WARNING: Two of my donors report that their exchanges blocked their accounts after they donated Bitcoin to me. I am a journalist! I do not commit crimes.

Last year I voiced strong opposition to blockchain analysis. My donation address was flagged in return. This is pure evil. https://t.co/EzZK7sa5LgThe admin believes there is a connection between the account closures and its staunch and vocal criticism of Chainalysis, however the accounts may simply have been flagged automatically due to links to the darknet. While the site can be viewed as a gateway to the darknet, dark.fail's Twitter bio classifies the account as an: ""Anonymous journalist researching Tor: the uncensored internet.""Dark.fail is a long standing critic of Chainalysis KYT flagging accounts as suspicious with no avenue for appeal. In Jan. 2020, the admin accused the blockchain analytics company of enabling the “theft” of customer funds that had been marked as suspicious by hidden KYT processes.Privacy is a human right, violated constantly by opaque companies like Chainalysis. Can an individual check a Bitcoin address' ""cleanliness"" according to their data? Nope, their blockchain surveillance is for governments and corporations only. Use privacy coins for fungibility.One of dark.fail’s BTC donation addresses, listed on the website home page recently as Dec. 2, 2020, contains nearly 40 transactions. The BTC donation option has since been removed from the website, which now only accepts contributions in the form of privacy coin Monero.Just in case your donation to a journalist is not something you want publicly visible in a blockchain: we have removed Bitcoin as a donation option.https://t.co/SKNIXlRoex is now Monero-only to protect our donors from blockchain misinterpretation/pseudo-analysis.Chainalysis describes KYT as “an automated, real-time cryptocurrency transaction monitoring and compliance solution” which is used to detect patterns indicating “risky activity.” It is currently used by over 150 companies in 40 different countries. Chainalysis has also assisted government-led investigations in the past, helping to break up a notorious ransomware network last month.While dark.fail’s status as an ""anonymous journalist"" is debatable, the report comes amid an atmosphere where journalist practices can be labeled as criminal activities. On Monday, a letter signed by the ACLU and other civil right defense groups called for the U.S. Department of Justice to drop charges against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, likening his indictment to “a grave threat to press freedom.”In May 2019, one of the oldest websites about darknet related subjects, DeepDotWeb, was seized by law enforcement after its administrators were arrested on money laundering conspiracy charges. The two admins are suspected of taking millions in cryptocurrency kickbacks from darknet markets listed on their website.According to stats provided by alexa.com, dark.fail is one of the most popular darknet market link providers on the internet, ranked #52,345 globally in terms of website traffic.Cointelegraph has contacted Chainalysis for comment and will update this story with their response."
404,"Growing institutional interest in Bitcoin (BTC) helped elevate the top cryptocurrency to a new record high on Feb. 9 and led to a total market cap value higher than the market cap of the Russian ruble. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows Bitcoin established a new all-time high of $48,220 in the early hours on Tuesday and has since pulled back to $47,092, marking a 9.24% increase over the past 24-hours.According to Decentrader founder, filbfilb, today’s market action showed strong activity from the bulls who aggressively “absorbed sellers” positions, resulting in the “failed breakdown of a low timeframe head and shoulders pattern"".Filbfilb views the current price action as a positive development for the future of BTC which looks to break out higher before establishing a new consolidation zone.In his Decentrader Telegram channel filbfilb said:Altcoins pushed higher as Bitcoin price consolidated in preparation for what could be a move toward $50,000.Following the launch of CME Ether futures contracts, Ether (ETH) price surged to a new high at $1,825. Data from CoinMetrics suggests that the CME launch could lead to accelerated inflows into the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE).Meanwhile, Litecoin futures have also seen a surge in activity with a record $584 million in open interest, indicating that the altcoin is attracting the attention of institutional investors.Elrond (EGLD) also set a new price and trading volume record as it increased 700% since the start of 2021 driven by the release of the Maiar wallet and plans to integrate with decentralized finance protocols.Interoperability between blockchains continues to be a prominent focus in the cryptocurrency sector and this boosted the price of Polkadot (DOT) to a new high at $24.04.DOT’s breakout to a new high followed the announcement that Curve Finance would be implemented on Equilibrium’s Polkadot parachain.CRV also saw its price spike to a 2021 high at $3.56 on Feb. 5 as news of the upcoming cross-chain functionality brought a fresh wave of optimism to the project.Binance Coin (BNB) hit a new all-time high as its growing DeFi infrastructure and expansion of token functionalities on Binance Smart Chain further strengthen BNB’s fundamentals. At the time of writing, BNB is up 44.09% and trading for $106.66.Other notable performers in the past 24-hours include a 52.22% rally from Filecoin (FIL) and a 20.23% move from EOS.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.4 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 62.9%."

406,"IDEO, an American design and innovation consultancy firm, has filed for a new cryptocurrency fund through its blockchain-oriented venture capital subsidiary.IDEO CoLab Ventures, an early stage investment fund focused on blockchain development, has applied Tuesday for a new crypto fund with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.Called “IDEO CoLab Crypto Fund II LP,” the new fund has a total offering amount of $100 million. The application was filed by IDEO CoLab managing director Joe Gerber.The SEC filing follows IDEO CoLab's  announcement of a $21 million early-stage crypto fund from in October 2020. The new fund is backed by executives from major cryptocurrency players like Coinbase as well as companies like Twitter, Fortress, and IDEO itself. Other backers include major investors like Avanta Ventures, GS Group, Hanwha Asset Management, Fineqia, and others.As previously announced, IDEO CoLab helped incubate over 30 crypto startups since making their first investment in 2018. Some of IDEO’s industry investments reportedly include digital asset trading platform FalconX and Handshake, a decentralized naming and certificate authority.Taehong Huh, Managing Partner at GS Group’s GS Futures, said that IDEO Colab is perfectly positioned to lead the movement supporting industry collaboration between between investors, entrepreneurs, designers, policymakers, and corporations.“We believe that the disruptive nature of blockchain technology is still underappreciated by the public, including corporations like ourselves, as it has not yet been translated into broadly desirable products or experiences,” he said."
407,"Corporate treasury commentators are criticizing Tesla's $1.5 billion Bitcoin splurge, echoing the well-worn rhetoric of BTC’s volatility.Speaking to Financial Times, Jerry Klein, managing director at New York-based investment management firm Treasury Partners said that there was no use case for plowing corporate cash into Bitcoin.Another critic quoted by FT, Campbell Harvey of Duke University in Durham North Carolina, called Tesla’s Bitcoin acquisition “unusual” and “risky” adding that it will not serve as a hedge against market uncertainties.Critics of Tesla’s Bitcoin purchase say the move potentially puts shareholders at risk given the volatility of Bitcoin. Some point to historical crashes like the 2018 bear market and the 50% dump that occurred on Black Thursday in March 2020.However, these arguments seem to leave out Bitcoin’s established “no look-back price trajectory” wherein each crash does not revert to a price level before the previous all-time high.Also, Bitcoin’s parabolic bounce from its lows does not appear in these anti-BTC arguments. For instance, the Black Thursday crash of 2020 was followed by an almost eight-fold increase by the end of the year.Since August 2020, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy has been acquiring Bitcoin and has spent about $1.1 billion in buying 71,079BTC. At the current price, the company’s Bitcoin stash is valued at almost $3.3 billion — a 200% gain on its investments.Bitcoin was the best performing asset of the last decade, gaining almost 9,000,000% and far outstripping all other asset classes. Indeed, as of the time of writing, only Bitcoin bought above the $47,000 price level is currently at a loss.Speaking to CNBC, MicroStrategy CEO and Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor countered the volatility rhetoric, saying holding cash reserves amounted to a stable loss of 75% of their shareholder value over the last decade whereas investing in BTC offered a volatile appreciation that doubled every six months. According to Saylor:The billions of dollars in economic stimulus packages by major economies are also expected to exert further downward pressure on fiat currencies.Apart from the backlash over Tesla’s Bitcoin investment, these corporate treasury critics also said that other companies will not be lining up to follow Tesla’s lead.However, Tesla is only the latest in an expanding cast of public companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, 1,400 firms signed up for MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-buying bootcamp.Indeed, Apple bull RBC Capital Markets recently clamored for the iPhone maker to follow Tesla’s example in buying Bitcoin. RBC even called on Apple to go a step further by creating a Bitcoin exchange.The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently up almost 60% year-to-date."
408,"Authorities in South Africa appear to be paying closer attention to the cryptocurrency space in 2021 in the wake of a major Bitcoin (BTC) Ponzi scheme and increased trading activity. As a result, the South African Financial Sector Conduct Authority has called for tighter controls of the crypto space following the collapse of what has been described as the biggest Ponzi scheme the country has ever seen.In December 2020, Mirror Trading International went into provisional liquidation after one of its directors allegedly skipped the country, taking with him access to a copious amount of Bitcoin that investors had entrusted to the company over the past few years. In January 2021, MTI claimed to have over 260,000 members around the world and had amassed 23,000 BTC of investor’s holdings, which is worth over $1 billion in today’s market.The South African arm of the business purported to conduct high-frequency derivatives trades using bots, but investors were left empty-handed at the end of 2020 when CEO Johan Steynberg fled the country. The firm’s other directors claim that Steynberg was the only one with direct control of MTI’s entire Bitcoin holdings and believe the CEO has fled to Brazil.The FSCA warned investors in South Africa against investing in MTI in August last year after ascertaining that the company had been operating without a financial service provider license. The regulator was also concerned that the firm was touting unusually high returns on investments to clients. This had followed a move by regulators in Texas, United States to shut down promoters of MTI in July last year.While the collapse of MTI has led to calls for clear regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrency use in the country, favorable cryptocurrency markets have also helped to drive trading in the country, which, as a result, has attracted greater interest from the South African tax authority.At the beginning of February 2021, the FSCA sent out a letter to the public indicating that it has received a number of complaints from South African investors that have been left out of pocket in an unnamed “crypto-related investment” or a “scam packaged as a crypto investment” promising high returns, which is understood to be MTI.The regulator noted in the letter that cryptocurrency-related investments are not regulated by the FSCA or any other authority in South Africa, which leaves the risk of investors having no recourse should a worst-case scenario happen.Brandon Topham, the divisional executive of enforcement at the FSCA in South Africa, discussed with Cointelegraph how the FSCA is involved in the MTI investigation. The FSCA is now dealing directly with the liquidators of MTI and has also shared the details of all of MTI investors to the South African Revenue Service. Topham told Cointelegraph that the use of cryptocurrencies was key for MTI the perpetrators to be able to dupe investors:Topham added that the situation was not a reflection of a lack of understanding of cryptocurrencies by South African investors but that people were “desperate and/or greedy” and continued to invest in MTI after the FSCA’s warning against doing so midway through 2020.The MTI debacle has cast a spotlight on regulation in the country. Topham told Cointelegraph that at present, there is still no regulation in the space, however, the FSCA began the process of declaring cryptocurrencies as financial products in November 2020, which was open for public comment up until the end of January 2020. According to him:Topham conceded that even registered financial service providers “sometimes go rogue” but insists that the framework would be a first step in protecting the public from abuse in the area. He further added that it’s difficult to regulate something “which has no address, no business and no management in general.” This, according to him, is exactly the reason why the regulators strongly advise investors to stay away from cryptocurrencies.While the MTI issue has renewed the perception that cryptocurrencies are often associated with scams or fraud for people unfamiliar with the space, the use and trade of cryptocurrencies in South Africa is in a healthy place.The recent boom in value across the cryptocurrencies markets brings with it a windfall for many traders and crypto holders. With plenty of profit to be made, there are also tax implications to be considered, and recent local reports indicate that the South African Revenue Service is honing in on the space.Local firm Tax Consulting South Africa noted that a number of its clients had received audit requests from SARS, with a specific query on their use of cryptocurrencies. The company said that users were asked to disclose the purpose for which the taxpayers had bought cryptocurrency, as well as a letter from cryptocurrency exchanges confirming the users’ investments and trading history and bank statements. The firm added that taxpayers should expect this query from SARS if they had previously disclosed crypto-related income or investments in their tax returns.Marius Reitz, general manager for a local cryptocurrency exchange Luno, told Cointelegraph that it was not privy to SARS’ strategy in relation to cryptocurrency traders but said that any sort of clampdown could include all types of trading profits or losses.Reitz also stated that neither SARS nor SARB has indicated that it will ask exchanges to submit any trading information of customers. As it stands, it’s up to South African taxpayers to provide tax information to SARS.While cryptocurrency users in South Africa can rest easy knowing that exchanges are not being pressured into giving up information on traders, Reitz did indicate that Luno will share customer data with law enforcement or other authorities to comply with valid requests from the relevant authority.Topham said that they actively work and support SARS’ efforts to enforce tax laws in the country and that cryptocurrency users should be well aware of the tax implications of trading, holding or transacting digital assets:Looking through the lens of the exchange, Reitz believes that the South African crypto landscape is fertile, having marked an influx of users on its platform over the past year and has seen over 6 million users sign up to its exchange services in different jurisdictions around the world.Luno has also played a role in shaping regulatory considerations in South Africa, having worked with the Intergovernmental Fintech Working Group, which is shaping regulation for the space. Reitz believes that regulation will provide clarity and protection to businesses and consumers, while the MTI affair, unfortunately, involves cryptocurrency:Reitz highlighted data from Statista that reports South Africa ranking in the top five countries for high rates of cryptocurrency ownership as another metric showing the growth of usage in the country.Meanwhile, Topham told Cointelegraph that the FSCA still believes that cryptocurrencies are not a credible long-term store of wealth and described investing in the space as high risk, as their value is driven by sentiment alone and is fuelled by anti-government thinking:"
409,"Bitcoin (BTC) has extended its rally over $46,000 on Feb. 9, a day after a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing revealed that Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of BTC. The price of Bitcoin immediately soared from around $39,000 to $45,000 across major exchanges on Feb. 8 after the news began to spread.As the Bitcoin price initially rallied to $45,000, it caused $500 million worth of short positions to get liquidated.The term liquidation in the Bitcoin futures market refers to when the price of BTC moves quickly in a short period beyond the liquidation prices of futures contracts.For instance, if a trader borrows 10 times the base capital and trades a $100,000 Bitcoin position with $10,000, the position would get liquidated after a 10% price movement.According to the data from Bybt.com, $1.34 billion worth of futures positions in the futures market were liquidated in the past 24 hours.This indicates two trends; first, the derivatives market was extremely overcrowded with short-sellers. When the Tesla news broke, it caused a massive short squeeze, liquidating hundreds of millions of dollars worth of positions in several hours.Second, it shows that many investors did not anticipate Tesla to actually invest in Bitcoin even after Musk changed his bio to “Bitcoin” on Jan. 29, 2021.Meanwhile, cryptocurrency traders are cautious due to the extremely high funding rates across major futures exchanges.Funding rates increase when the majority of the market are buying or longing Bitcoin. When the funding rates are overly high, the market is vulnerable to a long squeeze, which can cause an intense short-term drop.Nevertheless, a cryptocurrency trader known as “Loma” says that the market is not overconfident just yet. He said that when a point comes where traders are overly confident and do not expect a major drop, that is when a correction is likely to occur. He said:Meanwhile, CryptoQuant CEO, Ki Young Ju, emphasized that there is newfound buyer demand as stablecoin inflows into exchanges were spotted. In the near term, this would likely act as a catalyst for Bitcoin. He wrote:"
410,"Social media activity for Bitcoin is at an all-time high following a massive endorsement from Tesla CEO, Elon Musk.Speaking to Cointelegraph, co-founder and CEO of crypto data provider The TIE, Joshua Frank, noted there have been 143,000 tweets over the last 24 hours from “non-bot accounts.”The new record beats out the previous high of 140,000 from Jan. 3, 2021.On Feb. 8, news that electric vehicle maker Tesla had added Bitcoin to its balance sheet sent prices and market sentiment to record highs. BTC prices hit an all-time high of $47,500 in early Asian trading on Feb. 9.Frank described the surge in social engagement as evidencing bullish sentiment among retail traders:Musk’s tweet appears to have captured crypto-Twitter’s attention away from CME’s highly anticipated launch of Ether futures contracts on Feb. 8, with Frank noting that Ether’s Twitter-volume had slumped by half after recently enjoying sustained record highs:“ETH twitter activity was crushing all-time highs recently but wasn't massive today, down about 50% vs. yesterday,” he said.The run-up to the launch of CME’s Ether futures captured the imaginations of both institutional and retail traders alike, with ETH products representing 80% of last week’s institutional crypto inflows.Both Ethereum and Bitcoin’s prices are currently cooling after posting new record highs earlier today. As of this writing, the combined crypto market capitalization is sitting at $1.4 trillion."
411,"With Bitcoin rallying from $30,000 to $42,000 and back again during January, BTC’s annualized volatility rose to levels last seen in April 2020, according to a new report from U.S. crypto exchange Kraken.January was a roller-coaster ride for Bitcoin, with BTC rallying 46% to a new high of $41,989 before retracing 32% to below $29,000. This resulted in the annualized volatility spiking to over 100% — which was last seen 10 months ago during the infamous ‘Black Thursday’ price plummet.In early-March 2020, Bitcoin’s price dove more than 40% in a matter of days from $9,000 to $5,200 — resulting in volatility spiking from 60% to more than 150%.Despite its surging volatility, Bitcoin registered the smallest volatility spike of the top five crypto assets by market cap (excluding Tether).Polkadot (DOT) finished the month with the largest volatility of 228%, followed by Cardano (ADA) with 183%, and Ethereum (ETH) with 160%. Unlike Bitcoin, ETH, DOT, and ADA evaded heavy corrections during January, closing out the month near their respective local highs.Looking forward, Kraken anticipates that Bitcoin’s price will trend upwards with reduced volatility during February:However, not everyone is convinced Bitcoin will continue its road to higher peaks. Famed gold-bug and notorious Bitcoin-skeptic, Peter Schiff, speculated BTC’s bullish momentum is unlikely to last, predicting it will be superseded by the surging meme-coin DOGE:Being the first mover gave Bitcoin a head start, but it doesn't guarantee that it wins the race. #Bitcoin = Myspace, #Dogecoin = Facebook, _______ = Instagram, ______ = ______. Nothing will ever equal #gold!"
412,"On Feb. 8 Bitcoin (BTC) price broke out to a new all-time high at $46,794 after documents from Tesla revealed that the company had allocated 7.7% of its gross cash position to BTC. The purchase gives Tesla a sizable $1.5 billion position in the top-ranked digital asset. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows Bitcoin is currently up by 18.5% and trading near $46,000. Meanwhile, the majority of altcoins and DeFi tokens have also surged to notch double-digit gains for the day.While some analysts are speculating on which large company will be the next to jump on the Bitcoin train, Royal Bank of Canada Dominion Securities analyst Paul Steves thinks that Apple will be the next institutional player to join the trend.According to Steves, if Apple were to launch a crypto exchange or buy Bitcoin, it could lead to an estimated $40 billion in annual revenue.Bitcoin’s bullish price action came at a crucial time as the digital asset had seen a decline in overall sentiment in recent days as the price struggled to break above the $38,000 level.Dogecoin (DOGE) also broke out as bulls pushed the popular meme coin to a new all-time high at $0.0839. This move came shortly after Mark Cuban gave a nod of approval by calling the altcoin the “best entertainment bang for your buck available” in the crypto market.When a Forbes reporter asks me about #dogecoin and whether it’s a bad look for crypto when people are buying it pic.twitter.com/YGs27VdsxoCardano (ADA) price rose to a new mulit-year high at $0.72, an increase of 100% since Feb. 1, after the successful testnet implementation of smart contracts and the potential of future DeFi integration boosted investors’ outlook for the project.Investor optimism involving the possibility of a new round of stimulus from the U.S. government, including direct payments of $1,400 and a tax credit of $3,000 per child, helped bolster the traditional markets on Monday.The S&P 500, Dow and NASDAQ all established new record highs, closing the day up 0.74%, 0.76% and 0.94% respectively. The past six trading days have marked the longest winning streak for the S&P 500 since August 2020, and the Dow has experienced its best start to February since 1931, rising 4.7% so far this month.Altcoins also benefited from BTC bullish momentum and many rallied by double-digits and standouts like Terra (LUNA) and BitTorrent gained in excess of 100%.Polkadot (DOT) rallied 20.23% to a new high at $23.27, while Elrond (EGLD) gained 40.7% in the last 24-hours to establish a new all-time high at $191.73. Theta (THETA) also rallied 25.55% to set a new high at $2.86.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.32 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 62.9%."
413,"Today Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied to a new all-time high at $44,900 shortly after Tesla announced a $1.5 billion investment. This event triggered $555 million worth of shorts to be liquidated in two hours and it happened as Bitcoin futures open interest reached $13.7 billion, which is just 3% below its historical high.These price moves drastically increased the cost of carrying long positions, mainly for those using perpetual futures. This indicator raised a yellow flag on how leveraged those investors are and their potential price impact.As shown adove, the aggregate BTC futures open interest just reached a $15 billion all-time high.Whenever unexpected positive news hits the market, it is natural for players to enter extreme leverage positions. This happens both for the short sellers, whose margins diminish due to losses, and the long buyers who tend to increase their positions.Shorts with insufficient margin get liquidated as their positions are forcefully terminated and their leveraged decreases. On the other hand, the longs are profiting, thus increasing the position doesn't increase their leverage as much.After the initial pump it’s expected that the funding rate increases and the fees paid by longs to keep their perpetual futures (inverse swaps) open rises.As depicted above, the 8 hour fee charged to compensate for the eventual leverage imbalance between longs and shorts has just touched 0.25%. This rate is equivalent to 5.4% per week, which is quite significant for its holders.One should note that even if Bitcoin continues to appreciate, as seen on Jan. 29, the funding rate tends to adjust itself. Two main reasons fueled this: leveraged buyers depositing more funds and arbitrage desks shorting the perpetual futures while simultaneously buying spot BTC.A funding rate varying from 0.05% to 0.10% per 8 hours is standard and expected during a bull market. This indicator would signify a 4.6% to 9.4% monthly fee and wouldn't be problematic to leveraged longs.To understand how whales and arbitrage desks may have positioned themselves during this period, taking a closer look at the top traders' long-to-short ratio at major exchanges is useful.Binance top traders held a 33% net long position favoring longs ahead of the Feb. 8 rally, and this is slightly above their 26% 2-week average. As soon as the Tesla news hit the press, they increased longs and pushe the indicator to 46% which is its highest level in almost a month.Huobi top traders, on the other hand, remained relatively unaffected by the news. Their net position stood at 0.74, meaning 26% favored shorts ahead of Feb. 8. Their current 28% net short position remains in line with the previous 2-week average.Lastly, OKEx top traders increased their net longs from Feb. 6 to the early hours of Feb. 8, reaching a 14% net long position. Somehow correctly predicting the rally, those traders aggressively reduced net longs as BTC reached its all-time high.The momentary hefty funding rate may be an inconvience for longs but currently there is no sign of excessive leverage from buyers. At least for those large market makers and arbitrage desks that compose most exchanges' top traders.This suggests that there is room for further price appreciation from Bitcoin.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

414,"Bitcoin (BTC) broke out to a new all-time high today, buoyed by the news that Tesla has purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.In addition to the Bitcoin purchase, Tesla also plans to offer its customers the option of buying products with BTC. Instead of converting BTC payments to fiat upon receipt, Tesla may decide to add it to its reserves.In addition to Tesla’s purchase, legendary investor Bill Miller also plans to increase his exposure to Bitcoin by investing over $300 million in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. These purchases by large investors even after Bitcoin’s sharp rally show they expect the up-move to continue further.Mexico’s third-richest person Ricardo Salinas Pliego has added the hashtag Bitcoin to his Twitter bio. This act by Salinas brings Bitcoin to the notice of his 840,000 followers, some of whom may want to emulate the billionaire by buying Bitcoin. Salinas had revealed back in November that 10% of his “liquid portfolio” was invested in Bitcoin.These developments have given a positive boost to the fundamentals in the crypto sector. With a huge tailwind in place, let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to arrive at the possible target levels on the upside.Bitcoin had been stuck between $38,000 and $40,000 for the past two days. The long wick on Feb. 6 candlestick showed traders booked profits at higher levels and the long tail on Feb. 7 candlestick signaled buying on dips.Today, the bulls have propelled the price above the $41,959.63 overhead resistance. This opens the possibility of a rally to the immediate target objective at $50,000 where the bears may again mount a stiff resistance.But if the bulls can drive the price above $50,000, the BTC/USD pair may rally to $60,974.43.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls fail to sustain the breakout, it will indicate that traders are booking profits at higher levels. The bears will then try to pull the price back below $38,000.If they succeed, a retest of the moving averages is likely. A break below the 20-day exponential moving average ($36,196) will be the first sign of weakness and a drop below the 50-day simple moving average ($33,250) will increase the likelihood of a deeper correction.Ether (ETH) turned down from $1,757.338 on Feb. 5 but the bulls aggressively purchased the dip to the breakout level at $1,474.096 on Feb. 7 as seen from the long tail on the day’s candlestick.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside.If the bulls can sustain the price above $1,757.338, the ETH/USD pair could resume its uptrend. The next target on the upside is $1,870 and if this level is crossed, the up-move may reach the psychologically critical level at $2,000.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the current level, the pair could consolidate between $1,757.338 and $1,473.096 for a few more days. A break below $1,473.096 could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($1,148).Cardano (ADA) picked up momentum after breaking above the ascending channel on Feb. 5. The bulls easily pushed the price above the immediate resistance at $0.60 on Feb. 6, which opens the possibility of a rally to $0.80.Although the rising moving averages suggest advantage to the bulls, the RSI in the overbought territory warns of a possible correction or consolidation in the near term.A consolidation will indicate that traders are not booking profits in a hurry and that will enhance the prospects of the resumption of the uptrend.On the other hand, a correction could reach the 20-day EMA ($0.454). A strong rebound off it will suggest that the uptrend remains intact, while a break below it will suggest the momentum has weakened.XRP has been sustaining above $0.3850 for the past few days, but the bulls are struggling to push the price above $0.50. This suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.The bears tried to sink the price below the $0.3855 support on Feb. 7 but failed. This shows the bulls are buying the dips. When bears sell on rallies and bulls buy on dips, the price gets stuck in a range.A break and close above $0.50 could start an up-move that could reach $0.65, while a break below the 20-day EMA ($0.374) could sink the XRP/USD pair to the 50-day SMA ($0.312).The failure of the bears to sink and sustain the price below $19.40 has attracted strong buying from the bulls. This has propelled Polkadot (DOT) to a new all-time high today.The immediate target on the upside is $24.08 and if this level is crossed, the uptrend may extend to $30. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is near the overbought territory, indicating that the bulls are in control.This positive view will invalidate if the DOT/USD pair reverses direction and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($17.91). Such a move could pull the price down to the next support at $14.7259.Binance Coin (BNB) soared above the resistance line of the broadening wedge pattern on Feb. 5, which invalidated the bearish setup. The bears are trying to stall the current uptrend at $75, but the positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground.After a shallow correction on Feb. 7, the bulls are currently attempting to resume the uptrend. A breakout and close above $75.5 could propel the BNB/USD pair to $95 and then to $100.On the contrary, if the price again turns down from $75.5, the bears will try to sink the pair back into the wedge. If they succeed, it will suggest profit booking at higher levels.Litecoin (LTC) had been consolidating between the 20-day EMA ($144.98) and $160 for the past few days. The bulls are currently attempting to resolve this tight trading range to the upside. If they manage a close above $160, the altcoin could rise to $185.5821.If the bulls can propel the price above $185.5821, the LTC/USD pair could resume the uptrend and rally to $200. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the pair could again dip to the 20-day EMA.A breakdown and close below the moving averages will be the first sign of weakness. Such a move could pull the price down to $120.Dogecoin’s pump on Jan. 28 and 29 met with strong selling at $0.0875. Although the altcoin dropped on Jan. 30, the bears could not capitalize on this weakness. Strong buying at lower levels again resumed the up-move on Feb. 4 when the price broke and closed above the psychological barrier at $0.050.The DOGE/USD pair turned down from the $0.0875 overhead resistance on Feb. 7, but the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests that bulls are accumulating on dips. If buyers can drive the price above $0.0875, the momentum could pick up.The next target to watch on the upside is $0.102412 and then $0.13. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from $0.875, the pair may consolidate in a range for a few days before starting the next trending move.The long tail on the Feb. 7 candlestick shows the bulls purchased the dip to the 20-day EMA ($23.15). If buyers can now drive Chainlink (LINK) above the $25.7824 to $27 overhead resistance zone, the uptrend could resume.The first target on the upside is $30 and if the bulls can thrust the price above it, the LINK/USD pair could rally to $33. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest advantage to the bulls.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the bears will once again try to sink the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could slide to $20.1111.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) broke above the $465.02 resistance on Feb. 6 but the bulls could not sustain the breakout. This attracted profit-booking and the altcoin slipped below the 20-day EMA ($439) on Feb. 7.However, the bears could not capitalize on the weakness on Feb. 7 and sink the price below the 50-day SMA ($422). The bulls have currently again pushed the price above $465.02. This increases the likelihood of a rally to $515.Contrary to this assumption, if the BCH/USD pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the 50-day SMA, it will signal weakness.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

415,"Tesla (TSLA) sent shockwaves across the financial markets Monday after a United States Securities and Exchange Commission filing confirmed that the electric vehicle maker has added Bitcoin (BTC) to its balance sheet.Tesla’s latest Form 10-K filing for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2020 shows a $1.5 billion allocation to Bitcoin. As Bitwise researcher David Lawant points out, Tesla’s BItcoin exposure represents roughly 7.7% of its gross cash position.According to the most recent 10K filing, @Tesla had cash & equivalents of $19.4 billion (gross), or $98 billion (net of debt and finance leases).

Using these figures as a reference, $1.5 billion in #Bitcoin represents an allocation of 7.7% on gross cash or 15.1% on net cash. https://t.co/FgRpzRcXBh pic.twitter.com/tDVqJGtj2QHe derives those figures from Tesla’s cash and equivalents, which netted a gross of $19.4 billion by the end of 2020, or $9.8 billion net of debt and finance leases.Tesla’s Bitcoin purchase puts it near the top of the corporate treasuries list. Only one other company – MicroStrategy – has purchased more of the digital asset as part of its strategic reserves. News of Tesla’s participation in the Bitcoin market sent prices soaring on Monday. As Cointelegraph reported, the BTC price hit a high near $45,000, easily surpassing its previous peak. Bitcoin's market cap exceeded $800 billion for the first time. In addition to adding BTC to its balance sheet, Tesla plans to accept the digital asset as a mode of payment. What’s more, the BTC it receives will not be liquidated for cash but added to its balance sheet.Tesla is spearheading Bitcoin adoption at a crucial time in the bull market. Given Elon Musk’s propensity to move markets, Tesla’s newfound Bitcoin exposure could hasten retail adoption in the short term.Bitcoin has also piqued the interest of large corporations. Microstrategy's Bitcoin-buying webinar last week registered over 1,400 signups."
416,"Service outages have been reported at major cryptocurrency exchanges on Feb. 8, following the news that Tesla invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin (BTC).As Cointelegraph reported earlier, news of Tesla's sizeable investment broke after the discovery of a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This caused Bitcoin price to jump $3,000 in a matter of minutes, eventually claiming a newall-time high of $44,850.Problems were reported at a number of exchanges, including Binance, whose CEO CZ tweeted that a traffic influx was causing temporary delays while auto-scaling caught up, and that Tesla CEO Elon Musk was to blame.Massive incoming traffic. Some lags observed in some regions. Auto scaling. Should catch up soon. All because of Elon.Many Kraken users took to Twitter to complain that the site was also down, leading to an incident report being raised on the platform's status page.What a surprise! Theres a spike in volume and @krakenfx is down! Thank god I barely use you anymore, for new comes to crypto world, avoid them at all costs!The reported outages are just the latest in a seemingly never-ending cycle of issues to occur at major exchanges when traffic volume spikes, causing some in the crypto community to cry ""foul play"".Despite assurances from the exchanges that past issues have been addressed, platforms continue to crash on a regular basis during high-traffic periods such as price pumps; the time when most investors want their service to be at its most stable.Aside from news of Tesla's $1.5 billion Bitcoin investment, the report filed with the SEC also suggested that Tesla would start to accept Bitcoin as payment for its cars. As the company can now hold reserves in Bitcoin, it would not need to immediately liquidate tokens acquired in this manner."
417,"The Indian Crypto community has been involved in discussions with the government about how it should perceive cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology before finding ways to regulate the industry ever since the government placed a now-defunct blanket ban on banks servicing crypto firms in April 2018. In the latest update, on Jan. 29, the government revealed its plans to introduce The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021 to the lower house of the parliament (The Lok Sabha) in the upcoming session.As mentioned in the Lok Sabha’s release, the bill would have a two-fold agenda. The first is “to create a facilitative framework for creation of the official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India” and the second one being to “prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India” while also stating that it would allow for certain exceptions to promote blockchain, which is the underlying technology behind crypto.As the budget was going to be announced just two days later, on Feb. 1, the proposed bill listed on the agenda of the parliament sent waves of panic across the Indian crypto industry, as some assumed that the government would announce its intention to ban “private cryptocurrencies” during the budget.This panic even led to Bitcoin (BTC) trading at a 20% discount to global prices, whereas it usually trades at a premium of up to 10%. However, the community breathed a sigh of relief when the current Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Nirmala Sitharaman, didn’t mention anything on the subject during the budget announcement. This also caused Bitcoin’s price to recover in India after the budget announcement.Nischal Shetty, CEO and founder of WazirX cryptocurrency exchange, told Cointelegraph: “The fact that it was not mentioned in the budget shows that the government isn’t in a hurry to make a decision.” Shetty also went on to say how the government might proceed with this bill if it is at all presented in this upcoming parliament session:Although, as reported by the news outlet CNBC-TV18, the government could take the “ordinance route” to pass this bill instead of presenting this in parliament and allowing it to go through the usual stages of a bill passing through the houses of Parliament.The ordinance route means that this bill could be enforced with the approval of President Ram Nath Kovind even when the parliament is out of session. The report also stated that the ordinance could be enforced within a month of being issued. This has set off yet more buzz in the crypto industry, causing fear of the impending ban if it is enforced.Lately, Twitter discussions in India have been complemented by the hashtag #IndiaWantsCrypto. This hashtag has gained a significant amount of traction within the Indian crypto community as various investors and other crypto personalities have also begun using the same hashtag. Following the announcement of the crypto bill in India, WazirX went on to start an industry-wide initiative in the form of an email petition campaign of the same name, Indiawantscrypto.net. This would allow citizens to write to the members of parliament of their own constituencies to urge them to regulate crypto.The bill to be discussed in parliament also announced that the RBI would be working on a framework for how India can create an official digital currency that is backed by the RBI similar to its fiat currency, the Indian rupee.This is mostly driven by the fact that major economies, such as China’s, have already reached a trial phase for their own digital currency, which has been christened the Digital Currency Electronic Payment and is essentially a digital version of the yuan. Neeraj Khandelwal, co-founder of CoinDCX crypto exchange, told Cointelegraph:Although the RBI pointed to a CBDC as legal tender in the country similar to the Indian rupee, it has also called it a liability in digital form for the central bank, which is clearly indicative of the skeptical and apprehensive nature of the lower house of parliament toward digital currencies as a whole. This is despite the fact that the Indian government and the RBI have been actively studying blockchain technology and exploring the benefits and risks associated with cryptocurrencies and blockchain.In fact, the Indian government, along with the Election Commission, is working on trials of blockchain-aided voting to enable voters to cast their votes from outside their home provinces. Currently, Indian voters have to travel back to their constituency to physically cast their votes. There is no option of mailing votes as is the custom in the United States and other countries. Thus, this development is bound to be highly beneficial as a use case of blockchain technology.However, the need for a CBDC in India currently could be questioned, especially since India already has a highly successful intercountry online payment called Unified Payment Interface, which allows users to instantaneously pay vendors for services and transfer payments to other bank account holders via their smartphones.This application has been developed by the National Payments Corporation of India and has widespread adoption reaching into rural parts of the country. The success of UPI in addition to the fledgling public banking system and their “ballooning non-performing assets” could just be indicative of the fact that the Indian banking system has bigger fish to fry. On the matter, Shetty stated:The RBI has also stated in its Payments and Settlements systems booklet that it will first be “exploring the possibility as to whether there is a need for a digital version of fiat currency and in case there is, then how to operationalise it.” Nonetheless, due to the wide nature of the impact of this technological innovation in a country with a population of 1.3 billion people, this will be an interesting space to observe for further development.In the brief given in the Lok Sabha’s agenda, the bill states that it “seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India.” The usage of the word “private” is highly vague and misinformed, as it doesn’t clearly point to the fate of cryptocurrencies like BTC and Ether (ETH), which are digital currencies that are open-sourced and public in nature, allowing any participants in the blockchain to verify the transactions.Shetty said that the use of the wording “private cryptocurrency” indicates that “there’s a thought process which says RBI creating its own crypto removes the need for other cryptocurrencies.” In his opinion, it is a misunderstanding that needs to be clarified. Khandelwal also stated: “Given that the Indian government has not clarified what exactly it means by ‘private cryptocurrencies,’ the only option is to wait and watch.”Irrespective of what the government means by the term “private cryptocurrencies,” it is undeniable that the level of interest from average Indian investors in diversifying their portfolios by investing and trading in cryptocurrencies is on the rise. This is evident in the rise in volumes witnessed on major crypto exchanges."
418,"Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors is following in the footsteps of MicroStrategy and other companies by allocating part of its balance sheet to Bitcoin (BTC).In Monday’s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company announced it had purchased an aggregate of $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, to be held as an investment and store of value for its excess cash. It is currently unknown what is the average purchase price and number of BTC the company acquired. Tesla's investment policy has been updated at an unspecified point in January 2021, which suggests that Tesla may be holding between 35,900 and about 45,500 BTC, corresponding to average prices of $42,000 and $33,000, respectively. Given Bitcoin's price movement in the last few weeks, the 45,500 BTC estimate is likely closer to the true amount.As part of the policy, Tesla expects to begin offering clients the ability to purchase its products in Bitcoin, the filing states. Unlike many other similar initiatives, the Bitcoin it receives will not necessarily be liquidated as soon as possible, thus possibly adding to its reserves.In addition to Bitcoin, Tesla’s new investment policy allows for the purchase of gold bullion and gold exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. Famous ""gold bug"" and Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff appears to have taken meager consolation from this fact, suggesting that Tesla's BTC investment is already being sold off as the market reacts to the news.Related: Bitcoin hits $43K all-time high as Tesla invests $1.5 billion in BTCThe purchase follows Elon Musk’s entry into the world of cryptocurrency. From only holding about 0.25 BTC a friend had sent, Musk warmed up to cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin as the 2021 bull run unfolded.After earlier calling himself “CEO of Dogecoin,” he has dedicated some tweets to the meme-inspired coin. This triggered some criticism by prominent Bitcoin fans, who saw it as irresponsible. Nonetheless, it appears that Musk’s opening to Bitcoin carries far more tangible consequences than a Twitter bio change."
419,"Bitcoin (BTC) jumped by almost $3,000 in minutes on Feb. 8 as reports emerged that Tesla had bought $1.5 billion worth of BTC.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView tracked BTC/USD as a sudden spike to over $41,000 appeared as news of Tesla's plans trickled in.A filing with United States regulator the Securities and Exchange Comission (SEC) shows that the company plans to buy $1.5 worth of Bitcoin.Related: Tesla expects to begin accepting Bitcoin for payment""In January 2021, we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity. As part of the policy, which was duly approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, we may invest a portion of such cash in certain alternative reserve assets including digital assets, gold bullion, gold exchange-traded funds and other assets as specified in the future,"" it states.COINTELEGRAPH MARKETS PRO IS COMING! WE ARE INVITING LOYAL READERS TO A FREE TRIAL OF OUR NEW CRYPTO MARKET INTELLIGENCE PRODUCT - CLICK HERE FOR DETAILS.The move follows encouraging signs from CEO Elon Musk, the world's richest man, who last week openly stated that he was a ""supporter"" of Bitcoin. Since then, however, signals have been mixed, after Musk removed Bitcoin from his Twitter biography but continued tweeting and promoting Dogecoin (DOGE).At the time of writing, volatility was rampant as BTC/USD passed all-time highs of $42,000."
420,"Hedge fund legend Bill Miller is exhibiting an even larger appetite for Bitcoin (BTC). According to a Friday filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, The Miller Opportunity Trust is seeking indirect exposure to BTC via the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.The planned investment is coming at a time when the GBTC premium is at its lowest level since April 2019.If the GBTC shares acquisition does pull through, it will mark a significant departure from the usual investments in equities and derivatives for the $2.25 billion fund. Indeed, the trust’s website lists airlines, healthcare and financials among its core investment position focus.With the fund’s Bitcoin exposure limited to 15% of its assets under management, the GBTC outlay could top $300 million. As part of the filing, the trust did comment on price volatility, stating, “There is relatively small use of Bitcoin in the retail and commercial marketplace in comparison to the relatively large use of Bitcoin by speculators.”Miller is himself a noted Bitcoin proponent. Back in 2016, the legendary Wall Street investor committed 30% of his hedge fund into Bitcoin. This proportion has since increased to over 50% with the BTC play contributing to massive growth in the value of Miller’s hedge fund.Back in January, Miller countered Warren Buffett’s infamous “rat poison” retort, by adding that cash was the rat in that instance. The comments echo sentiments espoused by Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead back in 2018 who said something akin to Bitcoin is rat poison because banks are the rats.Bitcoin recently rallied to $40,000 over the weekend — its highest price level in almost a month. However, the move above $40,000 was met with a swift retrace below $38,000 with the largest crypto by market capitalization down almost 2% in the last 24-hour trading period."
421,"Kenanga Investment Bank Berhad, one of the largest financial services companies in Malaysia, is moving into the cryptocurrency industry with a new investment.According to an official Feb. 8 announcement, Kenanga has entered into a conditional agreement to acquire a 19% equity stake in a licensed crypto exchange. The investment was facilitated through Kenanga’s fully-owned private equity arm Kenanga Private Equity.According to the agreement, Kenanga will invest in Tokenize Technology, the operator of local crypto exchange Tokenize Xchange. Offering trading services for major cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), the platform is one of the three licensed digital asset exchanges regulated by the Securities Commission Malaysia. According to Kenanga, Tokenize Xchange is the second-largest digital asset exchange in terms of market share in Malaysia.Datuk Chay Wai Leong, group managing director of Kenanga Investment Bank Berhad, said, “We have been building a digital ecosystem to offer our customers a wide spectrum of financial products and services, including digital assets.” “Our interest in digital assets goes beyond Bitcoin and other commonly traded cryptocurrencies. We believe that the technology behind digital assets is very powerful and the emergence of digital assets in the future is inevitable,” he added.A spokesperson for Kenanga Investment Bank Berhad declined to provide further details regarding the investment. Kenanga is one of the largest financial services companies in Malaysia, reportedly owning Malaysia’s largest independent investment bank by equity trading and volume. The company is a known partner of Japanese crypto-friendly retail giant Rakuten, providing a joint online stock trading platform, Rakuten Trade, in Malaysia.In late 2020, Malaysia adopted new digital asset-related guidelines by the Securities Commission Malaysia. Targeting digital asset custodians and initial exchange offerings, the rules aim to promote “responsible innovation in the digital asset space” as well as managing potential risks and safeguarding the interests of issuers and investors."
422,"Bitcoin (BTC) bulls seem firmly in the driving seat this week as the largest cryptocurrency begins Monday at near $40,000.After climbing through much of the previous week’s trading, BTC/USD is now up 15% compared to seven days ago — what’s next?Cointelegraph takes a look at five factors which may influence where Bitcoin heads in the coming few days.Bitcoin’s ascent prior to the weekend was accompanied by a familiar scenario on macro markets.Despite the coronavirus and its fallout continuing to wreak havoc on many economies worldwide, stock markets hit new all-time highs, with the S&P 500 closing its biggest weekly gain since last November. Oil climbed above $60 a barrel for the first time in more than a year on Monday.The mood was buoyed by the prospect of fresh spending in the United States as lawmakers looked to finalize the details of President Joe Biden’s $1.9-trillion stimulus package.As Bitcoin proponents have consistently noted since the start of the pandemic and before, more spending means more money concentrated closer to the government and central bank — a phenomenon known as the “cantillon effect” — paving the way for continued interventions in stock markets among other areas.At the same time, the U.S. dollar has suffered in recent days, part of an ongoing narrative that states that the world’s reserve currency will continue to decline.The U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) abruptly fell below 91 on Monday, reversing its recent uptrend, which had begun in mid-January.Despite mixed views over stimulus, political sources appear to be fully signed up to inflating the money supply as the only option.“I remain concerned, as a medium-term worry, with secular stagnation, believe that fiscal policy will need to be much more active in the years ahead, and certainly share the administration’s view that policy should err very much on the side of expansion at a moment like this,” Lawrence Summers, chief economic adviser to Barack Obama, wrote in the Washington Post on Sunday.As Cointelegraph often reports, DXY weakness tends to result in stronger performance on BTC/USD, though the negative correlation has noticeably diminished since September 2020.After biding its time, Bitcoin is thus beginning to look like it could soon exit its established short-term trading zone between $30,000 and $40,000.Signs that this is on the cards were already present — fundamentals were at all-time highs and various indicators pointed to the start of 2021 forming the first innings of a bull run, not the last.This week continues the trend, with network hash rates at record levels and difficulty set to increase by almost 5% at the next readjustment in 10 days’ time.Sunday’s weekly close officially forms Bitcoin’s highest ever.“There will be pullbacks, maybe even to retest the top of the flag as support,” popular trader Scott Melker summarized about the market with a new chart prediction on Saturday.The weekend saw Bitcoin’s first decisive overshoot of $40,000 in almost a month, fuelling anticipation that a restructuring of price-performance could follow.As strong as Bitcoin looked, however, Monday was all about altcoins and, in particular, Ether (ETH).After passing all-time highs of its own last week, the largest altcoin has received its own dedicated Ether futures from CME Group.With a wave of professional traders now tipped to enter, excitement was already clearly visible on the market over the past week as Grayscale added to a buying frenzy that sent ETH/USD above $1,750.Now, however, attention is turning to whether performance can continue, or if the futures launch will be an anti-climax that conversely triggers corrective behavior.“Personally, I'm not entering the markets at all here,” Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe told Twitter followers on Sunday.Van de Poppe added that should a reversal ensue, likely support levels lay significantly below spot price — at $1,100–$1,175 and $875–$950, respectively.In 2017, the launch of the first Bitcoin futures coincided with a price build-up, followed by a comedown that triggered a year-long bear market. At the same time, futures uptake came much more slowly than thought, only hitting its stride in 2019.It is not just futures fuelling Ether, however, and continued investment in DeFi and other major altcoins could continue to cause a headache for Bitcoin.DeFi tokens have surged this year, and the past week has seen five altcoins gain in excess of 115%.As such, Bitcoin’s share of the overall cryptocurrency market cap is dwindling. Currently at 61%, its presence has returned to its position from October last year, just 5% off one-year lows.“In January 2017, after the second halving, we were only a few weeks away from a HUGE Altcoin Season,” popular Twitter commentator The Moon noted, adding a chart comparing Bitcoin dominance now and three years ago.Right on cue, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, returned with fresh publicity for meme-based altcoin Dogecoin (DOGE) on Monday.“Doge appears to be inflationary, but is not meaningfully so (fixed # of coins per unit time), whereas BTC is arguably deflationary to a fault,” he claimed on Twitter.As Cointelegraph reported, the success of Ether and DeFi is not without its problems. Transaction fees in the form of gas have exploded as prices have increased, leading to issues for users and exchanges alike.Right on track — that was the conclusion from quant analyst PlanB about Bitcoin’s performance after its most recent halving event last May.In a Twitter update, the creator of the stock-to-flow family of price forecasting models showed that compared to the post-halving periods in 2013 and 2017, Bitcoin was right in the middle.As such, depending on whether Bitcoin’s next move is more akin to the former or latter, price targets range between an average of $100,000 or $288,000.Bringing halving-based predictions closer to the present, meanwhile, popular commentator Bitcoin Archive devised a $90,000 aim for as soon as April this year.The reason, the account claimed, is that BItcoin is in fact following 2017 post-halving behavior, but “much higher.”“If we continue along this path 90k in April/May is the target,” it summarized, using data from Ecoinometrics."
423,"Bitcoin (BTC) has attracted several institutional investors in the past few months, but with the market capitalization sustaining above $700 billion, many more institutions are likely to contemplate buying Bitcoin. Similarly, Ether (ETH) with a market cap of about $180 billion also cannot be ignored by the investors. The institutional adoption of the top two cryptocurrencies is likely to attract numerous venture capitalists and early investors into smaller projects that have gained a decent size but have not yet reached their full potential. Although the risk is high in such investments, the returns could be equally attractive.For such investors, there are multiple projects to choose from because over 50 digital assets command a market cap of over $1 billion, giving them unicorn status, a term used in legacy markets for companies with a market cap of over $1 billion.If large players jump into these unicorns, they are likely to rally strongly, which will benefit the early retail investors who have a head start over the institutions. While these gains may take a long time, traders can benefit in the short term from the sharp up-moves in several altcoins.Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may resume their uptrend in the next few days.Bitcoin broke above the $38,000 overhead resistance on Feb. 5 and followed it up with another up-move on Feb. 6, but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick.The failure of the bulls to sustain the price above $40,000 has attracted profit-booking today and the bears are attempting to pull and sustain the price below $38,000. If they succeed, the BTC/USD pair could drop to the 20-day exponential moving average ($35,386).If the pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will once again try to resume the uptrend. A breakout of the $40,000 to $41,959.63 overhead resistance zone could signal the start of the next leg of the uptrend to $50,000.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair may dip to the 50-day simple moving average ($32,840). If this support also cracks, the pair may drop to the $28,850 support.The 4-hour chart shows the bulls had pushed the price above the $38,000 to $40,000 overhead resistance zone, but the pair turned down from $40,952.16. This shows the bears are active at higher levels.The pair has dipped below the 20-EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) is just above the midpoint, which suggests the momentum may be weakening. The pair could now drop to the 50-SMA.If the pair rebounds off the 50-SMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to resume the uptrend, but if the 50-SMA cracks, the correction could deepen to $32,000.Polkadot (DOT) is in a strong uptrend. The bulls pushed the price above the $19.40 resistance on Feb. 03 but they have not been able to build upon the breakout. This suggests the bears are attempting to stall the uptrend.However, the positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to sustain below $19.40. This suggests traders are not booking profits aggressively and are buying on every minor dip.If the bulls can now propel the price above $21.7321, the next leg of the uptrend could begin. The target objective on the upside is $24.08 and then $30. The rising moving averages and the RSI above 61 suggest the bulls are in control.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA ($17.43), it will suggest that the bullish momentum has weakened. The DOT/USD pair could then spend some more time oscillating between $19.40 and $14.7259.The 4-hour chart shows the formation of a symmetrical triangle, which generally acts as a continuation pattern. The bears attempted to sink the price below the triangle but the sharp rebound off the 50-SMA shows aggressive buying at lower levels.If the bulls can propel the price above the triangle, it will shift the advantage in favor of the bulls. The pattern target of the break above the triangle is $24.1621. On the other hand, if the bears sustain the price below the triangle, the pair could drop to $15.8379.Chainlink (LINK) broke and closed above the $25.7824 overhead resistance on Feb. 5 but the bulls could not sustain the momentum the next day. This shows the bears are aggressively defending the $25.7824 to $27 resistance zone.However, the long tail on today’s candlestick shows the bulls are buying the dip to the 20-day EMA ($22.83). The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.If the bulls can drive the price above the overhead resistance zone, the next leg of the uptrend could begin. The next level to watch on the upside is $30 and if that is also crossed, the up-move may reach $33.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the LINK/USD pair may extend its range-bound action between $20.1111 and $25.7824 for a few more days.The 4-hour chart shows the formation of an ascending triangle pattern. If the pair rebounds off the current level, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above the overhead resistance zone. If they succeed, the pair could rally to the pattern target of $31.4537.Conversely, if the bears sustain the price below the support line, the pair could drop to $22.61 and then to $21.65. The marginally downsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the negative territory suggest a minor advantage to the bears.The tight range trading between $0.325 and $0.35 resolved to the upside on Feb. 6, which shows the bulls have overpowered the bears. If the bulls can now sustain Stellar Lumens (XLM) above $0.40, the next leg of the uptrend could begin.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest that bulls are in command. Above $0.40, the XLM/USD pair could rally to $0.50 where the bears may again mount stiff resistance.If the bulls fail to close the price above $0.40, the pair could again dip back to $0.35. A strong rebound from this support will suggest the bulls have flipped it to support, which will increase the possibility of a break above $0.40.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.315), it will suggest the current breakout was a bear trap.The 4-hour chart shows the pair has broken out of a symmetrical triangle, which has a target objective at $0.445. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive zone, suggesting the bulls are in control.If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, it will indicate traders are accumulating on dips and that will enhance the prospects of the resumption of the uptrend. Conversely, a break below the 20-EMA will be the first sign that the momentum may be weakening.THETA is currently consolidating in an uptrend. The price action of the past few days has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern that will complete on a breakout and close above $2.51.The bulls had pushed the price above $2.51 on Feb. 5 but they could not sustain the breakout. This suggests the bears are trying to defend the resistance at $2.51.However, the positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the 20-day EMA ($2.09). If the price rebounds off the current levels, the bulls will again try to thrust the THETA/USD pair above $2.51.If they succeed, the pair could resume the next leg of the uptrend. The pattern target of the breakout from the triangle is $3.56. This bullish setup will invalidate if the bears sink the price below the triangle.The 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart has started to turn down and the RSI has dropped into the negative territory, indicating the bears are attempting to make a comeback. A break below $2.10 could pull the price down to the support line of the triangle.On the other hand, if the price turns up from the current levels or the support line of the triangle, it will suggest the bulls are buying on dips. They will then again try to push the price above the $2.51 resistance.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

424,"King Midas is most famously remembered through the fable we tell our kids that the king could turn everything he touched into gold. At first, it was a great idea that his greed turned even food into gold, leaving him wealthy but unable to live. Robinhood’s CEO and its board had the impossible King Midas dilemma this week: deciding whether to side with their customers and let them make over $15 billion in profits or halting trading and allow only the sale of GameStop (GME) to enable the money-hungry shorts to cover their position at lower prices and avoid massive losses. Robinhood showed everyone that its favorite color is money, and its friends are the same people who make sure you almost never win trading on Wall Street.Related: GameStop saga reveals legacy finance is rigged, and DeFi is the answerAs it usually does on Wall Street, greed triumphed. It was not only Robinhood, Interactive Brokers, Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, and Citadel and Point 72 but all centralized finances sided with the shorts.Robinhood launched a platform and an app that represented the people and that was always going to act in the users’ best interests. Still, the golden rule of startups applies: If you don’t pay for the product, you are the product. The company’s real plan was to collect enough order flow and assets to charge large market makers hundreds of millions of dollars in fees related to securities lending and order flow. The professionals on Wall Street call retail investors “plankton,” as it is what hedge funds and institutions feed upon to deliver obscene profits and bonuses to their employees and shareholders.How is it possible in 2021 to have 136% of stock sell short? Who allows such things to exist and why isn’t anyone being held responsible? While everyone is focused on enabling the Reddit mob to buy GME, no one is looking into the root cause of the GME problem: the collusion of brokers and hedge funds to use naked shorting to destroy companies for pure profit.When the GameStop short squeeze took place, we found out who Robinhood’s largest customer really was: Citadel & Point72 (two of the most storied hedge fund managers on Wall Street), which pays Robinhood over $300 million in fees yearly for the order flow and securities lending. It’s hard to believe Robinhood has its community’s back when it’s always looking over its own shoulder.Related: r/Wallstreetbets vs. Wall Street: A prelude to DeFi bursting onto the scene?Creating unobstructed access to basic financial services has the potential to unleash the genius and sleeping talent in our society. IQ is distributed equally across the planet, but access and opportunity are not. Often, access depends on status and wealth, which means beating the system is impossible. What is possible? We need to take advantage of this moment, when the traditional financial institutions are exposed, to introduce the waves of innovation that have been occurring on blockchain technologies.From naked short positions to lying about how much annual percentage yield you really should be making from holding your assets with these institutions, it is time to introduce real, impactful financial freedom through financial tools and methods that act in the best interest of the users and not the abusers at the very top.There is a reason why some of the most intelligent, innovative and community-focused leaders are adding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to their wallets and adding them to their Twitter profiles today. In protest of what we have witnessed this week — because no matter how hard they try — hedge funds, fat cats and tech bros cannot turn Bitcoin into dollars reserved only for their own pockets because the decentralized community is bigger than they are.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

425,"As the United States Senate begins confirming leadership posts across commerce and the treasury, there has been meaningful momentum in the crypto community as a response. This is due to the profiles of various individuals who have been reportedly nominated, as well as the anticipated economic measures by the coming administration — both of which are expected to nurture positive momentum for crypto growth.While a few official appointments have been made with numerous confirmations pending, others are still at the nomination stage. Let’s take a quick loop around the swamp.Confirmed with 84 votes, Janet Yellen will be at the helm of the treasury. During her confirmation hearing, Yellen outlined her support for Biden’s agenda, which includes a likely increase on taxes for the wealthy, “backing the buck” to stabilize the dollar amid attempts to undermine current value through market manipulation abroad, and ensuring the stabilization of the U.S. economy amid the current global COVID-19 pandemic. On crypto, Yellen did not directly address her approach to regulation in the space during her confirmation hearings; however, she did mention that legitimate uses for cryptocurrency should be encouraged, such as means using these types of decentralized finance to “improve efficiency of the financial system.”One appointment the crypto community is particularly excited about is Gary Gensler, who previously served as Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman under President Barack Obama and as a Treasury official under President Bill Clinton. Having previously called blockchain technology “a catalyst for change,” Gensler has been outspoken about the importance of cryptocurrencies and has gone on record to say there is a “strong case” for XRP being classified as a security. He has also been very vocal about how blockchain technology could solve payment problems in the United States.As the expected chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gensler will be in a prime position to rally support behind a U.S. central bank digital currency, particularly amid institutional interest for this product. Gensler would also play a significant role in broad governmental action on crypto and blockchain, such as the consideration of a Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund, and he is expected to shift sentiments in its favor. Currently a professor of practice at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management, Gensler conducts research and teaches blockchain technology, digital currencies, financial technology and public policy.Moreover, the departure of SEC Chairman Jay Clayton is also welcomed by crypto enthusiasts, as he was notorious for his skepticism toward the digital finance industry. With Clayton stepping aside, coupled with his anti-crypto biases, the path is open for Bitcoin ETFs to become a reality.There’s already a line of financial institutions led by Fidelity and investment firms that have applications for Bitcoin funds in process with the SEC and will be applying pressure on Gensler when he takes office.Another office coming into focus during Biden’s transition is the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Out is Brian Brooks, former head of OCC during the Trump administration, who, prior to stepping down, announced that banks can utilize stablecoins and blockchain to process payment. In what is being considered an “interpretive letter,” the OCC is allowing federally chartered banks to use cryptocurrencies with fairly stable prices for standard transactions. The letter also stipulates that banks can participate in validating transactions on a blockchain, setting an impressive regulatory step forward for stablecoins and creating more potential for cryptocurrencies.Prior to stepping down from office, Brooks went on record about the importance of decentralized finance where he explained:As of early February, Biden’s transition team is expected to nominate Michael Barr as Brooks’ successor in the OCC. Prior to his tenure as an advisor at Ripple and board member at LendingClub, Barr helped construct the Dodd-Frank Act, where strict regulations were introduced to lenders and creditors to protect consumers in the wake of the housing collapse. This unique blend of experience and credibility could be what’s needed to help push forward favorable regulation and further growth of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency in financial services.The last appointment that should make investors optimistic is Chris Brummer, who is expected to become the next Chairman of the CFTC. As a member of the CFTC’s subcommittee and faculty director of Georgetown’s Institute of International Economic Law, Brummer will advise Yellen on regulatory affairs related to cryptocurrency while also potentially laying the foundation for a more expansive derivatives market for digital assets.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
426,"The decentralized finance or DeFi market saw a steep correction over the last 12 hours as Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to break the $41,000 level.Meanwhile, analysts say that the profits from major DeFi tokens are flowing back into Bitcoin, even though the DeFi market is still lagging behind despite BTC’s recovery over the past week.Both major bluechip DeFi tokens and small market cap cryptocurrencies are struggling to recover against Bitcoin over the weekend.Typical DeFi bluechip assets include the likes of Aave (AAVE), SushiSwap (SUSHI), Uniswap (UNI), Maker (MKR), Compound (COMP), and Synthetix (SNX).Major DeFi tokens with slightly smaller market caps include Alpha Finance (ALPHA), Yearn.finance (YFI), and 0x (ZRX).The primary reason behind the DeFi market’s correction is that the profits from DeFi tokens were flowing into Bitcoin as BTC began to pull back.This trend amplified the selling pressure on DeFi tokens, particularly as the Bitcoin/Ether (ETH) pair has seen short-term weakness in the past two days.However, the cryptocurrency market has been moving quickly and thus market dynamics could change rapidly over the next coming days, especially with the launch of CME Ether futures on Monday.At the same time, another DeFi rally could be sparked by the price of Bitcoin cleanly breaking above $40,000 this time and consolidating between $41,000 to $42,000, the all-time hig. For this to materialize, Ether would have to catch up to Bitcoin and regain momentum above $1,700 in the short term. For now, ETH is trailing behind Bitcoin with the ETH/BTC pair struggling to recover.Whether ETH reclaims $1,700 as a support area would likely be the key factor that decides the trajectory of the DeFi market in the foreseeable future.Puru Saxena, an investor and a retired money manager, said that if Bitcoin goes back above $40,000 again, it would invalidate the bearish scenario. He said:Exchange heatmaps, especially the orderbook of Binance, show large sell walls at $41,000 and $42,000. As such, if Bitcoin reclaims $40,000 and makes its way towards $41,000, it would confirm that a bullish market structure is still intact.If Bitcoin regains strength and considering that the DeFi index has not broken its parabolic structure, a continuation of the rally is more probable than a steep correction.DEFI index so far looks like another pause in the longer term trend. Breaking curve would be worrying. pic.twitter.com/WfmNTnTOq4Bluechip DeFi assets have already begun to recover back to the daily open on Feb. 7, with AAVE, SNX, and ALPHA showing strength.It would be crucial for the DeFi index to recover beyond 2,080 in the short term, however, to maintain its bullish market structure, which would require a 4% rally."
427,"What was blockchain technology originally intended for? It’s generally presumed that it was created in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto as part of his white paper, creating Bitcoin (BTC). Since Bitcoin would be built on decentralized ledger technology, a blockchain needed to be established as the foundation for the cryptocurrency. Since 2008, blockchain technology has expanded well beyond cryptocurrency usage and is now being applied in a variety of use cases from healthcare to finance to green tech and more.But blockchain tech didn’t start with Satoshi’s white paper. It was actually invented in 1991 as a way to verify and protect content through a concept called timestamping.In Satoshi’s famous Bitcoin white paper, he cites another paper: “How to Time-Stamp a Digital Document,” published by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta in 1991. The two researchers knew that, in an all-digital world, the issue of certifying documents — when they were created and when they were changed — would become an issue.They explained that in the past, you could simply flip through the pages of a notebook to see dated entries. They cite other means of certification, such as mailing oneself a letter or having something notarized, but in those cases, tampering of documents would be discovered immediately. But not so in a digital world, where documents can be altered with no evidence left behind.“The problem is to time-stamp the data, not the medium,” they wrote. The first solution they proposed was to simply send a document to a timestamping service. The TSS would then retain a copy for safe-keeping, which could be brought out for comparison when needed.What is the problem with this solution? It relied on a third party that might mishandle it.Instead of a third-party verifier, they would use a cryptographically secure hash function, which would serve as the unique identifier for a piece of content. Instead of sending the whole document to the TSS, the creator would send the unique identifier instead. Upon receipt, the TSS would make a confirmation with a digital signature. By checking the signature, the client would be assured that the TSS actually did process the request, that the hash was correctly received, and that the correct time was included.But what happens if the TSS puts a false timestamp on the hash? Haber and Stornetta proposed two solutions: (1) Use bits of previous requests to create new ones, which forces a chronological record; and (2) Make the whole system decentralized, transparent and checkable.For anyone familiar with how blockchain technology works, this is it. Blocks are created by drawing from the hash of the last block and solving the hash of the new block. Once a block is added, it’s verified by nodes on the blockchain in a decentralized system and locked into the public ledger, unable to be altered.Haber and Stornetta outlined use cases for this kind of time-stamping, citing inventions or ideas where authorship would need to be proven. Because the documents are recorded as hash functions, it timestamps intellectual property and patents without revealing the contents. They also cite examples where, if a company has documents that were tampered with, they can prove the originals through the timestamp. They envisioned timestamping to encompass not only text documents but original audio recordings, photos, videos and more.While Haber and Stornetta eventually went on to create their own company called Surety, which acted as that TSS (and, interestingly, published their hashes in the New York Times classifieds every week starting in 1995), but the idea never fully caught on. It wasn’t until Bitcoin was created in 2008 that blockchain technology was finally fully created — four years after Haber and Stornetta’s patent on it ran out.The need for authenticating documents wasn’t just a 1990s concern. In a world where there’s so much digital content being produced and when distrust in content on the internet seems to be growing, timestamping might just be the way to achieve the transparency and accountability that’s needed.The idea is simple. A unique hash is generated from a piece of content’s text, title or date, and is added to the blockchain. This not only locks in the time at which a piece of content was created to a public distributed ledger but if any part of that content is altered, the hash alters too — showing that it was tampered with or that a new version was created.This allows content creators to be able to prove at any time that they created the piece by calling it up on the blockchain. Timestamping can also put an end to plagiarism and copyright disputes since original work can be found linked to its hash in an immutable blockchain.Timestamping also increases trust for readers. With added identity tiers, they can know exactly who wrote the content and when and can view an authentication certificate. The more sites that adopt timestamping, the more readers will get used to associating timestamping with transparency, accountability and authenticity — and will reject any unverifiable content that not timestamped. Timestamping has a use case in e-commerce as well, where buyers can see original terms and agreements and not be cheated by a suddenly updated version that nulls a warranty.With a simple implementation, the internet could become a safe, trusted place where authors can feel confident their content will remain secure, and where readers know that what they’re reading is verifiable. It’s been a long time since the original paper in 1991, but those ideas are needed today.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
428,"In the traditional investing world ‘unicorn’ is a term used by venture capitalists to describe a privately held startup valued at more than $1 billion. Typically these startups have strong fundamentals and oftentimes a first-mover advantage that helps them rapidly rise in value to become prized investment opportunities for yield-seeking funds.Some of the best-known unicorns include Elon Musk’s SpaceX, a private rocket and spacecraft manufacturer with a valuation of $46 billion, and Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange with a current valuation of $8 billion.While the world's attention has been focused on the Coronavirus pandemic, the outcome of the 2020 U.S. presidential election, and the recent r/Wallstreetbets social investing phenomenon, the crypto sector has quietly ascended to a total valuation of over $1.2 trillion.Adding to this, currently there are more than 55 unicorn status projects that have a market cap over $1 billion.Recent Bitcoin (BTC) evangelism from the likes of Michael Saylor, Mark Cuban and Elon Musk are helping shine a spotlight on the nascent crypto industry, and with it comes the discerning eye of institutional investors who will quickly want to look beyond BTC to what other promising opportunities exist in the space.These projects are no longer just focused on making cryptocurrency a global means of exchange. Some of the top projects include smart contract platforms, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, privacy tokens, oracles providers and even humor-oriented meme coins.With that in mind, here are some of the top crypto unicorn projects to keep an eye on as institutions begin to make their presence felt in the cryptocurrency markets.Bitcoin is the ultimate first-mover in the crypto space as it paved the way for the rest to come into existence and holds more than 61% of the total market value with a current market cap of $843 billion.As the longest-running chain possessing the strongest mining network of all proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, BTC is likely to be the go-to choice for new money coming into the sector which will take a cautious approach to start out with.Similar to how many of the current crypto faithful got involved in the space, Bitcoin will be the “gateway coin” that introduces the concept and leads to further exploration.Ethereum (ETH), with a current market cap of $196 billion, is the obvious second choice as it is the most-utilized smart contract platform and home to a majority of the top DeFi protocols that have surged in popularity in recent months.Other legacy projects that have survived multiple bull-bear cycles and achieved unicorn status include Litecoin (LTC), which has emerged as a reliable value transfer alternative to the higher fees and longer block times of BTC, and the privacy-focused Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC), which paved the way in bringing anonymity to blockchain transactions.These projects currently have market caps of $10.5 billion, $2.75 billion and $1.07 billion respectively.Since early 2020, one of the main driving forces in the growth of the cryptocurrency sector has been the emergence of decentralized finance.Decentralized exchanges (DEX) like Uniswap have steadily grown from being a simple exchange interface dApp to a sprawling trading platform that now averages a 7-day trading volume of $6.72 billion, a figure that rivals volume of the top centralized exchanges.Uniswap’s UNI governance token was initially airdropped to users of the interface who took a chance on the protocol while it was still in development, but now the token can be found on all major centralized and decentralized exchanges.The protocol also received venture capital backing to ensure further development. With a current market cap of $5.9 billion and a token price of $19.79, Uniswap is likely to be on the watchlist for the smart money eyeing the space.SushiSwap, the main competitor to Uniswap, has also achieved unicorn status with a current valuation of $1.8 billion. The platform offers a community-focused system that allows token holders to stake their SUSHI to participate in governance as well as earn passive income from trading fees generated by the protocol.While DEXs helped facilitate the growth of DeFi, lending protocols have emerged as the top draw for total value locked (TVL) and higher token values.Maker (MKR), AAVE and Compound (COMP) are the leading platforms when measured by the total value locked (TVL) in the protocol. Currently there is a combined $15.63 billion in value deposited in smart contracts that interact with the protocols and their market caps range from $2.1 billion to $5.98 billion.In addition to the high yield opportunities offered by staking protocols, retail investors are also attracted to the governance features that give token holders a say in the future development of the protocol. These DeFi darlings are likely to pique the interest of long term capital.Ethereum’s dominance in DeFi has proven to be a double-edged sword as increasing network congestion resulted in an untenable surge in gas fees.The recent record-high gas fees have opened the door for other smart contract platforms to fill the need for layer-2 options, as well as highlighting the need for oracle providers that can communicate data securely across platforms.Promising smart contract platforms that have emerged include Polkadot (DOT) and its sister chain Kusama (KSM), which introduce interoperability with Ethereum and other top blockchains as the solution to the current siloed nature of separate networks.DOT’s market cap has risen to $18.8 billion as its prominence continues to grow and Kusama is new to the unicorn club as its market cap just surpassed the $1 billion mark for the first time on Feb. 6.Interestingly, Cardano (ADA), one of the 2017 ICO-era projects, has also started gaining momentum in recent weeks following the addition of smart contracts to the protocol and hints of future DeFi related endeavors.Currently, Cardano’s market cap is $19.8 billion and the integration of DeFi could help propel its value higher as ADA has yet to tap into the liquidity offered on decentralized exchanges.Theta captured the first-mover advantage when it comes to blockchain-based video streaming and the project has recently added smart contract functionality, the ability to create non-fungible tokens, and they launched the Thetaswap DEX on Feb. 4.As more participants enter the crypto space and new blockchains emerge to fit specific niches, communication between separate networks will become essential to the overall health and continued growth of the sector.This is where oracle projects come in to offer reliable, secure ways to transfer data.Chainlink (LINK) is the top oracle project in terms of protocol integrations and its valuation. LINK currently has a $10.37 billion market cap and the project's recent integration with Kraken exchange is expected to add further value to the project.Meanwhile, upstarts like UMA and The Graph (GRT) have only recently achieved unicorn status as the 2021 bull market heats up. Both projects have developed novel ways to track, record and transmit data and they have reached valuations of $1.7 billion and $1.1 billion.GRT has been especially active in the growth department, announcing multiple partnerships and upcoming integrations including bridges to DOT and Binance Coin (BNB).Bitcoin burst onto the financial scene more than twelve years ago and has steadily forged a path to prominence that governments and the global financial system can no longer ignore.Now that institutions are finally beginning to dip their toes into BTC and ETH, it’s time to take an even closer look at what the emerging blockchain ecosystem has to offer.The herd of unicorns is likely to expand and considering that the decentralized finance sector is still in a very early growth stage, there’s plenty of value to be found in these unicorn projects.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

429,"GameStop and Twitter are both a mirage and an iceberg — but don’t try tweeting that. Not because you won’t own the tweet (because you won’t), but because the only completely true expression that Twitter is capable of delivering as a platform is unlocking the ugly truth about the internet itself. Or as Elon Musk recently tweeted:In retrospect, it was inevitableLet me explain.In the midst of Robinhood halting trading for its supposed users, Jack Dorsey has been talking about decentralizing Twitter and social media in general. But other than a few enthusiasts, the word “decentralization” is the equivalent to syntactical Ambien. But don’t fall asleep just yet. I promise I’m not going to tell you to buy Bitcoin (BTC), but I am going to tell you why you should be able to own part of the next Twitter and Robinhood. First, let’s say what we all clearly feel.Related: GameStop saga reveals legacy finance is rigged, and DeFi is the answerThere is something... in the air. There is a palpable electricity. A levy is about to burst — not a literal one, but a symbolic one that has stopped the river of progress and equality from flowing in far too many areas of our world. Power has always been held by the few, and in all of these areas, the equality of power is now at stake.People are starting to move from centralized power models to decentralized ones, moving from the few holding all of the power to the many sharing in it. When this dam bursts, there will be a massive shift where everyone involved will become more powerful while the most powerful among us will start to become less so. A leak has already begun. It is the dawning of the new power.Jeremy Heimans and Henry Timms, authors of the bestselling book New Power: How Power Works in Our Hyperconnected World — and How to Make It Work for You, describe the situation in a 2014 article:While the classic top-down power model, or tree or pyramid model, has been around since at least Aristotle, the 21st century has been moving toward something radically different. We have seen it in the invention of the internet, in political movements like the Tea Party or Black Lives Matter, in the Me Too movement, in open-source software, in collective knowledge projects like Wikipedia, and of course, in the invention of Bitcoin (BTC) and blockchain. However, what may be most interesting of all: The universe itself, the human brain, art and our natural ecosystems all resemble decentralized networks. More importantly, they do not resemble top-down power models.Heimans and Timms go on in their book:“Those who are building and stewarding vast platforms that run on new power have become our new elites. These leaders often use the language of the crowd — ‘sharing,’ ‘open,’ ‘connected’ — but their actions can tell a different story. Think of Facebook, the new power platform that most of us know best. For all those likes and smiley faces we create using what the company calls our ‘power to share,’ the two billion users of Facebook get no share of the vast economic value created by the platform. Nor any say in how it is governed. And not a peek into the algorithm that has been proven to shape our moods, our self-esteem, and even some elections. Far from the organic free-roaming paradise the early internet pioneers imagined, there is a growing sense that we are living in a world of participation farms, where a small number of big platforms have fenced, and harvest for their own gain, the daily activities of billions.”Robinhood and Twitter — and more importantly, the internet design that allowed their business models — are centralized and need toppling. They promote old power while marketing themselves as the opposite. This is where the mirage meets the iceberg. However, after the turbulent year of 2020, it seems the people have had enough. The cat is out of the bag, so to speak.What was once theory has now become reality. The network model is real, and ironically, it needs a new home because it currently operates on top of a pyramid.The internet is run by central servers owned by central entities. Our entire human output of data is controlled, manipulated, studied, sold and used to influence our behaviors and extract as much value as possible for a small group of people. This is simply the way it is, whether large tech giants want to admit it or not. Users are products, not customers. In the case of Robinhood shutting down the trading of GameStop and other securities, its free services are now pointing to the fact that user trading data is the real money maker by selling it to hedge funds. In the case of social media platforms, they sell our data to advertisers and, sometimes, political campaigns — or worse.Right now, we have millions of people desperately clamoring for new platforms where they control their own digital identity, control their own data and can even profit from and govern the platform. This new power proposition, where democracy meets libertarianism, thankfully already exists.From the model Bitcoin created for peer-to-peer transfer of value, to decentralized exchanges for digital assets that operate on code alone, to decentralized finance staking platforms that allow users to literally govern the rules of the platform — all of which have no central entity in control — the future is bright.But it is not enough.Everyday apps that we use on our phones still operate under old power infrastructure. They all use central servers and corporate-issued IDs (the average person has around 70), and they all have companies that own all of the data generated by their products/customers. This needs to change.New internet, or Web 3.0, builds new infrastructure and new roads for data to travel along and be stored. By removing central servers, allowing internet IDs to be issued by public blockchains, not corporations, and by giving users choice over how their data is stored, applications are becoming part of the new power movement. With decentralized internet, the popular adage “If it’s free, you are the product” can finally be proven untrue. How? Because Web 3.0 is a global movement, not a company.This is how the internet was always meant to be: a vast, decentralized smart network that no one controls, like our universe, our brains, our oceans and now our cultural movements. Decentralized social media is already in development, with decentralized versions of Twitter, LinkedIn and WhatsApp in the works.2021 is the beginning of the end for the old power of the internet. In my opinion, it could not have arrived soon enough.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

430,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) broke above $40,000 on Feb. 6 for the first time in 23 days. But this time, the market sentiment is a lot calmer with a less overheated derivatives market.The combination of a less crowded Bitcoin futures market, the selling pressure from whales peaking, and a fast recovery could help BTC stabilize above $40,000 this time.On Jan. 29, a pseudonymous Bitcoin researcher and analyst known as “Material Scientist” said that “mega whale” order flow reached an all-time high.This means that the selling pressure coming from whales dealing with $1 million to $10 million orders reached a record-high. The analyst said at the time:If the price of Bitcoin establishes $40,000 as a new support area, it would establish a highly positive short-term price trend for BTC.It would mean that BTC can now rally towards its all-time high without the massive selling pressure coming from major whales and high-net-worth investors.In the near term, for Bitcoin to maintain its bullish structure, it would need to protect two key support levels: $40,000 and $37,834.Meanwhile, according to the analysts at Whalemap, a data analytics platform that tracks whale data, there is a confluence of whale supports at $37,834 and $36,290.If Bitcoin breaks down from $40,000, these two support areas would be critical to defend. Below these two levels would likely result in a short-term bearish trend. The analysts wrote:In the foreseeable future, some traders anticipate Bitcoin to surge beyond $60,000 with the momentum from the ongoing rally.Scott Melker, a cryptocurrency trader, said there will be pullbacks, but Bitcoin would likely reach $63,000 following the breakout. He said:Bitcoin technically broke out of the bull flag when it surpassed $38,000 on Feb. 4. Considering that Bitcoin is looking stronger than the last time it broke $40,000 a month ago, there is sufficient momentum to carry it past $50,000 this time around.A potential catalyst in the near term could be Guggenheim potentially confirming its investment in Bitcoin after securing the rights to invest in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust in February."
431,"What happened to GameStop’s stock at the end of January will be remembered by investors for years to come, as it was probably the first time in the history of the “free market” that a group of self-described internet “degenerates” outsmarted a bunch of Wall Street pros at their own game.As a recap, on Jan 27, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply by over 2% — in large part due to the United States Federal Reserve announcing its move to maintain interest rates around the zero percent mark — shares of video game retailer GameStop (GME) and movie theater chain AMC Entertainment (AMC) proceeded to rise by 130% and 300%, respectively, taking their market capitalizations to $24 billion and $6.74 billion.This unprecedented surge was facilitated by a group of independent small-time traders operating out of a Reddit subreddit called r/Wallstreetbets. They were able to recognize that executives over at New York-based hedge fund Melvin Capital were shorting GameStop shares in order to net handsome profits for themselves.In a nutshell, “shorting” is a practice used in stock market trading wherein an individual borrows shares only to sell them off immediately in hopes of buying them back once they fall in price. The person can then return these shares to the lender, netting the difference between the price at the time of borrowing and returning of the stock.Upon seeing this window of opportunity, a large number of Redditors started to pump GME and AMC, among many others, resulting in prices shooting up by over 2,000% in a matter of several days. This caused Melvin Capital to incur substantial losses estimated to be worth billions of dollars.In the past, there have been countless similar scenarios that have played out exactly like this, wherein billionaires have gone up against each other upon realizing that large-scale shorting action was at play. However, this time around, because a group of unnamed individuals was able to pull off such a move, financial services providers such as Robinhood and TD Ameritrade rediscovered their financial ethics and decided to help Wall Street cut down on its losses.With traditional stocks now being faced with cryptoesque pump and dumps in addition to traditional gatekeepers like Robinhood playing Big Brother under the pretext of “protecting their customers,” Cointelegraph reached out to Nikita Ovchinnik, chief business development officer for decentralized exchange aggregator 1inch. In his view, it’s important for people to understand that there is a big difference between traditional pump-and-dump schemes and what happened with GME, adding:Jason Lau, chief operating officer of cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin, said that he is glad this event is finally opening everyone’s eyes to the market manipulation that is rampant in today’s so-called free financial markets. “Crypto is an entirely free market, there are zero barriers to entry,” he added.Lau also believes that incidents such as these are a case in point as to why brokers are bad for the financial ecosystem while also highlighting the need for more decentralization. Similarly, Vitalis Elkins, chief operating officer of Tradelize — a cryptocurrency trading platform — told Cointelegraph:As soon as Robinhood began to prevent amateur traders from taking a gamble on the pumping stocks, hundreds of thousands of disgruntled users decided to leave a one-star rating for the stock trading app on the Google Play store and Apple’s App Store. As a result, Robinhood’s rating proceeded to plummet to under one star almost overnight.However, on Jan 29, it came to light that Google’s and Apple’s development teams had decided to step in to remove the negative reviews and complaints regarding Robinhood, with Google having previously stated that “Ratings and reviews meant to manipulate an app’s average rating or top reviews” violate its policies, thus effectively negating the opinions of its customers and sending the app’s rating back above the four-star range.Following this, hoards of users once again decided to bombard Robinhood with one-star ratings, sending it to one star for the second time in just a few day’s time. However, it appears as though this time around, Google will not be coming to the app’s rescue. On Apple’s App Store, Robinhood currently has a four-star rating, but with the negative reviews flying in at a furious pace, that may soon change.One conclusion that the crypto community seems to agree on is that actions taken by service providers like Robinhood, Public and TD Ameritrade indicate that big money is reserved only for the elites and that the average person can't or shouldn't harbor hopes of amassing wealth, especially through the legacy financial system. Marie Tatibouet, chief marketing officer of cryptocurrency exchange Gate.io, told Cointelegraph that when it comes to decentralized finance:However, Charles Bovaird, vice president of content for advisory firm Quantum Economics, believes that while the recent developments involving GME and AMC have been very interesting to watch, they don’t put forth a strong enough argument for DeFi being the only way out of such situations in the future.In his opinion, another solution — one that many in the crypto industry may not particularly like — could be the intervention of regulators. Bovaird pointed out that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently summoned the heads of several government entities, including the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission, to look into matters like market fairness and asset volatility, activities that may help curb similar episodes in the future. He added:In a somewhat similar line of thinking, Elkins also opined that while DeFi is an attempt to “fix” the legacy financial system, it isn't the only way out. He believes that as things stand, DeFi definitely cannot be considered a decent alternative to the traditional financial system that operates at the moment. However, he did concede that with the pace at which DeFi is evolving, there is hope that adoption use cases will appear in the future: “ETH 2.0 is coming and fee lowering can be a small step for mankind but a big step for DeFi.”While it still seems as though a large number of people have yet to entirely grasp the immensity of what crypto technology has to offer, a lot of causal investors are now beginning to ask questions about how Robinhood could even conceive of restricting its users in the first place.This overarching theme of censorship and financial exclusion is a significant issue in traditional finance and will potentially serve for many as a gateway toward learning about crypto-enabled decentralized finance, according to Tatibouet:Similarly, Ovchinnik believes that the GME case ultimately stands to assist the crypto industry, especially because it will help investors realize that it’s simply impossible for anyone to stop trades from taking place on decentralized exchanges.Related: r/Wallstreetbets vs. Wall Street: A prelude to DeFi bursting onto the scene?That being said, he did state that from a purely user-experience standpoint, blockchain applications might still be too complex for many new users to get a grasp on immediately. “It would take at least a couple of years for the current protocols to evolve,” he added."
432,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price broke through the crucial level at $35,000 and continued its run above $40,000 on Feb. 6, just days after MicroStrategy's pitched Bitcoin to over 1,4000 companies. This breakout above $35,000 earlier this week was significant as it opened the door to a new all-time high test. The final hurdle at $40,000 has prevented BTC from a new all-time high, while many all-time highs were established by altcoins during the past week.Indeed, the crypto market is going parabolic as most investors have been seeing substantial increases in their portfolio sizes. However, the rally in DeFi alts, in particular, is at risk of becoming overheated as momentum may be swinging back to Bitcoin with BTC back above $40,000. Moreover, will the CME futures listing of Ether (ETH) change the market momentum next week, or will Bitcoin continue its climb? Let's take a look at the charts.The 4-hour chart of Bitcoin shows a beautiful breakout above $35,000, which resulted in a healthy continuation toward $40,000. During this run, the $38,000 level gave a small rejection but wasn’t classified as a massive resistance zone.The $38,000 level received its test during the Elon Musk pump, as Bitcoin’s price retraced significantly on the same day. Therefore, if Bitcoin would break through $35,000 again, it wasn't surprising to see a continuation to $40,000 rather than another rejection at $38,000.This $40,000 area is the final hurdle to break before new all-time highs. However, this new strength in Bitcoin means its market dominance is rebounding at the expense of most altcoins.The Bitcoin dominance chart is a beautiful chart demonstrating how market cycles work. In recent years, the Bitcoin dominance has topped out in December, following by an altcoin surge led by Ethereum. This has been accompanied by BTC dominance dropping substantially in January.This trend was repeated again this year with altcoins going parabolic, hitting new all-time highs as Bitcoin consolidated within a range.However, every run comes to an end, and altcoins will correct. Historically, a temporary bottom has been seen in February, after which the Bitcoin dominance rises for a little. This rise of dominance would be in line with a potential correction in ETH price.Ether CME futures will launch on Monday, Feb. 8, after which a correction should not come as a surprise. This is exactly what happened with Bitcoin CME futures in December 2017. This listing marked the top of the bull cycle and the beginning of a multi-year bear market.Therefore, a correction for Ether may come as well with the focus shifting back to Bitcoin, particularly as Ethereum gas fees have been hitting absurd levels. This shift would cause Bitcoin dominance to increase substantially.The daily chart of Bitcoin can be used to define the next targets for Bitcoin’s price. If Bitcoin’s price can break through the $40,500 area, the following points of interest can be defined through the Fibonacci extension tool.By using that indicator, the most common Fibonacci level is the 1.618 Fibonacci level. This level puts the potential price target for Bitcoin at $50,000, once it breaks the recent high.However, Bitcoin’s price has been seeing a significant rally in recent months already. So a clear breakout above the previous all-time high should be combined with a clear support/resistance flip of that level. Otherwise, a continuation of the range-bound construction is likely to happen, as history shows.In the cart above, Bitcoin’s price tried to break above the recent highs (after the halving) but couldn’t succeed, resulting in more ranging. An apparent breakout above the all-time high above $42,000 however, should propel Bitcoin’s price to $50,000.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

433,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is showing signs of a newfound rally as it breaks the $40,000 resistance area. There is a combination of optimistic on-chain data points and a favorable market structure that is leading analysts and traders to anticipate an impending Bitcoin breakout to a new all-time high.In the short term, the $38,000 and $40,000 levels remain the biggest hurdles for Bitcoin. The longer BTC took to break out of $40,000, the higher the probability of a potential correction was imminent. Thus, it’s critical for Bitcoin to surpass the $40,000 level and stay above it in the foreseeable future. Bitcoin has already spent nearly three weeks under $38,000, causing its short-term price cycle to stagnate and lose momentum. On Feb. 6, Bitcoin finally broke out of the $38,000 level, establishing it as a support level.One positive on-chain data point that raises the chances of a Bitcoin breakout is the increase of whale addresses. Analysts at Santiment said that Bitcoin whales have continued to accumulate despite the increase in the price of the asset: “The whales of #Bitcoin (1,000+ $BTC addresses) haven’t stopped accumulating, while the mid-tier traders (10-1,000 $BTC) haven’t stopped taking profit as its price hovers around $38,000. Meanwhile, the small addresses have been #FOMO’ing back in rapidly!”The accumulation of Bitcoin by whales coincides with large outflows from Coinbase, which typically indicates that high-net-worth investors are purchasing Bitcoin. A pseudonymous trader on Twitter known as Johnny stated: “There is coincidence that we have been seeing huge amounts of $BTC being withdrawn from coinbase. The first market correction of the 2021 bull market is now finished.”Scott Melker, a cryptocurrency trader, noted that atop the optimistic on-chain data and fundamentals, Bitcoin is demonstrating a favorable technical market structure. He explained that Bitcoin is seeing a “massive bull flag” structure, which, when played out, could lead BTC to hit $63,000 in the foreseeable future: “$BTC is potentially breaking out of a massive bull flag that would technically send price to $63,000,” expressing optimism toward Bitcoin’s short-term price cycle.Speaking to Cointelegraph, Guy Hirsch, managing director for the U.S. at eToro social trading platform, said that there is capital rotation ongoing from Bitcoin to decentralized finance and other altcoins. The market has become full risk-on, as DeFi-related tokens rally by 30%–100% on a single day. The appetite for altcoins, which are seen as higher-risk higher-return bets, has caused the momentum of Bitcoin to slow down.Hirsch noted, however, that the long-term sentiment for Bitcoin is still bullish. He explained that Bitcoin was range-bound for a while, which means that it was trading in a tight range. This would change if Bitcoin price secures at over $40,000, Hirsch said, as it would cause the interest in Bitcoin to spike in a short period. Based on the options market data, Hirsch said there is a lot of open interest at $52,000 and $56,000, which Bitcoin could be headed to next. He added:Bitcoin stagnated throughout the past week as the decentralized finance market outperformed major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ether (ETH). Hirsch said that many investors, including institutions, saw opportunities for higher-gain plays in the DeFi market. Consequently, he said that profits from Bitcoin rotated into altcoins, prompting an “alt season.” However, in the long term, Hirsch thinks that the profits would likely cycle back into Bitcoin, explaining:Investors, researchers and strategists at Bequant, LMAX Digital and CrossTower told Cointelegraph that they expect Bitcoin will likely successfully rally above $40,000 just like the explosive increase in demand in December 2020. They believe that the recent consolidation of Bitcoin does not show weakness in its price trend.Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Bequant crypto trading and brokerage platform, said that BTC staying below $38,000 for a long period showed “efficient price discovery,” which in the past led to a “sharp reversal due to lack of price information."" He further added that once the $40,000 level breaks, what happens next will be hard to predict:Chad Steinglass, head of trading at CrossTower crypto investment platform, said that after Bitcoin surpasses $40,000, it will see an explosive upward movement. Bitcoin saw a similar scenario play out in December 2020, when it struggled to break out of $30,000. As soon as it did, it saw a rather quick move to its $42,000 all-time high. According to him:Joel Kruger, a cryptocurrency strategist at institutional crypto exchange LMAX Digital, believes that Bitcoin could rally to the $40,000 level, which would present a more “meaningful” resistance area. He noted that the “current price action is indicative of consolidation in the aftermath of a significant rally,” emphasizing that the consolidation has been healthy for Bitcoin.Related: r/Wallstreetbets vs. Wall Street: A prelude to DeFi bursting onto the scene?However, he was more cautious in predicting the continuation of an upward movement of Bitcoin after breaking the $40,000 mark, saying that “we don’t believe the market should be expecting a meaningful bullish continuation beyond $40,000 just yet.” According to him, the “weekly and monthly technical studies are still tracking in severe overbought territory,” which would suggest that BTC is entering risky territory."
434,"For years, institutional investors have been watching Bitcoin from afar with bewilderment and amusement, but with little to no participation. Although they were attracted by the high returns, they were scared away by Bitcoin’s infancy, lack of rules and the myriad headlines warning of hacks, bankruptcies and scams. In its early years, Bitcoin (BTC) lacked the on- and off-ramps required for most institutional investors, making it virtually impossible to get approved by any corporate investing mechanism.Related: Why institutions suddenly give a damn about BitcoinBut a strange thing happened in the rally of 2017. As institutions were saying it’s too risky at the corporate level, many of the insiders were buying Bitcoin personally in every way they could.They purchased Bitcoin through exchanges, Bitcoin ATMs and participation in initial coin offerings. Many of these individuals become passionate, even obsessive, about Bitcoin, and with them, Bitcoin began digging its roots into the financial world.During the bear market that followed the 2017 rally, a huge number of Bitcoin products were created and launched specifically for institutional investors. Publicly-traded Bitcoin mining companies started providing investors with exposure to the most fundamental part of the industry.Bitcoin holdings were securitized so that investors on major exchanges could freely speculate on Bitcoin’s price without setting up and using Bitcoin wallets. Companies started taking on debt to buy and hold Bitcoin because speculating the long term appreciation on Bitcoin is worth more than the interest on the debt.When Bitcoin fell and bounced off its approximately $4,000 low in March of 2020, the global COVID-19 pandemic was just getting started. Governments around the world largely followed the same strategy — lock people down and print more money. Lockdowns, quantitative easing and fiscal stimulus were normalized before markets could fully digest what was happening.Markets became inefficient pricing mechanisms not because participants were acting in bad faith but because participants were acting only on faith — on faith that things couldn’t continue like this for much longer.As cash came in daily, the market reacted almost daily without looking for valuable parking spots for their capital. The market was competing with itself on how much and how fast capital could be parked. What does a logical person invest in as nearly every economy and industry in the world shrinks and world equity prices are soaring to record highs?Related: How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the crypto space? Experts answerThis time, everything was already in place for investors when they began to pay attention again. There were securitized products, on/off ramps, precedence, experience and many passionate supporters inside major institutions. Most important of all were the on/off ramps. For the first time in cryptocurrency’s history, investors were able to use their normal tools and exchanges to invest in Bitcoin safely, easily and without any special approval. With proper mechanisms in place, companies and investors did what most investors should do: buy and hold.In the real world, the simplest solutions are usually the best. This makes intuitive sense as it seems to embrace other seemingly natural laws of life, such as the 80/20 rule or the inevitability of death and taxes.This is true in Bitcoin as well. While there are many ways to make large amounts of money off Bitcoin, mining, day trading, speculating, etc., for most people around the world, regardless of who or where they are, the best investment strategy has simply been to buy and hold Bitcoin.The reason for this is clear: Anybody can buy and hold Bitcoin, but almost nobody can beat the market forever. The industry is simply growing at such a tremendous pace that no one can keep track of everything that is happening now, let alone forecast the future. You have to live and breathe crypto for a chance at beating the market odds. Even so, we have seen true legends in this space completely wiped out by thinking they can do better than just holding their Bitcoin.Related: Did Bitcoin prove itself to be a reliable store of value in 2020? Experts answerIn the history of Bitcoin, mining has been the clear exception to the rule of “buy and hold.” If you can create a scenario with the optimal blend of cheap energy and efficient mining hardware, Bitcoin mining will be a profitable activity in almost any economic scenario and at any Bitcoin price point.Related: Is Bitcoin a waste of energy? Pros and cons of Bitcoin miningTo prove this, we ran an opportunity-cost comparison with buying Bitcoin or buying a Bitcoin miner the day it was announced from Bitmain, operating it at $0.06 and selling enough Bitcoin to pay your electricity bills.In every scenario, you end up with more Bitcoin from mining than holding.This one simple economic incentive has in just seven years bootstrapped the Bitcoin mining industry into a $5-billion industry today; done right, mining is one of the most predictable and safe ways to turn your Bitcoin into more Bitcoin.Of course, “done right” assumes one very important thing: that you will reliably and consistently operate this equipment. This is often a lot easier said than done. Bitcoin mining can be highly technical: the equipment is sparse and highly varied in its quality, performance and condition. Also, like any piece of equipment, it needs the right operating environment and skilled operators and systems to run well and cost-efficiently.From the network’s perspective, Bitcoin doesn’t care how well or cost-effectively you mine. One terahash coming from a desert is equally valuable and indistinguishable from one terahash coming from snowy Quebec. But you as the owner will surely notice the cost difference on your bottom line, one thing is for sure: No one is in the mining business because they want less Bitcoin.It doesn’t take a genius to make money mining in a bull market, however, it does take a genius to plan for and survive a bear market. When we brought Bitfarms to the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2018, we were surrounded by a number of large peers, most of whom did not survive to this point. Those of us who did survive the bear market have come out stronger, more experienced and better operators with operations and equipment ready to capitalize on the 2021 Bitcoin rally and survive whatever market that follows it.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

435,"Ether (ETH) led the market higher as it trekked toward another new all-time high at $1,763. ETH CME futures are scheduled to launch on Feb. 9, leading many analysts to predict that the top-ranked altcoin will hit $2,000 before meeting any significant resistance. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows Ether currently trades at $1,714, an increase of 3.27% on the 24-hour chart while Bitcoin (BTC) is up 0.21% and trading at $37,633.Gas fees on the Ethereum network also set a new all-time high this week with the average transaction cost reaching $17.5 on Feb. 3, which prompted some exchanges to halt ETH and ERC-20 withdrawals.On Feb.4 Yearn Finance (YFI) underwent an exploit which saw a hacker drain $11 million worth of DAI stablecoin from the version 1 DAI yield vault. The team has responded quickly by taking several steps to help mitigate the damage of the attack.These included Tether freezing $1.7 million in stolen funds which will be returned to the project and a proposal from the MakerDAO community to create a purpose-built collateralized debt position (CDP) to make affected users whole.Positive news came from Protego, a Washington-based institutional crypto custodian, who announced that it has become the second crypto-native firm to receive national licensing from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.Stocks rose on Friday as U.S. lawmakers passed a key hurdle in the rollout of the next stimulus package which could see individuals making less than $50,000 per year get a $1,400 stimulus check.A majority of the major indices finished the day in the green, with the S&P 500, Dow and NASDAQ closing the day up 0.39%, 0.30% and 0.57% respectively. Silver also saw a gain of 2.82% and closed the day at $26.98.As Bitcoin trades in a range between $36,000 and $38,000, altcoins are gaining momentum and multiple coins saw their prices breakout on Friday.MakerDAO (MKR) gained another 45% to establish a new all-time high of $3,099 before correcting to $2,810, while the DeFi infrastructure protocol 0x (ZRX) has seen its price rise 61% to $1.63.Notable performers from the larger cap altcoins were Cardano (ADA), which is up 26.44%, and Binance Coin (BNB) which reached a new all-time high at $64.87The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.17 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 60.1%."
436,"A number of entities have called Bitcoin (BTC) a bubble since its inception roughly 12 years ago. Michael Wu, CEO of digital asset financial services outfit Amber Group, thinks otherwise, however. “I think it’s always like this when people come into a new paradigm shift,” Wu said in a CNBC interview on Thursday, referring to the concept of Bitcoin as a bubble. “People start with doubts, with skepticism — it’s very natural because they will have to take time to understand what’s new there, is it sustainable,” he said, adding:References to large mainstream players buying Bitcoin has become much more common in recent months. Microstrategy allocated more than $1 billion to Bitcoin in 2020. MassMutual put $100 million into BTC sometime thereafter, and Square later came in as welwith $50 million.Rationale for Bitcoin’s long-term price rise includes its limited supply matched with significant interest in the asset, Wu explained. “There will be price volatility, there will be short-term price corrections,” he added. “Sometimes these price corrections can be violent, but I think we’ve passed the stage of calling Bitcoin a bubble anymore.”Wu also commented on BTC and its store of value role, similar to gold. Bitcoin has seen its fair share of comparisons against gold over the years. “The worst case scenario of Bitcoin is still a better form of gold,” he said.On Wednesday, Wu’s company Amber Group announced that Annabelle Huang, one of the firm’s partners, had been given the task of furthering institutional and retail involvement. Amber Group “appointed partner, Annabelle Huang, to lead GlobalX Center, a strategic global expansion team established to grow the company’s institutional and retail product offerings in regions including South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei, North America and more,” said a statement provided to Cointelegraph."
437,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) correction from its January high has not shaken the confidence of institutional investors. According to Glassnode analysts, the number of whales holding more than 1,000 Bitcoin has increased by 200 this year.Along with the institutions, several high profile investors have also committed money to the crypto sector. Hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones, former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi, and American rapper LL Cool J have invested in a new venture capital crypto fund launched by Silver Lake Partners co-founder Glenn Hutchins and his associates.The steady inflow into crypto assets suggests that investors are bullish in the long-term. ARK analyst Yassine Elmandjra believes that Bitcoin is still in the early stages of its bull phase. According to Elmandjra, if Bitcoin mimics its previous two bull runs, it could rally to about $390,000 before the current bull phase ends.Even though Bitcoin’s price action attracts the bulk of the attention, several altcoins have been rallying higher. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies and determine their target objectives on the upside.Bitcoin has been facing resistance at the $38,000 level for the past two days, but the shallow correction on Feb. 4 suggests traders are not closing their positions and are buying on any minor dip. This increases the possibility of a break above $38,000.There is a minor resistance at $40,000, but if the bulls can drive the price above it, the BTC/USD pair could retest the all-time high at $41,959.63.The bears are likely to defend this level aggressively but if the bulls do not give up much ground, it increases the likelihood of the resumption of the uptrend.The next resistance on the upside is $50,000 and then $60,000. The 20-day exponential moving average ($34,625) has turned up and the relative strength index (RSI) has climbed above 61, suggesting the bulls are back in command.However, if the price turns down from the current levels, the pair may drop to the 20-day EMA. If the pair rebounds strongly from this level, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend.On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below the moving averages, the pair may consolidate between $28,850 and $38,000 for a few more days.Ether (ETH) picked up momentum after breaking out to a new all-time high on Feb. 2. There was some hesitation near the $1,675 overhead resistance but the bears could not even pull the price down to the breakout level at $1,473.096.The shallow correction on Feb. 4 shows traders are in no mood to book profits as they anticipate the uptrend to extend further. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, indicating that the bulls are in control. The next target on the upside is $2,000.This positive view will invalidate if the ETH/USD pair turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($1,385). Such a move will suggest aggressive profit-booking at higher levels and may result in a deeper correction to the 50-day simple moving average ($1,087).XRP rebounded off the moving averages on Feb. 2, which suggests the selling pressure has reduced and the bulls are accumulating at lower levels. However, the bulls may not get an easy ride higher as the bears will try to stall the current rally at $0.50.If the price turns down from $0.50, the XRP/USD pair could again drop to $0.3855 and consolidate between these two levels for a few days.However, the 20-day EMA ($0.35) has started to turn up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating an advantage to the bulls. If the bulls can push and sustain the price above $0.50, the pair could rise to $0.60 and then to $0.75.Polkadot (DOT) surged and closed above the $19.40 resistance on Feb. 3, indicating the resumption of the uptrend. The bears attempted to drag the price back below $19.40 on Feb. 4 but the bulls defended the level aggressively.The bulls have flipped $19.40 into support and this level could now act as a launchpad for the next leg of the uptrend. If the DOT/USD pair can ascend $21,7321, the next level to watch out for is $24.08 and then $30.This bullish view will be negated if the bears sink and sustain the price below $18.50. Such a move will suggest the current breakout was a bull trap and the pair could then remain range-bound between $14.7259 and $19.40.Cardano (ADA) has soared above the ascending channel today, which suggests a pick-up in momentum. If the bulls can sustain the price above the channel, the altcoin could extend the rally to $0.60.However, the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight. They will try to stall the rally at the current levels and sink the ADA/USD pair back into the channel. If they succeed, it may trap the aggressive bulls and the price could dip to the 20-day EMA ($0.37).If the pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the bulls continue to buy at lower levels. On the contrary, if the bears can sink the price below the support line of the channel, it will indicate a possible change in trend.Chainlink (LINK) rose to a new all-time high on Feb. 4 but the bulls could not hold on to the breakout. The bears tried to trap the aggressive bulls by sinking the price below the downtrend line but the buyers were unwilling to relent.The long tail on the Feb. 4 candlestick showed the bulls continue to accumulate at lower levels. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 63 suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the LINK/USD pair closes above $25.8532, a move to $30 is likely.On the contrary, if the pair again closes below $25.8532, it will suggest that traders are booking profits at higher levels. A break below the 20-day EMA ($22) will be the first sign of weakness that could pull the price down to $20.1111.The correction on Feb. 4 shows the bears tried to sink Litecoin (LTC) back below the moving averages but failed. The bulls purchased the dip to the 20-day EMA ($140), which suggests a positive sentiment.If the buyers can now drive the price above the $159 to $166 overhead resistance zone, the LTC/USD pair could retest $185.5821. The bears may defend this level but if the bulls do not allow the price to dip back below $166, it will enhance the prospects of a rally to $200.This bullish view will invalidate if the pair turns down from the overhead resistance and drops below the moving averages. Such a move could drag the price down to $120.Binance Coin (BNB) resumed its up-move after breaking above $53 on Feb. 4. The bulls continued their buying today and pushed the price above the resistance line of the broadening wedge pattern, but the wick on the candlestick suggests the bears are selling at higher levels.If the BNB/USD pair turns down from the current levels but the bulls do not give up much ground, it will indicate strength. The bulls will then again try to resume the uptrend. A breakout and close above $60 will open the doors for a possible rally to $80.Although the indicators are positive, the RSI above 80 suggests the rally is overheated in the short-term. If the pair turns down from the current level and slips below $52, it could result in a drop to the 20-day EMA ($46).Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is struggling to rise above the $450 to $465.02 overhead resistance zone, which suggests the bears are defending this region aggressively. However, the selling dries up at lower levels because the bears have not succeeded in sinking the price below the 50-day SMA ($414) support.The flat 20-day EMA ($430.99) and the RSI near the midpoint does not give a clear advantage to either the bulls or the bears.If the price rises from the current levels, the bulls will again try to propel the BCH/USD pair above $465.02. If they succeed, a rally to $515.35 and then to $539 is possible.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA, the pair could drop to the next support at $370 and then to $353.Stellar Lumens (XLM) has been trading between $0.325 and $0.35 for the past four days. A tight consolidation near an overhead resistance signals strength and usually results in an upside breakout.If the bulls can push and sustain the price above $0.35, the XLM/USD pair could rally to $0.409. The bears may again offer a stiff resistance at this level, but if the bulls can bulldoze their way higher, the pair may rally to $0.50.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below $0.325, a drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.30) is likely. A strong bounce will suggest a bullish sentiment, but a break below it could drag the pair down to $0.26.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

438,"Largest altcoin Ether (ETH) built on its recent all-time highs on Feb. 5 to climb ever closer to $2,000.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView showed a fresh breakout occurring for ETH/USD during Friday trading. At the time of writing, Ether was targeting $1,750 as 6.5% daily gains topped weekly returns of nearly 22%.The move came on the back of intense trading interest in DeFi coins, many of which use the Ethereum network as their basis. DeFi produced many of the best movers on weekly timeframes.Ether meanwhile had already seen brisk upside as anticipation built over the launch of dedicated futures from CME Group, one of the pioneering Bitcoin futures operators. Asset management giant Grayscale began buying ETH for its Ether Trust again this week after a near two-month break.While some well-known cryptocurrency figures, including Gemini exchange co-founder Tyler Winklevoss, celebrated price performance, the highs were accompanied by another record — transaction fees. As Cointelegraph reported, gas fees on the Ethereum network became so high this week that some exchanges were forced to halt ETH withdrawals altogether.""This is a legit crisis. Going to have to stock up on popcorn to see how Ethereum digs its way out of this,"" Blockstream developer Grubles commented.According to data from YCharts, the average ETH fee was $23.27 on Feb. 4, the latest date for which statistics were available.While Bitcoin (BTC) meanwhile simmered below $40,000, macro conditions appeared apt to fuel fresh upside for BTC/USD. As the S&P 500 hit its own all-time highs on Friday, so the U.S. dollar currency index drop, a phenomenon which traditionally implies that Bitcoin will benefit.""Correlation is not causation, but the trend is quite clear: #Bitcoin’s meteoric price rise (and occasional crashes) correlates closely with movements of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY),"" data analytics service Kaiko wrote about the phenomenon this week."
439,"Was last week’s Reddit versus Wall Street stand-off really the “beginning of the end for centralized finance,” as Gemini founder Tyler Winklevoss described it? Or was it just a one-time instance of individuals coming together to right a perceived wrong — with no long-term economic consequences?As GameStop, a struggling videogame retailer, came under attack by hedge-fund short sellers, a coalition of individuals spearheaded by r/Wallstreetbets, a Reddit forum, jumped in to save GameStop by buying its shares, driving its stock price from $20 to as high as $483 — and doing some real damage to short traders in the bargain.But then Robinhood, the insurgents’ trading platform of choice, suspended purchases of GameStop’s GME stock and seven other stocks. The Redditors cried foul, asserting that Robinhood had caved in to the hedge funds and other entrenched Wall Street interests. Robinhood, for its part, explained that it was forced to suspend GME purchases or it would have run out of cash to cover the transactions.However, more than 30 class-action lawsuits were filed against the centralized trading platform — one complaint arguing that the suspension was just what “the [GME-shorting] hedge funds wanted,” and another even declaring that “Robinhood stole from the poor to give to the rich.”Others implied that this sort of chicanery wouldn’t have occurred in a decentralized financial world. Along those lines, Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz called the GME flare-up a “giant endorsement of DEFI,” and one crypto user, who wanted to remain anonymous, told Cointelegraph: “Restricting individuals from buying a selected stock is a form of a centralized control mechanism. In a decentralized trading market, no one would have that power.”This view wasn’t unanimous, though. Quantum Economics co-founder Mati Greenspan found little to applaud in the crowd-sourced purchasing of GameStop stock: “The narrative that Main Street was finally able to beat Wall Street at its own game is extremely misguided,” as according to him, “there were hedge funds on both sides of this trade.” He went on to add: “It’s hard to see how buying overpriced shares of a company that’s losing money will make the world a better place.”With that as a backdrop, here’s a deeper dive into what lessons, if any, could be drawn from the r/Wallstreetbets vs. the suits showdown. For instance, if retail investors can now move stock prices, then surely they can move large-cap cryptocurrency prices, no?“The events around GME and Robinhood were a wakeup call for the broader public,” Alexei Zamyatin, co-founder and CEO at Interlay — a research and development company focusing on blockchain interoperability — told Cointelegraph, adding: “I doubt most people outside of finance/banking were aware that Robinhood’s main customers were hedge funds rather than retail users.”“I’m not entirely sure I agree that the recent GME saga has proven that retail investors can meaningfully coordinate to move stocks in the long run,” George Giaglis, executive director at the Institute for the Future at the University of Nicosia, told Cointelegraph. “I see this more as evidence of late-stage market-topping rather than a new wave of sustainable retail-driven market domination as many commenters would like to portray it,” he added.Kaj Burchardi, head of BCG Platinion Netherlands — a division of Boston Consulting Group — told Cointelegraph: “In theory, a joint retail crowd can move many assets,” including crypto prices — but of course, that depends on the size of the crowd. The Reddit r/Wallstreetbets forum reportedly mobilized thousands of individual investors to purchase GameStop shares. “Overall, I think the number of retail investors will grow in the crypto space — independent if they join forces similar to the GameStop example,” said Burchardi.Historically, retail investors — not institutions — have driven crypto prices, Lex Sokolin, chief marketing officer and global fintech co-head at ConsenSys, told Cointelegraph, adding:But what about the respective parties in last week’s scrap. Dallas Mavericks’ owner Mark Cuban suggested that “the old-school investment community is currently taking a kicking from what he describes as the ‘Store of Value Generation.’” Is it indeed a conflict between the young and old?According to Sokolin: “We saw not just a generational struggle but a philosophical one.” Furthermore, as the information gap has now shrunk, internet-native investors are now more capable of rivaling professional investors: “They can self-organize and vote with their money, which, in aggregate, can rival the billions in high finance.” William Knottenbelt, a professor at Imperial College London’s department of computing, told Cointelegraph:Along these lines, “DeFi shows strong potential when it comes to protecting and enhancing certain freedoms,” continued Knottenbelt, “but it is not immune to some kinds of ethically dubious activities that also manifest in more centralized systems.”Meanwhile, according to Burchardi, “it is a centralized vs. decentralized struggle,” which may correlate with age, but not necessarily. “For instance, in just one year, we saw the value of DeFi move from close to zero to $25 billion-plus of locked capital. This growth is decentralized and often community-driven.”If individual investors didn’t demonstrate their clout conclusively, then what about social media? Did platforms like Reddit serve notice that they are now a force with which to be reckoned in the financial realm? Sokolin told Cointelegraph: “We witnessed the power of social media, and powerful emotions tip over the financial games of the past. Crypto already embodies this ethos, as many assets are valued by the community, not by analysts.”Mati Greenspan, writing in his newsletter, agreed: “One lesson that the world seems to have learned is that social media can be a leading indicator, and even a driving force, for future price movements.”As for decentralized finance, did it get a boost from the outcry when Robinhood suspended buying of GME? “These developments, in my opinion, will definitely drive adoption,” Zamyatin told Cointelegraph. “DeFi builders are in the spotlight now, and it will be up to us to onboard non-crypto users and to showcase the positive potential of a decentralized financial system.”Giaglis told Cointelegraph: “DeFi is today where Bitcoin was in 2013 or 2015: a few early adopters are seeing the potential, while the mass market has yet to realize how disruptive this will be to traditional finance.” He agreed that last week’s events would probably accelerate acceptance.“Americans learned the limits of their market structure,” added Sokolin. “It’s not that Robinhood removed the button. It’s that they have to clear with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, and trades take T+2 [trade date plus two days] to settle, and volatility forced their collateral requirements to go up 10 times.” DeFi’s programmatic markets presumably would have escaped this fate because they are transacted in real-time and open 24 hours, seven days a week.Are decentralized exchanges even ready for mass markets? Could they handle the volume of last week’s r/Wallstreetbets’ action without crashing? “Today these decentralized markets are still small and not always enterprise-grade,” Burchardi told Cointelegraph, adding: “They would have big challenges to handle these volumes — at least in their current versions.”Moreover, decentralized exchanges aren’t even wholly decentralized and could be subject to manipulation, noted Zamyatin in a recent blog post. A DEX’s administrative account could upgrade contracts or halt operations, which means “our [proverbial] hedge fund need only get in touch with the person/group in control of this account, apply some pressure or offer a lucrative bribe — and trading can at least be slowed down.”Nor is Ethereum, the platform that hosts most DeFi projects, completely decentralized. Three mining pools control more than 50% of Ethereum’s hash rate, noted Zamyatin, and “we don’t really know who controls these pools in the background” if they were to collude. “We’re still not quite there from a technical perspective, and market manipulation is still possible — yet arguably, it is more difficult than on centralized platforms,” Zamyatin told Cointelegraph.Furthermore, since Ethereum houses most of the DeFi projects on the network, as demand for transactions rises, so do the gas fees, and at some point, they may become too expensive, very quickly.Maybe last week’s events will be viewed one day as DeFi’s Boston Tea Party moment when American colonists disguised as Mohawk Indians dumped 342 chests of tea into Boston Harbor to protest British rule — a seemingly irrational act, but one seen now as a precursor to the American Revolution.“We will remember this as another instance of short-term mass hysteria and FOMO dynamics that propelled some assets to valuations that had nothing to do with their underlying fundamental values before reverting to fairer prices,” observed Giaglis, adding:Burchardi agreed that a significant movement toward decentralized finance was now underway but added that two key points still needed to be resolved to ensure future growth: “How can you make DeFi more convenient? And when and how does it get regulated? The answers to these questions will determine how DeFi progresses.”All in all, last week’s event may have split the crypto community, with no clear generational or retailer/institutional clarity, but it arguably alerted the greater investing public to some of the flaws of the current system — a sort of “teaching moment” for decentralized finance, as it were.In any case, it behooves the blockchain and crypto community to make sure its technologies, security and protocols are in order for the day when the larger public rushes in to use its markets."
440,"The recent vow by United States Senate leader Chuck Schumer to end federal prohibition of cannabis could have knock-on effects for Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider cryptocurrency industry.Schumer and fellow Democratic senators Ron Wyden and Cory Booker released a joint statement on Feb. 1, declaring their intention to comprehensively reform federal cannabis legislation. The statement noted the disproportionate impact of the war on drugs on people of color. It stated:Even in states where cannabis is legal, dispensary owners have still been forced to operate outside the traditional banking sphere. Federal prohibition has so far meant that most banks have been unwilling to risk doing business with cannabis stores, effectively forcing owners to run a cash business.Cryptocurrency and cannabis, particularly in relation to legalization in the United States, both came of age in the same decade. Both have traditionally faced many of the same difficulties in gaining social acceptance, whether from lawmakers and regulators, or even the general public.Perhaps it should be no surprise that cryptocurrency projects stepped in to fill the void the banks had left in the legal cannabis industry. As well as giving birth to numerous marijuana-inspired cryptocurrency tokens, and seeing blockchain technology used to shake up the seed-to-sale supply chain, the emergence of crypto in the cannabis industry also gave dispensary owners an alternative to cash payments, and a way to store wealth.But if cannabis really were to be legalized at the federal level, what would happen to the burgeoning relationship between weed and crypto? Would cryptocurrency effectively be robbed of a use case?Michael Wagner, the CEO of Multichain Ventures, which provides blockchain payment solutions for the cannabis industry, told Cointelegraph it was possible that acceptance from normal banks could negate the need for business owners to use cryptocurrency. Wagner said:However, the impact of such an occurrence probably wouldn’t make itself felt, says Wagner, who says the lack of legal clarity around crypto has made it difficult for cannabis users to get on board so far.“It has been my experience, in countless conversations with cannabis operators, that cryptocurrency is not widely adopted despite the friction present in financial services today. A lack of clarity surrounding legality of crypto, as well as understanding of the technology, produced a considerable barrier to entry.""The drive to produce a digital payment system for the cannabis industry, which saw Multichain Ventures work alongside the State of Nevada on a blockchain-based pilot, is an example of an attempt to break down that barrier, says Wagner.But regardless of cannabis’ legal status, Wagner says using cryptocurrency comes with its own benefits, beyond simply being a means of storing wealth.“Further, our internal thesis has been, and continues to be, that decentralized financial ecosystems provide substantial utility on their own […] To that end, while traditional banking would open up competitors, the innovation that is cryptocurrency continues to be superior in virtually every way. Faster and cheaper transactions. Greater transparency.""Wagner says he supports calls for cannabis legalization and believes cryptocurrency will carve a path for itself no matter what:The legal cannabis industry was estimated to be worth around $20 billion globally in 2020, even amid the COVID-19 lockdown. For context, the value of the cannabis sold on the black market is estimated to be more than 10 times as much.Senators Schumer, Wyden and Booker intend to release a reform discussion draft by early 2021. Numerous cannabis stocks rallied in the wake of their official statement."
441,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has risen above $38,000 after nearly 21 days below this level with the exception of the ""Elon Musk"" rally last week. There are four major factors that have coincided with the rebound in BTC price above this key level that could see Bitcoin have another go at $42,000.These factors include the neutral Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator, miner outflow decreasing, exchange netflow back into negative, and whale accumulation.According to the pseudonymous cryptocurrency trader “Bitcoin Jack,” Bitcoin is demonstrating a “cup and handle” technical formation.The technical formation typically indicates a trend reversal to the upside, which will be all but confirmed if Bitcoin follows up with a breakout in the short term.The trader also emphasized the negative exchange net flow from exchanges, which shows signs of a Bitcoin accumulation phase. Citing data from CryptoQuant, the trader wrote:Negative exchange net flow is an important metric because it shows that Bitcoin is moving out of exchanges.High-net-worth investors prefer to move Bitcoin out of exchanges after they accumulate it for security and self-custody reasons. When BTC is moved to a non-custodial wallet, no one would have access to it other than the owner of the private keys.Furthermore, analysts at Glassnode found that the number of whales holding Bitcoin has substantially increased so far this year. The combination of the negative net flow and the rise in whales show that the level of Bitcoin accumulation remains high. They wrote:The RSI of Bitcoin across many time frames has returned to around 50, which is neutral. The RSI is an indicator that measures whether an asset is overbought or oversold.If the RSI of Bitcoin exceeds 75, then it would be considered overbought; if it falls under 30, it is considered oversold.Although Bitcoin remains close to the overbought area on the daily and weekly time frames, which are high time frames, the RSI stands between 45 and 60 across most low time frame charts. This suggests that Bitcoin has upside potential in the near term.Bitcoin miners are one of the major sources of selling pressure on BTC because they represent unmatched selling pressure.As such, when miners begin selling the BTC they mine on exchanges, it can place significant pressure on the short-term price cycle of Bitcoin.According to data from CryptoQuant, the Miners’ Position Index (MPI) has been declining. At least in the foreseeable future, this means that the selling pressure coming from miners should be low."
442,"The recent surge of Bitcoin (BTC) price has driven notable growth in the amount of electricity consumed by Bitcoin miners, spurring another wave of argument in the community over the ecology of the seminal cryptocurrency.According to the latest data from Digiconomist’s Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, Bitcoin energy consumption has been at its highest historical levels since late 2020, with the estimated annual consumption level staying above 75 TWh for a record period of time.Bitcoin is now estimated to consume around 77.8 TWh per year, which is as much power as consumed by Chile. Bitcoin’s carbon footprint — the total greenhouse gas emissions caused by BTC mining activity — reportedly amounts to nearly 37 megatons of CO2 annually, comparable to that of New Zealand.As Bitcoin’s electricity consumption has exceeded “normal” levels since November, the crypto community remains divided over concerns about its carbon footprint.Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano and a co-founder of Ethereum, believes that Bitcoin is consuming an “unfathomable amount of electricity.” “The issue is, it can never get better by design,” Hoskinson told CNBC Friday, emphasizing that Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus will only make energy consumption grow further with time:Hoskinson said that the Cardano network consumes only 6 GWh of power as it relies on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism alongside other blockchains like Polkadot and Algorand.Some crypto community members believe that Bitcoin’s unique features are worth its energy consumption. CoinShares chief strategy Meltem Demirors hinted that Bitcoin’s energy consumption is a good use of energy:Demirors also noted that energy use in itself is not bad. “Sending and storing emails uses energy. Yet, we don’t infer email to be bad because it consumes energy,” she said.Despite Bitcoin’s growing energy use, it still consumes less energy than that wasted on inactive home appliances in the United States, according to Michel Rauchs, research affiliate at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. The amount of energy wasted on idle home devices like microwaves in the U.S. could power the Bitcoin network for two years, Rauchs said."
443,"Bitcoin (BTC) could reach almost $400,000 this bull cycle simply by copying previous behavior, one popular analyst has said.In a tweet on Feb. 4, Yassine Elmandjra, cryptoasset analyst at asset manager ARK, revealed just how early on in its current bull run BTC/USD really is.Compared to 2013 and 2017, the 2020-21 cycle is barely off the start line, with a hypothetical chart suggesting that the top this time around could be as high as $390,000.“This is how bitcoin’s price would behave if the current bull market dwarfed the 2017 bull market in the same way the 2017 bull market dwarfed the 2013 bull market,” Elmandjra added in comments.With various indicators all now pointing to a continuation of bullish upside for Bitcoin, Elmandjra is not alone in predicting serious progress in the mid to long term. Responding, however, fellow analyst Tuur Demeester noted that in terms of increases, 2013 in fact beat 2017.The true “power” of the latest bull run thus depends on various factors, with other recent comparative data suggesting that this year ranks exactly between the two previous examples.Elmandjra confirmed that a $390,000 price would correspond to a Bitcoin market cap of around $8 trillion — roughly 80% of that of gold. As Cointelegraph reported, estimates suggest that in real terms, Bitcoin has so far cornered just 2% of that amount.Focusing on the immediate future, however, well-known figures are primed for a price continuation to begin imminently.Thanks to a combination of declining U.S. dollar strength, corporate interest and consolidating $30,000 support, it may not be long before bulls return to the driving seat.Commenting on Tuesday, investor Dan Tapeiro highlighted Bitcoin’s moving average convergence divergence (MACD) as the latest metric to flip.“Oh boy! Looking like consolidation over in #Bitcoin,” he tweeted.Tapeiro also anticipated heavy interest from institutions as a result of a dedicated conference by MicroStrategy, the company which now holds over 70,000 BTC. Over 1,400 executives attended the event this week, with CEO Michael Saylor likewise predicting that buy-ins would accelerate this year."
444,"Twitter founder and CEO Jack Dorsey has fired up his own Bitcoin (BTC) node. On Feb. 5, the tech billionaire posted a screenshot of the Bitcoin node software Bitcoind running on his computer, meaning Dorsey now lends a hand in validating Bitcoin transactions.Dorsey posted the screenshot along with the words, “Running #bitcoin”. The photo shows Dorsey’s computer in the midst of synchronizing with the Bitcoin blockchain, which requires that a user download the entire history of the chain to date. The Bitcoin blockchain is around 325GB in size at time of writing.Running #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/W51ga3yrKbThe synchronization process can take weeks depending on the computer and internet speed, and Dorsey’s screenshot shows that he’s only managed to synch up 2% of the chain so far.When asked if he was running the node on a dedicated Raspberry Pi, Dorsey revealed he had set it up using an M1 Macbook chip — the latest in Apple’s line of laptop processors. Dorsey tweeted, “Starting from a scratch build on M1 first.”Bitcoin nodes are different from Bitcoin miners in that they don’t compete for a share of the block rewards. Rather, each node hosts yet another immutable copy of the blockchain, helping increase overall network security. The number of full Bitcoin nodes in operation has fluctuated of late, landing somewhere between 7,000 and 11,000, according to recent data.Bitcoin’s node-count recently surged to an all-time high. As reported by Cointelegraph, 11,613 Bitcoin nodes were in operation on Jan. 20. That number had dropped to 7,260 by time of writing."
445,"Several DeFi tokens saw their prices breakout on Feb. 4 as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) prices traded sideways for the day. Aside from the general bullish trend permeating the DeFi sector, positive comments from big-name investors touting the benefits of blockchain technology and DeFi appear to be lifting sentiment throughout the sector.Currently, Bitcoin price is still struggling to reclaim the $38,000 level and according to Cointelegraph analyst Marcel Pechman, top traders may have added to their short positions as BTC rallied toward $38,000 on Feb. 3.Elon Musk made waves again as his “DOGE” tweet resulted in a sharp volume spike which sent Dogecoin (DOGE) into a 48% rally to $0.054. XRP price also broke out, rallying 12.45% to a daily high at $0.4365.Universal Market Access (UMA) saw its price explode by 158% to reach a new all-timeat $44.25 before correcting to its current value of $33.13. Decentralized exchange liquidity provider 0x (ZRX) also spiked 70% to a new 2021 high at $1.35.DeFi lending platforms AAVE, Compound (COMP) and Maker (MKR) all established new all-time highs as their prices have spiked 46.68%, 36.6% and 22.69% respectively.Traditional markets also caught a boost as stocks saw their fourth straight day of gains led by tech stocks like eBay (EBAY), which saw its price increase by 5%, and PayPal (PYPL) whose shares rallied 7%.The S&P 500, Dow and NASDAQ all closed the day well into the green, up 1.09%, 1.08% and 1.23% respectively.Increased attention from business leaders like Mark Cuban and institutions such as Grayscale Investments has brought increased attention to the crypto sector and also highlights the rapidly increasing involvement of traditional finance in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.With MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor offering a ‘Bitcoin Bootcamp’ to more than 1,400 publicly traded companies over the past 2 days, the recent price movements and increased trading volume seen today could be the start of wider adoption and increased inflows into Bitcoin and the emerging DeFi ecosystem.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.13 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 60.9%."
446,"After bouncing from the recent short-term low, Bitcoin (BTC) price posted a 15% gain over three days as it climbed from $32,400 to $37,200. This was an impressive move given that BTC price had been trading in a sideways range for weeks and regardless of the reasons behind the surge, one would expect large traders and arbitrage desks to follow the trend.Interestingly, this is not the case as many of the top traders opened short positions as BTC commenced its 15% move. Even if a trader lacks confidence in a potential retest of the $42,000 all-time high, opening shorts while Ether (ETH) blasts through $1,600 seems risky.Take notice of how both leading cryptocurrencies tend to trade in tandem most of the time even though investors could be rotating from BTC to Ether due to its role in decentralized finance, explosive price appreciation, and the allure of Eth2 staking.Data from TheTie, an alternative social analytics firm, also found that Google searches for ""buy crypto"" had recently hit an all-time high. According to the same source, there's been a 135% surge in cryptocurrency social media activity over the past three months.Adding to this bullish scenario, global payments giant, Visa announced that it is aggressively pursuing cryptocurrency partnerships, including debit cards and digital banks.Lastly, a recent 15,200 BTC ($515 million) outflow at Coinbase was deemed a 'bullish signal' by analysts at CryptoQuant. According to CryptoQuant, the outflow indicates an ""OTC deal from institutional investors"" who are possibly accumulating BTC into cold wallets.These bullish signals contrast with the exchange-provided traders' long-to-short net positioning. This indicator is calculated by analyzing the client's consolidated position on the spot, perpetual and futures contracts and it provides a clearer view of whether professional traders are leaning bullish or bearish.With this in mind, there are occasional discrepancies in the methodologies between different exchanges, so viewers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.Over the past three days, top traders at every exchange analyzed have increased their shorts. Even though large traders, market makers, and arbitrage desks may hold positions in their cold wallets or Grayscale GBTC funds, the long-to-short ratio shows that there is a lack of confidence on whether BTC will push through $38,000 and pursue the $40,000 level in the short term.Moreover, the recent outperformance by Ether could have been fueled by top traders reducing BTC exposure. This makes even more sense considering the upcoming CME ETH listing is on Feb. 8. It’s only natural that there would be a surge in appetite among institutional investors.Top traders could have also moved their BTC off exchange in search of better yield opportunities, so assuming that they’ve all entered short positions is a hasty conclusion.If these top traders did enter BTC short positions, there would be signs on derivatives markets. To disprove this theory, Friday's $1 billion options expiry still favors bulls, who at the moment have many incentives to push the price above $40,000.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

447,"The taxation of cryptocurrency is no longer just a young person’s problem. That changed the day the United States Internal Revenue Service made cryptocurrency a focal point of enforcement and added a crypto disclosure question on its Form 1040. Unsuspecting parents with dependent children should be on guard. The IRS is looking for noncompliance, and crypto questions create a possibly perjurious trap. Noncompliance may be sleeping in the basements of many unwary parents.As of October 2019, nearly 40 million Americans own some form of cryptocurrency, and the average account value is over $5,000. And Google Analytics data shows that over 40% of all crypto owners over the age of 18 are millennials, and nearly 17% are recently out of high school. It is the latter group that should concern parents. Those numbers equate to millions of crypto owners being college-aged or younger. This creates a potential “crypto trap” for parents who claim crypto-savvy young persons as dependents on their tax returns.Related: Crypto could save millennials from the economy that failed themMost parents claim their children under 18 as dependents, and some claim their children in college. Parents should use extra caution this tax filing season, as they may be stepping into an inadvertent nondisclosure and nonreporting of crypto “kiddie” income.Over the last two years, the IRS has launched a campaign to snuff out crypto tax noncompliance. It is estimated that crypto users account for a $25-billion tax gap. And because cryptocurrency is taxed as “property,” unearned income may arise when dependents are trading crypto or buying and selling goods with crypto.Related: Tax justice for crypto users: The immediate and compelling need for an amnesty programThe unsuspecting parent could have dependent children swapping crypto, trading crypto, buying and selling with crypto, and earning crypto from staking activities. In those instances, the dependent has both reportable capital transactions and unearned income — income that would be taxed at their parents’ marginal tax rate.Related: Better regulation needed to stop crypto tax evaders from running wildUnsuspecting parents, altogether unfamiliar with Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets, may never think to ask their children about crypto activities. It is easy to imagine a young person — under the shelter of their parents — engaging in crypto activities without telling Mom and Dad the details. It takes nothing more than a cell phone to do so. And why would young people? They are the least experienced group and the least likely to understand the tax consequences of cryptocurrency for themselves, much less their parents. It is difficult to imagine a young person coming to their parents at tax time and saying, “Hey, Mom and Dad, your CPA might want to know about my cryptocurrency at Kraken.” That is about as likely as Mom and Dad understanding decentralized finance, sidechains or crypto mining.But parents with dependents should quiz their children about crypto activities. Income is one big concern. The tax code imposes a “kiddie tax” on the unearned income of children who are under 19 (under 24, if a student). The current threshold is only $2,200. When a qualified child has unearned income in excess of $2,200, the kiddie tax may be applied to the excess at the parents' marginal tax rate instead of the child's tax rate. The kiddie tax is reportable on Form 8615, “Tax for Certain Children Who Have Unearned Income.” If a parent fails to report a dependent’s crypto capital gains in excess of $2,200, then the parent is omitting taxable income from their tax return.And a dependent child earning income is not hard to imagine. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has gone up nearly 300% in the past 12 months, and the second-most traded cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), is up 700% for the same time period. One may say that BTC and ETH are too rich for the young dependent, having spot prices of around $37,000 and $1,600, respectively, but consider others: Polkadot’s DOT, number three by market capitalization, is up over 300% since December, and its price is just $20. Cardano’s ADA, number six by market cap, rests at about $0.45, and it is also up 700% for the same time period. If Son or Daughter buys or sells goods with crypto, and the fair market value of those goods exceeds basis, then Mom and Dad may have a taxable transaction to be concerned with. By the end of it, parents may need to parentally control their child’s balance sheet.The IRS has done little to advise parents with dependent children of this compliance trap. Unknowing parents will likely stay the course at tax time, giving little thought to Bitcoin or altcoin headlines. Yet if their dependent child holds it, trades it, buys and sells with it, or earns it through staking or otherwise, parents could well be filing a false tax return. Upon audit, things could get even stickier. There is no indication that the IRS is going to be forgiving about crypto noncompliance. Again, there is a $25-billion tax gap to fill — large enough to be intolerant.Perhaps a bigger underlying problem lies in the cryptocurrency disclosure question on Form 1040. Here, too, unsuspecting parents may be in danger. The question asks:Ward Cleaver would certainly look to June Cleaver and say, “Of course we didn’t, honey,” without a thought to The Beaver.There is no guidance on what a “financial interest” means or how far it extends. If a parent is required to report the crypto income of their dependent, is that parent also required to answer “yes” to the cryptocurrency disclosure question? That question remains unanswered. But looking at it through the lens of current crypto tax enforcement policy, the answer gets murkier. The IRS may answer this question consistent with its overall crypto tax policy goals. It seeks to know about crypto positions, and it may not be satisfied only knowing obscure “kiddie” crypto income reported through an IRS Form 8615. The IRS may want to know more.If a parent takes “ownership” of a dependent child’s unearned income (for tax purposes), perhaps that same parent takes similar “ownership” of the crypto positions of his or her child (for disclosure purposes). After all, it is not the parent’s income they must report on IRS Form 8615, it is the child’s. It may not matter that the parent does not own the crypto account outright so long as the account is owned by their dependent child and the parent has knowledge of it. Knowledge is also a tricky complication. Presently, most crypto exchanges do not issue informational tax forms to users; rather, parents must rely on their children for answers.The policy reasons behind the kiddie tax may provide answers. The kiddie tax was implemented, in part, to close tax loopholes — that is, eliminate the retitling of investment property into the names of dependent children in an effort to avoid paying higher tax rates. Likewise, a similar policy argument could be made in relation to cryptocurrency disclosures. For example, if a parent were a large holder of cryptocurrency and an avid trader, they — without a disclosure obligation — could simply claim the accounts under the name of their child and avoid the crypto disclosure question entirely. That is, obscurely reporting the capital gains from crypto activities on Form 8615 but shielding the accounts from disclosure. It is unlikely the IRS would find such a tactic amenable.Unfortunately, a rhetorical question does not answer whether a parent must disclose their dependent child’s crypto accounts on Form 1040. Taxpayers are left guessing until more guidance is published or tax enforcement answers it. The idea that a parent would need to disclose the financial positions of a child is not a foreign one. Under the Bank Secrecy Act, minor children have a foreign bank account reporting, or FBAR, obligation if their foreign accounts meet certain thresholds. In that instance, if the child is unable to file the FBAR themself, the legal guardian or parent must file it for the child. If the Treasury Department expects disclosure assistance in one context, it is not difficult to see how they might expect it in another.Income and voluntary disclosures are at the forefront of the IRS’s crypto tax initiative, and both are potentially implicated by the kiddie tax and the 1040 crypto disclosure question. Parents need to remember that they sign tax returns under penalties of perjury.

448,"One of the most enduring cryptocurrency-related narratives revolves around the search of crypto’s definition as an asset class. Is Bitcoin (BTC) more of a digital currency or digital gold? Do its unique properties warrant viewing it as something completely distinct from the established categories of financial instruments? A recently published report by JPMorgan Chase’s strategists has sparked yet another round of such debates.The conclusions that the report presents are at odds with the “Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset” trope that has become somewhat conventional wisdom lately. The authors contend that the original cryptocurrency is actually not that great of a hedge in a situation when markets are undergoing severe stress and that expansion of retail ownership has rendered it more similar to a cyclical asset that moves up and down along with the stock market.It’s reasonable to discuss the argument of JPMorgan’s analysts with finance-savvy commentators to assess its strength, as well as to weigh in on what the recent developments in crypto markets can tell the general public about the nature of digital assets as a class.A good hedge asset should be resilient to the forces that can diminish the value of most other assets in an investor’s portfolio. The case of JPMorgan’s strategists against BTC’s hedging capacity seems to heavily rely on observations from the last year, when both crypto and traditional markets plummeted in March over the COVID-19 scare kicking in, only to start climbing to their respective record highs shortly thereafter.The argument presented in the report is also rife with assumptions. It presumes a very particular definition of a hedge asset that only takes into account a limited number of risks it safeguards against. Furthermore, it implies that cryptocurrencies behave more or less uniformly across various market conditions.Brock Pierce, chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, noted to Cointelegraph that as a maturing asset, Bitcoin’s behavior does not necessarily follow a rigid pattern in all situations: “I agree with them, in a sense, that it is not a ‘hedge asset’ because it’s been growing into what it can be.” He went on to add:Amber Ghaddar, founder of decentralized capital market AllianceBlock, who had previously held senior positions at JPMorgan, commented to Cointelegraph that “as a pure hedging asset and on shorter intra-month and intra-quarter timeframes, Bitcoin has been a poor hedge to acute market stress compared to the USD, CHF and JPY.” Therefore, she agrees with the assessment from JPMorgan: “This is due to the fact that Bitcoin lacks the short base that sponsors USD strength during market shocks.”However, Ghaddar added, this is not synonymous with BTC being unable to serve as a hedge to events like a destabilizing rise in inflation or a policy shock. To her, Bitcoin is best described as:Another point to note is that amid the black-swan, pandemic-induced market collapse of March 2020, nearly all liquid assets were highly correlated in their simultaneous decline. So this doesn’t necessarily mean that Bitcoin and stocks should demonstrate a similar relationship across the board, for example, between S&P 500 and BTC’s price.Seamus Donoghue, vice president for sales and business development at digital asset infrastructure provider Metaco, told Cointelegraph that in the wake of acute liquidity events, such as the stock market crash in March 2020, correlations for all assets trend toward 100%, and all kinds of assets get sold to raise liquidity. Furthermore, he questioned how the report only considers certain risks but not others:Konstantin Richter, CEO and founder of blockchain firm Blockdaemon, commented to Cointelegraph that aside from the largely exogenous shock from the pandemic in spring 2020, there hasn’t really been any adversarial conditions in the economy that would truly test crypto against other assets as a store of value hedge. Richter is convinced that once such a test will be applied, digital assets will outperform any competition.On the subject of whether Bitcoin is coming to resemble discretionary stocks that are doing well when the overall economy is thriving, those who shared their thoughts with Cointelegraph largely remained unconvinced. Ghaddar disagrees that “retail adoption is raising its correlation with cyclical assets.” In fact, she believes that it works the opposite way: “Most retail investors prefer to HODL (buy-and-hold) the Bitcoin. The same is not true for new institutional and speculative money that has recently been poured into Bitcoin.”Ghaddar also noted that the correlations observed by the authors of the report could be simply an artifact of a measurement tool they used. When applying Spearman’s correlation coefficient instead of the widely used Pearson’s coefficient, Ghaddar’s team did not observe crypto assets’ prices varying together with other asset classes significantly.Some even called JPMorgan’s motivation to reach the conclusions outlined in the report into question amid the rollout of the JPM Coin. Louisa Murray, vice president and head of sales at banking platform Railsbank, commented:At the end of the day, what is left in terms of the properties of crypto as an asset class? Pierce thinks that there is still much fluidity to Bitcoin’s status as a financial instrument, as he commented: “What we have learned about Bitcoin’s nature as an asset in the last year is: What it is, and what it can be, and how it will be able to affect people’s portfolios and investment decisions is evolving at a rapid pace.”There are also unique features that one can pinpoint with confidence. Bitcoin’s key advantages are faster settlement and a wider global exposure compared to any asset in the traditional financial market. Ultimately, cryptocurrencies now have a chance to develop key characteristics — such as means of payment — and not merely as the means of investment. In the long term, this can untangle them from traditional financial assets.Furthermore, Murray anticipates crypto becoming more regulated and accessible, which would reduce market volatility. With the younger generations investing their money differently, Murray expects to see “new cyclical patterns occurring in the future, possibly with markets following crypto, and not vice versa.”"
449,"Republican Rep. Tom Emmer has called for more precise tax guidelines regarding cryptocurrency earnings, after a report he commissioned from the Law Library of Congress showed a stark disparity between regulatory approaches taken by various tax authorities around the world.The 128-page study examines cryptocurrency tax laws in 31 nations, paying particular interest to their applications concerning coins and tokens earned through mining and staking. As the report notes, many countries have already established specific rules for coins earned through mining, but only five have laid down any guidance for would-be stakers.Of the 31 jurisdictions included in the study, only Australia, Switzerland, Finland, New Zealand and Norway were found to have addressed tax rules in regard to staking.Proof-of-stake, or PoS, is a consensus mechanism used by many blockchains as an alternative to the more energy-intensive proof-of-work pioneered by Bitcoin (BTC). The process is analogous to crypto mining, but instead of trying to amass the most computing power, PoS sees people “stake” their coins on the blockchain in return for a proportional share of the block rewards.The report also details tax guidance surrounding coins gained through airdrops and hard forks, where tokens are either given away for free or created as the result of the birth of a new blockchain. Only six countries mention airdrops or hard forks in their national tax guidelines: Finland, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore and the United Kingdom.Emmer said clearer guidance was needed from the Internal Revenue Service to avoid stifling technological innovation in the United States:Abraham Sutherland, legal advisor to the Proof-of-Stake Alliance, said a logical first step would be to tax the sale of tokens gained through staking, not their initial acquisition. “The critical first step is to clearly establish that block rewards are taxed when the new tokens are sold, like all other new property, and not when they are first acquired. This will both reduce administrative headaches and ensure that people are not overtaxed,"" Sutherland said."
450,"Bitcoin (BTC) is likely to hit $60,000 in 2021 amid the growing mainstream adoption, according to an analyst at major financial publication Investing.com.Jesse Cohen, a senior financial analyst at Investing.com, predicted that Bitcoin will likely reach a $60,000 level in the first half of 2021.According to Cohen, Bitcoin’s growth in 2021 will be fueled by support from institutional investors combined with the “flush of ultra-cheap money being pumped into the global financial system” by global central banks like the United States’ Federal Reserve:Cohen’s remarks come in conjunction with a new crypto-related survey by Investing.com, according to which 63% of respondents in the United Kingdom are planning to purchase some Bitcoin in 2021. More than 60% of 800 respondents also said that they believe that Bitcoin will surge above $60,000 in 2021.Despite growing confidence about Bitcoin’s rally in 2021, there are many concerns about the surrounding regulatory climate. “With Bitcoin moving into the mainstream and capturing greater attention, it will likely draw further scrutiny from regulators in the United States, Europe and Asia,” Cohen said.Cohen is particularly concerned about the impact of the new United States presidential administration. “The path forward may not necessarily be as smooth afterwards however. I’m expecting a retracement,” Cohen added.According to the survey, the majority of British respondents identify new regulatory restrictions as the biggest threat to Bitcoin in 2021.Cohen's prediction is by no means the highest for Bitcoin this year. Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead is confident that Bitcoin will hit $115,000 by August 2021. In early January, Binance.US CEO Catherine Coley predicted that Bitcoin could hit $100,000 by the end of the year. PlanB, the creator of the stock-to-flow model, also forecasts that Bitcoin should be somewhere between $100,000 and $288,000 by December 2021."
451,"The effect of celebrity tweets on the cryptocurrency market has become a topic of study for researchers after a week in which Elon Musk triggered sizable price surges for both Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE).Blockchain Research Lab published a paper on Jan. 3 titled, How Elon Musk’s Twitter activity moves cryptocurrency markets. The paper looks at six occasions when Elon Musk tweeted about cryptocurrency and attempts to measure the resultant impact on the trading volume and spot price of the coins in question.“We investigate the impact of Elon Musk's Twitter messages on cryptocurrency markets. By applying event study methodology, the impact of six Twitter events from 2020 and 2021 on return and trading volume of the mentioned cryptocurrency is analyzed,” the paper states.Of the six tweets, four were related to Dogecoin and two were related to Bitcoin. The paper concludes that all six events had an impact on the trading activity of both cryptocurrencies, specifically their trade volume:The biggest impact the paper notes on Dogecoin came in December, soon after Musk sent out the tweet: “One word: Doge”.Prior to the tweet, Dogecoin was being traded around nine times per minute, with an average trading volume of $1,942. In the 30 minutes immediately following the tweet, trade volume jumped to $299,330 per minute and the number of trades climbed to 775, the paper states.Not every tweet sent out by Musk affected the price of Doge or Bitcoin, but two did result in significant “cumulative abnormal returns.” “Four of the Twitter activities are likely only reactions to previous market events and relate to little or no significant price reactions. The other two events, however, do not seem to be reactions but independent actions which result in huge increases in trading volumes and large and significant positive abnormal returns,” the paper states.The biggest impact Musk had on Bitcoin came on Jan. 29, when the SpaceX and Tesla CEO added the word “Bitcoin” to his Twitter bio. As reported at the time, the value of Bitcoin surged within minutes of the new addition to Musk’s Twitter profile, and climbed nearly 20% in the hours following:So far, Musk’s dalliance with cryptocurrency has been nothing but positive, and, with the frequent use of memes, even funny. However, as the paper states, analogous research in other markets has already shown that the capacity for influencers to negatively impact the value of an asset via social media posts is also very real:The researchers acknowledge that the issue of influencing markets is not native to the cryptocurrency space. The same problems exist in the stock market and did so long before the GameStop saga triggered by collective traders on r/Wallstreetbets.Addressing the issue of public influencers is an ominous task and one which would undoubtedly broach the question of freedom of speech. Yet, as the paper concludes, the difference between the ‘right’ tweet and the ‘wrong’ tweet could be hundreds of billions of dollars.“Our results lead to the question under which conditions people in the public eye should comment on specific cryptocurrencies. If a single tweet can potentially lead to an increase of $111 billion in Bitcoin's market capitalization, a different tweet could also wipe out a similar value,” the paper ends."
452,"The combined value of all cryptocurrencies broke a new record of close to $1.139 trillion at 8:50 a.m. UTC on Feb. 4 . While long-term analysts often eye Bitcoin's solo chances of eating into gold's total market cap, the combined value of all cryptos together is currently more competitive with the total market cap of silver, at just under $1.5 trillion.Having broken the $1 trillion milestone early in Jan. 2021, today's crypto market is seeing greater distribution of growth between the top two assets in the game: Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). On Jan. 7, the date of the market's $1 trillion breakthrough, Bitcoin dominance clocked in at 69%, versus Ether's 13.5%. By contrast, the most recently updated data from CoinMarketCap this week has Bitcoin dominance at 62.2% versus Ether's share at 15.6%. Bitcoin Ether's relatively stronger market share signals the asset's record performance this week, having scored a new all-time high of $1,653 on Feb. 3. On the same date, Bitcoin dominance was down to 61.6%.As of the time of writing, Ether is up over 6% on the day at $1,623, with Bitcoin up 3.5% to $37,142. Soaring Ether prices have seen a corresponding increase in gas fees, with knock-on consequences for DeFi protocols — though a proposed fee and burn mechanism for Ether from Vitalik Buterin and Eric Conner has boosted the confidence of Grayscale Investments, which considers that the move, if pursued, could create “a positive feedback loop for Ether’s price.”Market analysts have this week also pointed to current incentives for bulls to push Bitcoin's target to $40,000, including tomorrow's total of $1 billion in Bitcoin options open interest set to expire.

453,"Meme-based cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) gained 25% in minutes on Feb. 4 after a fresh endorsement from the world’s richest man. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView showed DOGE/USD rebound past $0.05 per token on Thursday, edging towards new all-time highs.Musk, who is known for name dropping Dogecoin and Bitcoin on Twitter but just days ago said that he was taking a break “for a while,” returned to post a picture of a rocket and the moon.“Doge,” he added in a subsequent comment, with later tweet reading “Ur welcome,” accompanied by a doctored image of the Dogecoin shiba inu mascot as Simba in the Disney film, “The Lion King.”ur welcome pic.twitter.com/e2KF57KLxbImmediately afterwards, Dogecoin leapt from $0.04 to local highs of $0.058, while trade volume also surged by over 100% compared to Wednesday.The hashtag #ThanksElon also began to trend in the United States.As Cointelegraph reported, Musk had already helped fuel a Dogecoin bull run by adding to existing hype created by infamous Reddit group, r/Wallstreetbets.In an interview with Clubhouse, he described his various previous interactions with the cryptocurrency as “jokes,” nonetheless musing that its best days could still lie ahead.“Dogecoin is made as a joke to make fun of cryptocurrencies, obviously, but fate loves irony,” he summarized at the time.Musk likewise hit the headlines after causing a Bitcoin (BTC) price spike by making it the only item in his Twitter biography. That came weeks after another characteristically backhanded compliment, in which he said that Bitcoin was “almost as BS as fiat money.”“I had to think about it for a bit, but I do at this point think that Bitcoin is a good thing and so I am a supporter of Bitcoin, like I said — late to the party but I am a supporter of Bitcoin,” he added to Clubhouse.Thursday saw BTC/USD stage a comeback of its own, hitting levels previously seen only briefly thanks to Musk’s actions last week.At the time of writing, the pair circled $38,660. At the same time, Musk appears to have removed ""Bitcoin"" from his profile resulting in ""Elon has gone full doge"" comments from the Twittersphere.

454,"Guggenheim CIO Scott Minerd’s apparent shift from bullish to bearish and back again on either side of an SEC filing pertaining to a half billion dollar investment in BTC has been raising eyebrows on social media.The observation was made after approximately $500 million in BTC was moved from Coinbase into a series of private wallets on Jan. 31, which corresponds with an amount and effective date in a SEC filing by Guggenheim Funds Trust.I looked in to the 14K $BTC transaction from earlier

Split over 8 nicely mixed wallets, with some outputs going to a bunch of other non related wallets

~14466 $BTC which is approximately $500 million pic.twitter.com/pXVUZdvRxvPrior to the filing, Minerd hit the headlines on Jan. 21, when he tipped BTC would see a “full retracement back toward the 20,000 level,” and that it was unlikely to head any higher before 2022.In an interview with Bloomberg Television on Jan. 27, he said that institutional demand for Bitcoin was not high enough to keep it above $30k.But since Jan 31, Minerd has significantly broadened his high end price estimation for Bitcoin, claiming it has the potential to reach $600,000 in an interview with CNN on Tuesday, based on its scarcity and the value of gold. This was up from his December estimation, based on research and analysis by Guggenheim Partners, that suggested Bitcoin’s fair price in the long term to be around $400,000.Believing they were witnessing a wide discrepancy in publicly aired sentiment that may have consciously been of benefit to Guggenheim, many took to Twitter and Reddit to highlight Minerd’s seemingly contrary statements, as well as their timing and significance.Remember Guggenheim wants you to sell #bitcoin so they may buy lower. Been trying to scare the market into thinking price will crash to $20,000, even though they think its worth $400,000. https://t.co/B4woO5ULcWSome labelled it manipulation and others “FUD” although there’s no evidence Minerd isn’t simply responding to fast moving events in the cryptocurrency markets.“I’ve been saying this all along,” said user Asher68W on Twitter. “Guggenheim started buying Bitcoin in December. “When the price increased in January, Minerd trashed BTC on media to keep the price down until finished buying.”A $275 billion financial services company, Guggenheim Partners made the decision to invest in Bitcoin public with the filing of a SEC amendment in Nov. 2020, in which $500 million was to be allocated for an investment in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.A request for comment from Guggenheim Investments, the global asset management division of Guggenheim Partners, did not receive an immediate response."
455,"Bitcoin will continue its bullish push towards $50,000 as investors move funds out of gold and into the digital asset, according to Bloomberg senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone. By 2024, he believes its volatility could even reach gold levels, driving the price much further.In a report published on Wednesday, McGlone explained that BTC is showing strong support at $30,000, and “increasing institutional adoption and the potential for the benchmark to become a global reserve asset” could drive the price to $50,000 or higher.The report cited evidence of funds moving to Bitcoin from gold, highlighting accelerating flows into Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and decline in total known ETF holdings of gold. The investment firm has grown its GBTC fund from 1%, to 10%, of the “$210 billion tracking-gold ETFs” across 2020.“In a world going digital,” he stated, “it's logical to expect more funds to flow toward Bitcoin and away from precious metals.”McGlone believes investing up to 5% in Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly wise decision:A rise in stock-market volatility has boded well for gold and bitcoin in the past the strategist explained, with a combined investment of Bitcoin and gold showing a lower 260-day volatility rate (30%) when compared to the S&P 500 (35%).Despite this, McGlone believes that the digital asset has the potential for its resistance levels to rise to 100 times the resistance levels of gold. Current resistance levels for BTC ($40,000) are 22 times that of gold ($1,800).During the 2017 bull run, the Bitcoin-to-gold price ratio shot up from 1x to 15x in a matter of months.McGlone said Bitcoin was on track to match Gold's level of risk by 2024. In fact, he said Bitcoin could become even less volatile than gold due to its fixed supply.The current 260-day volatility for BTC sits at 50%, which he equates to gold’s 1980 volatility levels.McGlone also made mention of Ethereum, claiming it is turning the resistance level of $1,000 into a support level that is “unlikely” to break. He likened its trend to that of Q1 2017 in which it rose from $10 to above $40 before shooting up to over $1,000 nine months later."
456,"Sentiment throughout the cryptocurrency sector continues to improve as Ether (ETH) price ventured into uncharted territory and notched a new all-time high of $1,653 on Feb. 3. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) bulls appear to have their eyes set on the $40,000 mark and according to Cointelegraph analyst Marcel Pechman, this Friday’s $1 billion BTC options expiry favors bulls.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView show a price increase of 4.46% for the top cryptocurrency, which currently trades at $36,994, while Ether is up 8.38% and trades at $1,633.Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy plans to hold a meeting on Feb. 4 with 1,400 public companies during which CEO Michael Saylor will discuss how companies can integrate Bitcoin into their corporate strategy.Concerns that recent large institutional purchases and whale wallets are leading to the centralization of Bitcoin were addressed by on-chain analyst Willy Woo, who showed that “small and medium holders control roughly 40%” of the available supply and “distribution keeps getting better.”Today also saw a continuation of the upward momentum in the traditional markets as a combination of positive corporate earnings and economic stimulus-related developments from the Biden administration helped improve overall sentiment within the market.U.S. officials could gather as soon as Feb. 4 to discuss the growing influence of social media investing groups on the financial markets. It’s expected that the discussion will center around the recent evolution of r/Wallstreetbets and the use of platforms like Robinhood and Reddit to manipulate markets.The S&P 500 and Dow were able to bounce back from early downward pressure to finish the day up 0.10% and 0.11% while the NASDAQ was hit with a late selling surge that led to a slightly negative finish of 0.02%. Mega-tech stocks such as GOOGL, which finished up 7.28%, helped push markets higher into the closing bell.Developments related to brokerage firms blocking access to certain assets has placed a bright spotlight on the positives of decentralized finance. DeFi tokens have benefited from this attention, along with the strong breakout from Ether.The extra attention helped boost AAVE and SushiSwap (SUSHI) to new all-time highs of $345 and $14.84, while UMA saw its price surge by 59% to a 2021 high of $21.56.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.11 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 61.6%."
457,"CME Group’s chief economist and managing director, Bluford Putnam, recently acknowledged that Bitcoin is competing with gold as a hedge against inflation.“Gold appears to have an emerging competitor in Bitcoin,” told Bloomberg for a video released on YouTube on Tuesday. “Given the current price range for gold, it is likely that increased production will be a feature of 2021,” he said.Gold’s supply is less clearly defined than Bitcoin’s. Built into the asset’s code, BTC touts a set maximum limit of 21 million coins, dispersed into circulation on a steady mining schedule. Putnam mentioned this characteristic of Bitcoin in his rationale, although he also noted the coin’s volatile nature. “Please be aware, fixed supply does not mean less volatility,” he explained. “Indeed it can mean the opposite,” he said, adding:A store of value or hedge often represents a place to put value on a longer-term basis as possible protection against inflation and shifting global economic factors. Lack of correlation can be a key aspect of safe-haven assets, as noted by Investopedia.“We’ve also noticed that gold may be losing its appeal as a hedge against global political risks,” Putnam said. “In the 2017 to 2020 period, the mostly ups and occasional downs of the gold price appear to be directly tied to Fed policy shifts more than anything else,” he added. “Since equities were responding to the same driving force, the gold-equity relationship tended to become a little more closely associated, weakening gold’s safe-haven appeal.”Gold and Bitcoin both broke their previous all-time price highs in 2020. Gold bested its record high in July, going on to surpass $2,000 per ounce in August, according to data from TradingView.com. Bitcoin broke its record high in December, and doubled from there in the weeks following.Proponents often argue that Bitcoin is like digital gold, but with properties that make it easier to store and transport. Industry leaders have also been known to pit the two store of value assets against each other. "
458,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) stellar run in the latter half of 2020 and MicroStrategy’s purchase of the digital asset appears to have attracted attention from several publicly listed companies in the United States. However, the lack of regulatory clarity could have deterred them from buying Bitcoin at lower levels.To address this issue, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy is hosting an online seminar on Feb. 3 and 4, where “the legal considerations firms face while integrating Bitcoin into their corporate strategy” will be discussed. Several major crypto firms will also make presentations to the audience.About 1,400 firms have signed up for the webinar, which shows companies are deeply interested in Bitcoin. Even if a handful of these firms end up buying Bitcoin, it could start the next leg of the rally to a new all-time high.U.S.-based institutional investors have shown increasing interest in Bitcoin in 2020, which has propelled Coinbase to the top 1,000 websites in the world and one of the top 400 in the U.S.The popularity seems to have increased further in January of this year. Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano recently highlighted that the Coinbase app was downloaded 1.3 million times in January, which is greater than “E-trade, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Sofi” combined.With these positive fundamental tailwinds, let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies and determine what the technicals project.Bitcoin broke above the downtrend line on Feb. 2 and followed that up with another up-move today, which invalidates the short-term bearish sentiment. The relative strength index (RSI) has jumped into the positive zone and the 20-day exponential moving average ($33,945) has started to turn up, indicating advantage to the bulls.The BTC/USD pair could now rally to $38,000. If the bulls can drive the price above this resistance, the pair could retest the all-time high at $41,959.63. A breakout of this level could start the next leg of the up-move that may reach $50,000.On the other hand, if the bears defend the $38,000 level aggressively, the price may turn down and drop to the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend.But if the bears sink the price below the moving averages, the pair may consolidate between $28,850 and $38,000. A break below $28,850 could start a deeper correction.Ether (ETH) soared above the $1,400 to $1,473.096 overhead resistance on Feb. 2 and followed that up with another strong up-move today. This suggests that the bulls continue to buy at higher levels.The price action of the past three days has invalidated the negative divergence on the RSI. The ETH/USD pair could now rally to $1,675 and if that level is also crossed, the rally could extend to $2,000.Any correction is likely to find strong support at the breakout level at $1,400 and below that at the 20-day EMA ($1,321). A bounce off either level will suggest that bulls remain in command.This positive view will invalidate if the pair reverses direction and breaks below the uptrend line. Such a move will suggest aggressive profit-booking at higher levels.XRP formed a Doji candlestick on Feb. 2, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. Today, the bulls are attempting to resolve the uncertainty in their favor by pushing and sustaining the price above $0.41123.If they succeed, the XRP/USD pair could rally to $0.50 and then to $0.60. The gradually upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.33) and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that the bulls are trying to make a comeback.However, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above $0.41123, the bears will try to pull the pair back below $0.3855. A break below the moving averages will suggest weakness and the decline may then extend to $0.245.Polkadot (DOT) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($15.97) on Feb. 1 and has soared above the all-time high today. If the altcoin closes above $19.40, it will suggest the next leg of the uptrend has begun.The DOT/USD pair could then rally to $24.08 and then $30. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory indicate the bulls are in control.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair reverses direction from the current levels, a few more days of range-bound action is possible. The bears will have to sink the price below the $14.7259 support to tilt the advantage in their favor.Cardano (ADA) took support at the 20-day EMA ($0.35) and surged above the $0.38 resistance on Feb. 1. That was followed by another up-move on Feb. 2, which carried the altcoin near the resistance line of the ascending channel.However, the long wick on the Feb. 2 candlestick suggests traders are booking profits near the resistance line. The ADA/USD pair has formed an inside day candlestick pattern today, which generally acts as a continuation pattern.If the bulls can thrust the price above $0.4546265, the pair could rally to the resistance line of the channel. A break above the channel can push the price to the psychological resistance at $0.50.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below $0.38, it will suggest profit-booking at higher levels. A break below the channel will indicate a possible trend change.Chainlink (LINK) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($21.80) on Feb. 1 and broke above the downtrend line today. The bulls will now try to propel the price above the all-time high at $25.7824 and resume the uptrend.If they succeed, the LINK/USD pair could rally to $30. The rising moving averages and the RSI above 62 indicate advantage to the bulls.On the other hand, if the price turns down from $25.7824, the LINK/USD pair could again drop to the 20-day EMA. A break below this support may result in a fall to $20.1111 and the pair could consolidate in this range for a few days.The advantage will tilt in favor of the bears if the $20.1111 support cracks. Such a move could sink the price to the 50-day SMA ($17.11).Litecoin (LTC) broke above the downtrend line and the moving averages on Feb. 2. This move invalidates the head and shoulders pattern, which suggests the selling pressure has reduced.The LTC/USD pair could now rally to $165.9709. If the price turns down from this resistance, it will point to a possible consolidation between $120 and $165.9709.On the other hand, if the bulls can drive the price above $165.9709, the pair could retest $185.5821. A break above this resistance could resume the uptrend.This bullish view will invalidate if the pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the $120 support. Such a move will suggest that the bears are back in command.The bulls have pushed Bitcoin Cash (BCH) above the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA ($431), which suggests the bearish sentiment has weakened. The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI is just above the midpoint, suggesting a balance between supply and demand.The bulls can now push the price to $465 and then to $515.35. If the price turns down from either level, it will suggest that bears are selling on rallies. The bears will then again try to sink the price below the moving averages.If they succeed, the BCH/USD pair could drop to the $370 to $353 support zone. A bounce off this zone will keep the pair range-bound for a few more days, but a break below it could pull the price down to $275.Binance Coin (BNB) skyrocketed above the $50 psychological resistance on Feb. 1, indicating strong demand from the bulls. Another positive sign is that the altcoin has not given up much ground since then, which shows that traders are not booking profits in a hurry.In a strong uptrend, corrections are usually shallow and last for one to three days. If the bulls can push the price above $53, the next leg of the up-move may begin. The next target objective on the upside is $60.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below $49, the BNB/USD pair could drop to $47. If the bulls can flip this previous resistance to support, the pair will again try to resume the uptrend.The first sign of weakness will be a break below $47 and the trend could turn in favor of the bears if the 50-day SMA ($39.75) cracks.The bears have been defending the $0.325 to $0.35 overhead resistance zone for the past few days, but they have not been able to sink and sustain Stellar (XLM) below the 20-day EMA ($0.29). This suggests the bulls are buying at lower levels.When the price repeatedly pierces a resistance level, it tends to weaken. Therefore, the possibility of an upward breakout in the XLM/USD pair is high. If the bulls can sustain the price above $0.35, the pair could rally to $0.409.A breakout above this level will start the next leg of the uptrend that could reach $0.50. The rising moving averages and the RSI above 64 suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest a change in sentiment. That could result in a drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.235).The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

460,"On Feb. 5, a total of $1 billion in Bitcoin (BTC) options open interest is set to expire. This number is small relative to the past month's $4 billion options expiry, but monthly and quarterly options typically concentrate the most volume. Friday's expiry is somewhat unusual although it is balanced at the current BTC levels. Data also shows that bulls have many incentives to push up the price above $38,000.Deribit exchange holds 84% market share for Friday's expiry. By analyzing the aggregate open interest between $28,000 and $43,000, there are $300 million worth of neutral-to-bullish call options stacked against $290 million open interest from put options.Therefore, by analyzing strikes 25% above or below the current BTC price, there’s virtually equilibrium from both sides.As per the above data, the neutral-to-bearish put options are concentrated at $34,000 and below. Between $34,000 and $36,000 strikes, there's a perfect balance, as both call and put options are equally matched.Despite the discrepancy below $32,000, bears incentive to push the price down presents a 3,400 BTC contracts imbalance. That translates into a $109 million open interest for a 13% or more negative price move. Although nominally significant, it doesn't seem enough to create the incentives required to take the bulls by surprise.On the other hand, if bulls want to prop up the price up to $38,000, that would result in a 2,800 BTC contracts imbalance. This situation is equivalent to a $106 million open interest for a 4% positive price swing, thus a better risk-reward for such an effort.To assess whether market makers and arbitrage desks are pricing the risk for upside or downside, the 30% to 20% delta skew is the most useful indicator. It measures the premium difference between the neutral-to-bullish calls options stacked against similar put options.Numbers between 0 and 15 are considered neutral, whereas a negative delta skew indicates that large option traders request an extra premium to take downside risks, hence regarded as bearish.The last time a situation like this occurred was on Dec. 29, and over the past five days, the indicator has held at 10. This data shows a perfect balance between risks, meaning there are no incentives for market makers and arbitrage desks to pressure BTC in either way as the Feb. 5 expiry approaches.OKEx, Bit.com, and Deribit weekly contracts mature on Feb. 5 at 8:00 AM (UTC).The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

461,"Earlier this week, Elon Musk made history when he placed his full support behind Bitcoin (BTC) during a Clubhouse stream. When discussing Bitcoin and the GameStop debacle with Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, Musk said: “I am late to the party, but I am a supporter of Bitcoin.” This came a few days after Musk changed his Twitter profile, adding “Bitcoin” to his bio.Interestingly enough, Musk's public endorsement of Bitcoin comes at a time when legacy financial markets have been openly caught defrauding their own customers, and the Robinhood app is at the center of this fraud. Indeed, the richest man alive told the world that he believes Bitcoin is on the verge of mass adoption amid a backdrop of criminal stock market behavior.For those unfamiliar with these events, the GameStop saga is a “David and Goliath” story that started out with a community of online traders on the subreddit r/Wallstreetbets bringing down hedge funds — clawing away at billions of dollars in institutional short orders. A short order is a type of order that allows investors to profit from the demise of a company.After retail investors realized that hedge funds shorted GameStop for 150% of its entire public stock — i.e., more shares than existed — a group of 2 million (now 8 million) Redditors figured out that by buying the stock and not selling, hedge funds that shorted GameStop would lose billions. And thus it was. By Jan 29, the loss tallied $19.75 billion as word spread through the power of the internet.However, as soon as retail investors began winning, the long-reaching tentacles of centralized corporations were able to stop the game entirely, freezing trading on key exchanges and trading infrastructure so that hedge funds could reposition without losing everything.Indeed, one of the largest fictions of our time is the story of free markets. This concept embodies the “American dream,” whereby anyone who chooses to follow their dreams can do so (at considerable personal risk). This includes the ability to be rewarded (or punished) for having a stake in the financial game, which should operate under strict rules.Whether it's high-frequency trading, synthetic derivatives, infinite money-printing or some combination of all three, the stock market rewards a handful of insiders who game the system and play by a different set of rules than everyone else.It's important to realize that the issue is not the game itself — free markets are the most efficient way of proper value transfer, if done correctly. The issue is that rules only apply if institutional players win, otherwise they can be broken, suspended and revised with minimal consequences for those with friends in high places.This drove many Redditors to the point where, knowing that the market is rigged, they did not care about losing money, provided hedge funds lose billions. It started out as retribution against those responsible for the 2008 financial crisis and the misery that many had to endure because of it.This Reddit post paints a good picture of the motivations that inspired millions of people to band together against crooked financial conglomerates. Of course, other motivations — such as profit motives — were undoubtedly at play as the market fed on its own self-reinforcing mechanisms. Regardless, the system's true colors are now out there for all to see.And while legacy financial media has attempted to steer the narrative in a certain direction, the truth of the matter is that this story is apolitical and exposes the fact that ordinary everyday people are not allowed to win. Irrespective of intentions, the stock market is shown to be a means to entrench and exacerbate poverty in a rigged game that only benefits those who are already wealthy.However, the journey doesn't end here — for there is a parallel system that is not controlled by Wall Street or central bankers, and it's growing as we speak. With a market capitalization of over $1 trillion, cryptocurrencies are fast becoming the new frontier for financial markets that have no allegiances.On top of being a new technology that democratizes markets, there is now a crystal-clear reason for investors to opt out of the old system and enter the new one.Bitcoin started this revolution 11 years ago, and it does not stop there. An entirely new financial ecosystem is being built on Ethereum from the ground up, which has sprung a wealth of decentralized finance products with various trade-offs and use cases.This time last year, capital in DeFi products reached the $1 billion landmark. Today, that figure is approaching $30 billion, according to DeFi Pulse.With this backdrop, the future of financial markets seems closer than ever before.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

462,"Strategists at JPMorgan Chase caused quite the stir in January when they informed clients that the approval of a Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund, or ETF, would be a short-term headwind for the digital asset. A United Kingdom-based cryptocurrency hedge fund manager is attempting to pour cold water on those claims, asserting that JPMorgan’s analysis isn’t based on quantitative analysis or in-depth research.The crux of JPMorgan’s argument is that a new institutional-grade ETF would introduce competition for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, or GBTC, which has amassed over $22 billion in assets under management. The bank’s strategists say that the new ETF could lead to a cascade of GBTC outflows and cut into the premium.GBTC boasts a large premium over Bitcoin largely because of its dominant position in the market. Institutional investors that want exposure to the digital asset without having to buy it outright have few options outside of GBTC.Tyr Capital Arbitrage SP has completed a detailed refutation to JPMorgan's claims. The fund manager told Cointelegraph: “We disagree with the JPM assessment” on grounds that there is no evidence suggesting that a decrease in the GBTC premium will lead to negative short-term returns for BTC.“Instead we found evidence of the opposite, namely a decrease in the GBTC Premium tends to be followed by short term gains in Bitcoin,” Tyr says in its yet-to-be-released report.The report continues:Nick Metzidakis, Tyr Capital’s research lead, told Cointelegraph that his analysis of GBTC’s premium history over the past five years suggests that a “decrease in the premium has a positive impact on Bitcoin.”As for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Metzidakis said that increased competition may affect its market share but that its assets under management will likely continue to rise as more investors allocate to Bitcoin.Despite rumblings to the contrary, Metzidakis doesn’t believe the United States Securities and Exchange Commission will greenlight a Bitcoin ETF this year. That being said, the growth of crypto as an asset class “may encourage regulators to fast track their acceptance of a Bitcoin ETF as they are motivated to provide a safe and controlled point of access” to the new asset class.He continued:"
463,"Institutional investors are seen to be rushing toward Bitcoin (BTC) at high speed, with more companies emerging that look to adopt Bitcoin as a way to store their reserves. Recently, Marathon Patent Group, a Nevada-based Bitcoin mining company, has bought $150 million worth of Bitcoin as a reserve asset, a move similar to MicroStrategy purchasing $425 million worth of Bitcoin in September 2020. This purchase made Marathon Patent Group the third-largest holder of BTC among publicly traded companiesIn addition to Marathon, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager by virtue of assets under management, has stated in its new filings to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission that Bitcoin derivatives now could be a part of the investment schemes of two of its associate funds, BlackRock Global Allocation Fund Inc. and BlackRock Funds. This is bound to set a precedent for other large asset management companies, such as Vanguard, UBS Group, State Street Advisors, etc., to enter into the domain of crypto investments.According to research done by technology researcher Kevin Rooke, publicly traded companies now hold over $3.6 billion worth of Bitcoin, which is a 400% increase within the last 12 months. In 2019, these companies barely had 20,000 BTC in their portfolios, a number that has now jumped to 105,837 BTC, with the biggest holders being MicroStrategy, Galaxy Digital and Marathon Patent Group. Institutions are now getting involved in the Bitcoin market as some are expecting Bitcoin to become a digital alternative to gold.The price of Bitcoin has jumped from around the $7,250 mark at the start of 2020 to its all-time high of $41,940 on Jan. 9 this year. This jump entailed that investors got a 303% return on their investment in Bitcoin over 2020. These returns surpassed the returns of market indicators such as S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite Index and gold by a significant margin.These abnormally high returns with Bitcoin have led institutional investors to feel fear-of-missing-out, especially since several prominent traditional finance firms have tipped that Bitcoin could hit $100,000 later this year. Scott Freeman, co-founder and partner at JST Capital — a firm specializing in digital assets for institutional investors — told Cointelegraph that “BTC is more broadly recognized as an asset in its own right,” adding: “Funds that missed out on the growth in 2020 are being pushed by their investors to get exposure to this asset.”In addition to the high returns that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have offered throughout 2020 and continuing into 2021, institutional investors are looking to use Bitcoin to hedge risks from other assets on their portfolios that have a low correlation to the cryptocurrency markets.Sergey Zhdanov, chief operating officer and chief financial officer of EXMO — a U.K.-based crypto exchange — told Cointelegraph that “cryptocurrencies have a higher practical value compared to gold.” He further pointed out that this “confirms the fact that cryptocurrencies have a chance to develop their applied characteristics (means of payment and circulation) and not only investment ones.”An instance of institutions using Bitcoin as a hedge for their portfolios is when Ruffer Investment Company announced to its investors that it now holds 2.5% of its portfolio in BTC, stating that “we see this as a small but potent insurance policy against the continuing devaluation of the world’s major currencies.”With a lot of institutions now buying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets, one could argue that these investors are slightly late to the party and are buying assets at a higher price point than they would if they had adopted the crypto realm merely a year ago. However, Simon Peters, market analyst at eToro — a social trading and multi-asset brokerage company — told Cointelegraph:Buying and holding Bitcoin as a reserve currency for their portfolios to complement traditional assets is only the first step to widespread exposure. As these institutions become more familiar with digital assets, they will delve into other ways of utilizing them, such as for payments, remittance and settlement purposes, according to Peters, who added: “We may even see central banks holding Bitcoin if it grows in status to become a global reserve digital currency.”Earlier this month, eToro released its “Institutional Cryptoasset Trading” report, which shows that one of the greatest barriers to institutional adoption of crypto is the insufficient market capitalization. However, now that the market capitalization has passed $1 trillion, the traditional players coming in are expected to accelerate the growth to $2 trillion in the near future. Peters further outlined how the new incoming administration in the United States responds to crypto will be critical:The market is currently making institutional investors join the market as they are being pushed by their clients who want exposure to this fast-growing asset class. But these investors buying into Bitcoin is not really affecting the price action of the market in the current scenario, as that’s what is expected of them acting as somewhat of a lag indicator for these markets. Thus, it’s questionable whether these investments are actually pushing the market forward.However, Zhdanov thinks that in the long term, these investments will push the market, as large investors tend to hold on to their positions. Furthermore, the number of new BTC addresses created daily still hasn’t reached the 2017 level, suggesting that the current growth is organic in nature. Freeman added that the entry of these players could benefit the volatility of these assets: “These investors tend to have a longer investment horizon and will tend to counterbalance the short-term volatility that may be caused by typically shorter-term retail investors.”It’s important to remember that the BTC market is still more speculative than one that follows rules of traditional trading based on the fundamentals and technical analysis. The most recent example of this is Elon Musk, who added #Bitcoin to his bio with a related tweet saying: “In retrospect, it was inevitable.” Related: Institutional demand for crypto isn’t subsiding, but impact will be gradualBitcoin price responded with a surge that was later labeled as the “Elon Candle,” wherein it jumped by 13.9% within the next 30 minutes. This by itself is evidence of how speculative the market is at the moment. However, irrespective of these short term price movements, it is expected that more institutional investors will flock to the crypto markets for the lucrative gains, hedging opportunities and exposure they offer to diversified portfolios, albeit at a slower pace than many would like to believe."
464,"Bitcoin (BTC) ownership is becoming more decentralized every day, data shows, allaying fears that the supply is being controlled by an elite.Data from Glassnode reproduced by statistician Willy Woo on Feb. 3 shows that the number of smaller Bitcoin holders and those holding coins on behalf of clients keeps growing.Despite BTC/USD rising to record highs in recent weeks, more, not fewer, small investors are coming in board. At the same time, longtime BTC hodlers, known as ""humpbacks"" in reference to their status as the largest and oldest whale investors in the space, are not cashing out.""Distribution keeps getting better,"" Woo summarized in a series of tweets on the data.The numbers serve to alleviate fears of centralization fanned by recent articles in the mainstream press on the back of Bitcoin price rises and associated publicity.In a piece on Jan. 31, Bloomberg used a report from research entity Token Analyst to claim that ""Bitcoin’s infrastructure is more centralized than ever before,"" and that this was ""raising alarms about the security and viability of what is championed as a decentralized network.""In late December, Forbes targeted mining as an alleged victim of ""Chinese centralization."" Proponents meanwhile continue to highlight Bitcoin as the antidote to the centralization which has undermined fiat currencies around the world.""How did we get to this point? Centralization, complacency, and a detachment from monetary reality,"" commentator Marty Bent wrote in his latest blog post on Feb. 1. A minor preoccupation nonetheless remains the impact of major selling on distribution should new institutional buyers choose to take profit.For popular trader Scott Melker, such a scenario is a matter of ""if,"" not ""when,"" and the idea that institutions will hodl ad infinitum is a myth.Both MicroStrategy and Grayscale added to their positions this week, the former purchasing 295 BTC on Tuesday while the latter's Bitcoin assets under management now total $22.5 billion.""Regardless of all of the reports surfacing about hedge funds exploring Bitcoin, it is our belief most are going to lock in profit at some point, whether they own GBTC or custody their own coins. So, our answer is yes, institutions will sell their bitcoin,"" he wrote this week."
465,"Michael Green, chief strategist and partner at investment advisory firm Logica Capital, sounded the alarm about China’s Bitcoin (BTC) mining dominance during a debate with crypto proponent Anthony Pompliano.The discussion between the Bitcoin skeptic and the Bitcoin bull has just been published by digital asset media outlet Real Vision.Green emphasized the dominant share of hash rate located within China’s borders, describing the network as “incredibly vulnerable” from the perspective of the United States.“The vast majority of the mining activity is occurring in regions like China, Russia and Iran, and if we incorporate the participation of mining pools, they control in excess of 90% of the hash rate. This is not a decentralized system,” said Green.“It's completely absurd that the U.S. government would put itself into a situation in which the control of the monetary system was outsourced in the same manner that we've chosen to outsource our iPhone production,” he added.But Pomp described Green’s assertion as flawed, asserting that Bitcoin is “the strongest computing network in the world [...] by every measure.“ He noted recent “diversification” in the Chinese centralization of hash rate, emphasizing significant increases in the hash power commanded by U.S.-based entities.Pompliano also challenged Green’s inference that the geographical distribution of Bitcoin’s hash rate is representative of the capacity for a nation-state to exert control over the network, stating, “Just because there is any sort of capital flow elsewhere does not mean that those governments control it.”Green also characterized Bitcoin as a conduit for criminality and a tool used by enemies of the United States to bypass and undermine the dollar. Ultimately, Green predicted it is only a matter of time until the U.S. government moves to ban BTC.“In terms of a ban of ownership, I'm not advocating for that,"" he said. ""I'm actually suggesting that I think [a ban] is the eventual outcome. Whether that is good or bad will ultimately be decided by the future.""Rebutting, Pomp argued that should Green’s worldview prevail, the United States will make the mistake of excluding itself from the global financial revolution that blockchain and crypto will drive:“We should embrace [Bitcoin] and ensure that the United States stays the leader on a global scale,” he added."
466,"MicroStrategy, a $6.37-billion business intelligence conglomerate in the United States, will meet with public companies on Thursday to discuss Bitcoin (BTC).Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, said that professionals from over 1,400 firms are joining the event.“If you are interested in the legal considerations firms face while integrating Bitcoin into their corporate strategy, you are not alone,"" Saylor wrote. ""We have professionals from more than 1400 firms joining us tomorrow for this discussion.""He also said that he has never seen so many CEOs sign up to attend one of its events, adding: Ever since MicroStrategy started to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin in the summer of 2020 as its main treasury asset, there has been a clear increase in institutional demand.Bitcoin is becoming more compelling as a store of value and a safe-haven asset as the fear of inflation continues to intensify. The demand for Bitcoin has been evident in the rising inflows into Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and large Coinbase outflows, as just some examples.High-net-worth investors in the U.S. rely on Coinbase to purchase Bitcoin and typically withdraw the BTC they purchase to self-custody wallets.Hence, when Coinbase outflows increase, it signals that large buyers in the U.S. are buying BTC. On Monday, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said:The accumulation of Bitcoin by big players in the U.S. coincides with the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin and the upcoming meeting between MicroStrategy and public companies.MicroStrategy has also been actively buying the dips in recent months. The latest purchase came on Tuesday, with MicroStrategy adding another $10 million in Bitcoin.The company now holds 71,079 BTC, worth $1.145 billion, which it purchased at an average price of $16,109 per BTC. Saylor wrote:If inflows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and outflows from Coinbase spike considerably after the meeting, then it may suggest that some companies may have bought BTC.There is a real possibility that some of these 1,400 companies will follow MicroStrategy's footsteps, particularly considering the effect investing in BTC had on the company. In fact, MSTR is one of the few stocks that has even outperformed BTC in the past few months.Currently, Bitcoin is hovering under the $38,000 resistance level, which is the last remaining resistance before the $40,000–$42,000 range."
467,"Robinhood, the stock trading app formerly popular with millennials, is facing another class-action suit, following its recent temporary suspension of purchases of GameStop and other “meme-stocks” through its platform.The lawsuit, filed Jan. 29 in Houston, Texas, alleges that Robinhood, along with other named defendants including TD Ameritrade and WeBull, arrived at “a common understanding of what must be done, which they carried out with conscious parallelism.”Conscious parallelism, in competition law, refers to behavior in which competitors in an oligopoly set prices or terms without a formal agreement. One entity will take the initiative in setting a price, while the others follow suit, as a departure from that behavior could threaten market share and lower profits.Robinhood and several other trading platforms suspended trades in a number of stocks, which were being targeted through a crowd-sourced collective purchasing strategy.This had initially been proposed through the r/Wallstreetbets subreddit, in response to the revelation that certain hedge-funds had taken short positions on GameStop which exceeded the available stock.The strategy involved a short-squeeze, “ultimately punishing the hedge funds and transferring a large sum of their money to individual investors.”The suit alleges that the actions of the defendants in suspending trading in GameStop and other shares denied their customers the chance to profit from the volatility, and actively manipulated the course of the stocks.Robinhood is accused of violating customer contracts, breaching fiduciary responsibilities, and violating laws on anti-competitive practices and price-fixing.The company did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph's request for comment.A previous class-action suit filed in Manhattan on Jan. 28 makes similar claims. Disgruntled users are able to automatically join as a plaintiff through online consumer-rights platform DoNotPay.The furor over Robinhood’s actions has seen it face the ire of Democratic Representative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, and reportedly shelve plans for an IPO in the wake of the PR disaster.Hollywood studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer even felt that the debacle deserved a feature length dramatization and quickly snapped up the movie rights."
468,"Uphold, an American digital wallet and trading platform, has acquired European card issuer Optimus Cards UK Limited to launch a cryptocurrency-enabled card on the continent.According to a Feb. 2 announcement, Uphold is planning to roll out its crypto-powered debit card in Europe starting in April 2021. Uphold CEO JP Thieriot said that the launch in Europe follows a successful roll out in the United States:“Very soon our European customers will be able to receive part or all of their salary in Bitcoin — or any asset of their choice — and spend it using Uphold Cards issued through Optimus,” Thieriot said.The new card will include some of the assets supported by Uphold’s platform — including cryptos, precious metals, U.S. equities, and carbon credits.Optimus is one of the biggest debit and credit card issuers across the United Kingdom and Europe. The firm is regulated by the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority as an Electronic Money Institution and acts as a primary card issuer and payments facilitator. Optimus' services are compatible with major platforms like Apple Pay and Google Pay, as well as contactless and virtual cards.Uphold did not disclose the cost of the acquisition in the announcement. The company did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.As previously reported, Uphold announced its multi-asset debit card in the U.S. in March 2020, supporting 24 crypto assets like Bitcoin (BTC), 27 fiat currencies, and four precious metals.In July 2020, Binance — the world’s largest crypto exchange — debuted its crypto card in Europe after acquiring Swipe wallet."
469,"Polish police have detained a suspect in an armed attack on FlyingAtom, a cryptocurrency and gold exchange in the city of Olsztyn in northeastern Poland. The incident, which occurred around 7 p.m. local time on  Jan. 22, resulted in the injuries of two employees — one of whose situation was severe enough to necessitate an induced coma.According to local media reports from Jan. 23, the masked attacker escaped with gold worth 450,000 zloty (roughly $120,000), fleeing the exchange's office on the fourth floor of a skyscraper in the city center. Following the incident, police secured the area and scoured surveillance footage, cordoning off multiple roads in the city and searching passing cars. Roads were re-opened by the following morning.On Jan. 23, FlyingAtom publicized an announcement offering a prize of 100,000 zloty for any information that could help to identify the perpetrator.A local crypto outlet reported on Jan. 24 that a suspect was subsequently detained in connection with the investigation. The outlet cited the press spokesman of the Municipal Police Headquarters in Olsztyn, Andrzej Jurkun, with a comment on the evening of Jan. 23 that “in Bydgoszcz [the police] detained a man who may be related to the attack. We do not provide more information, activities are underway. ""On Jan. 25, FlyingAtom published a Facebook post thanking the police for their successful capture of the suspect, as well as medical authorities for their ongoing care of the injured victims, appearing to confirm the earlier report of the suspect's detention. Since the attack, the exchange's office has been closed and will likely resume operations in early March, according to a post from Feb. 1.While many criminal incidents related to cryptocurrency are perpetrated online, there is nonetheless a persistent risk of physical robbery in the industry. In late January, an armed gang posing as cryptocurrency buyers stole about 3.5 million Hong Kong dollars ($450,000) from a woman in Hong Kong. While she was luckily unscathed during the incident, other victims of cryptocurrency-related attacks have suffered kidnap and torture, or been forced to escape in highly dangerous circumstances."
470,"United States President Joe Biden has rejected a Republican proposal for a COVID-19 relief bill that would have seen $618 billion allocated to struggling American households and businesses.Biden and newly appointed Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, dismissed the sum — just under the size of Bitcoin’s entire market capitalization — as insufficient for stimulating the economy amid the ongoing pandemic, Reuters reported.Democrats voted along party lines in the U.S. Senate on Jan. 2 to push through Biden’s relief bill that would see the GOP’s proposed sum more than trebled to $1.9 trillion. Senate leader Chuck Schumer told reporters anything less would leave the country managing the crisis for too long. Referring to the GOP’s initial $618 billion proposal, Schumer said:On the same day, the House of Representatives took a partisan vote on the relief bill renegotiation; democrats won 216-210, with no republicans pledging their support.The Federal Reserve printed more money in 2020 than the nation had issued in its first two centuries of existence; total U.S debt nears $28 trillion at time of writing. That leaves the country with a debt-to-GDP ratio in excess of 130%, the highest in its history by a large margin.Some posit that the Fed’s money-printing practices ultimately benefit Bitcoin by creating genuine fear, uncertainty and doubt regarding the U.S. dollar. Co-founder and CEO of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, Tyler Winklevoss, has previously expressed the view that the Fed essentially primes Bitcoin for a bull run every time it prints more money.However, even a bull run may not be as bullish as it seems. The number of dollars created in 2020 was equal to almost a fifth of all the dollars ever printed. This inflation effectively robs Bitcoin and other associated cryptocurrencies of its buying power, since they are still valued against the U.S. dollar.Biden’s relief package proposal represents a sizable reduction from the initial $3 trillion sum he first suggested in early January. Whether such efforts to stimulate the economy will boost the price of Bitcoin is largely a subject of speculation, however, it’s worth noting that the coin’s value has increased by early 700% since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic."

472,"Bitcoin (BTC) exchanges in the United States are seeing unprecedented popularity as a wave of adoption sweeps the market. Data from statistics resources Alexa and Similarweb shows that major exchange Coinbase now ranks within the top 1,000 most popular websites around the world.As BTC/USD circles all-time highs, its run to $42,000 in January appears to have sparked a tsunami of new user engagement with some of the most popular cryptocurrency trading platforms.In the U.S., the focal point of institutional inflows into Bitcoin in recent months, exchanges Gemini, Kraken and Binance U.S. are all part of the top 10,000 global sites. While Binance just beats Coinbase in terms of worldwide visits, the latter reigns supreme among its domestic market, ranking 386th among U.S. internet users. The data relates to December 2020, with the crypto rush at the start of this year likely hiking exchange popularity even further.Despite widely publicized system outages and other technical problems — phenomena which have plagued Coinbase throughout the years — its popularity remains clearly unaltered. ""Coinbase had 1.3M app downloads in January. That's more than E-trade, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Sofi had....combined,"" Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano noted on Tuesday.Coinbase currently ranks as the top crypto-specific finance app on the Apple App Store, with both Binance and Binance U.S. also in the top ten.In a further hint that bad publicity is not as bad as it may seem, retail trading app Robinhood likewise saw a huge jump in app downloads last week as users and commentators alike complained about what they viewed as arbitrary restrictions on their actions. As Cointelegraph reported meanwhile, Coinbase as a venue for large buys has become a useful bellwether for assessing market appetite to buy or sell. This week saw large withdrawals from the exchange to private wallets, something which one analyst suggested marks a continuation of institutions buying for the long haul.""The strongest bullish signal is working,"" Ki Young Ju, CEO of on-chain analytics resource CryptoQuant, continued in fresh comments on Wednesday.BTC/USD is trading at around $36,000 at the time of writing, up 4.8% on the day after hitting highs of $36,820."

In remarks to the reddit group r/Wallstreetbets, Cuban said that ""stocks will be on the blockchain in the future.”Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) has now been integrated with the Stellar blockchain, enabling the stablecoin to be transacted on the Stellar network and possibly take some of the strain of the clogged Ethereum network.Data from Glassnode shows USDC transaction volume on Ethereum has steadily been increasing over the past year as the Coinbase backed coin steadily gains ground on Tether (USDT). Utilizing Stellar blockchain will greatly reduce USDC transaction fees and free up space on the Ethereum network.The hype surrounding r/Wallstreetbets stocks like GameStop (GME), AMC and BlackBerry (BB) dwindled as their prices extended the losses experienced on Feb. 1.While the “meme” stocks saw their prices plunge, the S&P 500, Dow and NASDAQ all put on strong performances for the day and closed up 1.39%, 1.57% and 1.56%.

Kessler wrote the blogger had ""found that as much as two-thirds of Bitcoin buys on any given day were purchased with Tether"" based on CoinLib data.Raising questions over Tether and its lack of audits and the idea USDT was being employed to buy Bitcoin to ""jack up its price,"" Kessler added;Kessler said he must also note that ""wallet provider Coinbase, the largest holder of Bitcoin, says it 'does not support USDT.' Do they know something? (Coinbase offers its own stablecoin USDC, in partnership with Circle.)Carter, who is now board chair at Coin Metrics, wrote that assessing trade between USDT and Bitcoin using data called CoinLib was “indefensible” as it included tens of billions of wash trading data from exchanges that reputable data sources ignore.He said any serious trader knows that “many of the exchanges composing the CoinLib sample are not credible, and that the resultant data was thus completely unreliable.”Carter stated that CoinLib is taking the data outputs from marginal and often non-fiat connected Tether based exchanges as face value, and “unsophisticated analysts like CryptoAnon” are using it to disseminate FUD about Bitcoin’s liquidity.He argued that highly regulated exchanges and institutional fund providers do not rely on or even support Tether in some cases and they all facilitate an on-ramp to Bitcoin and support the price.Carter concludes that Kessler needs more research and called for a retraction and a correction by the WSJ:"

We have professionals from more than 1400 firms joining us tomorrow for this discussion. There is still time for your legal team to attend. https://t.co/fid9nrZUfPThe seminar will take place on Feb. 3 and Feb. 4, with five one-hour sessions scheduled for the first day, and twice as many 30-minute sessions slated for the second. The first day will feature presentations from Saylor, the firm’s president and CFO Phong Le, along with representatives of legal firms specializing in digital assets. The topics discussed will include strategies for incorporating Bitcoin into treasury reserves and related questions regarding the accounting, tax, legal, and auditing considerations for firms who pursue this strategy.The second day will feature presentations from top crypto exchanges and fund managers, including Coinbase, Binance, Grayscale, and Galaxy Digital.In August, MicroStrategy made headlines after revealing it had purchased 21,000 BTC for $250 million. The following month, Saylor announced the firm had purchased an additional 16,796 Bitcoin for $175 million, with the firm continuously purchasing roughly 0.19 BTC every three seconds over 74 hours to complete the transaction.In December, MicroStrategy issued $650 million worth of bonds which were quickly mobilized to purchase 29,646 BTC. The firm purchased an additional 314 Bitcoin for $10 million in late January, and a further 295 BTC for $10 million this week, bringing its Bitcoin reserves up to 71,079 BTC, or 0.38% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply.While MicroStrategy paid $1.095 billion to accumulate its BTC holdings, current prices value the stash at $2.57 billion — a gain of 135%.Despite the firm’s rampant Bitcoin accumulation leading to its shares being downgraded by Citigroup on Dec. 8, its stock has since rallied by 113%."
477,"Miami city employees could soon choose to get their salaries paid in Bitcoin rather than USD. In an interview with Forbes, Mayor Francis Suarez said tangible paths to expand Bitcoin's adoption throughout the city included enabling city employee salaries to be paid in BTC.Major figures in the cryptocurrency world have responded positively to the idea, with Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey calling it “smart” on Twitter.Smart https://t.co/wxsQkbfPefGemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss stated that the mayor is “leading the way for governments and Bitcoin.”Mayor Suarez told Forbes that due to the rise in crypto’s popularity among citizens, he wants to do everything he can to make Miami a Bitcoin-friendly city. Other proposals include allowing local fees and taxes to be paid in Bitcoin and certain other cryptocurrencies, as well as investing some of the city’s treasury into Bitcoin, following Microstrategy’s example.Although he isn’t sure of specific amounts, Suarez explained that the treasury investment would be structured as a public-private partnership, with the private partners receiving some of the rewards for alleviating some of the risks.He also revealed that he’s also considering financing his reelection campaign in Bitcoin. He isn’t the first to turn to Bitcoin to help fund political campaigns with Democrat Andrew Yang, California U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell, Minnesota U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer, and Libertarian Lara Loomer among U.S. politicians who have already accepted cryptocurrencies in past campaigns.The mayor believes Bitcoin will be the “biggest story for the next few years.”Late last year the mayor called Bitcoin a “stable investment” during an “incredibly unstable year.” Last week, he uploaded Bitcoin’s whitepaper onto the government’s website saying:The mayor told Forbes that he has reached out to other states and jurisdictions, including Caitlin Long in Wyoming and Florida CFO Jimmy Patronis to help drive Bitcoin-friendly changes in Florida’s legislature. These efforts are part of the city’s push to be the next major tech hub in the U.S. with plans to grow innovation and tech growth in the next few years.Should these actions take effect, Miami’s 450,000 citizens may be encouraged to start transacting in Bitcoin on a regular basis, with the potential for this to spread to the rest of Florida’s 21.5 million residents. It would also make the city more attractive for blockchain-related tech companies and events.Major crypto conference Bitcoin 2021 announced earlier today it was moving from Los Angeles to Miami in June this year.Although Miami may be the first U.S. city to offer employees salaries in Bitcoin, other companies have also been exploring this. Last week, Cointelegraph reported that software development services provider Sequoia Holdings, based in Virginia, is offering employees the ability to sacrifice a portion of their salary to invest in either Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), or Ether (ETH)."
478,"Recent global developments have put a spotlight on the cryptocurrency sector as people across the world begin to question the decision making process of governments and central banks. Multiple metrics like the increasing amount of Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) locked in DeFi, soaring transaction and on-chain activity and the plummeting BTC and Ether reserves of top exchanges show that investors are becoming increasingly interested in cryptocurrency.Data from CryptoQuant, an on-chain analytics firm, shows that as Ether (ETH) established a new all-time high above $1,500 on Feb. 2, the amount of Ether held on all centralized exchange’s reserves continued to drop to new lows as token holders withdrew their coins.Many analysts believe that the rapidly expanding DeFi sector, launch of Eth2 and increasing participation from institutional investors are the primary reasons for the drop in BTC and Ether held on centralized exchanges.Each week the number of participants interacting with the DeFi sector seems to reach a new high and as of Feb. 2, the total value locked in DeFi platforms has reached $28.67 billion.Data from Defi Pulse shows that the majority of DeFi platforms are built on the Ethereum network and require Ether to transact with the protocol.In addition to offering attractive ways to earn a yield from simply lending Ether, an increasing amount of the available supply is being directed towards DeFi-related activities and not available for trading purposes.A similar phenomenon is happening with BTC as holders looking to participate in the DeFi space without selling their Bitcoin have been wrapping them into ERC-20 synthetic versions of Ether.Platforms like REN and BadgerDAO lead in this effort and a similar drain on the available Bitcoin supply could also be helping to push the price of BTC higher.Since the launch of the Beacon chain on Dec. 1, 2020, the Eth2 contract has enabled token holders to stake their Ether in the new PoS contract by becoming validators for the network.Data from the Eth2 Launch Pad shows that there are currently 2,907,298 Ether worth a total of $4.39 billion staked on the network earning an estimated APR of 9.2%The contract has a multi-year commitment but for holders who refuse to stomach the risk and volatility of DeFi yield farming, Eth2 staking offers a way to earn a yield over time rather than let tokens sit on exchanges or in cold wallets.Since 2020, Bitcoin has received the lion’s share of attention from the institutional investment crowd as investors like MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor lead the way by buying up immense sums of Bitcoin and tweeting non-stop about its estimated future value.Now that Bitcoin is more than a decade old and seen as more established, firms are increasingly open to looking for the next big opportunity that the cryptocurrency sector has to offer. With the explosion of DeFi and its current dependence on the Ethereum network, Ether is quickly becoming a recommended choice for the institutional investors.Grayscale Investments temporarily closed their various crypto trusts to new investments in late December following the rise in the price of Bitcoin, but inflow resumed in early January and their total Ether holdings have increased by 242% over the past 3 months.Coinbase also noted in its annual 2020 review that institutional investors are increasingly seeing Ether as a store of value with “a growing number” of its institutional clients taking a position in the token due to the strong returns offered.The exchange also noted that while a majority of their clients bought BTC throughout 2020, Ether’s strong finish to the year saw it surpass BTC in terms of price growth and this is a trend which has continued into 2021.DeFi’s continued growth, the allure of the Eth2 contract and increasing participation from institutional investors are all signals that Eth price may continue to rise."
479,"The U.S. dollar lost about 7% of its value in 2020, while Bitcoin rallied about 300% during the same period. As Bitcoin’s institutional adoption increases, United States companies may start to diversify their treasury with other stores of value, and Bitcoin (BTC) stands a good chance to garner a portion of it.Ark Invest’s latest report, ""Bitcoin: Preparing for Institutions,"" shows that even a paltry allocation of 1% by companies from the S&P 500 could boost Bitcoin’s price by $40,000. However, analysts at Ar believe that the allocation is likely to be in the range of 2.5% to 6.5%, which ""could impact bitcoin’s price by $200,000 to $500,000.""Even as Bitcoin’s price consolidates and readies for the next leg up, several altcoins have been rising, backed by strong fundamentals and investors' high expectations of their upcoming products. Let’s look at three such tokens today.The decentralized finance space has boomed in the past few months, and the success of the protocols rely heavily upon data sources that are decentralized, fast and reliable. This is where Band Protocol steps in. The cross-chain data oracle has announced several partnerships in the past few days, which shows it is gradually building its market share.The strong rally in stocks such as GameStop, AMC and others have captured traders' attention in the past few days. Band’s tie-up with Injective Protocol to deliver decentralized price oracles for various stocks to be supported on the decentralized derivatives platform could benefit the price of its native token, BAND, as a successful integration would be followed by an increase in demand.Similarly, Linear Finance, a derivatives asset protocol, will also use Band’s real-time price feeds to offer its clients a seamless trading experience for several synthetic assets.Band is not limited to only providing price feeds of cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange assets and commodities. Elrond and Band have expanded their partnership further to bridge the two networks to provide off-chain data to various applications being developed on the Elrond network. Other than the usual price feeds, Band will also cater to data requests for sports, gaming, esports and much more.Along with these, Band has also entered into partnerships with the Moonbeam protocol, Nervos and Fantom in the past few days and broadened its existing partnership with CoinGecko.BAND price rose from $7.1532 on Jan. 22 to $12.949 on Tuesday, an 81% rally within a short time.  Previous to this move, the price had largely been stuck in the range of $7 to $11.50 for the past few days.The bulls pushed the price above the range on Tuesday, but the long wick on the day’s candlestick shows the bears are aggressively selling at higher levels. This has dragged the price back into the aforementioned trading range.If the bulls do not give up much ground, then one more attempt to break above the range is likely. The 20-day exponential moving average ($9.28) has started to turn up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive territory, which suggests that the path of least resistance is to the upside.If the bulls can drive and sustain the price above $11.50, the BAND/USD pair could rally to $16 and then to $17.78. This zone may act as stiff resistance, but if the bulls can propel the price above it, the momentum could further pick up.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears successfully defend the $11.50–$12.949 resistance zone, the pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.The GameStop saga and the trading limits imposed on retail traders by brokerages like Robinhood have exposed their significant flaws. This is likely to draw traders to decentralized exchanges where control does not lie with any central entity.Transaction fees are an extremely important aspect during trading, especially for smaller-sized traders. So, when Ethereum gas fees increase, these retail traders are the most affected. Loopring attempts to solve this problem with it layer-two scaling.Data from Dune Analytics shows that Loopring’s fee collection recently surged to its highest-ever level due to increasing volume. The protocol recently updated its LRC tokenomics model and announced a new fee distribution pattern to its various participants. This could further attract LRC investors who may want to benefit from the rising popularity of the protocol.LRC rose from an intraday low at $0.33651 on Jan. 22 to an intraday high at $0.57618 on Jan. 31, a 71% rally within a few days. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls are in control.The up-move is currently facing resistance near $0.55, and the LRC/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.43). This is an important level to watch out for because the pair has taken support at the 20-day EMA on three previous occasions.If the pair again rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $0.62167. If they succeed, the pair could rally to $0.71773 and then to $0.78.This bullish view will invalidate if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that the bulls are not buying the dips anymore, and that could result in a fall to $0.35 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($0.31).Certain aspects of traditional finance could act as an inspiration to build projects in the decentralized space. Cream Finance recently announced the launch of Iron Bank, which is guided by the success of the $10-trillion U.S. corporate debt market.While there are several peer-to-peer lending protocols existing in the crypto space, Cream has taken it a step further and created a protocol-to-protocol lending mechanism. The main attraction of the Iron Bank is that it will facilitate zero-collateral lending.To keep the risk under check, Cream will set a credit limit after whitelisting the protocols. Initially, the Iron Bank is available only for Cream’s partners, but if this project succeeds, it is likely to be a huge positive for the entire DeFi space.In other news, Cream recently widened its services by adding SushiSwap and Uniswap LP tokens as collateral options for lending and borrowing.The platform's CREAM token rallied from $119.35 on Jan. 22 to an intraday high at $319.9 on Tuesday, a 168% rally within a short time. The long wick on the day’s candlestick shows that traders aggressively booked profits at higher levels.If the bulls do not allow the price to dip below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $251.65, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($181) and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest the advantage to the bulls.If the bulls can push and sustain the price above $294.80, the CREAM/USD pair could rally to $362 and then to $430.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $251.65, the pair could dip to the 61.8% retracement level at $209.45.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

480,"Unsuspecting investors have lost $16 billion by buying into crypto projects they thought would be the next best thing. And that money is nearly impossible to recover. As the crypto industry established itself as a disruptor of currency and technology and as Bitcoin (BTC) began to gain traction in 2017, scammers took advantage of naïve investors interested in getting involved. Related: Crypto Crimes Rated: From the Twitter Hackers to Not Your Keyser, Not Your CoinsThe crypto startup market is growing and expanding every day. There are startups working to create alternative banking opportunities, which raise capital through initial coin offerings, tokenize assets for easier use, create exchanges, and innovate in the decentralized finance space. Unfortunately, as what typically happens, many of the good projects are overshadowed by the few bad ones. That said, crypto scams are easy to spot if you know what to look for.In examining some of the biggest scams in the crypto space, there’s a pattern of how these schemes are run. One type lures investors with the promise of incredibly high returns, and in some cases, up to 1% interest per day. This Ponzi scheme is typically run by an individual who claims they’ve created a special trading bot that can produce these returns, but in the end, they’re simply paying out what other investors are putting in without any valid product.The second type is a pyramid scheme where the crypto project draws investors, promising large returns, using tokens on an exchange, and participating in the “next big thing.” But an investor can really only make money by referring to new investors, not from an actual product. Crypto scams may be one or the other or a combination.Scammers have also created tokens that can only be used within their own exchange and are essentially worthless. Scams also trick investors with lots of hype, flashy promotions, buzzwords and jargon. Some investors lose their money because the projects collapse, causing a sudden price drop, and some have lost their money because the founders suddenly disappeared with it.Since 2012, 132 different crypto scams have made off with over $16 billion in investors’ funds, according to our “Crypto Investor Scam Report.” Due to the unregulated nature of the industry, this money is unprotected and will be very hard, if not impossible, to get back. And what have been the consequences of these actions? According to the report, even though there have been 132 crypto scam projects since 2012, only 71 of the projects have had any kind of legal action taken against them.Related: Did you fall for it? 13 ICO scams that fooled thousandsWhile there are plenty of things an investor can look for when evaluating crypto projects for credibility and worth — such as assessing their white paper, evaluating their team, asking to see a working business model, and confirming that they want to provide value, not just hype — the crypto industry shouldn’t just leave that due diligence up to the investor. There are ways not to only keep crypto projects accountable but ways to make it easy for investors to learn more about projects they may want to back.Right now, if an investor wants to learn more about a crypto project, its history, its team and its business model, they have to hunt it out on the internet — if that team has provided such information. One of the major failures of crypto scams is that investors are backing projects they know little about.Instead of leaving it to chance or leaving it to investors to ask, the industry should be actively encouraging new projects to make their information public in one source or registry. If it becomes an industry standard, those willing to disclose company information will show they have nothing to hide. Those who refuse to disclose can be flagged for potentially fraudulent activity.The young crypto startup industry hasn’t necessarily had to consider establishing a set of investor relations best practices. Yet other companies in other industries have established methods by which they interact with investors to keep them fully informed on company actions and finances.By building a culture of good IR in crypto, it sets the baseline for how crypto companies communicate with investors — and those unwilling may be flagged as scams. Similarly, it sets a baseline for encouraging investors to ask questions and get involved to find out how their money is being used.As seen above, major scams preyed on investors’ ignorance around the crypto space, as everyday people were lured into the promise of high returns without really knowing what crypto was about, thinking that it functioned like a Ponzi or pyramid scheme. The responsibility of educating the world about how crypto works falls on the shoulders of the industry, which needs to increase those initiatives to those outside the crypto, finance or technology space so that new investors don’t get taken advantage of.Finally, the industry needs to hold scammers accountable. While some founders of these fraudulent projects have been brought to justice, there are many who are still at large or continuing their shady practices. Will the industry call them out? Getting to the point of scamming unknowing victims is actually too late. So, what kind of checks and balances like the ones detailed above will the industry put in place to expel bad actors before they’ve had the chance to start?While $16 billion has already been lost, there are ways to keep it from happening again. That includes a commitment from investors to thoroughly assess any startups they want to back. But most importantly, it requires the industry to commit to accountability and transparency going forward.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
481,"Global cryptocurrency exchange OKEx is moving to cheaper and faster Bitcoin (BTC) transactions with its upcoming Lightning Network integration.According to a Tuesday announcement, OKEx’s Bitcoin Lightning Network will be integrated “in the coming quarter,” making OKEx a participant node in the Lightning Network.The integration will allow OKEx users to select the Lightning Network option when depositing and withdrawing BTC, intending to decrease transaction fees and times.The Lightning Network is a second-layer scaling solution and payment protocol based on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The protocol was suggested by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja in 2015 in an effort to solve Bitcoin’s scalability problem. According to data from crypto analytics website BitInfoCharts, the average Bitcoin transaction fee amounted to more than $15 on Monday.As the Lightning Network is not a blockchain itself but rather a secondary layer, the solution was originally mostly used for small or even micro Bitcoin transactions. To solve this problem, Lightning Labs introduced so-called “Wumbo” channels in August 2020 in order to make it possible for nodes to service larger transactions while reducing on-chain fees. The word Wumbo, which apparently means “large,” is a reference to an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants. These channels are named as such because they are larger than the 0.1677 BTC ($5,800) limit.OKEx is not the only crypto exchange to start experimenting with the Bitcoin Lightning Network. In July 2019, European crypto exchange Bitstamp set up its own Lightning Network node to boost the network’s capabilities. Another global exchange, Bitfinex, reportedly became the first crypto exchange to enable Lightning payments in December 2019. In September 2020, Bitfinex announced support of Lightning Network’s Wumbo channels to enable it customers to deposit and withdraw large amounts of Bitcoin.Amid Lightning Labs expanding the Lightning Network’s capabilities, more crypto exchanges have moved to integrate the protocol in recent months. In December 2020, major United States-based crypto exchange Kraken announced that it too will integrate the Bitcoin Lightning Network in 2021. OKCoin also recently announced its plans to integrate the network in the first quarter of 2021."
482,"Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a turbulent past few days after Elon Musk showed support for the cryptocurrency amid the GameStop fiasco on the equity markets. However, since that tweet, Bitcoin’s price has been correcting after the entire push through Elon Musk was retraced.Since then, Bitcoin’s price is facing a crucial hurdle at the $35,000–$35,200 area before an all-time high test. Once that area breaks and flips for support, continuation toward a new all-time high is likely.The three-hour chart shows a clear downtrend structure, with the ""Elon Musk pump"" outlier. This downward structure was established after the peak high at $42,000 earlier in the year.This downtrend has seen lower highs and lower lows, which can be seen in the chart. Therefore, there is a good possibility that this downtrend will continue. If BTC breaks the $35,000 barrier, the $38,000 resistance zone level should pose not much of a problem for the bulls. The next likely major area of resistance will be around $40,500.On the other hand, if Bitcoin’s price can’t break through $35,000, a renewed retest of the $30,000 level is on the table. Given that the $30,000 level has seen many tests since the previous all-time high, there is a good chance that this level will be lost. In this case, an even further correction toward $25,000 to $26,000 is on the table.Once again, the only indicator to watch for any further correction is the 21-week moving average (MA). In the previous bull cycle, it provided sustainable support for the entire period.If the market corrects further, however, a retest of the previous all-time high in 2017 remains unlikely. In other words, everybody and their mother will be buying there, so the market will likely not provide this opportunity.Therefore, the likelihood of another further correction to $24,000 to $26,000 is still there, and this would also fill a CME gap alongside a test of the 21-eek MA.However, such a correction depends on whether Bitcoin’s price can break through $35,000.This detailed chart and scenario show that the critical area is the $35,000 zone, which if broken, will open the door to new all-time highs.That $38,000 zone may see some short-term consolidation. But since BTC has tested this once already, it is more likely to see resistance at $40,500. Therefore, if Bitcoin’s price breaks through the $35,000 area, continuation is expected to $40,500.The bearish scenario is also straightforward, with $35,000 holding as resistance for further downside. The first support is the $32,000 area, which has been tested several times and will likely fail as support. The next area is found between $29,000 and $30,000, which has also been tested many times for support.A renewed test and falling through this level would open up the door to $25,000. This would line up with the CME gap and the 21-week MA. Meanwhile, every previous support level is confirmed as resistance, with the correction continuing to set new lower highs and lower lows.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

483,"Bitcoin (BTC) could fetch at least a $535,000 price tag if corporate buyers convert 10% of their cash reserves to the largest cryptocurrency.In one of the various conclusions from its latest report, ""Bitcoin: Preparing for Institutions,"" investment firm Ark Invest said that even a 1% allocation from S&P 500 companies would be enough to increase BTC/USD spot prices by $40,000.The findings come as institutional buyers continue to focus on Bitcoin as a long-term alternative to cash, with one transaction in particular drawing attention after $500 million left Coinbase.""Based on search volumes compared to 2017, bitcoin’s price increase seems to be driven less by hype. With bitcoin appearing to gain more trust, some companies are considering it as cash on their balance sheets,"" the report reads.In terms of the longer-term impact that corporations could have on Bitcoin's scarcity, Ark forecast that probable allocations would likely far outstrip the 1% level.""Based on daily returns across asset classes during the past 10 years, our analysis suggests that allocations to bitcoin should range from 2.55% when minimizing volatility to 6.55% when maximizing returns,"" it wrote, adding:Despite BTC price action failing to deliver a convincing continuation of its bull run in recent weeks, anticipation is building that the status quo will soon be turned on its head. As Cointelegraph reported, asset management giant Grayscale may provide the spark that reignites the market as soon as Wednesday.""There is a large and emerging group of institutions that have an enormous capital base that are reallocating to this space,” Michael Bucella, general partner at fellow investment firm BlockTower Capital, told CNBC this week.On Feb. 8, meanwhile, the largest altcoin, Ether (ETH), will join Bitcoin in seeing dedicated futures markets go live from CME Group."
484,"Gemini cryptocurrency exchange has launched an interest-earning program for customers in the United States.Dubbed Gemini Earn, the program lets customers earn up to 7.4% annual interest on all cryptocurrencies supported by Gemini, the firm announced Tuesday. The platform supports 26 cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Zcash (ZEC) and others. The program is immediately available for select Gemini customers, while a full-scale rollout is scheduled for early February.Gemini chief operating officer Noah Perlman told Cointelegraph that interest rates for each cryptocurrency are based on supply and demand in the market for borrowing that crypto. Interest is compounded and paid daily, with earnings being generated in the same cryptocurrency as the deposited funds.Gemini Earn will be run as part of the Gemini platform, enabling customers to transfer existing crypto holdings or purchase crypto to send to Gemini Earn. The program allows users to earn interest for any period of time, requiring no minimum balance.As a Trust company regulated by the New York Department of Finance, Gemini positions its new product as the only crypto interest-earning program available in all 50 states. As Gemini is not the lender or borrower, the firm’s partners like Genesis Global Capital are crucial in providing this product, Perlman noted. “Our vetted institutional lending partners, such as Genesis Global Capital, find these borrowers and lend crypto funds in exchange for an interest payment,” he said.Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss said, “We designed a program that allows our customers the ability to generate a real return on their crypto holdings without having to sell one of the best performing asset classes of the decade.”The launch of Gemini Earn comes shortly after the exchange released its new credit card in mid-January 2021, which allows users to earn crypto rewards on everyday purchases in crypto. As previously reported, Gemini is apparently planning to pursue a public listing."
485,"Bitcoin (BTC) may have traded sideways for much of last month thanks to Grayscale, but the status quo will soon change.According to data from on-chain analytics resource CryptoQuant, the price premium of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) just hit its lowest since April 2019.Grayscale has made the headlines frequently this year thanks to record BTC purchases and record demand, but despite the inflows, BTC/USD has not continued to gain.As February begins, the Trust’s purchase premium is at around $6.50, having previously been as high as $40 over the course of its existence. This historically coincides with meandering price direction, while large premiums equal large upside moves for Bitcoin.In late December, a dedicated article in technology magazine Hackernoon explained the phenomenon as being tied to releases of GBTC shares which have been subject to a customary lock-up.Once they are released, Bitcoin tends to shoot higher as customers put their profits back into BTC, while the time preceding such events corresponds to a lack of price action.“What's important to know is once these higher prices and premiums are realized after an unlocking, price goes on to consolidate. This lets the premium shrink again before its next unlocking event,” Hackernoon summarized.With the next unlocking set for Feb. 3, anticipation should be building for a continuation of the Bitcoin bull run.“This voids enables premiums to shrink again just like the nine times before,” the article continued, correctly predicting the price behavior for the second half of January.Grayscale meanwhile continues to expand its offerings as institutional interest broadly shows no signs of slowing for either Bitcoin or altcoins.This week saw its Ethereum Trust reopen after being closed since December, while Feb. 25 will see Grayscale sponsor crypto-focused event the Bloomberg Crypto Summit.GBTC had $21.8 billion in assets under management as of Feb. 1. Ether (ETH) purchases have been on pause since Dec. 10."
486,"January was a record month for Bitcoin’s price and network activity, with more than 22.3 million unique addresses actively sending or receiving BTC over 31 days.The milestone was spotted by crypto market data aggregator Glassnode, who tweeted that January had seen the highest monthly number of unique active addresses in Bitcoin’s history:#Bitcoin network activity at ATH.

In January, more than 22.3 million unique addresses were active in the network sending or receiving $BTC – the highest monthly number in Bitcoin's history to date

Chart: https://t.co/yPPOix0KFx pic.twitter.com/yjWwYbRC98January’s spike in activity beats out the previous record of more than 21 million active addresses from December 2017. Since 2017, the number of unique addresses engaging with Bitcoin has not fallen below 10 million per month.Despite the increase in unique active wallets, Glassnode also noted the number of “active entities” on the Bitcoin network has decreased significantly since spiking into new highs in early January.Glassnode defines an entity as “a cluster of addresses that are controlled by the same network entity.”Bitcoin trade volumes spiked to record levels last month as Bitcoin surged past $30,000 to post all-time highs near $42,000 on Jan. 8 before posting three weeks of aggressive range-bound consolidation.On Feb. 2, U.S.-based exchange Kraken announced it had processed more transactional volume during January 2021 than it had during all of 2019, with $56 billion worth of assets changing hands on the platform last month.The month saw numerous cryptocurrency exchanges experience outages, with Kraken and Coinbase announcing measures intended to prevent future failures in the event of surging traffic and volume."
487,"Sen. Cynthia Lummis, a long-time proponent of Bitcoin (BTC) ownership, has revealed plans to launch a Financial Innovation Caucus to educate her fellow senators on cryptocurrency and digital assets.Appearing on Anthony Pompliano’s podcast on Feb. 2, Lummis announced her intention to establish the caucus, stating:Lummis stated the caucus will first work to fight the false narrative about digital assets and crypto being used for money laundering, noting that research from blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis indicates “cryptocurrency-related crime is smaller than criminal activity with cash.”Lummis noted she recently spoke with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, whose recent comments regarding the use of crypto in illicit financing caused concerns regarding an incoming regulatory crackdown to reverberate across the cryptosphere.Lummis sought to quell the crypto community's concerns about Yellen, describing the treasury secretary as having “an open mind” about crypto. However, the senator stated: “It’s going to take a lot of work to get to where we can have an open dialogue that is free from the clutter of seeing this knee-jerk reaction to the concern that all crypto is subject to criminal activity.”Sen. Lummis purchased Bitcoin during 2013 and 2014 and has since touted it utility as a store of value. She likened Bitcoin to the permanent mineral trust fund that she oversaw while working as Wyoming’s state treasurer during the 2000s.“I was state treasurer in Wyoming during the first part of the 21st century, so I was always looking for a store of value.,"" she said. ""We have in Wyoming permanent funds that are based on extracting minerals and oil and gas from the ground. We take a severance tax [...] from minerals and invest it in a permanent fund.”“There will only be 21 million Bitcoin mined, and because it is a finite resource, I see it as a very good store of value,” Lummis concluded."
488,"Recent Bitcoin (BTC) outflows from Coinbase are reminiscent of the “proof-of-keys” days and could be a sign of a bullish future, according to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju.Data from the cryptocurrency analysis firm shows that more than 15,200 BTC, currently worth over $515 million, were withdrawn from Coinbase on Jan. 31.According to Ki Young Ju, the withdrawal “went to custody wallets that only have in-going transactions,” and was likely an “OTC deal from institutional investors” based on several identifiers.He also pointed to the fact that the split of a 15,000 BTC wallet into wallets containing 1,000-5,000 BTC increases security costs. Furthermore, most of the internal transfers are done with round amounts, like 1,000 to 5,000 Bitcoin, while this transfer included odd groupings of 1,265, 2,391, and 1,957 BTC.As to why Coinbase outflows are a bullish sign for the top cryptocurrency, Ki Young Ju linked to a previous tweet from Dec. 18 which states that “if Coinbase moves a significant amount of Bitcoins to other cold wallets, it indicates OTC deals” which are non-exchange transactions.He said:The slow inflow of institutions into the cryptocurrency sector is helping to increase the legitimacy of the crypto sector as a whole and appears to be providing a certain level of support for the price of BTC as the available supply continues to be locked away in cold custodial wallets.While the media were pointing to Bitcoin’s price drop from $42,000 to below $30,000 as a sign that the BTC bubble had popped once again, the purchase of 4,000 BTC on Feb.1 indicates that institutions have instead seen this as an opportunity to buy the dip and are taking full advantage of this buying opportunity."
489,"Bitcoin (BTC) price spent the day trading in a tight range between $32,000 and $34,000. At the time of writing, the digital asset is pinned below the descending trendline resistance and each attempt to cross above it is met by selling. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView show a price increase of 4.14% for the top cryptocurrency, which currently trades at $33,840.In light of the sideways price action, Ki Young Ju, the CEO of the cryptocurrency analysis firm CryptoQuant, spotted a potential bullish indicator that may indicate a price breakout in the near future for Bitcoin.According to Ju, more than 15,000 Bitcoin were recently withdrawn from Coinbase Pro with the outflows going “into custody wallets that only have in-going transactions,” indicating the purchases were likely “OTC deals from institutional investors.” Rallies have followed similar outflows in the past, and Ju sees this as a sign BTC will “protect $33,000 in the short-term.”Financial markets are still dealing with the antics of r/Wallstreetbets, which has expanded into the cryptocurrency sector via r/Satoshistreetbets and helped initiate the recent pumps in the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) and now XRP.After rallying 147% to trade at $0.76 overnight, XRP price corrected by 47% and currently the altcoin is trying to retake the $0.40 level.In other news, Kraken cryptocurrency exchange joined Grayscale Investments in its effort to fight back against the proposed FinCEN self-hosted wallet rule and the U.S. government’s STABLE Act.The exchange pledged $100,000 to Coin Center, a Washington D.C.-based cryptocurrency advocacy group whose focus is to educate regulators about digital assets while also advancing the rights of crypto users.Traditional markets saw increases across most sectors and this helped to recover some of the losses from Jan. 29. The S&P 500, Dow and NASDAQ have all benefited from the positive price action on Feb. 1 and closed the day up 1.61%, 0.76% and 2.5% respectively.As announced over the weekend, members of the r/Wallstreetbets investing group turned their focus to the precious metals market and pushed silver futures above $30, its highest price level since 2013.The market has since cooled off slightly, and SLV currently trades at $29.07.DeFi related tokens continue to perform well as the battle between Uniswap and Sushiswap heats up and the top two DEXs see increased trading volume, along with sharp appreciation in the pric of their native tokens.Both tokens rallied to new 2021 highs. The price of UNI is up 17% and trading at $20.44 while SUSHI is up 28% and trading at a price of $12.73Binance Coin (BNB) has been the best performing top 10 coin over the past 24-hours, currently up 12.91% and trading at a price of $49.51. Meanwhile, the NEO-based DeFi platform, Flamingo (FLM), is up 38.19% and trading at $0.305, boosted by an ongoing governance vote by token holders.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands around $1 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 62.5%."
490,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently voiced his support for Bitcoin (BTC) during a chat with Clubhouse. Musk said that his friends tried to onboard him to the Bitcoin bandwagon as early as 2013, but the world’s richest man did not take the final step. Musk admitted that he was “late to the party.”Musk also said that Bitcoin could be “on the verge of getting broad acceptance by conventional finance."" While these comments by the SpaceX founder are positive, they did not move the markets since he did not commit to buying Bitcoin as a personal investment or for the treasury reserves for his companies.However, institutional investors have continued their purchases without waiting for a deeper correction. CoinCorner CEO Danny Scott noted that recently a single entity had withdrawn $500 million worth of Bitcoin, an indication of institutional buying.While Bitcoin buyers seem to be planning to hold their positions, the same cannot be said about the pump and dump schemes that are being promoted in select altcoins. First, it was Dogecoin (DOGE) and today it is XRP’s 50% fall from $0.75 that may have left several novice traders with huge losses.These violent corrections should be a lesson to traders and remind them to follow a well thought out trading strategy instead of getting carried away by emotions and greed.Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the trend and the path of least resistance.Bitcoin has been hugging the downtrend line for the past three days, but the bulls have not been able to push and sustain the price above it. This shows that the bears are aggressively defending the higher levels.The 20-day exponential moving average ($33,412) has flattened out and the relative strength index (RSI) is near the midpoint, suggesting a balance between supply and demand.If the bears sink the price below the $31,900 support, the BTC/USD pair could drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($30,920) and then to the critical support at $28,850. A break below this level will complete a bearish descending triangle pattern that could start a deeper correction.Conversely, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above $35,000 the pair may rally to $38,520 and then to $40,000. The next leg of the up-move could start after the bulls drive the price above the all-time high at $41,959.63.The bears are defending the $1,400 overhead resistance while the bulls are buying the dips to the 20-day EMA ($1,258). This suggests that Ether (ETH) is stuck in a tightening trading range, which is likely to expand within the next few days.If the resolution happens to the downside and the bears sink the price below the uptrend line, the selling could intensify. This may result in a possible drop to the 50-day SMA ($1,005) and then to the critical support at $840.93.On the contrary, if the ETH/USD pair turns up from the current level and breaks above the $1,400 to $1,473.096 resistance zone, it will indicate the resumption of the uptrend. The pair could then rally to $1,675.While the upsloping moving averages suggest an advantage to the bulls, the negative divergence on the RSI favors the bears. As the indicators are sending mixed signals, it is better to wait for the price to complete a breakout before taking a directional bet.XRP skyrocketed to an intraday high at $0.755 today, but the long wick on the day’s candlestick shows that traders used the higher levels to aggressively close their long positions.The XRP/USD pair has plunged to the $0.3885 support. If the bears sink the price below this level, the selling could intensify and the pair could drop to the moving averages and then to $0.245, giving back all of the recent gains.A break below $0.245 could result in a fall to $0.17351. On the other hand, if the bulls can defend the $0.3885 support, the pair may again attempt to rally to $0.60.Polkadot’s (DOT) rebound on Jan. 28 fizzled out at $17.7522 on Jan. 29. The failure of the bulls to push the price to the top of the $14.7259 to $19.40 range suggests demand dries up at higher levels.The 20-day EMA ($15.41) has started to flatten out and the RSI is gradually dropping towards the center, which points to a balance between supply and demand. If the price rebounds off the $14.7259 support, the consolidation may extend for a few more days.Contrary to this assumption, a break below the $14.7259 support will be the first sign of weakness. That could pull the DOT/USD pair down to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $11.8383.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push the price above the $19.40 range. Such a move will signal the resumption of the uptrend.Cardano (ADA) broke above the downtrend line on Jan. 30, but the bulls could not push the price above the $0.38 resistance, which shows that demand dries up at higher levels.However, the positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the support line of the ascending channel. The buyers are currently attempting to defend the 20-day EMA ($0.33).A strong rebound off the current levels could reach the $0.38 overhead resistance. If the bulls can push the price above this level, the ADA/USD pair could resume the uptrend, with the next target objective at $0.48.Conversely, if the bears pull the price below the support line of the channel, the pair could drop to $0.28 and then to the 50-day SMA ($0.25).Chainlink (LINK) has not been able to sustain above the $24 level for the past few days, which suggests traders are closing their long positions on rallies.The RSI has formed a descending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close below 53. Sometimes, the patterns on the indicators project the upcoming directional move in the price.If the bears can sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($21.18), the selling could intensify and break the $20.1111 support. If that happens, the LINK/USD pair could drop to $17.7777 and then to the 50-day SMA ($16.63).This negative view will invalidate if the pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA or the $20.1111 support and sustains above the downtrend line. Such a move will enhance the prospects of the resumption of the uptrend.Litecoin (LTC) has been facing stiff resistance at the downtrend line for the past few days. The long wick on the day’s candlestick suggests every relief rally is being sold into.If the bulls fail to push the price above the downtrend line within the next few days, the possibility of a break below the $120 support increases. If that happens, the LTC/USD pair will complete a bearish head and shoulders pattern, which has a target objective of $55.However, it may not be a straight fall because the bulls will try to stall the decline at $100 and then again at $70.This negative view will be negated if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the downtrend line. Such a move will suggest that the selling pressure may have ended. On the upside, a break above $150 will suggest the bulls are making a comeback.The relief rally in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is facing stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($429), which suggests the bears are attempting to defend this level. If the price turns down and breaks below the $370 to $353 support zone, the altcoin could drop to $275.The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest the bears have a marginal edge.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, the BCH/USD pair may rally to $465 and then to $539. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair could extend its consolidation for a few more days.Binance Coin (BNB) soared above the previous all-time high at $47.2187 and hit a new high at $50.60 today. Whenever the price of an asset class makes a new all-time high, it shows that the bulls are in command.However, the long wick on today’s candlestick suggests profit-booking near the psychological resistance at $50. If the price fails to rise and sustain above $50, the BNB/USD pair could consolidate in a tight range for a few days.A breakout and close above $50 could start the next leg of the up-move that may reach $60. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $46, the pair could drop to the support line of the ascending broadening wedge pattern. A break below this support could signal the start of a deeper correction.The bulls and the bears are locked in a battle for supremacy in the $0.325 to $0.35 zone for the past three days. Although the bulls pushed Stellar (XLM) above $0.35 on Jan. 28, 30, and today, they could not sustain the higher levels, which shows traders are booking profits on rallies.However, the bulls have not allowed the price to sink below the 20-day EMA ($0.28), indicating accumulation at lower levels. The bulls are currently trying to push and sustain the price above the overhead resistance zone.If they succeed, the XLM/USD pair could rise to $0.409. A breakout and close above this resistance may start the journey towards $0.50. The rising moving averages and the RSI above 61 suggest the bulls have the upper hand.This positive view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($0.228).The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

491,"The Bitcoin (BTC) price could be headed a lot higher as more companies allocate a portion of their treasuries to the digital asset, according to new research from ARK Invest. In its annual Big Ideas report, ARK said Bitcoin’s price would increase by roughly $40,000 if “all S&P 500 companies were to allocate 1% of their cash” to BTC. This scenario isn’t entirely unrealistic as support for the BTC network continues to grow.According to the report:At current values, a $40,000 gain would put Bitcoin’s price in the vicinity of $73,000.If S&P 500 companies allocated 10% of their cash reserves to BTC, the digital currency’s price could increase by $400,000, ARK said.The influx of institutional and corporate buyers adds to the strong hands that currently make up the Bitcoin market. Industry data consistently shows that more than 60% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply hasn’t moved in a year, underscoring the conviction of long-term holders.MicroStrategy, which isn’t part of the S&P 500, has led corporate America’s push into Bitcoin. The data analytics firm has accumulated nearly 71,000 BTC at a basis price of over $1.1 billion. Its holdings are currently worth roughly $2.4 billion.MicroStrategy and payment company Square “are showing the way for public companies to deploy bitcoin as a legitimate alternative to cash,” ARK said.As of today, corporate adoption remains extremely limited compared with the number of publicly-traded U.S. companies. At last check, there were less than two-dozen publicly-listed entities holding BTC on their books. "
492,"Let’s get one thing out of the way: You will not agree with every selection on the Cointelegraph list of the Top 100 Notable People in Blockchain.In fact, you will almost certainly disagree, vehemently, with many of the people we’ve included on this year’s list.You will rage at the inclusion of [insert comedy villain here] and the exclusion of, say, Charles Hoskinson. Particularly if you are indeed Charles Hoskinson.You will seethe at the fact that Arthur Hayes is nowhere to be found. (We looked.) You'll eat your own... words because you once tweeted that John McAfee was a shoo-in.And despite your fury at the absence of the delightful Charlie Lee, and the presence of [really, that guy?], we hazard that our Top 100 is the blockchain industry’s most comprehensive, thoroughly researched... and indubitably controversial selection.Our criteria for inclusion this year recognizes that the Cointelegraph Top 100 is not a Who’s Who of crypto. Nobody is guaranteed a position based on their reputation. Instead, it references those whose choices over the last year have made a major impact on the industry, or who we expect to be particularly influential over the course of 2021.Irreverence toward the ""establishment"" in crypto, if such a thing can exist in an industry barely over a decade old, is reflected by the fact that there are an astonishing 75 new entrants on this year’s list.Even more surprising is the fact that not a single person from last year’s Top 10 kept their spot in the top bracket of this year’s list — and five of them are gone from our Top 100 completely.Our list, compiled with the input of the entire editorial team at Cointelegraph, is not an endorsement of the individuals who appear on it, nor a celebration of every achievement. We actively dislike black hat hackers, but you can’t deny the impact they’ve had on our industry.And although it’s somewhat Western-centric, that’s a deliberate choice since some of our regional editions have created lists of their own. We should also note that we had no quotas regarding diversity and inclusion, despite a robust internal debate; the list is meritocratic, although we continue to be surprised and disappointed at the pace at which underrepresented groups are entering the sector. With that said, we are encouraged by the fact that women now represent 24% of the Top 50 — a significant increase from the 10% of 2020.VISIT THE COINTELEGRAPH NOTABLE 100Our list includes 10 people from each of our 10 categories:In preparing our list of Founders, we necessarily have to choose those whose ideas have begun to come to fruition. These are people who have demonstrated that they have the patience and stamina to succeed, as well as the burning desire to innovate.The figures on our Investor list often act as a bridge between the blockchain and the traditional finance world, and the more investors join the crypto ranks, the closer the industry approaches widespread adoption.The list of top DeFi personalities attempts to cast a spotlight on this diverse list of characters. In their own — often startling — way, each of them made a contribution to the space in 2020, and many of them will continue shaping the future of DeFi.We’re talking rockstars, influencers, sports personalities, OG tech wizards, converts from traditional finance and creatives of all stripes — even a starship captain — each sharing a willingness to broadcast a common view that distributed technology is the way we move humanity forward.Some of the figures we’ve highlighted in our Media, Data & Research category are well known in the media, from crypto influencers and podcasters to cable TV hosts. Others head up data analytics firms or aggregators that help us separate the signal from the noise. And there are a few figures who toil mostly behind the scenes, heading up influential research firms and funds.The individuals we’ve highlighted in our Markets category represent the sector’s most talented, ingenious analysts. Some have the uncanny ability to forecast macro market moves with a succinct single chart posted on Twitter, while others pore over Bitcoin’s on-chain activity to develop elaborate metrics geared toward institutional and long-term investors.Those chosen for our Exchange category this year responded to scaling challenges and emerging financial models in various ways, including ramping up server capacity, improving user experience, and rolling out solutions such as the Bitcoin Lightning Network, sidechains and decentralized exchange protocols.For our Adoption category, we’ve highlighted the individuals in crypto who are creating and supporting products that are going mainstream, as well as those helping to remind us why we’re here in the first place. These figures have found genuine use cases for the relatively young digital asset class and are dedicated to solving real-world problems with cryptocurrencies.As adoption marches on, governments become ever-more involved in setting out rules of the road. Given how new crypto is and how fundamentally blockchain could decentralize data that is critical to governments functioning, the laws and regulations surrounding the industry are evolving rapidly. The individuals in our Law & Politics category come from both the public and private sectors, but they are united in that they have pushed for the most tangible legal breakthroughs for the crypto industry.Some are dedicated to rectifying some of blockchain’s flaws, while others yet are bringing privacy solutions to public ledgers and beating hackers and exploiters to the punch on vulnerable smart contracts. Bitcoin was engineered with supreme grace and elegance — it’s a marvel that will likely last centuries. But on the back of blockchain, there is more to be built, and these developers are doing just that.The Notable 100 will be released in batches of 10, counting down from #100, each day from Monday, Feb. 1 until the announcement of the Top 10 on Wednesday, Feb 10.We hope you enjoy it — despite how clearly wrong we were about the vital contributions of that-person-we-excluded-because-we’re-so-ludicrously-biased.Don’t worry, we’ll get them next year.VISIT THE COINTELEGRAPH NOTABLE 100"
493,"The r/Wallstreetbets saga which saw a group of Redditors join forces to extract billions from Wall Street hedge funds is set to be turned into a movie.As reported by Deadline on Jan. 31, a newly proposed book by The Social Network author, Ben Mezrich, was subject to a bidding war between major Hollywood studios, with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer winning out in the end.The project will reunite Mezrich with MGM producer Michael DeLuca, who also produced the Academy-Award winning film The Social Network, which told the story of the rise of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.No details have yet been released regarding the shape the film will take, but it is expected to focus on the recent “short squeeze” orchestrated by members of the r/Wallstreetbets subreddit.The film will perhaps benefit from the presence of major cryptocurrency figures, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss — founders and operators of the Gemini exchange. The Winklevoss brothers will join the project as executive producers under their Winklevoss Pictures production company.After noticing that major hedge funds were shorting GameStop (GME) shares, the Redditors saw a prime opportunity to make profits by collectively betting the other way.This resulted in the value of GME shares skyrocketing over 2,600% in January alone, with the knock-on effect of causing Wall Street shorters to lose tens of billions of dollars. One hedge fund, Melvin Capital, reported 53% losses in January and has since been forced to restructure its investment portfolio to ensure quicker exit strategies in the future.The sudden explosion of GameStop stock was all the more surprising given that most people considered it to be a dead brand; a victim of the streaming market which has effectively transferred media consumption from the TV to the internet.Even more seemingly dead companies were resurrected by Reddit’s merry band of traders, including AMC (up 905% in January), as well as Nokia, Blackberry, and Bed, Bath and Beyond.In the aftermath of the short squeeze, many trading apps suspended users from buying any more of the shares in question. The Robinhood app came under particularly heavy fire after observers noticed that 35% of its revenue came from Citadel Securities — a sister company of the same hedge fund which lost billions of dollars.This prompted outrage from all corners of the internet and beyond. Politicians from both sides of the spectrum have since voiced their concerns about the actions of RobinHood, with hundreds of thousands of viewers tuning in to watch Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez discuss the possible illegality of the firm’s actions. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has since stated that it will be looking into Robinhood’s handling of the GameStop drama, fearing that such actions will undermine market confidence."
494,"BitMEX’s parent company 100x Group has hired a financial veteran with a professional background including the Bank of China.According to a Feb. 1 blog post on BitMEX, 100x has appointed former Chinese banker Wai Kin Chim as its new independent non-executive board director.A non-executive board member participates in policymaking and planning decisions at a firm, as well as monitoring the executive directors and acting in the interest of shareholders. However, they are not part of the executive team. Best known for his chief credit officer position at the state-owned commercial bank, Bank of China, Chim brings more than 30 years of financial expertise including international banking, compliance, corporate governance and risk management.A spokesperson for 100x told Cointelegraph that Chim currently serves as an independent non-executive director at Hong Kong-based OCBC Wing Hang Bank, chairing the risk management committee. Prior to joining OCBC Wing Hang, Chim was also an independent non-executive director for Standard Chartered Bank’s Chinese division. The exec also held a senior position at Deutsche Bank.Chim reportedly was the highest-paid executive at the Bank of China, leaving his position in March 2015 amid pay cuts imposed on senior managers at Chinese lenders.The new senior hire at 100x comes shortly after the company appointed Alexander Hoptner — the former CEO of German stock exchange Börse Stuttgart — as its new CEO in January 2021. According to the latest announcement, both Hoptner and Chim will also join the board of directors at 100x as of Feb. 1, 2021.As previously reported, 100x has been actively strengthening its regulatory and compliance efforts amid an ongoing legal action brought against BitMEX by United States securities regulators. In late 2020, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed civil complaints against BitMEX, accusing the firm of offering unregistered derivatives sales to U.S. retail investors.BitMEX subsequently announced a number of measures to boost its compliance including a new collaboration with crypto intelligence firm Chainalysis and completing obligatory Know Your Customer checks. On Jan. 21, 100x joined Global Digital Finance, a major industry association advocating for the adoption of digital assets."
495,"Gene Simmons, a rock and roll legend and a known fan of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), has reaffirmed his bullish stance on crypto by purchasing several cryptos.The Kiss frontman said on Feb. 1 that he now owns several cryptocurrencies including XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE). Simmons did not hint at how much he invested and noted that his statement is not a recommendation. Not recommending any of these to anyone. But yes, I also bought Dogecoin, XRP and others. Make of it what you will.Simmons claimed that he has also bought and is still planning to purchase major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC). Simmons has emerged as a major celebrity voice supporting cryptocurrencies. In 2017, Simmons said that he was interested in Bitcoin as part of his investment strategy. “I am interested in Bitcoin, but only as a piece of the investment puzzle,” he said. Simmons’ move to invest in DOGE and XRP comes amid a massive bull run in both cryptocurrencies. As reported by Cointelegraph, both Dogecoin and XRP have been likely pumped by the controversial Reddit community r/Wallstreetbets.At publishing time, XRP is trading at $0.59, up over 32% over the past 24 hours. DOGE is trading at $0.039, surging around 41% over the past 24 hours."
496,"Bitcoin (BTC) is on the verge of seeing broader acceptance, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, said in a Clubhouse conversation on Feb. 1.Clubhouse is an exclusive audio chat social media platform that is invite-only. Members can join various conversations, akin to an online private conference.""I am late to the party but I am a supporter of #Bitcoin."" - Elon MuskDuring the conversation with Andressen Horowitz and other prominent investors, Musk was asked about his thoughts on Bitcoin.On Jan. 29, Musk put the word “Bitcoin” in his Twitter bio, causing the price of BTC to rally by more than 14% in 30 minutes.After the occurrence, Bitcoin investors and enthusiasts were highly anticipating positive comments about crypto, in general, from Musk.When asked about Bitcoin, Musk said according to industry executives who were able to listen to the chat:Industry executives were generally positive about Musk’s comment on Bitcoin. James Todar, a partner at Greymatter Capital, said:Dan Tapiero, a partner at 10T Holdings, shared a similar sentiment. He said that the richest man in the world being a Bitcoin supporter “feels good.” Tapiero wrote:As Cointelegraph reported, prominent Bitcoin investors such as billionaire Tim Draper have been asking Musk and his businesses such as Tesla to accept BTC directly, which would give Bitcoin a massive boost in global awareness. The price of Bitcoin pulled back by around 3% immediately after Musk commented about the dominant cryptocurrency.There are two reasons why the price of Bitcoin might have dropped after Elon talked about Bitcoin. First, some may have anticipated Musk to disclose his Bitcoin holdings. Second, the market might have reacted with a sell-the-news response, as the minor pullback occurred merely minutes after Musk's comments were publicized.As Cointelegraph reported, the price of Bitcoin has been showing weakness since the ""Elon pump"" to $38,000 on Friday. Traders are now closely watching technical resistance at $34,500 and $35,000 that must be broken to avoid more downside in the short term. "
497,"Over the past seven days, the crypto market saw an uptick in volatility as Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) price rallied higher simply because of social media activity. In situations like these, traders who make their investment decisions based on emotions tend to incur heavy losses and this is exactly what happened last week.Dogecoin’s (DOGE) recent pump and dump caused several new traders who bought due to FOMO to lose money within a short time and this scenario is likely to play out again as social media groups have decided that collective pumps of altcoins is a new method of investing.A similar trend currently seems to be developing in Bitcoin (BTC), which has retraced a large portion of the up-move that was caused due to the “Elon pump” on Jan. 29. This shows that barring a few emotional buyers, most professional traders may have used the rally to lighten their long positions.Stack Funds head of research Lennard Neo believes the Bitcoin miners are selling on rallies and that trend may continue as the Chinese New Year holiday approaches. Neo expects Bitcoin’s price to remain volatile in the near term.Even as Bitcoin’s price consolidates, the decentralized finance tokens continue to surge, which suggests traders' focus has shifted to the DeFi space. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that could trend in the next few days.Bitcoin’s long wick on Jan. 29 shows the bears aggressively sold the rally above the downtrend line of the descending triangle. That was followed by a Doji candlestick pattern on Jan. 30, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears.The failure of the bulls to push the price above the downtrend line today has attracted further selling. The bears are currently trying to sustain the price below the 20-day exponential moving average ($33,395).If they succeed, the BTC/USD pair may drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($30,631) and then to $28,850.A breakdown and close below $28,850 will complete the bearish descending triangle pattern that has a target objective at $15,741. However, it is unlikely to be a straight fall because the bulls will try to arrest the decline at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $25,897.42 and again at the 61.8% retracement at $22,106.73.This negative view will invalidate if the price turns up from the current level or rebounds off the $28,850 support and sustains above the downtrend line. Such a move will suggest strong accumulation at lower levels, which could result in a rise to $40,000.The 4-hour chart shows the breakout above the downtrend line met with strong selling pressure and the price quickly retracted back into the triangle.The failure of the bulls to push the price back above the downtrend line has attracted selling and the bears have pulled the price below the 20-EMA. The bulls are currently attempting to defend the 50-SMA but if this support also cracks, the pair may start its journey towards $28,850.This negative view will invalidate if the price rebounds off the current level and rises above the downtrend line. Such a move could push the price to $38,519.63.Ether (ETH) broke above the $1,400 resistance on three previous occasions but the bulls could not sustain the breakout, which shows profit-booking at higher levels. However, the positive thing is that the bulls have not given up much ground in the past few days. This shows the bulls are accumulating on dips.The ETH/USD pair had formed a Doji candlestick pattern on Jan. 30, indicating uncertainty. That indecision has resolved to the downside today and the pair may now drop to the 20-day EMA ($1,253), which is likely to act as strong support.A bounce off the support will suggest the sentiment remains bullish and traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then try to resume the uptrend. If the bulls can drive the price above the $1,400 to $1,473.096 resistance zone, the pair could rally to $1,675 and then to $2,000.This bullish view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA and the uptrend line. In such a case, the pair may drop to the 50-day SMA ($990).The 4-hour chart shows the formation of an ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakout and close above $1,440. This bullish setup has a target objective of $1,768.However, the moving averages have flattened out and the relative strength index (RSI) is just below the midpoint, which suggests a balance between supply and demand.If the bears sink the price below the support line of the triangle, it will invalidate the pattern. The next support on the downside is the uptrend line and then $1,050.Uniswap (UNI) is in a strong uptrend that has pushed the RSI deep into the overbought territory. While the RSI can remain overbought for an extended period, traders should be cautious as corrections from overbought levels can be swift and sharp.The first support on the downside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $15.3963. If the price rebounds off this level, it will suggest the bulls are aggressively buying the dips and are not waiting for a deeper correction to enter.If the bulls can push the price above $20.5612, the UNI/USD pair could rally to $28 and then to $32. Both moving averages are rising and the RSI is above 79, indicating the bulls are in control.However, if the correction deepens below $15.3963, the next support is at the 20-day EMA ($11.85), which is near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $12.2054. A deeper fall usually delays the start of the next leg of the uptrend.The 4-hour chart shows the pair has made a flag pattern. If the bulls can push the price above the flag, the uptrend could resume and the pair may rally to $22 and then to $25.Another possibility is that the pair continues to correct and drop to the 20-EMA. If the price rebounds off this support, it will suggest the sentiment remains positive and the bulls are buying on minor dips.During the current leg of the uptrend, the price has repeatedly taken support at the 20-EMA. Therefore, a break below the 20-EMA will suggest the bullish sentiment may be waning and could result in a drop to $15.3963 and then to the 50-SMA.Cosmos (ATOM) has formed a cup and handle pattern that will complete on a breakout and close above $8.877. If the bulls can propel the price above the $10.20 resistance, the uptrend could begin.The first target on the upside is $11.151 and the next level to watch out for is $13.554. The rising moving averages and the RSI’s bounce from the midpoint suggest the bulls have the upper hand.If the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($7.65), the ATOM/USD pair may remain range-bound between $6.603 and $8.877 for a few more days.The bullish assumption will be negated if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 50-day SMA ($6.4). Such a move may pull the price down to $5.50 and then to $4.50.The 4-hour chart shows the bulls have pushed the price above the downtrend line of the descending triangle. This has invalidated the bearish setup but the bulls are struggling to thrust the price above the $8.877 resistance.The flat moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest the pair may remain range-bound between $8.877 and $6.726 for some more time. If the bulls can propel the price above $8.877, the pair could rise to $10.20, while a break below $6.726 will suggest the bears are trying to make a comeback.Compound (COMP) completed a rounding bottom pattern on Jan. 29 when it broke and closed above the $272.61 resistance. This reversal setup has a target objective of $464.60.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest bulls are in command. After the breakout from a pattern, the price usually retraces and retests the breakout level, but if the trend is very strong, it only consolidates or enters a minor correction before resuming the up-move.If the COMP/USD pair rebounds off $272.61, it will suggest the bulls have flipped the previous resistance into support. That could then act as a launchpad for the next leg of the uptrend.This positive view will invalidate if the bears sink and sustain the price below $272.61. Such a move will indicate profit-booking at higher levels and a lack of buying on dips.The 4-hour chart shows traders booked profits near $340 but the correction was short-lived as the price turned up from $304.84. If the bulls can now drive the price above $340, the pair may rally to $405.On the other hand, if the price again turns down from $340, the pair may drop to the 20-EMA. If the price rebounds off this support, the bulls will again try to resume the up-move, but if the bears sink the pair below the 20-day EMA, a drop to $272.61 will be on the cards.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

498,"On Dec. 8, 2020, Citigroup, one of the largest banks in the world, downgraded MicroStrategy'ss stock (MSTR). Since then, MSTR stock is up 113.27% from $289.45 to $617.31, as the price of Bitcoin (BTC) rallied.In the same period, the Citigroup stock has declined slightly by 0.63%, from $58.36 to $57.99.MicroStrategy has been investing its treasury holdings in Bitcoin, making BTC is treasury reserve asset. Currently, it is the biggest public company holder with over 70K BTC worth roughly $2.4 billion at today's prices. Moreover, on Dec. 9, 2020, MicroStrategy announced raising $550 million in capital from convertible bonds.In an official statement, MicroStrategy explicitly said that it intends to invest in Bitcoin with the proceeds of the bond. This is also the statement that is said to have triggered Citi to downgrade MicroStrategy. The statement read:At the time, Citigroup analyst Tyler Radke issued a sell rating. He acknowledged that the return on MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investment has been “impressive,” but said the market is overpricing the core business of the firm. He wrote:Since December 2020, however, the price of Bitcoin saw an explosive rally. While the skepticism toward the core business of MicroStrategy could have some merit, BTC saw a rally of over 100% in the last month of the year.In just December, Bitcoin rallied from $18,319 to over $42,000 on Binance, outperforming most assets in both the stock market and the crypto market.MicroStrategy remains an important multi-billion dollar business intelligence firm with strong core business.But as long as the price of Bitcoin continues to increase in the near term, it will likely have a positive impact on the stock price of MSTR.Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, remains fully confident in the company’s position on Bitcoin, and often buying the price dips. In the fourth quarter financial results for 2020, Saylor wrote:"
499,"The sudden rise of stocks like GameStop (GME) have shined a positive light on Bitcoin (BTC), as more retail investors look to “rail against” the financial status quo, according to Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino.Bitcoin’s price peaked north of $38,500 on Friday, just as U.S. stocks concluded their worst week of trading since October. The divergence between BTC and stocks was partly due to a massive short squeeze of institutional investors by a Reddit group called r/WallStreetBets. The Reddit buying frenzy was centered around GameStop, the video game and consumer electronics retailer.Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, also added the Bitcoin symbol to his Twitter page, possibly signaling his newfound support of the digital currency.Paolo Ardoino believes the GameStop saga is only the beginning of a mass revolt against the financial status quo and that Bitcoin stands to benefit significantly from this narrative. “Bitcoin is ascendant again as the GameStop issue takes center stage,” Ardoino tells Cointelegraph. “As advocates for retail investors rail against the current structure and practices of financial markets, it is important to note that much of the work being done in the blockchain space has been inspired by these barriers.”He continues:The retail crowd was dealt a significant blow last week after Robinhood – a trading platform that supposedly empowers the little guy – suspended trading of GME and other stocks over fears of extreme volatility. A class-action lawsuit was filed against Robinhood shortly thereafter. Ardoino isn’t the only one who thinks Bitcoin will benefit from the GME short squeeze. Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of billion-dollar hedge fund SkyBridge Capital, believes GME is “more proof of concept that Bitcoin is going to work.”Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz called the GME melt-up a “giant endorsement of DeFi,” or decentralized finance, which represents one of the largest use cases for blockchain technology."
500,"For example, just last week, when the currency was hovering around the $30,000 threshold, a whole host of pundits was warning investors to brace for impact, suggesting that the premier crypto asset was on the verge of a correction and could once again dip to around the $20,000 region.However, in just one day, Bitcoin was once again playing with the bulls, retesting the $38,500 limit, only to witness a selloff and eventually settle around the $33,500 region. While for most crypto veterans that might have been another day at the office, others branded the upsurge as “Elon’s Candle,” which relates to Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, who included “Bitcoin” in his Twitter bio as well as sent out the following cryptic message “in retrospect, it was inevitable” to his 40 million-odd followers online.Regardless of the cause, has the recent price volatility scared off institutional investors, or are they still looking to buy Bitcoin? But if they are, it is strange to see BTC continuing to hover between the $30,000–$40,000 range amid reports of big-name players lapping up sizable sums of Bitcoin. For example, on Jan. 22, when BTC dipped by 15%, MicroStrategy announced yet another BTC purchase deal, worth around $10 million.On the subject, George Donnelly, CEO of Panmoni — a commerce system for Bitcoin Cash — told Cointelegraph that there is absolutely no doubt in anyone’s mind as to whether institutions are still looking to buy Bitcoin, saying:Furthermore, he opined that a core reason as to why BTC is not able to break out is because the currency’s developers have “consciously limited network throughput for ideological reasons” and even attempted to divert use into its layer-two networks, thus reducing the ecosystem’s security. Even then, he does believe that in the coming three months, the currency “will top the $40K mark.”With another $2-trillion stimulus package seemingly on its way thanks to the new United States President, Joe Biden, and the Federal Reserve, a lot of hype is once again being generated around crypto, especially as an increasing amount of people are beginning to understand the future implications of such uncontrolled money printing and how it can devalue the U.S. dollar to unprecedented levels.Filipe Castro, co-founder of Utrust — a crypto-enabled e-commerce platform — told Cointelegraph that the continued expansion, or rather dilution, of the U.S. dollar money supply pool is going to sooner or later bring into perspective the effects of hidden inflation into the American economy, adding:He further highlighted that institutions don’t typically directly trade in the market but instead purchase from a custodian intermediary, with the latter usually securing the necessary liquidity beforehand, thus minimizing immediate market influence upon the entry of large buyers.What this means in layman’s terms is that a surge in demand is reflected asynchronously over time, and what’s more, it comes in large periodic variations instead of a swift outcome from the latest announcements. “It is likely thus that any future surges will take time to manifest and will do so in large and sharp swings,” he added.While one may be tempted to believe that mainstream interest in crypto may be finally dying out, it’s worth bearing in mind that institutional purchase cycles work very differently from the activity of individual traders and smaller institutions.For example, Castro highlighted only a few institutions have actually taken an active position on Bitcoin, including some family offices. Not only that, it should be noted that approval procedures relating to new assets and risk assessments can usually take months or years to complete and represent a completely new investment paradigm for many traditional investors.On the issue, Lennix Lai, director of financial markets for cryptocurrency exchange OKEx, pointed out to Cointelegraph that as the world’s global reserve currency, the U.S. dollar, becomes increasingly weaker, many institutions are turning to other assets such as BTC for its undeniable potential in regard to capital appreciation, saying:That being said, COVID-19 virus mutations, a slow rollout of vaccinations, global lockdowns and rising unemployment are adding to the ongoing economic uncertainty — something that has the potential to spill over into various financial markets, including crypto, as was previously seen over the course of the last 12 months.Related: Risk it for the Bitcoin: Has BTC matured to be a safe investment play?On the issue, Nischal Shetty, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, reiterated that the reason why an increasing number of funds are continuing to explore Bitcoin is that it is turning into a legitimate hedge against inflation, the effects of which he believes are bound to be felt eventually as the global money pool continues to be diluted. He added: “As inflation increases, we believe that there will be more inflow of institutional investors buying into Bitcoin.”Castro stated that institutional interest is only just beginning and that recent announcements should simply be viewed as a “wake-up call” for other players who haven’t yet been able to understand the proposition that has been put forth in front of them. “This is yet far from the widespread institutional [interest] that is to come. We are sure to see a higher ceiling if more and larger institutions diversify into BTC and other cryptocurrencies,” he added.While on paper there may be a host of ways to analyze and attempt to predict the price of BTC, the fact of the matter is that it is pretty much impossible to guess the price action of an asset with any sort of certainty. However, there are a few indicators we can look at in order to glean its potential valuation.For example, Lai pointed out that based on historical data related to BTC’s performance post-halvings, it could be close to breaking out to $50,000 soon and even surging as high as $100,000 by April 2021.On the subject, Castro believes that there is still no accurate model to describe BTCs fundamental behavior, adding that the only framework that he actually considers when evaluating BTC is PlanB’s stock-to-flow model, which, if one is to believe, will see the premier cryptocurrency surge to anywhere between the $100,000–$288,000 region before the end of 2021.Related: Believing, not seeing: Institutions still predict $100K Bitcoin priceLastly, another reason why making such predictions is so tough in Shetty’s opinion is that with every jump in Bitcoin’s price, an increasing amount of selling pressure seems to be coming from long-term investors: “These are the investors who take long positions and want to dilute at certain historic price points. $40,000 seemed to have been that historic price point where a lot of old Bitcoin holders decided to liquidate.”Bitcoin (BTC) is proving to be one of the biggest mysteries of the decade, and anyone who claims to know where the currency might be heading is most likely deluding themselves at this point.

501,"During this first wave of decentralized finance projects and services, users have been more than willing to part with their funds. It is very similar to how decentralized exchanges work, as convenience seems to trump privacy and security in DeFi. Just because some platforms offer a high annual percentage yield does not mean anyone should give up control of their funds.Considering that DeFi is designed to be built on blockchain technology, there is no reason for go-betweens, intermediaries or fees. Unfortunately, these aspects are all present in a lot of solutions today. Regrettably, users have to pay to deposit funds and withdraw them again afterward. Concepts like these will eventually be the downfall for DeFi unless developers address them soon.Uniswap, currently the fourth-largest Ethereum DeFi project by total value locked, shows how noncustodial DeFi works. The DEX never takes control of user funds — not even when adding liquidity to trading pairs. Its downside is that the escalating Ethereum gas fees hamper it. Using Uniswap is very easy, but paying over $20 to move funds in and out is unacceptable.Ultimately, the end goal of DeFi is to let crypto enthusiasts earn a passive revenue stream without contracts or platforms taking custody of funds. Several projects already explore that option, but there is room for further improvements.In the current landscape, interfacing with decentralized finance relies on trusting smart contracts that may need an external audit. Unfortunately, this has given rise to a growing number of scams, rug pulls and projects suffering from hacks or other attacks. It makes the entire industry look weak and unprofessional.A CipherTrace report from November 2020 confirms that half of the 2020 cryptocurrency-related hacks were due to insecure DeFi protocols or scams — an astonishing development — yet people keep pouring money into unknown projects. While exchanges lose more funds than decentralized finance projects, these statistics need to improve quickly.Related: Roundup of crypto hacks, exploits and heists in 2020Having the ability to earn up to 12% passive interest on one’s existing crypto holdings is a lot more appealing — especially when there are no lock-in periods for funds, as you can take money out of a solution at any time. It makes for a smarter, safer, more passive approach to putting one’s crypto assets to work. While an APY of up to 12% may not seem significant when compared with returns of up to 1,000%, it involves less risk and trust. I know where I’d put my money.More importantly, a solution such as this comes with a peer-to-peer marketplace. Users looking to make loan offers have many options to choose from without requiring approval from intermediaries. Combined with a platform’s approach to insurance and creating a protection fund — as well as thorough audits — there is a lot to appreciate from this “second-gen” DeFi protocol. Moreover, support for more digital assets has to become the norm in decentralized finance.A popular trend in the current DeFi landscape is providing liquidity or liquidity protocol token farming. The concept has gained momentum thanks to Uniswap and other automated market maker platforms. The biggest drawback is that users are parting with two tokens and their balances to provide liquidity.For example, if one wants to provide Uniswap liquidity, you need Ether (ETH) and Tether (USDT), or Dai and MKR, and so forth. For newcomers, this creates a big hurdle to overcome. This requirement of having to own the “correct asset” to partake in LP farming will not survive much longer. A new solution needs to be found, and LP grouping will make a significant impact.LP grouping ensures that users only need to own one “asset” of the liquidity pair to provide liquidity. The smart contract can match them with other users who have the opposite asset. Creating a “grouped pool” to match these users will significantly boost overall DeFi participation and reduce the risks of providing liquidity.An extra benefit is that LP grouping entitles users to earn compounding interest on their original asset and earn platform-native tokens. It is a curious concept that will make users more “loyal” to the platform of their choice. This is certainly an option worth exploring for anyone serious about advancing DeFi to the next stage. I hope to see more initiative involving LP grouping — or concepts that can perhaps improve upon it — pop up in the coming months.The same applies to issuing native DeFi tokens as governance assets. More often than not, some tokens serve a speculative purpose first and foremost. Some platforms take a bolder approach by actively separating their utility and governance tokens. A dual-token approach is the way forward, and proper boundaries need to be established by DeFi providers. Dual tokens can also boost liquidity provision and trading volume when executed correctly.Similar to how Bitcoin evolved from “play money” to the world’s leading cryptocurrency, DeFi platforms need to undergo an evolution. That will only happen by building new infrastructure and growing the overall community.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

502,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is showing overall weakness as it struggles to establish $34,000 as a support level. Overall, BTC appears to be stagnating without signs of a short-term relief rally, leading traders to be cautious.One concerning trend is that the volume of Bitcoin has been stagnating along with its price, apart from the “Elon pump” on Jan. 29. This trend indicates that there is an overall drop in buyer demand since the $42,000 top despite BTC hovering in the low $30,000 region.On Jan. 29, the price of Bitcoin rose to as high as $38,461 on Binance after Tesla CEO and the world's richest man, Elon Musk, ostensibly showed support for Bitcoin.However, before this rally, on-chain analysts were already warning that the momentum of Bitcoin was slowing.Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, for example, pinpointed the high selling pressure from Bitcoin miners as a sign of a short-term bearish scenario.Although the price of Bitcoin briefly surged 14%, it snapped back down to sub-$34,000 within 24 hours. Hence, weakening on-chain indicators were likely a warning that BTC would retrace most of its ""Elon pump"" gains. Ki wrote before the rally:Whales likely sold as the price of Bitcoin abruptly surged to the $38,000 resistance level, causing a sharp correction.With shaky on-chain indicators and some selling pressure coming from miners, traders are also showing caution about longing BTC/USD in the near term. A pseudonymous trader known as “Salsa Tekila” said that he is not using leverage until Bitcoin breaks out or drops back to $30,000. He said:Meanwhile, another popular pseudonymous trader known as “Byzantine General” argues that the rally is broken. Hence, even if Bitcoin is bullish in the macro picture, more downside is possible until it sees a convincing breakout on lower time frames. He noted:Traders and technical analysts are closely observing Bitcoin’s reaction to the $34,500 to $35,000 range.If Bitcoin breaks out of it with strength, momentum, and high volume, then the probability of a short-term trend reversal rises.However, if Bitcoin struggles to retest the $34,500 resistance level and continues to stagnate in the $33,000 region, the risk of a further breakdown to the $33,000 support remains.Additional signs that BTC price could see another pullback include the Crypto Fear and Greed index remaining at ""extreme greed"" levels and Google searches for ""Bitcoin"" dropping by 50% since multi-year highs seen earlier this month. "
503,"Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a very volatile week, as the price of Bitcoin jumped around from $32,000 to $38,500 and back toward $33,000 in a matter of 24 hours. The initial spike to $38,500 happened in minutes after Elon Musk added #Bitcoin to his Twitter profile.However, no follow-up of that price movement was seen on the charts as Bitcoin dropped substantially in the following hours. Currently, the $34,500 area is a significant resistance zone to break through if the market wants to sustain the bullish momentum.The levels that are critical to watch are highlighted in the chart above. Simply put, $38,000 must break for the rally to continue. Flipping this level for support opens the door to new all-time highs.However, the surge couldn’t be sustained yesterday. After the $38,000 level's failure, the $34,000 level couldn’t provide the heavily needed support for further upward momentum.Therefore, the ""Elon Musk pump"" can be considered an outlier, and the general trend continues. This is a downtrend since the peak high at $42,000 that most likely will continue unless Bitcoin’s price can break through $34,500 and flip it into support.One of the primary arguments for more Bitcoin downside would be the recovering U.S. Dollar Currency Index (DXY). This index shows a potential bottoming formation as a bullish divergence is seen at the significant 90-point level.After this, the bullish divergence will be confirmed through a higher low, indicating that more upside is likely. Remarkably, the previous relief rally on the DXY Index in September caused a 20% correction for Bitcoin. However, since that relief rally, the DXY Index has shown massive weakness, one of the significant variables for the enormous increase of Bitcoin’s price to $42,000.However, February isn’t the best month for equities. The same can be concluded about Bitcoin, as February 2018 was when Bitcoin crashed to $6,000 after hitting its previous all-time high.Therefore, a rebounding DXY could add to the bearish sentiment for Bitcoin in February as well.Historical charts show previous market behavior with many patterns being cyclical. When Bitcoin's dominance topped out in December, massive surges were seen across the altcoin market. However, after such an enormous rally, a healthy correction would not come as a surprise to test previous resistance levels.Those tests would mean a bounce for Bitcoin dominance in February, which may open the door for a huge run for the entire crypto market from March onwards.The critical levels to watch are easy to see in the chart above. First, Bitcoin’s price has to reclaim the $34,500 level as support to sustain bullish momentum. If that happens, the level at $38,000 will be retested. Most likely, that test will result in a breakout above $38,000 toward the all-time high. However, if Bitcoin’s price can’t break through $34,500, further downward momentum is likely, as the chart shows. In that perspective, the critical level to watch is the $30,000 region. If that fails to sustain support (after numerous tests already), I expect a drop toward $25,000 and the 21-Week MA.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

504,"Tim Draper, the billionaire Bitcoin (BTC) investor who also invested early in Tesla, reacted to the company's CEO and world's richest man, Elon Musk, adding #Bitcoin to his Twitter bio to join the likes of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.Draper, who holds around 30,000 BTC according to reports, told Musk that he would like to pay for the Tesla cybertruck with BTC while promoting his Bitcoin payment processor portfolio company OpenNode. He said:On Jan. 29, Bitcoin proceeded to rally by 14% in merely 30 minutes shortly after Elon Musk's Bitcoin support began circulating on social media. Many speculated that Musk could have been the high-net-worth investor behind the massive Bitcoin accumulation on Coinbase in the past week.In the past several days, the premium on Coinbase skyrocketed to around $200, compared to Binance. This usually indicates significant buying activity from U.S. investors.However, Musk did not follow up on the bio change, and overnight, the rally reversed. Bitcoin rose from $33,000 to over $38,000, and dropped back down to $33,000.Draper likely tweeted at Musk due the interest in Bitcoin from Musk and the positive market sentiment around BTC.In a recent interview with CNBC, Draper said that he is actually buying more Bitcoin. Draper also said that he does not intend to sell BTC in the future, expressing his strong belief in Bitcoin as a “currency of the future.” He said:On-chain data shows that Draper isn't the only one focused on long term gains.  In fact, ""HODLing"" activity, which indicates the intent of Bitcoin investors to hold BTC for a long time, is at record highs.Bitcoin is increasingly becoming considered as a store of value and an alternative to gold as a safe-haven asset. In recent months, though, the correlation and inverse correlation between Bitcoin, gold and stocks have been decreasing. In addition to the massive price gains, the fear of inflation and the large injection of liquidity by central banks have stirred massive interest among institutional and high-net-worth investors.But while accepting BTC is becoming increasingly common, the question remains whether Bitcoin would ever be used as a currency and a medium of exchange like the dollar today.Ironically, when the price of Bitcoin is in a clear uptrend, investors are less likely to sell or spend their BTC. Draper himself is suggesting that he will probably pay the $40,000 for the Cybertruck with dollars rather than the ""currency of the future.""However, if Bitcoin price stabilizes in the future at a high enough price level and sees lower volatility, then BTC could become more compelling for everyday payments.Meanwhile, as the network gains more users and must scale, the Bitcoin blockchain network may ultimately become inefficient to use for everyday payments on the first layer. At that point, second-layer scaling solutions, like Lightning Network and sidechains like Liquid, for example, may become the blockchain ""apps"" for processing small payments instantly. Such interoperable platforms will likely have their own tradeoffs with varying degrees of trustlessness, privacy and decentralization."
505,"Bitcoin has often been described as the “digital gold” of the 21st century, but is the cryptocurrency truly reliable as a new safe haven against financial uncertainty and inflation? The question is a difficult one to answer, but the actions of a number of major institutions and the sentiments of some well-renowned investment managers suggest that Bitcoin (BTC) is becoming more attractive as a hedge against these fears.Business analytics firm MicroStrategy has led the institutional charge into Bitcoin over the past six months, having purchased more than $1 billion worth of BTC after adopting the cryptocurrency as its primary treasury reserve asset. The company now holds approximately 70,784 BTC.MicroStrategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor, has been abundantly clear in his assertion that the preeminent cryptocurrency is a superior store of value over fiat money, and he’s put his Bitcoin where his mouth is since August 2020.Meanwhile, Grayscale Investments has been vacuuming up Bitcoin in recent months and has firmly established itself as the largest digital asset manager in the world. Grayscale’s Bitcoin holdings are a significant contributor to its overall portfolio, with its roughly 648,000 BTC valued at over $20 billion, according to the latest data from the firm.Following in the footsteps of these proverbial Bitcoin trailblazers, SkyBridge Capital launched its own Bitcoin fund in December 2020. Skybridge was founded by American financier and former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci, who has delivered some very bullish statements about Bitcoin’s future as a safe-haven asset.Scaramucci and SkyBridge executive Brett Messing penned an op-ed published by CNN that portrays BTC as an increasingly attractive option for long-term investors looking for shelter from inflation. The pair said that increased regulation, improved infrastructure and financial institutions offering exposure to cryptocurrencies have “made bitcoin investments as safe as owning bonds and commodities like gold, which are also used to balance portfolios.”Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency space have been thrust into mainstream consciousness once again as BTC, Ether (ETH) and other altcoins have hit all-time highs over the past two months. What remains to be seen is if Bitcoin will indeed become less volatile and live up to the hopes of Scaramucci, Saylor and others who see the cryptocurrency becoming a new-age safe-haven asset.There has been an overarching sentiment that the current cryptocurrency boom is inherently different from previous periods of considerable growth. Driven by a force of institutional interest, cryptocurrencies are seemingly becoming a more reputable investment for individuals and institutions alike.Pavel Matveev, CEO of cryptocurrency payments firm Wirex, told Cointelegraph that the perception of Bitcoin may well be changing despite the fact that it still retains its notoriety for extreme price volatility.Matveev said that the price of Bitcoin is still three times more volatile than the S&P 500 index, while more recent haywire movements in value have been driven by macroeconomic factors like the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting fiscal measures by governments to address the situation:A pertinent question for many is whether Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ether are now becoming more trustworthy, long-term investments amid continued economic uncertainty. Matveev noted that institutions, which are typically long-term holders, will have made informed decisions when looking to invest in BTC.Bitcoin’s positive track record for long-term appreciation has been a driver of interest from institutions, and Matveev also noted that some publicly listed payments companies have committed to integrating Bitcoin into their core activities, which adds further credence to the performance of BTC’s price. However, he conceded that this “doesn’t change Bitcoin’s high market volatility in the short-term” but at least makes it an eligible investment.Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com — an exchange and crypto card issuer — noted to Cointelegraph the impact that institutional investment is having on the cryptocurrency markets and suggested that their continued involvement could bring balance to the space: “Investing in Bitcoin today is different than it was in 2017, when it was primarily retail-led and thus prone to more dramatic market movements.” He added:Marszalek also highlighted the fact that some renowned traditional financial asset management firms like Fidelity and JPMorgan Chase have started to advocate for clients to have a 2% to 5% exposure to cryptocurrency in their portfolios. He believes it’s evidence that the tide is shifting: “There’s no doubt that perception of BTC has turned a corner. As a result BTC is safer than it used to be as a long-term hedge, but still carries risk like any other investment.”As interest in the space continues unabated, questions around regulation are still a prominent point of discussion in the potential long-term adoption and appreciation of cryptocurrencies. Wirex’s Matveev agreed that regulation could well have an influence on cryptocurrencies being considered conventional, long-term investments in the next few years, adding further:Renowned hedge fund manager Ray Dalio also waded into the Bitcoin conversation at the end of January in a personal post on LinkedIn. Dalio is well-known as a proponent for Gold as a long-term investment and store of value. In his essay which he penned in an effort to avoid ‘media misinterpretation’, Dalio described a number of reasons why he believes Bitcoin has become an “alternative gold-like asset”. At the same time, Dalio believes that the limited supply of Bitcoin is a point of contention, as other cryptocurrencies that fulfil a similar role could negate its finite supply.While he noted the apparent success of Bitcoin as a new invention in the decade since its inception, Dalio also highlighted the fact that governments and banks will not simply let a competitive system upset their control on the global economy especially when it comes to the ‘privacy’ that Bitcoin affords users:With his firm operating across multiple jurisdictions, Marszalek has direct experience working with regulators, and he highlighted its base in Malta as a prime example of the potential benefits of clear, fair regulatory parameters: “2020 was a year where regulation for cryptocurrencies advanced quite a lot. [...] Malta is one of the few jurisdictions in the EU that have developed a clear digital assets regulatory framework to protect investors.”While the outlook for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies markets is in a very positive space, there are still prevailing risks associated with investing in the space. The cryptocurrency market is still in its infancy and, as highlighted above,  some areas still need to be addressed before Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would truly become tried and trusted long-term investments."
506,"On Jan. 29 Bitcoin (BTC) price briefly rallied to $38,500 before retracing the move and spending the majority of the day struggling to reclaim $35,000. The wild breakout in Bitcoin price has partially been attributed to Elon Musk changing his Twitter profile to simply “#Bitcoin,” which Musk subsequently followed up with a cryptic tweet saying “In retrospect, it was inevitable.”Dogecoin (DOGE) also continued to make waves across Twitter and with crypto traders. After reaching a new all-time high at $0.078 on Jan. 28, DOGE price corrected by 41% before rebounding to trade at $0.045.Developments related to DOGE and r/Wallstreetbets led FTX crypto exchange to create a Wall Street Bets (WSB) index which tracks the price of Nokia (NOK), BlackBerry (BB), AMC Theaters (AMC), GameStop (GME), Silver (SLV), DOGE, and the FTX Token (FTT) using a weighted average of their prices.The exploits of the popular Reddit group have also not gone unnoticed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, which announced that it will be taking a closer look at how Robinhood handled the trading of GME stock on its platform.Despite the recent volatility, institutional investors continue to show an increased interest in Bitcoin and are willing to pay a premium to get exposure to CME’s Bitcoin futures contracts.Even selling pressure from Bitcoin miners, who have been selling at levels not seen since BTC price topped out at $14,000 in July 2019, has not been able to satisfy increasing demand. Unlike previous years, mass selling from miners is not negatively affecting the long-term price of BTC, as shown by data from CryptoQuant.According to Lennard Neo, the head of research at Stack Funds, the current miner sell-off is likely to continue in the near-term due to the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday.Neo said:Growing interest from institutions and the emergence of DeFi are big drivers of Bitcoin price growth. As the market heads into the Chinese New Year holiday, the key level of support to watch is now $34,000 while a move higher is likely to face resistance at $38,000.The $4.9 billion worth of BTC futures that expired on Jan. 29 appears to have little effect on the market as this past week’s Robinhood ordeal is bringing more attention to the cryptocurrency industry.The traditional markets faced a new wave of pressure which led to the worst weekly performance for the S&P 500. The Dow, NASDAQ and S&P 500 all finished the day negative, down 2.03%, 2.0% and 1.93% respectively.While Bitcoin price struggled to hold the $34,000 level, DOGE made its way into the top-10 and a number of altcoins saw bullish breakouts.XRP and Stellar (XLM) have both rose by roughly 9% in the past 24-hours, while Voyager Token (VGX) continued to climb higher, currently up 70% and trading at $1.77.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.01 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 63.5%."
507,"When Bitcoin's (BTC) price dropped 10% to $29,150 on Jan. 27, something unusual happened with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) BTC futures contracts. As the price fell, these CME Bitcoin futures traded at a 1% discount to Coinbase, which signaled a disarrangement between both markets.Good morning.

Bitcoin spot has almost full retraced the weekly.

CME bitcoin futs are both backwardian and expire Friday. That is all.Immediately, traders suggested that futures contracts, which were set to expire in 48-hours, were responsible for the price dump. Now, before rushing to quick conclusions, one should note that every short sale needs a buyer (long) of the same size.Thus, there can not be an open interest imbalance. Moreover, futures contracts can be extended (rolled over) for a future date, as long as its holder has enough margin to cover it.Instead of assuming that one singular factor impacted Bitcoin’s price, it’s better to analyze the intraday movements of both markets (CME futures and spot exchanges).The futures premium (or basis) measures the premium of longer-term futures contracts to the current spot (regular markets) levels. Whenever this indicator fades or turns negative, this is an alarming red flag. This situation is also known as backwardation and indicates bearish sentiment.These fixed-month contracts usually trade at a slight premium, indicating that sellers request more money to withhold settlement longer. On healthy markets, futures should trade at a 5% to 15% annualized premium, otherwise known as contango.The unalignment between each market could have been caused by long contracts liquidations driven by traders with insufficient margin, thin order books, or an intense price action ahead of the remaining spot markets.Therefore, this data by itself does not uncover a cause or a consequence. Furthermore, a similar movement took place on Jan. 18.Take notice of how the CME BTC premium collapsed to a negative 1% despite no apparent volatility taking place on the BTC spot exchanges. It is safe to say that this event held zero relation to the market's price action.By analyzing the Jan. 27 crash on a more granular view, it is possible to determine whether the negative CME premium preceded the market volatility.The above data levels show that instead of acting as a leading indicator, the CME Bitcoin futures premium plunged much later in the day. As Bitcoin tested the $31,800 resistance, the sell pressure at CME continued, causing the momentarily price difference.Multiple reasons could be behind this effect, so comparing the intraday price on multiple exchanges might explain if CME led the downturn.To summarize, there is no evidence of any price anticipation by the CME Bitcoin futures. These markets are incredibly arbitrated and will typically move in tandem. Moreover, the usual premium might face some momentary discrepancies similar to those that occurred on Jan. 18, regardless of Bitcoin's volatility at the time.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

508,"Sentiment plays a major role in the short-term price action of an asset. This truth was demonstrated today when Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, simply wrote 'Bitcoin’ in his Twitter bio. Crypto traders and Musk followers immediately noticed and Bitcoin price conveniently shot up a few minutes after the tweet.When BTC price makes a sharp directional move, traders buy into the breakout and short-sellers are squeezed out of their positions. That is what seems to have happened with Bitcoin (BTC) as the sentiment swiftly turned bullish.It is not only Bitcoin that has seen a pick up in sentiment. Rumors were afloat that Reddit users, who were recently responsible for GameStop’s massive surge in price, were discussing whether or not Dogecoin’s (DOGE) could be pushed to $1. This resulted in a huge spike in Dogecoin’s price.Trading with excessive greed and emotion can be risky. While professional traders may make money in such volatile environments, the novice retail trader usually gets stuck at higher levels and has to bear heavy losses. Therefore, traders should keep their greed in check and stick to their trading strategy.In volatile environments, the price action and trends can change quickly. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot the support and resistance levels that could be helpful in making trading decisions.Bitcoin held the 50-day simple moving average ($30,065) on Jan. 27 and dip buyers aggressively purchased on Jan. 28, which pushed the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($33,555).The buying continued today and the bulls have propelled the price above the downtrend line. This move invalidates the short-term bearish view on the BTC/USD pair.There is a minor resistance at $38,000, but if this level is crossed, the rally could extend to $40,000 and then to $41,959.63. The current all-time high may act as stiff resistance but if the momentum can push the price above it, the journey to $50,000 may begin.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from either overhead resistance, the bulls are likely to defend the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, it will suggest traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then again try to resume the uptrend.The trend will turn in favor of the bears if the pair turns down and plummets below the critical $28,850 support.Ether (ETH) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($1,234) on Jan. 28, which shows the bulls are aggressively buying on every minor dip and are not waiting for a deeper correction to enter long positions.The bulls had driven the price above the $1,400 overhead resistance today but are currently struggling to hold the higher levels. If they can sustain the price above $1,400, a retest of the all-time high at $1,473.096 is possible.A breakout to a new all-time high will open the gates for a further rally to $1,675 and then $2,000. The upsloping moving averages suggest advantage to the bulls, but the negative divergence on the relative strength index (RSI) points to a weakening momentum.If the bears can sink and sustain the ETH/USD pair below the uptrend line, it will indicate weakness.Polkadot’s (DOT) strong rebound off the $14.7259 support on Jan. 28 shows the bulls are aggressively buying on dips to this level. The altcoin could now extend its stay inside the $14.7259 to $19.40 range for a few more days.A shallow correction after a strong rally and consolidation near the overhead resistance are signs of strength. This shows traders are not booking profits in a hurry as they anticipate the uptrend to resume.If the bulls can push the price above $19.40, the next leg of the uptrend could begin. The first target objective is $24 and then $27. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 60 suggest the bulls are in control.This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the $14.7259 support. Such a move will suggest traders are aggressively booking profits and that could result in a drop to the 61.8% retracement at $11.8383.The bulls defended the $0.245 support on Jan. 27 and XRP started a relief rally on Jan. 28. This shows traders are accumulating at lower levels. The flat 20-day EMA ($0.28) and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest the selling pressure has reduced.The bulls had pushed the price above the downtrend line today, but they could not sustain the higher levels. This indicates, traders are offloading their positions at higher levels as they do not expect a sustained up-move.If the price turns down from the current level, the bears will again try to break the $0.245 support. If they succeed, a drop to $0.17351 is possible. On the other hand, if the bulls can sustain the price above the downtrend line, the XRP/USD pair may rally to $0.3855.Cardano (ADA) bounced off the support line of the ascending channel on Jan. 28, which shows the bulls are accumulating on dips. The buying has continued today and the altcoin has risen above the downtrend line.The ADA/USD pair could now rally to $0.38 and then to $0.40. If the bulls can drive the price above this resistance, the pair may rally to the resistance line of the channel near $0.46. The momentum could pick up if the bulls propel the price above the channel.The gradually upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.32) and the RSI in the positive zone suggest bulls have the upper hand. This bullish move will be negated if the price turns down and plummets below the support line of the channel. If that happens, the pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.24).The bulls flipped the previous resistance at $20.1111 into support when Chainlink (LINK) rebounded off it on Jan. 27. The buyers will now try to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above the all-time high at $25.7824.If they succeed, the LINK/USD pair could rally to $30. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the trend favors the bulls.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below $20.1111, it will suggest the sentiment has turned negative and traders are selling on rallies. That could pull the price down to $17.7777 and then to the 50-day SMA ($16).Litecoin (LTC) did not complete the bearish head and shoulders pattern on Jan. 27 as the bears could not sustain the price below the critical $120 support. The altcoin rebounded sharply on Jan. 28, suggesting strong demand at lower levels.The relief rally has reached the downtrend line, which may act as a resistance. If the price turns down from the downtrend line, the bears will again try to sink the price below the neckline of the H&S pattern at $120. If they succeed, a drop to $100 and then to $70 may be on the cards.Conversely, if the bulls can drive the price above the downtrend line, it may result in a rally to $165.9709. The bears may attempt to defend this level but if the LTC/USD pair can climb above it, a retest of $185.5821 is possible.The price action at the downtrend line is likely to decide whether the next move will favor the bulls or the bears.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) bounced off the $370 support on Jan. 28, which suggests the bulls are attempting to defend this level. The rebound is currently facing resistance at the 20-day EMA ($437).If the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 50-day SMA ($395), the bears will try to sink the price below the $370 to $353 support zone.However, the 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand.If the bulls can sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair may rise to $465 and then to $515 and extend its consolidation by a few more days.Binance Coin (BNB) bounced off the support line of the ascending broadening wedge pattern on Jan. 28, which shows strong demand at lower levels. The bulls continued their purchase today and pushed the price above the $43.4241 resistance but are struggling to hold on to the higher levels.The gradually upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the bulls can sustain the price above $43.4341, the BNB/USD pair could retest the all-time high at $47.2187.A breakout of this resistance will suggest the resumption of the uptrend with the next target objective at $50 and then $55. This bullish view will invalidate if the pair turns down from the current level and breaks below the support line.Stellar Lumens (XLM) broke below the $0.26 support on Jan. 27, but the bears could not capitalize on this weakness. This attracted aggressive buying from the bulls on Jan. 28, resulting in a sharp bounce that pushed the price back above $0.26.The buying continued today and the bulls propelled the price above the $0.35 resistance but they have not been able to sustain the higher levels as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick.Aggressive buying at lower levels and selling at higher levels suggest the XLM/USD pair may remain range-bound for a few more days.This view of a consolidation will invalidate if the bulls push and sustain the price above $0.35. Such a move will indicate the bulls have made a strong comeback. If they can push the price above $0.409, a rally to $0.50 is possible.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

509,"Frank Holmes, CEO/CIO of US Global Investors, believes Bitcoin and Ethereum could reach $80,000 and $3,000 respectively in 2021. He also sees the possibility of Bitcoin dropping to $20,000 and Ethereum dropping to $500. This wide spread is derived from a philosophy he calls the DNA of volatility.According to Holmes, each asset class has its own DNA of volatility, or the typical percentage of price fluctuation over a period of time. He finds it particularly intriguing when two different assets have similar volatilities. In this interview, he points out that the DNA of volatility of Tesla is the same as Ethereum.So why do these two seemingly disconnected assets have similar DNAs of volatility? Holmes believes that a higher range of volatility is an indicator of a disruptive asset. Tesla is disrupting the car industry while cryptocurrencies are disrupting the global financial sector. Although these assets inhabit wholly different industries, they are both agents of change, which creates similar uncertainty and volatility in price.The crypto space is famous for high-flying Bitcoin price predictions. Some, such as Dan Held, even believe Bitcoin could hit $1,000,000 per coin. But if Bitcoin were to reach even a third of that number, how would it happen?Looking 3-4 years down the road, Holmes postulates that Bitcoin will still be valuable as art even if it doesn’t become the sovereign digital money it was originally built to be. He likens owning Bitcoin to having an original Andy Warhol print, except Bitcoin is far more transactable.If you enjoyed this interview, please hit the like button and subscribe to the Cointelegraph YouTube channel."
510,"When the decentralized finance sector exploded in summer 2020, it was an eye-opening moment that showed crypto’s actual capabilities to revolutionize finance. However, the boom also exposed a lot of vulnerabilities of the Ethereum network, which most DeFi projects are built upon. The most serious ones included high gas costs and low scalability.A bull cycle has kicked in since then, lifting Ether’s (ETH) value to a new all-time high — and now the above-mentioned problems are even more persistent. People are forced to pay as much as $60 to $100 to complete a single trade on Uniswap, while numerous DeFi projects are struggling to facilitate their transactions on the Ethereum chain in time, failing their users as a result. An unending cycle of bullish news doesn’t help, as it unintentionally distracts the community from those problems. It has been two days, and your transaction is still pending? But look at the charts: Ether price has been exploding, and one of the institutional funds has announced it is buying X million Bitcoin (BTC)!Related: Ethereum will become the main asset for investors in 2021The long-awaited Ethereum 2.0 transition, which aims to address scalability and gas fees, has begun, but Phase 1.5, which merges the Ethereum 1.0 and Ethereum 2.0 blockchains, won’t arrive for another 12 to 18 months at the earliest. Are we really ready to keep paying a few tens of dollars to send a single transaction?Related: The Ethereum 2.0 factor: Changing the way DeFi projects operateLuckily, the potential fix has already arrived. Layer-two solutions, which started to gain traction around crypto winter, serve to address both the issues at hand: They reduce gas fees and scale the Ethereum network by moving most transactions to sidechains. There are quite a few companies that have been working on such solutions, including Aztec, Offchain Labs, Matter Labs and others.There are also projects like Polkadot, which uses a sharded multichain network that can process many transactions on smaller chains in parallel — which is why they are called “parachains” — instead of processing them one-by-one like legacy blockchains.Similarly, Polkadot’s DOT token has been experiencing an unprecedented rally on the back of the rising gas fees, beating XRP and moving up to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. In its 2021 prediction, Maple Leaf Capital — a team of researchers focused on Web 3.0 speculation and building — anticipated that Polkadot could jumpstart infrastructure and application improvements.As a result of the massive adoption of layer-two solutions, a lot of space will be created for the cryptocurrency industry — and we will heave a sigh of relief and get back to savoring the good news about cryptocurrency’s market capitalization, Bitcoin’s value and institutional adoption.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

511,"After a surprise rally fueled by an update to Elon Musk’s Twitter biography, demand for Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be particularly strong in professional trading circles.According to TradingView data, the ticker BTC1!, which represents CME’s Bitcoin futures contracts with the closest expiry — currently for February — is trading at over a 1% premium over spot BTC markets. This positive deviation in prices between a future and the underlying — which traders call ""contango"" — indicates that few institutions are willing to be short on the asset. Since this difference can be arbitraged, a consistent contango condition means that the buying pressure is overwhelming arbitrageurs, who cannot keep the price divergence in chec.A one percent deviation on a contract expiring in one month is significant. It is normal for longer-dated contracts to have significant deviation, as the longer the wait, the less compelling the arbitrage opportunity becomes. The attractiveness of such an opportunity is compared to the “risk-free interest rate,” usually U.S. Treasury bonds. Current yield is just over 1% per annum, meaning that making 1% in a month should be more than lucrative.Looking at the charts, it is clear that CME’s contract is trading at about $500 higher, a 1.3% difference. It is worth noting that TradingView delays CME data by ten minutes, meaning that the chart must be compared with previous candles on Bitstamp.CME is a traditional futures exchange that offers contracts for 5 BTC each — outside of the reach of most retail traders. A contango condition on this platform is a strong indicator that traditional institutions are particularly bullish on Bitcoin.Indeed, the institutional world has seen dramatic short squeezes lately, fueled by traders on Wall Street Bets, a Reddit forum. Stocks like GameStop, AMC and Nokia are seeing immense rallies as the community rallied behind assets with huge short positions opened by hedge funds.Nonetheless, excessive premiums on futures contracts are usually interpreted as signs of exhaustion. This indicates that most of the traders who want to be long on the asset are already long, with buyers having little firepower left to continue the rally."
512,"Data by crypto analytics firm Messari shows that many of the projects once favored by the market are still far from their all-time high. Matt Casto, an analyst at CMT Digital, tweeted a compilation of 410 crypto assets that hit their all-time high in 2017 or later, which showed an average loss of 65.71% for all the projects combined.Out of the 410 assets analyzed, 157 hit their all-time high in 2018, having lost since then an average of 90.71% in value. A further 67 assets hit their all-time high in 2019 and have since lost 73.33%. In contrast, projects that have hit their all-time high in 2021 have only shed 13.82% of their value.According to Casto, holding assets that have hit their all-time high in the last three years is “a massive lost opportunity cost for deploying capital.” The data illustrates how the market favors hype cycles and speculates on coins that often have little to add to the cryptosphere as a whole.While the current crypto rally has also been reflected in many of these coins, they are still far from their all-time high, as the data shows. In the meantime, tokens in the DeFi ecosystem have been breaking their all-time highs continuously, showing that for many of these coins, their best days are yet to come and that it’s happening at the expense of the zombies.While Bitcoin (BTC), the oldest cryptocurrency, has continued to show gains throughout the years, most other “old” coins have not shown the same tendency. Data from Messari further confirms the concept of the “great repricing,” which states that many of the top altcoins in the market will be replaced by newer sectors such as decentralized finance.When asked about the great repricing, Ryan Watkins, senior research analyst at Messari, told Cointelegraph that it’s “definitely not just hype” but rather “real fundamentals, high growth, strong product-market fit.”These once-prevalent altcoins are becoming known as “zombie projects” and are usually layer-one blockchain protocols, many of which compete directly with Bitcoin and Ethereum, either as a form of currency or platforms for asset issuance, smart contracts and more. With both BTC and Ether (ETH) maintaining their relevancy, many of these projects are now generally seen as being obsolete or having failed.As for DeFi, the ability to generate yield from cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, along with the possibilities for decentralized and superior financial services, makes it one of the most interesting (and risky) investment choices of 2021. As such, capital that once flowed into these assets during the alt season of 2017 and 2018 is now being redirected to the promising DeFi sector, most of which is hosted on the Ethereum network.While many of the aforementioned zombie projects started out with potential, they were often launched with a single feature or purpose in mind: coins that focused on privacy or speed or projects providing a specific service such as file-sharing or asset issuance.However, as Ethereum continues to be the go-to place for developers to create new functionalities in crypto, many of these features or purposes have been incorporated within the Ethereum ecosystem itself, making many layer-one projects obsolete. The same can be said for Bitcoin, whose developers continue to strive to make faster and anonymous payments a reality through projects such as the Lightning Network and more.Throughout the years, Ethereum has garnered what is known as the “network effect,” where all the services required by users are found in one place. Therefore, it’s more convenient to stay inside a single network and to use only one cryptocurrency to pay for these services, the most popular of which has become DeFi’s yield-generating protocols, such as Yearn.finance and Compound.It’s also worth noting that many of the coins that hit their all-time high in 2018 were competitors to Bitcoin and Ethereum. The two top cryptocurrencies have turned out to be resistant to the test of time. Bitcoin’s superior safety has proven itself in comparison to competitors that have been victims to 51% attacks on the networks.On the other hand, the hype generated around initial coin offerings also had a huge role in making these projects relevant, to begin with, as the cryptocurrency bubble of 2017 and 2018 pushed the prices of these tokens to unrealistic levels.Once the hype is gone, the crypto community seems to have lost the appetite for these projects, while some have been all but forgotten. Ilya Abugov, advisor at DApp statistics aggregator DappRadar, told Cointelegraph: “Startups fail at a very high rate, so it is only natural that many of the projects from the 2018 wave will not recover.”Despite being far from their all-time high, a small number of these projects has shown gains during the current bull market, some of which have shown four-figure percentage gains.Many projects are kept going by their community of investors who believe in long-term success. Some of these have made strides in some features or shown success in the DeFi realm.However, it’s hard to say if this will last, especially as Ethereum continues to dominate the DeFi sector. According to Abugov, this may soon change since “it takes time for useful DApps to emerge on a platform. Ethereum had a head start.” He added further:As the top altcoins from yesteryear fade out of the spotlight, the DeFi sector continues to take the world by storm with projects such as Aave, Uniswap and SushiSwap being among the top gainers in January, rising over 200% in the last 30 days. Isa Kivlighan, digital marketing manager at Aave, told Cointelegraph that “DeFi is just getting started,” adding:The initial DeFi boom in the first quarter of 2020 counted with a lot of overhyped projects, some scams, rug pulls and hacks, and some compared it to the ICO craze of 2017–2018 when worthless projects were pumped for no apparent reason other than pure speculation.Although hype is still part of the current scenario, the second surge of DeFi seems to favor promising projects with an already-working product, with pre-DeFi projects still lagging behind, as Dr. Octavius, co-founder of DeFi protocol OctoFi, told Cointelegraph:Meanwhile, new sectors of the cryptosphere have been gaining traction, especially nonfungible tokens. These types of tokens allow nonfungible assets, virtual or physical, to be represented in a digital setting, facilitating proof of ownership, transactions and sales. NFTs are often used to represent in-game items, digital artwork and more.Related: The perfect match? Both Bitcoin and DeFi push and pull crypto marketsWhile NFTs may become increasingly popular in the future, there seems to be a synergy between them and decentralized finance, where DeFi concepts, such as decentralized trading, can be applied to the NFT sector, and NFTs can be used to gamify DeFi apps, among other examples. Abugov believes that DeFi is here to stay, despite the growth of other sectors in crypto. He told Cointelegraph:"
513,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been correcting since the peak high at $42,000. However, this correction might have ended as a significant momentum shift occurred in recent days. The GameStop debacle raised many questions about big parties' trustworthiness and exchanges, after which more and more people started to claim that decentralization is the future.Among these people is Elon Musk who is worth nearly $183 billion, according to Forbes making him the world's richest person. The Tesla CEO included #Bitcoin in his Twitter profile and also wrote ""in retrospect, it was inevitable."" A very cryptic message to his 44 million followers, which some may interpret as Musk investing in Bitcoin.In retrospect, it was inevitableHowever, this tweet and profile change from Elon Musk prompted a new rally on Jan. 29 with price surging from $32,500 to $38,000 in a matter of minutes. The primary questions now are: does this mean the bull market is continuing and will BTC see new all-time highs?The 2-hour chart shows a clear bullish breakout after holding the significant support zone at $30,000.The critical breaker for bullish continuation was to find support at $30,000, which happened in recent days. Since then, the next step for bullish continuation would be a breakout above the $34,000 resistance zone.As the chart shows, and largely thanks to Elon Musk's tweet, the breakout was confirmed, and Bitcoin started to accelerate heavily. The next level to break is $37,600-38,000 as that’s the next area of significant liquidity.Currently, Bitcoin’s price is trying to crack that level of resistance at $38,000. If this area flips for support, a further bullish continuation toward the all-time highs will likely occur, and $50,000 comes into play. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has reached new all-time highs in the past 24 hours, accelerating to the $1.13 billion level.However, the total market capitalization and the price of Bitcoin are still far away from the 21-Week MA. That 21-Week MA often sees a support test before continuing upward.Therefore, the levels to watch for the total market cap are still the same as before. If the market can’t continue going up from here, $730 billion will be the focus as that would grant a perfect support/resistance flip from the previous all-time high.The weekly chart shows an apparent bullish cycle and a big gap between the 21-Week MA and the current price. These two often come back to each other to get the markets back to the ""mean"" of the price movement.Thus, such a correction would bring the price of Bitcoin to the $25,000 region in the coming weeks. In the end, as long as Bitcoin remains above the 21-Week MA, the continuation of this bull market is very likely.Currently, the price of Bitcoin is trying to break through the resistance at $38,000. If that breaks, a continuation toward a new all-time highs seems inevitable, as $40,500 is the only level to watch after $38,000.In that perspective, even price targets of $45,000 and $50,000 are on the table. However, if Bitcoin’s price can’t break through the $38,000 area, a renewed retest of the $34,000 zone should be expected.If that doesn’t hold for support, a sharp fall toward the lows may occur along with more range-bound price action. Nevertheless, this would not be unhealthy for the market from a wider perspective.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

514,"Billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio has sought to clarify his views on the world’s most famous digital asset with the publication of a short essay titled “What I Really Think of Bitcoin”.Dalio’s views on Bitcoin (BTC) — which he said should be read directly to avoid media misinterpretation — are both hopeful and cautious. Firstly, Dalio recognized the technical accomplishments of Bitcoin and praised its ability to last for over a decade already:What’s more, Dalio believes that Bitcoin is already an “alternative gold-like asset,” and one that will become more and more important in the future due to the debasement of fiat currencies by excessive money and debt printing:Dalio thinks Bitcoin has already crossed the line from being a “speculative idea” to something that will “probably” have some value in time to come:However, not everything is rosy regarding Dalio’s thoughts on the world’s first cryptocurrency. The hedge fund manager thinks the extent of Bitcoin’s privacy will depend entirely on how private the government allows it to be:Why would governments want to disrupt the use of Bitcoin? As Dalio points out, the principles at play now are the exact same as those at play in the year 1694, when the newly launched Bank of England sought to solidify its position as the sole issuer of debt and monies within its borders.Leaders in any industry will naturally try to quash opposition, and the same might happen with Bitcoin, especially, as Dalio points out, if it ends up becoming more and more popular.Dalio does not think government agencies will allow Bitcoin to flourish as an alternative to printed money — a sobering thought which pours some icy water on his earlier praise of the technology. Dalio said:The alleged demand which Bitcoin is credited with having as a result of its diminishing supply was also questioned by Dalio, who pointed out that the emergence of “Bitcoin-like” assets (other altcoins) effectively expanded Bitcoin’s supply by offering an alternative but similar service.Putting thoughts and theories to one side, Dalio also asked his staff at Bridgewater Associates to calculate the efficiency of Bitcoin as a diversified asset in relation to gold during market drawdowns.The researchers concluded that it was still too early to judge whether Bitcoin would provide the same degree of diversification in the future.“We hesitate to draw any firm conclusions with such a small sample size and given how quickly the cryptocurrency world is evolving. So far, Bitcoin’s ability to offer some diversification benefit seems more theoretical than realized,” the report stated."
515,"Stock and cryptocurrency trading platform Robinhood has temporarily disabled instant deposits for cryptocurrency purchases as of Friday, citing ""extraordinary market conditions.""Users are still able to buy cryptocurrency using settled funds that have previously been deposited, although such deposits can take up to five business days to clear.A Robinhood spokesperson told CNBC that the company would ""keep monitoring market conditions and communicating with our customers.Robinhood has faced recent criticism for suspending the trading of a number of traditional stocks, including GameStop, that were being supported by retail investors to the detriment of Wall Street hedge funds.This prompted U.S. congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to describe the move as unacceptable. Ocasio-Cortez, who sits on the House Financial Services committee, then hosted an hour long Twitch stream, discussing the topic with a number of guests, which pulled in 300,000 viewers.One of the questions that the congresswoman posed was: ""How do you actually shift power back into the hands of everyday people? Ultimately that's what this is about.”Robinhood's ""Instant Buying"" functionality is a paid feature that gives customers instant access to funds from bank deposits and stock trades.The suspension of instant buying power for crypto through the trading app comes hot on the heels of the same group of retail investors, led by Redditors from the r/Wallstreetbets subreddit, pumping Dogecoin (DOGE) to surge 900%.This has led to the meme-based coin reentering the top 10 digital assets by market capitalization for the first time since 2015.Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) has also been pumping, gaining $5,000 in a matter of minutes, following Elon Musk changing his Twitter bio to simply “#bitcoin.”Musk followed this with a cryptic tweet, stating only that, ""In retrospect, it was inevitable""."
516,"Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian has joined Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Tesla CEO Elon Musk in updating their Twitter bios to ""#Bitcoin.""Ohanian’s bio update seemed to be in response to a tweet by tech entrepreneur and former Coinbase chief technology officer Balaji Srinivasan. As part of the tweet, Srinivasan highlighted the growing appeal of Bitcoin to the likes of Musk and Dorsey, calling  Bitcoin (BTC) “the flag of technology.”Ok changing the bio.....#Bitcoin https://t.co/LOYYdRAfqYThe Reddit co-founder is a known crypto advocate and has previously revealed that he holds a percentage of his wealth in cryptocurrency. Back in May 2020, Ohanian remarked that crypto was here to stay and praised the level of “top-tier talent building” in the industry.Ohanian has previously offered optimistic price predictions for both Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) at $20,000 and $1,500, respectively. At the time, the Reddit co-founder revealed that he was most bullish about Ethereum.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Reddit, with its over 1.7 billion monthly visitors, recently inked a partnership deal with the Ethereum Foundation. As part of the collaboration, Reddit plans to introduce the requisite scaling technology to support projects like tokenized community points on the Ethereum network.Musk’s bio update earlier on Friday seemed to spark a flurry of BTC buying action, with Bitcoin briefly surpassing $38,000 for the first time in almost two weeks. The current resurgence in BTC enthusiasm also appears fuelled by the actions of several in the mainstream trading establishment and their treatment of retail participants.On Thursday, several retail brokers like Robinhood prevented users from buying stocks like GameStop and AMC. These stocks had been experiencing parabolic gains to the benefit of retail holders, with the resultant short squeeze threatening to bankrupt prominent hedge funds.Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s Friday surge has seen over $850 million in BTC derivatives, mostly shorts, liquidated over the last 24-hour trading period. According to Bybt data, more than 310,000 trader positions went underwater, with the largest single liquidation happening on BitMEX to the tune of about $10 million."
517,"As the Bitcoin (BTC) price sees a sharp upsurge, the governor of the Central Bank of Ireland has voiced his concerns about cryptocurrency investments.Gabriel Makhlouf, who is also a governing council member of the European Central Bank, warned the public about the risks of crypto investment on Bloomberg TV this Friday. The central banker specifically referred to a recent warning by the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority on Jan. 11:According to Makhlouf, consumer protection is now the most important task of local regulators as investors are clearly considering cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as assets for investment. Despite growing concerns about consumer protection, Makhlouf appeared to be confident that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin do not pose a threat to global financial stability:Some key crypto community members have taken issue with Makhlouf's statements. Founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital Mike Novogratz argued that unlevered Bitcoin investment is not as risky as the central banker implied.I am sick of this type commentary. It’s just not true. Yes it’s a 100% vol asset and if you buy with leverage it’s very risky. But unlevered you will NOT lose all your money. $BTC is a macro asset. Repeat 100 times. It will be around for a long, long time. https://t.co/U5btK5HK5VMakhlouf’s remarks echo those of European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, who on Jan. 13 called on global regulators to tighten rules for crypto, calling Bitcoin “funny business.”At publishing time, Bitcoin is trading at $37,338, up around 18% over the past 24 hours.

518,"The influence of Reddit’s r/Wallstreetbets subreddit has apparently spread to the cryptocurrency space, after a new coin appeared at the top of CoinMarketCap’s rankings on Friday.Dubbed WallStreetBets (WSB), the new coin apparently gained in excess of 130% in the past 24 hours, with a daily trade volume of $100 million.However, the new coin appears to be the latest in a series of jokes played by the CoinMarketCap team. The coin’s page on CMC features the following message:The reference to Charmander-marth links to a YouTube video featuring Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya being interviewed by CNBC regarding his successful trading of GameStop stocks during the short-squeeze initiated by the r/Wallstreetbets subreddit.The coin’s CMC page offers up a brief timeline of the GameStop saga, describing the short-squeeze tactic and the subsequent effect it had on the Robinhood trading app, which suspended retail trading for GameStop and several other stocks, including AMC, Nokia and Blackberry.Clicking the link to the coin’s white paper links to the Twitter page of ""MuzlM_Trader,"" whose tweet also drew attention to Chamath Palihapitiya’s appearance on CNBC.Bruhhh he keeps exposing their shit you heard it from @chamath the market is different and will continue to be volatile moving into the future... whose ready to be rich???? $cciv $gme $nakd $nok $Tesla etc... pic.twitter.com/Chake5mkTFThe influence of the subreddit on the cryptocurrency space was also witnessed in the price surge initiated by Dogecoin (DOGE), which briefly broke into the market capitalization top 10 following a 570% increase in its spot price. DOGE's surge was also orchestrated on Reddit."
519,"When the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, updated his Twitter bio on Friday — simply adding the word ""Bitcoin"" — it was followed by a near-immediate 13% increase to the Bitcoin (BTC) spot price.Musk’s bio appeared to be updated on Friday morning and was followed by a cryptic tweet that referred to the inevitability of... something.In retrospect, it was inevitableTweeted at 8:22 am UTC, Musk’s 43 million followers apparently took notice. Some assumed the tweet was a reference to the Dogecoin (DOGE) price surge that was ignited by r/Wallstreetbets traders as a follow-up to the recent GameStop stock short-squeeze. Others assumed the tweet was related to Bitcoin.Either way, at 8:24 am, Bitcoin suddenly took off. Over the course of the next 30 minutes, the value of Bitcoin increased by 13.9% as the coin price climbed from a starting point of $32,194. By 9:04 am, the coin was worth $36,670, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Shortly afterward, BTC continued to climb, eventually hitting $37,420 — representing more than 20% growth from the previous 24 hours.In December 2020, the value of Dogecoin increased by 25% after Musk posted a Doge meme. Musk had previously posted Dogecoin memes followed by the words “It’s inevitable,” perhaps providing a clue to the nature of Friday’s tweet.Musk isn't even the first billionaire to add the word ""Bitcoin"" to his Twitter bio. The social media site's own CEO, Jack Dorsey, did the same thing in mid-2020. Dorsey is the CEO of Square, the fintech company responsible for Cash App, which also caters to Bitcoin users. Almost 80% of Cash App's revenue came from Bitcoin alone by the third quarter of 2020."
520,"Bitcoin (BTC) surged by over $5,000 in minutes on Jan. 29 after the world's richest man added its symbol to his Twitter page.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and Tradingview showed BTC/USD spiking to $38,000 as users began to notice that Elon Musk was now publicly advertising Bitcoin.The move comes amid major anticipation from investors that BTC will be the next asset to receive a boost, either from a figure like Musk or from lay consumers affiliated with the now notorious Reddit group r/Wallstreetbets.As Cointelegraph reported, Musk had previously singlehandedly pumped the price of several cryptoassets notably meme-based Dogecoin (DOGE), with just one or a handful of tweets.DOGE, along with stocks GameSpot and AMC, meanwhile all surged thanks to Reddit this month, with the ensuing regulatory retaliation causing uproar and increasing cryptocurrency's reputation as an independent investment.""This should be your wake up call to get your #Bitcoin off exchanges,"" popular Twitter account Documenting Bitcoin summarized as $GME trading was shut down.For Musk, who at one time had ""former Dogecoin CEO"" in his bio, no explanation of the move towards Bitcoin had been made public at the time of writing, with only a characteristically cryptic tweet coming afterward.""In retrospect, it was inevitable,"" he wrote.Musk has a chequered history when it comes to Bitcoin, with previous tweets making it impossible to tell if he owned or even liked the largest cryptocurrency.On Friday, however, BTC/USD had yet to match $GME or others, reversing at $37,000 to trade slightly lower and still within an established corridor. As proponents noticed his update, messages of support came rolling in fast.""Got em,"" Robert Breedlove, author of ""Thank God for Bitcoin,"" responded.Abra CEO Bill Barhydt added:"
521,"Amid renewed bullish action on cryptocurrency markets, stablecoins like Tether (USDT) are flooding exchanges to hit a new historical high in terms of allocation.According to market data provider CryptoQuant, stablecoin holdings on global crypto exchanges broke a new all-time high on Jan. 28, surpassing $4.7 billion.This amount makes up a significant part of the total stablecoin market capitalization, which is estimated at around $35.2 billion at the time of writing, according to data from CoinGecko. The total trading volume of all stablecoins is now evaluated at around $111 billion, with Tether (USDT) alone making up $103 billion of these volumes.Alongside stablecoins' holdings on crypto exchanges hitting a new all-time high, the amount of inflow stablecoin transactions also appears to be growing at the time of writing. On Jan. 28, the number of inflow stablecoin transactions amounted to nearly 33,000 transactions, up from 30,000 transactions on Jan. 27.Massive stablecoin inflows are often regarded as a short-term catalyst for Bitcoin, suggesting that sidelined capital is moving back into BTC. Specifically, fiat-pegged stablecoins like USDT are becoming an increasingly useful tool for traders to make deposits on crypto exchanges, allowing them to easily buy and sell millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. As such, growing stablecoin allocations on crypto exchanges may be associated with increasing buying power.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the start of Bitcoin’s rally in October 2020 was driven by growing stablecoins’ inflows onto exchanges. At publishing time, there is a notable upward trend on crypto markets, with the majority of the top-10 coins by market cap posting significant growth and Bitcoin returning above $32,000."
522,"Bitcoin (BTC) price appears to have flipped the $32,000 level back to support as the wider cryptocurrency market saw renewed optimism on Jan. 28. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that BTC has steadily climbed higher in price from $31,000 to its current value of $33,400, an increase of 9.5%.The most notable gainer of the day was Dogecoin (DOGE) which surged more than 200%.The popular meme coin became the latest beneficiary of the 3 million member Reddit community behind the incredible GameStop (GME), BlackBerry (BBY) and AMC Theatres (AMC) pump that happened over the last few days. In the early morning hours of Jan. 28, a Twitter account named WSB Chairman tweeted:A lot of you are talking about Dogecoin. What’s that? A meme crypto?Shortly afterwards, members in the Wall Street Bets telegram began discussing the possibility of pushing DOGE to $1.According to data from TheTIE, the tweet volume for Dogecoin “surpassed Bitcoin over the last 24 hours,” making this the first time on record that “an altcoin has been tweeted about more than Bitcoin over a 24 hour period.”In a private conversation with Cointelegraph, Joshua Frank, founder of TheTIE, commented on just how “wild” the activity related to Dogecoin has been over the past 24-hours.Frank said:Coinbase officially unveiled its plan to go public later this year. According to Coinbase Blog, the company will do a direct listing of its Class A common stock, making existing shares available to the public.North Carolina wealth manager Kingfisher Capital also made headlines after filing documents revealed that the firm had purchased 10,667 shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust over the past few months.Several brokerage firms in the United States, including the popular mobile-based Robinhood, are receiving blowback for halting trading on stocks like GameStop (GME) and AMC Holdings Inc. (AMC), which has been the primary story of the week after a retail investor-inspired short squeeze by members of the Reddit group r/wallstretbets pushed the prices of each stock up by hundreds of percent.The traditional markets also saw a bounce following a minor sell-off yesterday. The S&P 500, NASDAQ and Dow all saw positive inflows and finished the day up 0.98%, 0.68% and 0.99% respectively.Bitcoins show of strength at the $32,000 coincided with a strong rally from many altcoins and currently the majority of the top 100 coins are reflecting 3% to 15% gains.Cosmos (ATOM) rallied by 15.41%, Stellar (XLM) gained 13.91% and Compound (COMP) added 14.21%. Ether (ETH) price also increased by 5.96% and currently trades at $1,355.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $984.6 billion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 63.2%."
523,"It is a useful exercise for those of us working in tech to cast our minds back to the dot-com boom and bust of the late 1990s. There is a lot that can be learned from that time. The period was crucial for the United States and the global economy and a defining moment for the tech sector. It is helpful to consider those helter-skelter days when assessing the current crypto ecosystem.Most people will rightly point to the glut of Super Bowl ads coming in at over $2 million each or the initial public offerings that rose more than 1,000% on opening day as the defining memories of the time, and they would be right. It was a time of frenzied excitement, where the fundamentals of technology and business models were often disregarded by sky-high growth projections. But this excitement only arose because technology unlocked a new approach to doing business. Well-run companies built on network effects survived the crash and continued to grow and create enormous value. In 2000, three of the top five listed companies in the U.S. were tech stocks — now it is all five.Even the Super Bowl ads that we like to ridicule were associated with business models that have since led to the formation of great companies — trading stocks and recruiting staff online are big industries. Digitizing these functions and other similar ones led to extremely successful companies, but this value was only realized in the subsequent decades as digital infrastructure was rolled out internationally and digital literacy improved. These first movers could have achieved far more if they had concentrated on building effective businesses based on long term vision and solid unit economics. Instead, they are notorious for being swept up by hype bubbles and being swayed by large valuations inflated by immature investors.Something similar can be witnessed in the fintech and crypto space. This story also involves a crash, as the 2008 financial crisis and the collapse of Lehman Brothers led to a crowd of young, bright finance professionals suddenly looking for work. Nascent fintech startups absorbed the talent, creating a fintech boom in clusters within financial capitals, including New York and London. Technologists and mathematicians reimagined finance at an abstract level, recruiting financial “masters of the universe” to complete the vision and build companies.The combined talent from these two groups, coupled with the experience of two crashes in a decade and a half, led the fintech industry to take a pragmatic approach to growing companies and building products. Because investors had cooled on tech, fintech entrepreneurs had to focus relentlessly on product/market fit to grow their startups, iterating repeatedly when building new financial products and markets from first principles. This led to the creation of a stable ecosystem where valuations were grounded in reality, rather than charismatic founders and fantasies of growth.The other financial milestone of 2008 that history books will recognize was the creation of Bitcoin (BTC). When the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin white paper in October of that year, she, he or they looked past the wreckage of the financial system and imagined a new one based on blockchain technology. This store of value based on memory and removed from a central authority was intellectually elegant and came at a crucial juncture of technological development and financial instability. Many thought the stage was set for Bitcoin to take over the world.But there was a problem. Where some of us saw an asset class with tremendous social value, far more saw nothing more than an asset going up in price, and others saw a Ponzi scheme. Satoshi built an amazing system, but its true value had yet to be realized.We know what happened next. Bitcoin became a speculative asset that then surged in value in 2017, leading to behavior eerily similar to the Super Bowl ad blitz with Bitcoin mortgages and blockchain iced tea. Then the price cratered and ushered in the crypto winter. Just like the viable ideas of the dot-com craze, a fundamentally strong idea was lost to poor communication, scarce infrastructure and a lack of product/market fit.Like we saw in the broader tech ecosystem, things change over time. Today we have a vast range of products, functions and currencies built on blockchain technology, built to last during the crypto winter, like the fintech companies of the last decade. This is backed by a sophisticated class of investors who are providing clear-eyed valuation to the blockchain. Wide-scale quantitative easing and fluctuating fiat currencies due to the COVID-19 pandemic are showcasing the true value of the blockchain. Its time has come.The global financial system as a whole is a demonstration of an apt product/market fit for blockchain. Bitcoin’s hype exceeded reality, harming the sector’s reputation for several years. However, we now have the infrastructure, expertise and demand to meet the technology’s potential. The key to reaching maturation will be to realize the social value of blockchain — how it empowers people — rather than solely viewing it as a financial instrument.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
524,"Ray Dalio, the famed founder of Bridgewater Associates, called Bitcoin (BTC) “one hell of an invention,” adding that he’s considering digital-asset investing for clients wishing to protect against currency debasement. In a note to clients that was obtained by Bloomberg News, Dalio called Bitcoin’s store-of-value characteristics an “amazing accomplishment” and one of the few “alternative gold-like assets at this time of rising need for them.”He said:Bridgewater Associates is the world's largest hedge fund, with assets under management of roughly $160 billion. The firm is trusted by institutional investors and other high-net-worth individuals to produce steady returns regardless of the market environment.Like other hedge fund managers, Dalio has been critical of Bitcoin in the past. In November 2020, he criticized BTC for its excess volatility, claiming that it could never be an effective medium of exchange or store of value. He quickly retracted his statement as Bitcoin’s price surged toward new all-time highs.“I might be missing something about Bitcoin so I’d love to be corrected,” he said in a Nov. 17, 2020 tweet.I might be missing something about Bitcoin so I’d love to be corrected. My problems with Bitcoin being an effective currency are simple... (1/5)In his note to clients, Dalio admitted that Bitcoin has succeeded in “crossing the line” from a speculative idea to an asset with real value. He indicated that Bridgewater is focused on providing alternative stores of value via alt-cash funds that can protect investors from currency devaluation.“Bitcoin won’t escape our scrutiny,” he said."
525,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) violent price swings could become a thing of the past as institutional buyers with stronger hands continue to push the asset higher, according to a prominent crypto whale. Eric Peters, the founder and CEO of One River Asset Management, told Bloomberg Thursday that Bitcoin’s path to maturity should help stabilize its price.“There are all kinds of reflexive dynamics in these assets that ironically will lead to less volatility the higher they go,” he said. “As the prices are going higher, you are drawing in new types of investors with stronger hands.”One River Asset Management has accumulated over $600 million worth of BTC. The asset manager expects to own roughly $1 billion worth of Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) by the first half of this year.Volatility has been central to Bitcoin ever since the flagship cryptocurrency launched in 2009, but the intensity of price moves has declined considerably over the years. With the exception of the March 2020 liquidity crisis, Bitcoin’s daily volatility hasn’t exceeded 10% since 2013. Since 2016, daily volatility has eclipsed 7% only a handful of times, according to Bitpremier data.Peters believes that institutional buyers will play an increasingly vital role in helping Bitcoin mature — and avoid the massive price swings seen in the past.He told Bloomberg:Goldman Sachs, a U.S. financial institution that was highly critical of Bitcoin in the past, has even conceded that the digital asset is starting to mature. However, long-term stability will depend on greater institutional adoption.Jeff Currie, the bank’s global head of commodities research, told CNBC recently that Bitcoin still needs to attract smart-money investors to help stabilize the market.In the short term, it doesn’t seem like institutional adoption will be enough to keep Bitcoin’s price elevated beyond $30,000, according to Guggenheim chief investment officer Scott Minerd. Despite his seemingly bearish short-term outlook, Minerd still called BTC a viable asset in the long run."
526,"The majority of cryptocurrency users reportedly prefer to hold their crypto as part of a long-term investment strategy, according to a new survey by Binance Research.Released on Thursday, the survey report shows that as much as 55% of respondents own cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) as a long-term investment.The “2021 Global Crypto User Index” report is based on a global survey that includes input from more than 61,000 crypto users across 178 countries and regions. The survey was conducted over a period from Sept. 15 to Oct. 25, 2020.According to Binance Research’s findings, the majority of respondents were mainly motivated to own crypto due to the concept of “hodling,” which means that most people are inclined to hold cryptocurrency rather than sell it. As much as 39% of respondents stated that their “usage” of crypto is dominated by hodling.The “hodlers” category is followed by 28% of respondents who prefer to use most of their crypto for buying other cryptos. The next 22% of respondents said that they mainly use their crypto for staking and lending — practices that allow users to earn rewards for securing the network or locking up their coins. Binance Research mentioned that staking is becoming increasingly popular with the ongoing Ethereum 2.0 upgrade.Only 11% of respondents said that they mainly use their digital coins for payments, which once again demonstrates that the current level of crypto adoption is far from being associated with day-to-day payments in crypto.65% of respondents held Bitcoin (BTC), making it the most popular option in the survey."
527,"The largest Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency asset manager in the world, Grayscale, could be set to move into the decentralized finance space after documents for several new trusts were filed in the Delaware corporate registry.New trust filings for Aave (AAVE), Polkadot (DOT) and Cosmos (ATOM) were filed on Wednesday. On the same day, Grayscale also registered trusts for Cardano (ADA), as well as the privacy coin Monero (XMR).Grayscale has since stated that the filings are not indicative of a definitive product launch for the five coins mentioned, merely that the firm is laying the groundwork for possible future launches.“Occasionally, we will make reservation filings, though a filing does not mean we will bring a product to market,” the company told industry media. Grayscale’s decision to expand its cryptocurrency horizons could have been spurred by the price performances of the five coins in question over the course of the past year. Aave recorded 483% growth in the final quarter of the previous year, climbing to the 15th spot by market capitalization. The project was a forerunner of the decentralized finance phase in 2020, focusing on lending and borrowing and flash loans.Cosmos recorded similar growth of 489% as the value of its ATOM coin climbed from the $1.50 range to over $9. The project is now ranked 25th by market cap.Polkadot, meanwhile, recorded 537% growth between launching in August 2020 and the time of writing. The project, which describes itself as a decentralized, interoperable, multichain protocol, takes aim at providing blockchain infrastructure and seeks to compete with Ethereum as a home for blockchain developers.Although not among the graduating class of 2020, Monero also gained 467% over the course of the calendar year, while Cardano benefited from the launch of its much anticipated Shelley mainnet, having gained 187% since that time.The value of Grayscale’s assets under management soared throughout 2020, reaching over $25 billion, according to the latest figures released by the company."
528,"Bitcoin’s smart-contract-enabled sidechain RSK is introducing the concept of meta-transactions, which allow third parties to pay for a user’s transaction fees.Announced on Thursday, the “RIF Enveloping” solution enables wallet providers to pay for their users’ transactions. Paying transaction fees is currently a major bottleneck in the adoption of smart contract platforms. Users wishing to trade tokens must always have some units of the blockchain’s native currency — for example, Ether (ETH) for Ethereum and Smart Bitcoin (RBTC) for RSK.RIF Enveloping introduces meta-transactions to enable greater flexibility for decentralized application developers. Smart contracts using the technology can choose to subsidize the user’s gas fee completely or request payment with tokens. The technology will be integrated with Beexo Wallet, one of the main wallet providers for RSK.Similar solutions exist on Ethereum as well, using OpenZeppelin’s Gas Station Network. Wallets that use it include Argent, which uses smart contracts to store the user’s tokens. While the company used to subsidize gas costs completely, the skyrocketing prices on Ethereum led them to discontinue the program. Nonetheless, despite their apparent benefits, meta-transactions have yet to achieve significant adoption on Ethereum.Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar, co-founder of RSK, told Cointelegraph that RIF Enveloping can be more impactful to RSK’s ecosystem:He also explained that RSK’s solution has a technological advantage. Meta-transactions on Ethereum require redeploying contracts or using proxies, while RIF Enveloping can work with any existing token or contract.RSK features a growing ecosystem for decentralized finance. The recent launch of Sovryn brought a full suite of trading and lending products, while existing platforms like Money on Chain or RSK Swap recreated core DeFi projects on Ethereum like MakerDAO or Uniswap."
529,"The upcoming Chinese New Year holidays on Feb. 12 could have an indirect impact on Bitcoin's (BTC) price and drive sell-offs on the market, according to a recent analysis. Per a Thursday report by cryptocurrency investment firm Stack Funds, the ongoing selling pressure on Bitcoin's price is likely to continue in the short term due to Asian miners increasingly offloading their funds amid the upcoming week-long holiday.With more than 60% of global Bitcoin mining pools located in China, Stack Funds head of research Lennard Neo suggested that a lot of selling pressure is coming from Chinese miners. The researcher stated that the miner position index, or MPI, has seen a massive surge recently, indicating a subsequent pullback of Bitcoin's price. As Cointelegraph reported, the MPI surged to its highest levels since 2019 in mid-January.Neo concluded that the ongoing sell-off coincides with the upcoming holidays, suggesting that the floor price has yet to be seen:Also known as the Lunar New Year or Spring Festival, the Chinese New Year is one of the biggest holidays celebrated in the country and is usually associated with increased spending. As previously reported, the crypto community has long speculated that Chinese New Year celebrations have historically driven Bitcoin price declines. At publishing time, Bitcoin is trading at $31,546, up 2.8% over the past 24 hours. After briefly dipping below $30,000 on Wednesday, BTC is down 4.3% over the past seven days."
530,"A pseudonymous trader known as “Byzantine General” is short-term bearish as Bitcoin (BTC) continues to test the same $30,000 support area.Although the price of Bitcoin is staying above a key support level, the trader said the price action is not bullish. He wrote:Analysts see a similar trend from the options market and previous Bitcoin fractals. Fractals are technical candle chart patterns that analysts typically use to compare the current price action of Bitcoin to previous cycles.According to analysts at the data analytics company Laevitas, the options market signals are short-term bearish view. They said:The options market has a larger impact on the price trend of Bitcoin now than before because the open interest is now hovering above $3 billion.There are significantly more active options contracts and options traders compared to before. This means that if there is selling pressure coming from the options market, it would likely have a negative impact on the price of Bitcoin.Based on the fractal that analysts at “Material Scientist” found, both historical price cycles and the options market data hint at a short-term consolidation phase. The analysts noted:One of the possible reasons why the price of Bitcoin continues to range and stagnate could be the high selling pressure coming from miners.Data from CryptoQuant shows that the Miners’ Position Index is relatively high, which means miners are depositing Bitcoin to exchanges.Since miners are one of the few external and unmatched sources of selling pressure in the Bitcoin market, a high Miners’ Position Index usually precedes a sell-off.On Jan. 26, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said:As long as the options market is leaning towards a bearish short-term trend and miners continue to sell BTC, the price of Bitcoin is unlikely to break out in the near term.However, the $34,000 resistance level remains the key area in the foreseeable future. If Bitcoin surges above it, there is a chance for a quick trend reversal to the upside."
531,"Guggenheim’s Scott Minerd has come out with another gloomy price outlook for Bitcoin stating that there is not enough institutional demand to keep the asset over $30,000.The chief investment officer of the financial services firm told Bloomberg Television the institutional investor base was not big enough to sustain the current prices.Minerd added that Bitcoin is still a viable asset class in the long run. Since its all-time high of $42,000 on January 8, Bitcoin has corrected 27% to current prices around $30,600. Three prominent lower highs on the chart suggest that the downtrend is strengthening.The Guggenheim executive also thinks that this downward pressure has a lot further to go, adding that it is “not uncommon to see squeezes like this”:On January 20, Minerd told CNBC that he expects prices to fully retrace back to $20,000. If this scenario plays out, it would entail a correction of more than 50%, and that has happened several times during previous market cycles. The last time BTC fell by over half was in March 2020 when it dropped from just over $10,000 to below $5,000 in just three weeks.Guggenheim has not changed its stance on the long term outlook for Bitcoin, however, with Minerd stating in December that the firm’s fundamental work has shown that Bitcoin could be worth about $400,000.As Bitcoin approaches this psychological support level at $30,000, the imminent expiry of $4 billion in BTC options could favor the bulls according to analysts."
532,"In the last 24-hours Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped 10% today to test the $30,000 support. This drop below what traders have described as a ‘key’ support occurred just two days ahead of this month’s futures and options expiry. Despite the record-high $4 billion options expiry being just two days away, both bull and bear sides traded similar sizes today.Unlike futures contracts, options are divided into two segments. Call (buy) options allow the buyer to acquire BTC at a fixed price on the expiry date. On the other hand, the seller of the instrument will be obliged to make the BTC sale. Generally speaking, they are used on either neutral arbitrage trades or bullish strategies.The put (sell) options are commonly used as hedge, protection from negative price swings.To understand how these competing forces are balanced, one should compare the calls and put options size at each expiry price (strike). Options markets are all-or-none, meaning they either have value or become worthless if trading above the call strike price, or the opposite for put option holders.The trading volume over the past 24-hours has favored the more bullish call options by 51%. Nevertheless, this number is polluted by the ultra bullish strikes priced at $37,000 and higher. Considering there's less than 36 hours before the expiry, these contracts are trading below $50 each.Excluding these over-optimistic strikes, today's trading added another $95 million worth of call options open interest below $35,000. On the other hand, the more bearish put options at $27,000 and higher amount to $90 million worth of open interest.The result of today's activity has been neutral for Friday's options expiry. Nevertheless, one should check the overall open interest imbalance separate from today's movement.By excluding the put options below $27,000 and the call options above $35,000, it is easier to estimate the potential impact of Friday's expiry. Incentives to pump or dump the price by more than 16% become less likely, as the potential gains will seldom surpass the cost.This data leaves $582 million worth of call options up to $35,000 for the aggregate options expiry on Jan. 29. Meanwhile, the more bearish put options down to $27,000 amount to $422 million. Therefore, there's a $160 million imbalance favoring the more bullish call options.Considering the volumes traded over the past 24 hours and the put options open interest, there's not much gain for bears in pressuring BTC below $29,000, at least from the options market standpoint.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

533,"Public companies have purchased about 85,000 Bitcoin (BTC) in the past year and institutional investors have pumped money into Grayscale Investments, which shows increasing institutional adoption is one of the main reasons for the recent Bitcoin rally.However, at the moment it seems institutional investors are unlikely to chase prices higher. If the fresh inflow of money stalls or reduces drastically, it could result in a pullback in Bitcoin’s price. If that happens, short-term traders and momentum players may book profits and trigger a deeper correction. A correction will be a healthy sign because it will shake out the speculators and only the long-term HODLers will be left in the market. As the price dips, additional institutional investors may start buying at lower levels. The transfer of Bitcoin’s ownership from speculators to long-term investors will be positive in the long term.If Bitcoin enters a deeper correction in the short term, several altcoins are likely to follow suit.Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the support levels where buyers may step in.Bitcoin broke above the 20-day exponential moving average ($33,254) on Jan. 25 but the traders used this rise to sell, which pushed the price down to the $30,450 support on Jan. 26. The bulls purchased this dip but could not push the price above the 20-day EMA.The BTC/USD pair has resumed its correction today, which shows the bulls are not able to absorb the supply. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) in the negative zone suggest bears are in control.If the bears can sink and sustain the price below the 50-day simple moving average ($29,407), the pair will complete a bearish descending triangle pattern. This could result in a drop to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at 25,897.42 and then to the 61.8% retracement level at $22,106.73.This bearish view will invalidate if the price rebounds off the current level and breaks above the downtrend line. If that happens, the pair may rally to $40,000 and then to $41,959.63.Ether’s (ETH) inability to sustain above $1,400 on Jan. 25 shows the bears were booking profits at higher levels. The bulls again attempted to regroup on Jan. 26 but the altcoin has turned down today, which suggests traders may be closing their long positions.The negative divergence on the RSI shows the momentum has weakened. If the bears can pull the price below the 20-day EMA ($1,211), a retest of the uptrend line is likely. This is an important support to watch out for because a break below it will signal a possible trend change. The next support on the downside is the 50-day SMA ($928).On the other hand, if the bulls can sustain the current rebound, it will suggest that the bulls are buying on dips. If the bulls can push the ETH/USD pair above the $1,400 to $1,473.096 resistance zone, the uptrend could resume with the next target objective at $1,675.Polkadot (DOT) turned down from the overhead resistance on Jan. 25 and dropped to the $14.7259 support today. The bulls are likely to defend this support aggressively.A strong rebound off $14.7259 will suggest traders are accumulating on dips. That could keep the DOT/USD pair range-bound between $14.7259 and $19.40 for a few more days. The gradually rising 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the bulls have a minor advantage.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below $14.7259, the decline may extend to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $13.2821 and then to the 61.8% retracement at $11.8383. A deeper correction will suggest the uptrend has lost momentum and that may result in a few days of consolidation before the next trending move starts.After defending the 20-day EMA ($0.28) for the past few days, the bears are currently attempting to sink XRP below the $0.245 support. The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the downside.A break below $0.245 will increase the possibility for a fall to the next critical support at $0.17351. If this support also cracks, the XRP/USD pair could resume the downtrend with the next possible stop at $0.10.On the contrary, if the pair rebounds off the current level, the bulls will again try to push the price above the downtrend line. If they manage to do that, the pair could remain range-bound between $0.245 and $0.3855 for a few more days.Cardano’s (ADA) strong recovery on Jan. 22 fizzled out at $0.3685714 on Jan. 24, suggesting traders used the rally above $0.34 to close their long positions.The bulls are currently defending the support line of the ascending channel. A strong bounce off this level will suggest the bulls are buying on dips. The bulls will then try to push the price above the downtrend line, which will be the first indication that the correction may be over.If the price sustains above the downtrend line, a retest of $0.3971995 could be on the cards. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the support line, it will suggest a possible trend change that could result in a drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.23).Chainlink (LINK) is currently witnessing a correction in an uptrend. The first critical support to watch on the downside is the 20-day EMA ($20.15), which is near the breakout level at $20.1111.A strong rebound off this support will indicate the bulls are aggressively accumulating at lower levels. They will then try to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above the recent all-time high at $25.7824.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the LINK/USD pair could drop to $17.7777. A break below this support will suggest a change in trend and may pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($15.58).Litecoin (LTC) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($139) on Jan. 25, which suggests the bears are selling on relief rallies. The bulls purchased the dip to the 50-day SMA ($128) on Jan. 26 but could not push the price above the 20-day EMA.Renewed selling has dragged the LTC/USD pair below the 50-day SMA today and the bears will now try to break the $120 support. If they manage to do that, the pair will complete a bearish head and shoulders pattern that may result in a fall to $100 and then to $70.The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the downside. This negative view will be negated if the pair rebounds off the $120 support and rises above $148.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) failed to sustain above the 20-day EMA ($443) on Jan. 25 and that could have attracted selling from the bears who have dragged the price below the 50-day SMA ($389) today.The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the downside. A break below the $370 support could pull the price down to $353 and if that level also cracks, the next stop may be $275.This bearish view will invalidate if the BCH/USD pair bounces off the current level or the $353 support and rises above $450.Binance Coin (BNB) could not sustain above $43.0992 on Jan. 25, indicating a lack of buyers at higher levels. The altcoin formed a Doji candlestick pattern on Jan. 25 and 26, which showed indecision among the bulls and the bears.The sellers are attempting to gain the upper hand by sinking the price below the support line of the ascending broadening wedge pattern. If they succeed, the BNB/USD pair may drop to $35.69 and then to $30.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can defend the support line, it will suggest demand at lower levels. The bulls will then again try to push the price above $43.0992. If they can manage to do that, the pair may rise to $47.2187.The flattish 20-day EMA ($40.99) and the RSI close to the midpoint does not give a clear advantage to either the bulls or the bears.The failure of the bulls to push Stellar Lumens (XLM) above $0.282 may have attracted profit-booking from short-term traders who had purchased the dip on Jan. 22. The altcoin turned down and broke below the 20-day EMA ($0.261) on Jan. 25.When the price fails to build up momentum above the 20-day EMA, it shows a change in sentiment. The current fall indicates the traders used the recent relief rally to lighten their positions.The XLM/USD pair can now drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.214), which may attract some dip buying. But if the pair fails to rebound off this support with strength, the correction could deepen, and a fall to $0.19 and then to $0.15 may be on the cards.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

534,"In the past 48 hours, Bitcoin has tested the $30,500 support level on two occasions. Historically, when a major support area is tested repeatedly, it often breaks. On the third retest on Jan. 27, Bitcoin broke below $30,000. However, $30,000 is a highly important support level for BTC, and hence, whales might try to buy the level to prevent a further breakdown after reclaiming it.Whale clusters suggest three key levels in the near term: $34,970, $29,314 and $28,727. Currently, Bitcoin is battling the $30,000 support level. Whale clusters form when whales or high-net-worth investors buy Bitcoin and do not move it. The theory behind whale clusters is that if BTC pulls back, whales are much more likely to buy more at the price they bought at previously.The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating under $33,000 following the steep rejection of $35,000. As BTC stagnates, traders are considering both bear and bull cases in the near term. For now, traders are seemingly leaning toward the bearish scenario as Bitcoin struggles to quickly rebound from the crucial $29,314 support area.In the foreseeable future, Bitcoin is likely to range between $29,314 and $34,970. Whales that bought BTC at $29,314 will likely keep buying if BTC comes close to that level. But whales that bought at around $35,000 might want to sell at the break-even point, and hence, $34,970 has been acting as a resistance area. Bitcoin has seen two rejections at that level in the past 48 hours, indicating that it’s a stacked sell wall.The bull case for Bitcoin in the short term is still a macro one. In the immediate term, analysts are generally cautious about the trend of Bitcoin. However, in the mid-term to long term, on-chain analysts are spotting a positive trend. According to analysts at Glassnode, the net unrealized profit and loss, or NUPL, indicator shows Bitcoin has room for another rally before topping out.NUPL measures the level of unrealized profit that crypto investors are sitting on. If the unrealized profit is high, then there is a possibility of a take-profit correction, which can amplify the selling pressure on BTC. Glassnode analysts wrote: “#Bitcoin NUPL was rejected at the entrance into the ‘euphoria’ zone earlier this month. [...] After a similar event in 2017, $BTC increased around 900% before hitting the top.”Atop the relatively low unrealized profit in the Bitcoin market, institutions and public companies are continuing to accumulate Bitcoin aggressively. On Jan. 25, Marathon, one of the largest enterprise Bitcoin mining companies in North America, bought $150 million worth of Bitcoin.The company emphasized that it will soon have the capacity to mine 55 to 60 BTC per day, worth $1.65 million. However, the firm noted that it wants to hold more Bitcoin as a treasury asset: “By leveraging our cash on hand to invest in Bitcoin now, we have transformed our potential to be a pure-play investment into a reality.”The two metrics to watch in the near term will be Coinbase outflows and stablecoin inflows. Coinbase outflows suggest that institutions or high-net-worth investors are buying BTC and taking it off of Coinbase. Throughout the past two months, when outflows have been high, BTC has rallied strongly. High stablecoin inflows are also important because it would mean that sidelined capital is entering back into the Bitcoin market.The bearish case for Bitcoin in the near term mainly revolves around the prospect of the market seeing a drawdown as a result of institutions and large buyers taking off risk. Raoul Pal, CEO of video channel Real Vision, previously explained the “head fake” theory, where hedge funds and institutions take profits on their positions before the end of the first quarter. This often leads to a marketwide pullback as retail investors that buy stocks and other assets at high valuations begin to capitulate.Pal said that he feels something is at risk with the market. He pinpointed the abnormal sentiment around gold, Bitcoin, bonds and the U.S. dollar. Based on this trend, Pal said that he is on alert for a “market clearing event,” which likely means a marketwide correction:Similarly, a pseudonymous trader known as “Altcoin Psycho” said that the options market is set for a huge “gamma squeeze.” If this happens near a record options market expiration date, it could result in a bearish correction in the short term. This trend would go along with the historical tendency of Bitcoin pulling back after the Chinese New Year:Although some analysts say that the crypto market is at risk of extreme volatility, the same risks that are present in the stock market are not prevalent in the crypto market. For instance, GameStop saw a huge rally overnight as a result of a subreddit’s aggressive accumulation of the stock.As reported previously, the 700% rise has most likely attracted the attention of the crypto market away from BTC’s performance. Furthermore, Robinhood, a popular trading platform for stocks and crypto, reportedly went down due to high demand for GME.Quotes in this article taken from previously published sources have been lightly edited."
535,"Bitcoin (BTC) retested the $30,000 support on Jan. 27 as a day of losses culminated in violation of the psychologically significant price level.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and Tradingview showed any bullish momentum left in Bitcoin dissipate on Wednesday after rejection at highs near $33,000.""Another $30,000 retest for #Bitcoin,"" Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe summarized.Despite aiming for another test of monthly lows, Bitcoin's price action hardly surprised regular market participants. For fellow trader Scott Melker, it was a case of ""wait and see"" until the longer time frames completed.""6 hour looks the same as 4 hour. 12 hour needs 10 more hours, so barely worth watching. But the potential is there. Bottom line: no clear signal yet, but worth keeping an eye if they can build up,"" he wrote in part of a series of tweets on Wednesday.The resolution of current price action would, nonetheless, be a ""moment of truth"" for BTC/USD, he said.As Cointelegraph reported, attention was broadly focused on GameStop stock throughout the day, after its 700% fortnightly gains caught the attention of both the media and regulators.Likewise defying expectations was movie theater chain AMC, which gained 240% in a day after avoiding bankruptcy.If you don't like suits, buy $GME and $AMC. If you don't like the bankers, buy #BitcoinBitcoin, despite being a more cost-effective buy-in than at almost any time since Christmas, failed to hold the limelight.""People have maximum interest at $40,000 per #Bitcoin, but almost zero interest at $30,000 per #Bitcoin. Interesting,"" Van de Poppe added.Data from on-chain monitoring resource Whalemap highlighted an area at $29,300 as likely support in the event of a $30,000 breakdown.Also worth noting is the Dollar Currency Index (DXY) showing its traditional inverse correlation with BTC as the markets opened on Wednesday. The DXY rebounded to its highest level in nearly two weeks while BTC and stocks pulled back. Cryptocurrency skeptics meanwhile used the GameStop debacle to pour scorn on Bitcoin and those who argued that decentralized investment was a beneficial phenomenon.""Attention #Bitcoin HODLers: The only people who will walk away with any real winnings from the #GameStop short-squeeze will be those smart enough to sell. Those who HODL will likely lose it all. Bitcoin HODLers will meet the same fate if they fail to realize their paper profits,"" gold bug Peter Schiff tweeted.A glance at the subreddit used for stocks plays, r/Wallstreetbets, meanwhile showed that user strategies focused on hodling, not selling, their newly profitable stock — at the expense of unprepared hedge funds.""Retail reflexivity in action in traditional markets,"" commented trader Philip Swift, adding: Quotes in this article taken from previously published sources have been lightly edited."
536,"Bitcoin (BTC) mining rig manufacturer Bitmain has issued a notice to customers stating that business operations will resume as normal in light of former chairman and CEO Jihan Wu’s departure from the company.Orders of Bitmain’s ASIC mining rigs were previously halted temporarily in 2020 during an internal power struggle at the Beijing-based hardware company.In a dramatic saga that saw Bitmain’s two co-founders, Micree Zhan and Wu, attempt to oust one another from the leadership of the company, Zhan temporarily stopped a Shenzen subsidiary from shipping products to customers, as reported by local outlet The Block Beats at the time.On Wednesday, hours after Wu amicably left the company (after buying $600 million worth of shares from Zhan and other shareholders), the team behind Bitmain’s flagship Antminer product released a statement telling customers to expect business as normal:Bitmain was founded in 2013 by Zhan and Wu, and by 2018, it had become the largest manufacturer of ASIC machines for Bitcoin mining in the world. The company also runs two mining pools, Antpool and BTC.com, which collectively account for around 20% of all Bitcoin mining and 30% of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) mining.The company’s influence has seen it at the forefront of several Bitcoin-related dramas over the years, not least during the 2017 hard fork that saw Bitcoin Cash break away from Bitcoin. Bitmain sided with Bitcoin Cash during the hard fork, which arose as a result of ideological disagreements over aspects of Bitcoin’s design — specifically, the size of blocks.Despite uncertainty regarding the leadership of the company, Bitmain secured a contract for 15,000 of its Antminer S19 series machines from Riot Blockchain, a Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency mining firm, in December 2020 in a deal worth $35 million.Concerns about stockpiles of unsold merchandise may have been silenced somewhat over the New Year period as Bitcoin mining profitability increased by over 330%, according to the latest data from BitInfoCharts."
537,"Technology researcher Kevin Rooke has been tracking the Bitcoin (BTC) holdings of public companies throughout the past two years. According to Rooke, public firms now hold over $3.6 billion worth of BTC.In 2019, public companies had merely 20,000 BTC on their books. This figure has increased to 105,837 BTC in 12 months. Rooke said:Today, MicroStrategy is the biggest Bitcoin holder, with 70,784 BTC, and GalaxyDigital Holdings is a distant second, with over 16,400 BTC. Square, meanwhile, is the largest company by market capitalization among public company holders, with roughly 4,700 BTC.In a year, public companies alone accumulated around 85,000 BTC, which is equivalent to $2.67 billion.This trend is indicative of the rapidly growing institutional demand for Bitcoin, as portrayed by the surging trading activity on Grayscale and CME.Grayscale’s products and the CME Bitcoin futures market both primarily cater to institutions, and they have seen a massive uptick in volume since mid-2020.Institutions are growing their exposure to Bitcoin because of the expectations that BTC could eventually evolve into an established alternative to gold.Amid rising inflation and liquidity injections from central banks, investors and corporations are seeking ways to hedge their holdings and portfolios. Cameron Winklevoss said:If the Joe Biden administration aggressively introduces more stimulus and efforts to ease financial conditions, it would likely create a more favorable environment for Bitcoin and gold to rally.In the foreseeable future, despite the compelling macro environment, analysts are slightly cautious.Still, in the bigger picture, macro analysts say that they lean towards the bullish scenario for Bitcoin. Alex Krüger, an economist and Bitcoin trader, said:There are also expectations that more institutions will accumulate Bitcoin in the coming weeks due to brightening market sentiment.On top of this, the derivatives market has reset, with the futures market becoming less crowded. The trader further noted:Quotes in this article taken from previously published sources have been lightly edited."
538,"South African regulators are seeking to exercise more control over cryptocurrency trading following the collapse of what was alleged to be the largest Ponzi scheme the country has ever seen.Self-proclaimed Bitcoin (BTC) trading firm Mirror Trading International was placed in provisional liquidation in December 2020 as investors tried and failed to withdraw their funds. The firm claimed to have attracted over 260,000 memberships worldwide, handling a reported 23,000 Bitcoin — a sum now worth in the region of $716 million.However, an investigation by the Financial Sector Conduct Authority revealed the firm kept no accounting records, nor any kind of user database. The company’s management claimed to have been misled by CEO Johann Steynberg, who it says may have fled to Brazil.Lawyers for the firm’s remaining management stressed that the FSCA had not yet ascertained that MTI was operating as a Ponzi scheme, only that it was trading without a license.The FSCA’s head of enforcement, Brandon Topham, told Bloomberg that prosecuting authorities had to be able to stop such schemes before they gathered momentum:To that end, the authority is making proposals to formally regulate the trading of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Topham said. Topham said trying to get in early on Ponzi schemes had become fairly common practice in South Africa:In July, the Texas State Securities Board shut down MTI operations taking place in its jurisdiction after concluding that the project was a multilevel marketing scheme. South Africa’s own regulators were already suspicious of MTI’s claims that it would return 10% profit per month for every user.“It’s going to take a serious investigation to ascertain how much was involved,” Topham told Bloomberg, adding that two other firms were under investigation for possible ties to MTI. Liquidators have thus far failed to trace all of the company’s assets and are expected to be granted an expanded final liquidation order on March 1, assuming legal proceedings remain unopposed.While governments have flirted with cryptocurrency regulation for years, they are now being pushed into enacting concrete laws due to the rising profile of Bitcoin and associated cryptocurrencies.In December 2020, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said that the United States Treasury Department was proposing laws that could see exchanges require a name and physical address for users involved in any crypto transaction exceeding $3,000 in value."
539,"Bitcoin (BTC) showed little signs of improvement on Jan. 27, but one major fund believes that it will benefit from new trends among investors. At the same time, all eyes have been on GameStop (GME) price volatility this week.By comparison, GME has dwarfed BTC in gains so far this year, up over 3,000% percent, with some analysts calling the jaw-dropping rally ""dangerous.”Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that BTC/USD suffered from selling pressure over the 24 hours leading up to Wednesday, trading at around $30,900 at the time of writing.A classic consolidatory move for Bitcoin, the ranging price behavior followed a brief spurt of volatility in which the largest cryptocurrency broke $30,000 support, only to rise to then see rejection at $35,000.While mainstream media narratives on its performance were as mixed as ever, attention had already focused on another asset that commentators decided was more concerning. GameStop, the penny stock that delivered almost 700% gains in two weeks, should be investigated by United States regulators.An Elon Musk tweet also propelled GME stock higher in afterhours trading. Gamestonk!! https://t.co/RZtkDzAewJWell-known investor Michael Burry, who himself took a position in GameStop, warned in a now-deleted tweet quoted by Bloomberg on Tuesday:For Bitcoin proponents, however, it was the style, not substance, behind the investment that was worth noting.Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital — which has a $385 million BTC allocation — highlighted retail investor participation in the GameStop boom as well as its social media genesis as proof of the changing face of the market.“The activity in GameStop is more proof of concept that Bitcoin is going to work,” he told Bloomberg.Trading volumes for GameStop beat Bitcoin by a considerable margin over the past day, reaching $20 billion compared with $13 billion for BTC.“It’s the age of the micro investor and you better take it seriously, otherwise you’ll get taken to the cleaners,” Scaramucci added.As Cointelegraph reported, a lull in the Bitcoin bull market soon took the wind out of trading activity, which instead began to focus on altcoins on the back of Ether (ETH) setting new all-time highs this week."
540,"Early Bitcoin investor and industry proponent Chamath Palihapitiya has signaled a potential run for the position of California governor.The CEO of venture capital firm Social Capital, Chamath Palihapitiya, appeared to announce his intentions in a Tweet on January 26. The post linked to his new website with a number of promises for the U.S. state including massive tax cuts, an increase for teacher’s salaries, the end of student loans, and a handout for new births.Palihapitiya appears to be gearing up for the 2022 Gubernatorial race or potentially for a special election, though no specifics were provided beyond his intentions to get involved politically.The billionaire businessman has also joined efforts to force a recall vote for the current California governor Gavin Newsom which would lead to a special election later in 2021 according to reports.A growing number of Californians have been displeased with Newsom’s performance in the position, especially when it comes to inconsistent shutdowns and a slow-moving Covid-19 vaccine rollout.It’s on. #RecallGavinNewsom https://t.co/r8Cwd4szrnThe former Facebook executive Palihapitiya was an early investor in Bitcoin (he bought a million) and he says he wants to maintain the state’s status as a leading technology hub:In an interview on January 7, he said that he sees Bitcoin as insurance against economic uncertainty and that its price could soar to $200,000 over the next five to ten years.According to an April 2020 Forbes article, Palihapitiya bought Bitcoin back in 2013 when the price was around $80 per coin, and he claims that at one point he owned around 5% of the entire Bitcoin supply.There have been a number of pro-crypto moves in U.S. politics since President Biden took office on January 20 which include the nomination of former member of Ripple’s board of advisors directors, Michael Barr, as the next Comptroller of the Currency. Additionally, the Biden administration has also picked crypto-knowledgeable Gary Gensler to head the Securities and Exchange Commission."
541,"Today Bitcoin (BTC) price continued to face selling pressure in the $32,500 to $33,000 resistance cluster and this led to a mild 3% to 5% pull back from most altcoins.Despite the recent revelation that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has given the green light for two of its funds to invest in Bitcoin futures, BTC price still struggles to gain momentum above the $33,000 level.Meanwhile, the DeFi sector continues to flourish as Venus (XVS) and Fantom (FTM) saw their prices increase 23% overnight and the total value locked in DeFi protocols currently stands at $25.77 billion.Following the confirmation of Janet Yellen as the new secretary of the United States Treasury, the department’s dreaded cryptocurrency monitoring rule is now back in motion and the public has 60 days to comment on the proposed self-hosted wallet requirement.Selling wasn’t limited to just the cryptocurrency sector as global financial markets also fell under pressure following news that the upcoming stimulus package offered by the Biden administration might not be as large as previously suggested.The S&P 500 and Dow both faced selling pressure at the opening bell and finished the day down 0.15% and 0.07% respectively, while the NASDAQ was able to eke out a positive gain of 0.05%.The Reddit-based investing group that recently put the squeeze on short-sellers betting against GameStop (GME) were able to regroup overnight and managed to push the price of GME up to $145.57 on Jan. 26, near its all-time high of $159.18.DeFi related coins continue to surge higher despite the waning momentum seen from Bitcoin and Ether (ETH).Uniswap’s trading volume surged above $6 billion earlier today and this helped lift the price of it’s governance token (UNI) to a new 2021 high at $13.67. Terra (LUNA), a stablecoin-oriented project, also saw its price increase by more than 37% and currently trades at $1.22.Fantom (FTM) and Alpha Finance (ALPHA) have also seen an influx of buying activity in the past 24-hours and both rallied 22% and 35% during today’s trading session.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $947.6 billion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 62.9%."
542,"Over the last 48 hours, Bitcoin (BTC) price climbed from $31,000 to $34,800 before reversing course and dropping the majority of these gains. While this $3,800 shift to the downside might not seem significant, the 12% oscillation liquidated $660 million worth of futures contracts.While it’s unlikely that there will ever be a definitive answer behind the move, on Jan. 25, President Joe Biden voiced his willingness to lower the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. This might have reduced incentives for those buying BTC as an inflation protection or a hedge against U.S. dollar devaluation versus leading global currencies.Shorter-term charts might not reflect Bitcoin’s bullishness, but several derivatives indicators and the top traders' flow leaves no room for expecting sub-$30,000 prices.Bitcoin has been testing the $30,800 support, but bulls have shown aggressive buying activity below that level. Not surprisingly, both MicroStrategy and Marathon Patent Group have recently announced sizeable acquisitions.Data shows that the top traders at OKEx have been heavily buying the dip and the futures contracts premium does not reflect excessive leverage from buyers.One should keep in mind that the Jan. 29 futures' expiry will extinguish $4.9 billion worth of futures contracts, or 47% of the total $10.5 billion open interest.Albeit initially worrisome, a large part of those contracts are usually rolled over. These include $1.53 billion at OKEx, $875 million at CME and $840 million at Binance.Traders who are currently long can buy a longer-term contract while simultaneously closing their January futures position. Thus, regardless of being (or not being) underwater, as long as there's enough margin deposited, both sides can keep their bets open.While the recent liquidations may have been large, professional traders are not easily shaken by a mere 12% price swing. This hypothesis is especially true considering Bitcoin's 120% annualized volatility.To understand how whales and arbitrage desks may have positioned themselves during this period, one should analyze the top traders' long-to-short ratio and the futures contracts premium.There’s not really a concrete way to gauge a trader's net position effectively, as they could be holding coins in a cold wallet or using multiple exchanges simultaneously.Furthermore, when combining options with futures contracts, it becomes virtually impossible to interpret an investors' position by solely looking at spot and futures exposure.Since Jan. 22, top Binance traders held a steady and balanced position, but they started to add longs in the early hours of Jan. 25. This trend continued on Jan. 26, and the indicator currently favors longs by 13%. Currently, the top Binance traders' long-to-short ratio remains below its 1.20 monthly average.On the other hand, top traders at Huobi averaged a 0.85 long-to-short ratio over the last 30 days, favoring net shorts by 15%. On Jan. 25, as Bitcoin made its $34,800 local top, those traders increased their net shorts to 25%. Therefore, by correctly trading the movement, they could repurchase those contracts at lower prices and currently stand at 0.85, which is their monthly average.Lastly, top OKEx traders have been aggressively buying since Jan. 25, causing the long-to-short ratio to reach its highest level in 30 days at 2.64. This means longs held 164% larger positions than top traders with negative net exposure. Considering that this happened while BTC dropped from $34,800 down to $31,100, these traders will face serious liquidation risks if markets turn bearish.When it comes to the futures premium, traders should expect a 10% to 20% annualized premium (basis) versus regular spot exchanges on healthy markets. This indicator should be comparable to the stablecoins deposits' yields.Whenever this indicator sustains levels below that range, it should be considered an alarming signal. On the other hand, a sustainable basis above 20% signals excessive leverage from buyers, creating the potential for massive liquidations and eventual market crashes.The above chart shows the futures premium oscillating near 4.5%, translating to a bullish 22% annualized basis. After the Jan. 20 BTC price crash, the indicator scaled back to 3.3%, and more recently to 2.2% as BTC tested its $31,000 support. The current 12% annualized premium stands at a neutral position.More importantly, there haven’t been any signs of desperation in derivatives markets. The absence of a futures contracts premium would be easily noticed in such a situation.Even though the OKEx long-to-short position might seem excessive, the overall market structure is far from being over-leveraged. Thus, even if BTC repeats its Jan. 4 crash test of sub-$28,000 levels, buyers have ammunition left to turn away the short-term bearish tide.All eyes now should be focused on the $4 billion options Jan. 29 expiry, which currently favors bulls, as Cointelegraph reported.

543,"A new report by CoinShares suggests Bitcoin (BTC) has garnered 97% of the total crypto inflows in 2021.The recent correction in Bitcoin price does not seem to have deterred crypto investors as CoinShares data shows a record $1.3 billion in crypto product inflows over the past week. This suggests that investors are accumulating on the dips rather than attempting to chase higher prices.Another space that has taken giant strides in the past few months has been the decentralized finance sector. While bond yields across the world are reeling near-zero levels, the attractive yield farming opportunities in DeFi and flash loans have attracted investors, boosting the total value locked to $26.1 billion on Jan. 25.Unless the markets are gripped in panic, there are always certain sections that are in a bull phase. The tokens selected today have also outperformed the broader market in the short term.Let’s investigate some of the fundamental reasons behind their bullish moves and pinpoint the critical levels to watch out for.Transferring money seamlessly across borders without having to pay high fees is a necessity in today’s world and Celo (CELO) aims to ease this process. The project is gradually gaining adoption as there is now $30 million worth of cUSD in circulation.After the success of cUSD, the platform plans to launch a new stablecoin that is pegged to the euro in the next two months. Similar to its cUSD, the euro stablecoin will use a basket of crypto assets to keep the price closely pegged to the underlying asset. Celo’s partnership with KardiaChain, Kadena, and Paychant opens several new opportunities for its users. The community also cheered Celo’s listing on Binance exchange on Jan. 5 and the altcoin broke out strongly after listing.Celo recently announced a rewards program and starting Jan. 25 users who maintain a certain minimum average monthly balance of cUSD will earn rewards in CELO on a first-come, first-serve basis.Along with the products, the credibility of the project is also important for its success. On that front, Celo’s inclusion in the World Economic Forum’s Global Future Council on Cryptocurrencies may have worked as a big positive.CELO price surged from $1.752 on Jan. 12 to an intraday high at $3.922 on Jan. 22, a gain of 123% within ten days. The token is currently forming a rounding bottom pattern that will complete on a breakout and close above $4.50.The CELO/USD pair has started a new uptrend and has been making a series of higher highs and higher lows. This suggests a bullish sentiment and traders are buying on dips. The moving averages are sloping upward and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the overbought zone, indicating an advantage to the bulls.The pair does not have any major resistance until it reaches $4.30 but the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to stall the current up-move in the $3.60 to $3.922 zone. If they succeed, the pair could drop to the 20-day exponential moving average ($2.528) where buyers are likely to step in.A strong rebound off the 20-day EMA will keep the uptrend intact and the bulls will then again try to push the price to $4.30. A breakout and close above the $4.30 to $4.50 resistance zone could start the next leg of the uptrend.This bullish view will invalidate if the pair breaks below the 20-day EMA. In such a case, the pair could drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($1.95).The DeFi space continues to hold strong even as major cryptocurrencies are witnessing a sharp correction. This shows users’ confidence in DeFi and the ability of the sectors' projects to offer much better returns compared to altcoins.Venus Protocol (XVS) is exclusively on Binance Smart Chain, therefore it did not suffer from the detrimental effects of high gas fees that negatively impacted DeFi projects in early January. This could have attracted some traders to jump over to Venus.Decentralization is one of the key factors in crypto and Venus completed the transition on Jan. 15. The protocol will now be governed by the community, which is a welcome step in the right direction. The positives of the past few days may have resulted in its total value locked to jumping to $400 million.XVS has risen from an intraday low at $3.945 on Jan. 18 to an intraday high at $12.90 today, a 227% rally within a short span. The momentum picked up after the bulls pushed the price above the stiff $5 to $6 overhead resistance zone on Jan. 23.Some profit-booking was seen on Jan. 25 but the bulls purchased the dip and pushed the price above $9.89 today to resume the uptrend. Crossing into double digits seems to have ignited the bulls who have continued to buy at higher levels.The XVS/USD pair could now rally to $15 and then to $20. However, the recent rally has pushed the RSI deep into the overbought territory, which increases the risk of a correction or consolidation.If the price turns down from the current levels, it is likely to find support at $10. A strong rebound off this level will suggest the previous resistance has flipped to support and the bulls will then try to resume the uptrend. On the contrary, if the price breaks below $10, the correction could deepen to $8.FantomFinance (FTM) is another DeFi project that is acting as a bright spot that is leading the market higher.Fantom recently entered into a partnership with Injective Protocol that is expected to increase adoption as users can access assets on both chains. Together both teams plan to bring new and innovative synthetic products to the market, tapping the ever-growing popularity of synthetics and decentralized derivatives trading.This offers an opportunity for the traders to benefit from trading markets that are in a trend rather than getting stuck to a specific asset class. FTM’s recent listing on SushiSwap also seems to have been cheered by the community.FTM has soared from an intraday low at $0.0241 on Jan. 22 to an intraday high at $0.0678 today, a 181% rally within five days. The bulls had pushed the price above the $0.05665 resistance on Jan. 24 and 25 but could not sustain the higher levels.The bears attempted to start a correction on Jan. 25 but the bulls were in no mood to relent. They have aggressively propelled the price to a new all-time high today. However, the sharp rally of the past few days has pushed the RSI deep into the overbought territory, which could start a correction or consolidation.If the price turns down from the current levels but rebounds off the $0.05665 support, it will suggest the previous resistance has flipped to support. The FTM/USD pair may then start the next leg of the uptrend that could reach $0.0850.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $0.05665, the pair could drop to $0.05 and then to $0.045. A break below this support could signal a change in trend.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

544,"When Bitcoin (BTC) launched in 2009, it was motivated by the distrust of financial institutions and their fees and the inflationary practices by central banks during the Great Recession. Bitcoin was supposed to usher in an era of decentralization, financial inclusion and democratization. Yet more than a decade later, with Bitcoin prices surging, we’re witnessing the digital asset being hoarded by large, centralized financial institutions, risking the principles behind its creation. Bitcoin is now in danger of being predominantly in the domain of the financially included — exactly the types of institutions that the creators sought to avoid in the first place.Related: Why institutions suddenly give a damn about BitcoinMeanwhile, in the context of other potential applications of blockchain on which Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built, Big Tech has matured in its midst, with many seeing the problems of anti-competition and the abuse of power that come with its size. Problems such as economic and financial control, data privacy, disinformation and the general usurping of users are the symptoms of structures that we have let become too powerful.It is 2021, and we risk never fulfilling the promise of adoption that will be possible with these technologies. While the community has been preoccupied with profit-making from crypto, we have the opportunity to create even more massive value as an industry. The potential is not today’s crypto market capitalizations but the billions of users and trillions of dollars of market potential that are this technology’s true promise.As an entrepreneur who was around for the last technological disruption of the internet, I played a role in one of the internet’s most dominant categories: social networks. As a co-founder of LinkedIn, I’m struck by a similar kind of idealism that pervaded the Internet 1.0 era, but I also see the chasm between those in this new art and those who have yet to experience its benefits and question its existence.Crypto and blockchain remain in their infancy many years after their creation. There are some hundreds of millions of Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) wallets, while the internet boasts 4.7 billion users. Even under an optimistic assumption of 250 million wallets and one user per wallet, crypto’s user base represents only 5% of internet users. The recent ascendancy of crypto’s market cap to $1 trillion is only 1% of the worldwide public stock markets’ total market cap, which stands at $90 trillion. Most blockchain projects today still have woefully limited adoption, and their tokens are subject to volatile speculation.With the exception of Bitcoin, which is finally being endorsed by the experts, and decentralized finance, which in its current speculative state has the potential to demonstrate real-world value, this community knows its fair share of skeptics. The mainstream still wonders whether crypto and blockchain are solutions in search of a problem when centralized solutions seem to be working just fine at scale. The industry still has not captured the imagination of the mainstream nor shown signs of mass adoption.Putting the ideals aside, I believe decentralized technologies can fix the vexing problems of Big Tech and finance in the years to come. To do this, we need to adopt a more pragmatic, business-minded approach to our industry. This mentality might run counter to the sensibilities of our entrepreneurs in the community. I’ve seen too many efforts that don’t work on products that are relevant to the mainstream. Nor do we measure success in terms of traditional key performance indicators such as product-market fit, user bases or revenue. We still talk about utopian concepts and the size of our communities that speculate on tokens but don’t mostly use them.As an industry, we need to work on solutions that appeal to the mainstream, with a focus on applications or decentralized applications. We should figure out the applications before investing too much more in infrastructure projects that abound in the ecosystem.Today the world’s top companies provide applications for end-users and are not infrastructure providers. Take a look at the top 50 internet companies: Almost all of them offer solutions to a large addressable market of users that have big active user bases. What’s more, for the ones offering infrastructure solutions, they started by bringing applications to market first. Only after these applications achieved some form of scale did these companies offer infrastructure tools. The most notable examples include Amazon and Amazon Web Services (in 1994 and 2006, respectively), Facebook and Facebook Platform (in 2004 and 2007), Google and Google Cloud (in 1998 and 2008), and LinkedIn and Confluent (in 2003 and 2014).These companies fulfilled a need first for ordinary users, and only after their infrastructures were scaling did they launch their own tools. By then, these infrastructure technologies solved real-world needs, and they were also conveniently battle-tested. Sure, there were also plenty of infrastructure companies created during the first internet era, but can we name any of them today?Our industry might have gotten it wrong when it focused on infrastructure from the beginning. Just because Ethereum won critical attention early on, it shouldn’t have resulted in so many other infrastructure projects.We should be emphasizing the creation of more decentralized applications. Let’s identify and focus on use cases that have large addressable markets with pain points and opportunities to provide solutions. We should then strive to work on achieving product-market fit. Let’s also be bolder and look beyond financial use cases. There are plenty of mainstream opportunities, including better versions of Big Tech applications, and new use cases yet to be discovered. With working solutions for real users, we should work backward to technologies that will be truly useful to develop.Those decentralized solutions have to be noticeably better than existing centralized solutions. Decentralization promoted for its own sake is not enough, as the benefits for users have to be clear and tangible to convince them to switch and adopt the decentralized versions.Digital assets such as Bitcoin are already on their way to demonstrating their superior characteristics as a hedge over traditional currencies, and DeFi has the opportunity to truly reach the underserved in financial services with its borderless capabilities. Many more types of services need to be developed.While the industry will discover which solutions will be better than their centralized counterparts, the topic that we should be passionate about is digital identity and reputation. The category of social media platforms that have so dominated the first internet era and make billions of dollars of revenue (Facebook: $70 billion, Twitter: $3.5 billion, YouTube: $15.1 billion) and even more in market cap (Facebook: $805 billion, Twitter: $40 billion) depends on user data that consists of user identities.These platforms make money knowing their users’ behaviors, interests and other aspects of their identity. Yet, monetary incentives between platforms and users are in conflict, with the platforms reaping all of the monetary benefits from user data while user identities are held hostage. The bargain in return is for users to continue to use the platforms for free. Since their rise, we’ve also been facing serious existential challenges from disinformation and data breaches.Decentralized approaches hold the promise to address the vastly inequitable distribution of value from user identity and reputation. The overall value of user data can be more equitably distributed, with the worth of identities transferred to users. The better the reputation someone has, the more economic opportunities they can access. Think influencers but democratized to everyone, for everyone has a reputation. And there are additional benefits for users, such as control over the circumstances under which to share their identity data. There’s also the potential of a decentralized solution to disinformation.Finally, it’s necessary to make the benefits of this technology more accessible and convenient by making decentralized products much easier to use. When the overall friction of a product is reduced and it can be conveniently accessed, this is when it will gain more users.We need to focus on ease-of-use. We should be spending as much time considering user experience as we do on smart contracts and blockchains. Truly secure wallets, one of the foundational elements of this technology, are still too complex for the average person. Let’s strive to live up to the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke’s saying that “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” Products should just work for people. A successful decentralized service means that users should not have to know that it is powered by a blockchain underneath, just like traditional applications don’t need users to know that there are underlying database systems.As an industry, we have been terrible at explaining what we do to users and need to much better explain our solutions. Much of the technical jargon used in the space speaks to cypherpunks and finance wonks, whether it’s proof-of-anything or financial concepts such as yield farming. Granted, it’s natural for innovators and developers to create a common language for working together, but it’s a very limited group of people. It’s important to associate our work in everyday terms that a mainstream audience would value, speaking to benefits such as enablement, convenience, speed and/or lower costs. The efforts by mainstream companies like PayPal and Square should be celebrated, but the decentralized natives would be remiss not to offer their own hopefully superior versions.Related: Will PayPal’s crypto integration bring crypto to the masses? Experts answerIn the arc of history, including the history of technology, the world oscillates between centralized and decentralized structures while always tending toward more decentralization. Let’s take full advantage of the approaching trend toward decentralization. As with the internet era, the winners of the decentralized economy may well be those efforts that play to massive addressable markets and connect meaningful value to the masses.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
545,"The rise of cryptocurrencies over the past few months, especially with the onset of 2021, has certainly catapulted the crypto niche into the mainstream. While traders buy and sell and try to calculate how much this or that currency has grown by and as large investment funds predict that Bitcoin (BTC) will soon reach $100,000 per coin, big things are also happening in the crypto mining space.Miners in the largest pool, F2Pool, reportedly contributed to the recent fall of BTC price and then to its subsequent recovery, while individual miners from the United States and France are even heating houses in winter with their machines. This indeed suggests that Bitcoin is one of the lifelines of the industry, especially with 2021 promising to be a year filled with new crypto mining products, especially video cards.At the end of 2020, several new products were expected from the two largest GPU card manufacturers, Nvidia and AMD, and it didn’t take them long to deliver. During the annual CES technology conference at the beginning of January, the manufacturers did not present the final versions of their GPU cards but confirmed that they will arrive on shelves very soon.Users will be interested in the AMD Radeon RX 6700 and RX 6700 XT cards, which are intended to replace the Radeon RX 5700 and RX 5700 XT cards. This new series is interesting because according to some experts, the RX 6700 will be able to outperform its competitor and undisputed leader among miners, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti.The new card can support up to 12 GB of GDDR6 memory, a powerful cooling system — like the GeForce RTX 3070 has — a 192-bit memory bus and 96 MB of Infinity Cache memory. An important factor for the popularity of the card will be the price, and because it’s reportedly cheaper to produce than the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, the retail price is expected to be lower.Why then can the RX 6700 be a success? Before purchasing a GPU card, miners look at the profitability of the cards — but here, AMD has problems. Of the 10 most profitable cards, almost all positions are occupied by Nvidia products. Of course, there is the AMD Radeon VII, which is very good, but when talking about cards that occupy the middle price category of $400 to $500, AMD is not in a strong position. This is why the RX 6700 series can possibly become a contender for the top five video cards of 2021.What about Nvidia? Unfortunately, the company has yet to unveil a launch plan for a new card, perhaps because the RTX 3000 series just came out and is breaking all demand records, leading to a shortage of cards. Even before the new year, the new RTX 3080, 3070, 3060 Ti and 3090 were hard to find, even at several times their retail prices. The company admitted that this problem will likely not be resolved until April or May.The RTX 3000 series is so popular because they are the most profitable cards for mining. According to some estimates, one GeForce RTX 3080 card can bring in $6 to $9 per day when mining Ether (ETH), and investments can be recouped in just two to six months — not bad for today’s network complexity.But the manufacturer can get out of the crisis in a fairly simple way: Make cards specifically for miners and thus reduce the demand for the RTX 3000 series and end the struggle between gamers and miners.Recently, the chief financial officer of Nvidia said that if demand from miners continues to grow, then the manufacturer may resume the production of the crypto-mining processor series. At the moment, the decision regarding their production has not yet been announced, which is understandable, as the previous generation of such cards in 2017 to 2018 was not widespread and the manufacturer fears another failure.But that time, Nvidia presented special equipment for mining rather late, when many were already mining on readily available cards. Additionally, the timing was bad, as the wave of interest in crypto began to subside and the market entered a prolonged bearish period. This time, if Nvidia does a quick job of it and manages to release the cards within the next six months, then these cards may still come out while there is an ongoing shortage for the RTX 3000 series.While Nvidia is cautious regarding announcing its own new mining cards, other manufacturers are starting to produce mining video cards based on the Nvidia architecture. MSI recently registered several products with the Eurasian Economic Commission — the main regulatory body of the Eurasian Economic Union, which consists of Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan — including the MSI GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Miner 8G and 8G OC GPU cards, which are designed specifically for mining.Of course, this registration does not necessarily mean that the company will release these products, and it does not reveal a possible launch date, but this step clearly means that some manufacturers are interested in catering to the needs of miners and are determined to release very specific solutions.The fact is that while there is no special, up-to-date equipment for mining, all users end up buying the same latest cards, which operate well in both scenarios. For gamers, the main indicator of the quality of a card is the frame rate per second it achieves when playing the newest game at the maximum video settings.The leader among gamers right now is the new Nvidia RTX 3090, which achieves 152.7 fps. A more popular card is the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 with 142.1 fps, which costs about $700 and works on the improved Ampere architecture. The only problem is that this card is as hard to find as a Sony Playstation 5.But gamers should not be discouraged because there are signs that manufacturers are generally moving toward dividing equipment into mining and gaming. Nvidia announced that in February, the GeForce RTX 3060 will be released for sale and come equipped with 12 GB of GDDR6 video memory.These cards will only be issued by Nvidia partner companies. Hong Kong-based Zotac has already presented two versions of the cards. The main thing that should please gamers is that they will not be powerful enough for mining and will only be suitable for games.It seems that for the near future, unfortunately, miners should be looking out for any GPU available on the market and cease hoping to strike gold by buying the latest and greatest. Ilya Goldberg, managing partner of Ecos-M — which operates a cloud mining center — said that 2021 will likely go by without any major shocks for the mining industry:Anyways, there is no need to fall into despair, as hardware manufacturers are evidently taking steps to meet the demand of all consumers — miners and gamers — which means that slowly but surely they are recognizing the power and demand of mining and are looking to deliver products for the industry."
546,"On Jan. 20, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with over $8.7 trillion assets under management, appeared to have given the green light to two of its associated funds, BlackRock Global Allocation Fund Inc. and BlackRock Funds, to invest in Bitcoin futures. In this regard, the prospectus documents filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission suggest that BlackRock is looking to dabble in Bitcoin (BTC), especially as the first ever cryptocurrency has been added to the company’s lists of derivative products cleared for use.Furthermore, over the last few months, the company’s executive brass had spoken positively about Bitcoin, alluding to the fact that in the near future, a number of institutions may look toward digital assets to expand their list of financial offerings.For example, in an interview last November, Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of BlackRock, said that Bitcoin has the potential to “take the place of gold to a large extent.” A somewhat similar sentiment was echoed by the company’s CEO, Larry Fink, who told the media that Bitcoin has caught the attention of the masses and has the potential to possibly evolve into a global market of its own.Lastly, it’s also worth remembering that exactly one month ago, BlackRock posted a job advert seeking a qualified individual for the role of vice president, blockchain lead for its New York office. According to the post, the role required applicants to be able to devise and set in motion various strategies that can help “drive demand for the firm’s investments and technology offerings.”BlackRock investing in Bitcoin futures is a significant step forward for the global crypto ecosystem, as it brings tremendous credibility to Bitcoin as a new asset class. Jason Lau, chief operating officer of cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin, told Cointelegraph that this move will set the stage for other asset managers to follow since most traditional asset managers are typically “consensus followers,” adding:Currently, CME futures and investments trust shares issued by Grayscale and Bitwise are two of the primary vehicles for institutions to get involved with crypto. However, due to this severe limitation, there have been large premiums from trusts versus the underlying price of BTC. For example, Lau stated that during the recent BTC price appreciation in December, Grayscale had a 40% premium on Bitcoin’s underlying value.Kyle Samani, a managing partner at Multicoin Capital — a thesis-driven investment firm — told Cointelegraph that BlackRock’s entry is a big step forward for the entire industry. He believes that by enabling some of its funds to go long on BTC, it will allow more investors to join the space.While some are rejoicing at the news of BlackRock making its way into the crypto market, Maksim Balashevich, founder and CEO of Santiment — a market intelligence platform for cryptocurrencies — told Cointelegraph that from a purely “behavior analyses” standpoint, it’s not just the big headlines that should be considered.Instead, the reaction of the masses, which, more often than not, is the single most crucial factor that determines market price action, could be more decisive. He added: “BlackRock’s entry is no special event but just yet another ‘latecomer’ from ‘big money’ funds. The move won’t have any implications except further professionalizing, increasing the liquidity of the market.”When asked about the impact BlackRock’s entry may have on Bitcoin’s potential value stabilization, Balashevich pointed out that despite these “big moves,” crypto volatility is here to stay and that many more ups and downs will happen in the coming months. “Players like BlackRock are sharks playing against each other,” he said.Lastly, on the subject of whether the point of saturation in terms of institutional entry into this space is getting closer, he believes that the industry is indeed “getting very close to the top” and that “there aren’t too many big players left to enter the market.”Historically, the SEC has rejected a number of ETF proposals — such as those submitted by Phoenix Wilshire, Gemini, etc. — sighting price manipulation, lack of liquidity and price indexing sources as key concerns. However, with BlackRock making inroads into this space, it seems as though the stage may finally be set for an ETF being approved sometime in 2021, as Lau pointed out:He pointed out that it will be extremely interesting to see if BlackRock’s ETF business, iShares, decides to become the first major mover to recognize this fast-opening window of opportunity and file for an ETF itself. Recently, investment management firm VanEck has once again submitted an application with the SEC to create a new Bitcoin ETF. This move was followed by another similar application submitted by Valkyrie Investments. So the ETF race is back on following a brief period of calm.Also, with Bitcoin recently scaling past the $42,000 threshold, it appears as though a number of Wall Street institutions are quickly warming up to the crypto industry, as is highlighted by the fact that MassMutual recently became the latest big-name player from the realm of traditional finance to acquire $100+ million worth of BTC.Not only that, a number of high-profile investors such as Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller have cozied up to this relatively new asset class in recent times and from the corporate domain, companies such as Square and PayPal have purchased Bitcoin."
547,"Bitcoin (BTC) hodlers hoping for a return to the bull run may not have long to wait, as a popular indicator gives cause for optimism.As compiled by on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode, data from the Bitcoin spent output profit ratio (SOPR) suggests that the current BTC price correction is almost complete.The SOPR tracks the percentage of coins being moved that are in profit — in other words, whether hodlers are selling at a profit or loss.When the indicator is above 1 and falling, it reflects sellers divorcing themselves of their holdings at various profit margins. Once 1 is hit, ""resetting"" the SOPR, sellers have sold all that they can, which reduces downward price pressure and notionally allows Bitcoin to increase once again.The SOPR has shown its muscle in various phases of past bull cycles, and the resetting phenomenon was particularly successful at charting price bottoms in 2020. Now, with a decreasing trend nearing the magical 1 value, market participants are hoping that the past week's sell-off may be the end, rather than the beginning, of lackluster performance.""So, if we are in a bull market now, according to the SOPR the correction is not over yet, but it will end soon,"" popular Twitter account CryptoHamster wrote on Tuesday, uploading an annotated Glassnode chart.If the SOPR repeats its historical pattern, it may please some investors who have witnessed considerable volatility so far this year. While commentators argue that Bitcoin could not have continued its vertical gains for an extended period under any circumstances, cold feet have characterized reactions to Bitcoin's correction from $42,000 to under $30,000.Amid a sea of explanations for the sudden slump, proponents are highlighting institutional involvement as an antidote to panic from retail sellers and criticism from the mainstream news and financial sector. Grayscale, for example, has resumed its buying after the holiday break ended, regularly adding many more times the amount of BTC than is mined during the same period. ""$1.31 billion flowed into Bitcoin and crypto investment products last week (a new record) as investors rushed to buy the dip,"" entrepreneur Alistair Milne summarized on Twitter Tuesday. He added that 97% of that new capital entered Bitcoin, specifically.Disclaimer: Quotes in this article taken from previously published sources have been lightly edited."
548,"Foundry, a wholly owned cryptocurrency mining subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, or DCG, has entered the top 10 largest Bitcoin (BTC) mining pools in the world.The firm's CEO, Barry Silbert, announced the news on Tuesday, predicting that Foundry will soon break into the top five mining pools list.At publishing time, Foundry has a total hash rate of 2.74 exahashes per second, according to data from block explorer BTC.com. The mining pool is responsible for 1.85% of the total global hash rate.The news comes shortly after Silbert announced that global Bitcoin miners will be able to join the Foundry pool starting in February. The CEO also expressed optimism about the United States’ mining power, predicting that Foundry will “soon become the largest U.S.-based bitcoin mining pool.”Officially introduced by DCG in August 2020, Foundry is still far from the world’s top mining pools like F2Pool and Binance Pool in terms of hash rate. China-based F2Pool — the largest mining pool, comprising 18% of the total hash rate — is generating a hash rate of more than 24 EH/s at publishing time.Launched by Binance in April 2020, Binance Pool is now the second-largest mining pool, responsible for nearly 13% of total global Bitcoin mining power. The pool’s hash rate amounts to 19.16 EH/s at publishing time.As Cointelegraph reported on Friday, F2Pool’s activity was likely a major reason behind Bitcoin’s recent sell-off, resulting in its price dipping below $29,000."
549,"David Puell, an on-chain analyst and the creator of the Puell Multiple, believes two things could cause Bitcoin (BTC) to see a temporary top this cycle.The analyst pinpointed the U.S. government potentially taxing unrealized gains and the possible approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) could cause BTC’s momentum to slow down.The potential impact of the U.S. government imposing taxes on unrealized gains on the price of Bitcoin is quite clear.At the end of each taxation cycle, Bitcoin could see a heightened level of selling pressure, pushing its momentum down.But the prospect of a Bitcoin ETF potentially having a negative effect on the price of Bitcoin is a relatively new concept.Puell explains that the arbitrage play of taking advantage of the premium of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has been a major catalyst for BTC’s recent rally.The approval of an ETF could slow down the inflow of capital into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which then could ostensibly lower the demand for Bitcoin on paper. Puell said:These two events are unlikely to happen anytime in the near future. Puell emphasized that if they do happen, however, they would be fundamentally bearish for Bitcoin. He explained:Nevertheless, Bitcoin has a good chance of breaking out of the $35,000 resistance level in the short term. It rose to as high as $34,880 on Jan. 25, demonstrating strong momentum in an overnight rally.But, Bitcoin has struggled to break out of the critical $35,000 level, pulling back below $32,000 on Jan. 26.Loma, a pseudonymous cryptocurrency trader, said that the failure to surpass $35,000 could make altcoins more compelling, especially if the BTC momentum dwindles. He noted:As Cointelegraph reported, the weakness of Bitcoin in the past two weeks has led the ETH/BTC pair to break out. Large-cap altcoins, including Ether and DeFi tokens, have performed particularly well against BTC so far this year.If Bitcoin continues to consolidate under $35,000 for now, altcoins will be in a good position to catch up in value against, particularly in their respective BTC pairs, in the first quarter of 2021."
550,"Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, remains the most preferred digital currency for investors, according to a new report.Bitcoin inflows accounted for 97% of total crypto inflows so far in 2021, according to a Jan. 25 report by digital asset investing company CoinShares.Bitcoin comprises 83% of digital asset investment products under management, while BTC investment products represent just 6.5% of total Bitcoin trading turnover. Amid a major cryptocurrency bull run in January, daily BTC trading volumes have massively surged so far this year, increasing from an average of $2.2 billion in 2020 to $12.3 billion this year.Crypto investment product inflows hit a record of $1.3 billion over the past week following a period of minor outflows, CoinShares noted. “We believe investors have been very price conscious this year due to the speed at which prices in Bitcoin achieved new highs,” the firm added.Ether (ETH) — the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap — saw inflows of $34 million over the past week, according to CoinShares’ data. There were “little inflows since early December” as investors have been cautious, the report noted.Both Bitcoin and Ether hit their new all-time highs in 2021. Bitcoin broke its historical high of $42,000 on Jan. 8, followed by Ether’s ATH of $1,430 on Jan. 19. Both cryptocurrencies were subject to a major price correction, with Bitcoin plunging below $30,000 and Ether dropping to around $1,000 on Jan. 21.According to CoinShares, the recent price dip was partly prompted by recent comments from Secretary of the United States Treasury Janet Yellen. On Jan. 19, Yellen expressed concerns over cryptocurrencies, claiming that crypto is often used for illicit financing. However, she noted that crypto has some potential to improve the financial system."
551,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell towards $30,000 on Jan. 26 after higher levels evaporated and fresh miner outflows appeared to suppress price action.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and Tradingview showed the largest cryptocurrency abruptly U-turn as it neared $35,000 in early week trading. At the time of writing, BTC/USD was lingering closer to $31,000, marking 24-hour losses in excess of 5%.A combination of factors, all of which suggest a short-term profit-taking mission among market participants, entered the scene on Monday to keep bulls from taking prices higher. Data shows that miner outflows — funds leaving mining pools — continued to spike this week. As Cointelegraph reported, last week's price dive came as largest pool F2Pool saw several days of major outflows. This time, however, smaller miners were taking the lead.Outflows may not specifically indicate that miners are selling BTC, but show that mined coins are moving, possibly to venues where they will form part of a trade.According to on-chain analytics resource CryptoQuant, total outflows were down this week versus last, but still heightened compared with recent months.Looking at exchanges, traders appeared to be nervous regarding market strength. Unlike behavior during Bitcoin's vertical price growth at the turn of the year, net flows to exchanges were positive in recent days. Compiled by on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode, data tracking major exchanges showed that around $108 million more was deposited than withdrawn on Monday.Conversely, supplies of largest altcoin Ether (ETH) on trading platforms fell by $47 million, while Tether (USDT) increased by $65 million.Removal of coins from exchanges implies that holders have no intention to trade or sell them, instead placing them back in hot or cold storage wallets.There are more active Bitcoin addresses than ever, while BTC holdings kept moving in recent days.Bitcoin Days Destroyed, which measures the amount of each transaction on the Bitcoin network versus how long ago the coins involved last moved, hit three-month lows this week.Glassnode tracked a steep decline in the metric in January, coinciding with a trading frenzy on the back of Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs of $42,000.At the same time, wallet numbers themselves passed 1.24 million as of Jan. 8, the latest date for which data is available.A glance at the spot market on Tuesday highlighted multiple resistance levels on BTC/USD, with sellers lined up at $1,000 increments beginning at $35,000.So far, bulls have failed to tackle any of these, with support likewise in place at each $1,000 level until $27,000.Finally, after hovering at record levels in Q4 2020, a classic measure of investor sentiment came back down to October levels in recent days only to then rebound to 71. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which uses a basket of factors to determine whether investors themselves will cause Bitcoin to boom or bust, swapped ""extreme greed"" to comparatively normal ""greed."""
552,"The cryptocurrency community has been doubling down on its support to privacy-centric applications like Tor Browser in 2020, according to new data.The Tor Project, a non-profit organization behind the anonymous Tor Browser, saw a 23% increase in cryptocurrency donations in 2020. A spokesperson at the Tor Project told Cointelegraph that crypto-powered donations surged from $189,637 in 2019 to $233,019 in 2020.According to a Jan. 25 announcement by the project, crypto donations made up nearly 26% of total individual donations, which amounted to $913,110. According to a Tor Project representative, Bitcoin (BTC) was the most popular cryptocurrency for their donors in 2020, followed by Ether (ETH) and privacy-focused altcoins like Monero (XMR):The Tor Project has emerged as a major Bitcoin-friendly nonprofit, having started accepting BTC donations back in 2013. In March 2019, the Tor Project expanded the number of supported cryptocurrencies for donations, adding eight altcoins including Ether, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC) Dash (DASH), Stellar Lumens (XLM) and others.The project’s move to support more cryptocurrencies for donations was apparently widely appreciated in the crypto community as Bitcoin holders got an opportunity to keep their BTC and donate in other digital currencies instead. In September 2019, Matt Odell, a Bitcoin maximalist and co-host of the Tales from the Crypt podcast, urged the community to support the Tor Project with altcoins, not Bitcoin. “Donate shitcoins. stack sats,” Odell wrote in his XLM transaction to the Tor Project.Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were becoming increasingly popular as a tool for donations in 2020. Dave Portnoy’s Barstool Fund — an initiative to support small businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic — started accepting crypto donations through The Giving Block in late 2020."
553,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell to lows of $28,950 on Jan. 22 thanks to miners likely selling huge amounts of their holdings — but big buyers made sure that the dip was minimal.According to data from on-chain monitoring resource CryptoQuant, the past few days saw vast outflows from mining pools, which in turn corresponded to BTC/USD shedding 20% in a week.It's important to note that F2Pool is not a miner, but rather a service provider that Bitcoin miners use to coalesce their resources. Beginning on Jan. 15, outflows from these miners began to rise and by Jan. 17, daily outflows had reached 10,000 BTC ($313 million).  These continued for three days in a row before returning closer to normal levels.Initially, CryptoQuant and Cointelegraph reported that F2Pool was responsible for the vast majority of outflows, but after learning that there was a slight misrepresentation in its data CryptoQuant issued a revision. For f2pool, their participants involved with other big clusters, that's why their outflow looks huge. We're trying to solve this kind of over-clustering problem.Aside from the narrative of miner selling driving Bitcoin price down, theories including the controversy around Tether (USDT) and a recovering dollar were being touted as the root causes of the volatility. Meanwhile, Bitcoin exchange balances have stayed constant throughout January in contrast to the general downtrend that has been in place since summer 2019, data shows.Should the coins from mining collectives associated with F2Pool have formed a large glut of new BTC supply for sale on the market, it is likely that one buyer, in particular, would have hoovered them up fairly quickly.As Cointelegraph reported, asset management giant Grayscale has added conspicuous amounts to its assets under management this week, these potentially helping BTC/USD avoid a deeper dive.The company's recently published Q4 2020 report, in which it says that institutions provided 93% of its inflows, compounds the idea that it is the main buyer of any spare BTC supply. CEO Michael Sonnenshein believes that 2021 will see increased interest from financial advisors in the Bitcoin space, along with a drop in associated investment risk."
554,"A Jan. 25 report published by crypto data aggregator Glassnode has noted that Bitcoin’s adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio, or aSOPR, suggests that a further decrease in prices will leave many investors in the red according to when their holdings last moved on-chain.Despite the metric suggesting few investors are sitting on paper-profits, Glassnode interprets the data as bullish, stating:Glassnode describes the indicator as representing the profit-ratio of coins based on the price of Bitcoin when they were last moved on-chain. As aSOPR is an on-chain metric, BTC circulations on centralized exchanges are not counted.While SOPR should typically oscillate near 1, the extreme bullish momentum of recent months saw Bitcoin’s aSOPR spike above 1.15 for the end of December and the first half of January.However, during bullish market conditions, values of aSOPR below 1 are rejected as traders are reluctant to sell at a loss.Glassnode noted the aSOPR chart suggests that the current correction is coming to an end. From peak to trough of its recent, Bitcoin had corrected 31% when it fell just below $29,000 on Jan. 22. Bitcoin was trading hands for $31,750 at the time of writing.On Jan. 25, Glassnode also reported that 2.3 million BTC or 12.6% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply moved on-chain while BTC was trading above $30,000, flagging the activity as bullish:"
555,"Since Jan. 22 GameStop has been attracting a lot of attention from the mainstream news as the stock (GME) for the popular video game retailer rallied 860% from $17.40 on Jan. 4 to a high of $159.18 on Jan. 25. On Jan. 25 GME pulled back 51.70% from its high to close the day at $76.79 but what lies behind the massive upsurge warrants closer inspection.While solid fundamentals often lead to price breakouts in both stocks and cryptocurrencies, the recent interest in GameStop appears to have more to do with the ‘Reddit army’ phenomenon which has seen internet groups go head to head with some of the largest firms on Wall Street.The most well-known instance of this trend in the cryptocurrency sector occurred when a group of dedicated Chainlink (LINK) investors affectionately referred to by many as ‘LINK Marines’ joined forces to spread positive news about the altcoin and also pledged to keep buying it when larger investors devised a plan to short LINK.In early 2020 the LINK Marines responded to Zeus Capital’s attempt to short the altcoin. When the word got out that Zeus Capital had referred to Chainlink as ‘crypto’s wirecard’ and opened a short position, LINK marines went to work, refusing to sell and pushing the altcoin’s price to a new all-time high by triggering successive short squeezes.Fallout from the short call also shifted to Nexo Finance as members of the LINK marines discovered a clue allegedly connecting Zeus Capital with Nexo.Gemini exchange co-founder, Tyler Winklevoss, previously acknowledged the contribution that the LINK marines add to the cryptocurrency community with the following tweet:A similar situation occurred with GameStop on Jan.21 after Citron Research announced plans to open a short position as they believed GME price would fall back to $20. The reaction to this announcement was so swift that Citron Research was unable to finish its Twitter live stream due to an overwhelming amount of responses.This isn’t the first time a group of investors on a social platform have joined together to pump the price of an asset as a similar phenomenon occurred with Tesla and Netflix stock in 2020.Analysts had been calling for a drop in the price of Tesla (TSLA) stock since early 2019 and a number of institutional investors opened large short positions only to see its value increase by more than 1000% since that time and help Elon Musk briefly become the richest person in the world. Short sellers who piled in on the advice of the trusted wall street analysts have been crushed by the non-stop move higher.These moves higher have been powered in part by the Robinhood effect, a term coined to define irrational stock price movements caused by retail buyers on mobile investing apps like Robinhood. Millennial traders high on easy options trading made it possible to pump TSLA and NFLX, triggering a massive short squeeze again and again.Netflix (NFLX) has also been plagued with calls of an impending price drop for years as analysis showed that the company was burning through cash, losing subscribers to competitors yet still raises prices. Some of the top investment brokerages rated the stock as a ‘sell’ and chat forums were rife with discussions of why Netflix stock should be shorted.During the time that analysts were writing NFLX off, its price increased from $253 to an all-time high of $586 on Jan. 20.From Tesla to GameStop, it’s clear that there has been a shift in how investors interact with financial markets and the factors that catalyze price discovery have also changed as retail traders have easier access to market information and analysis.Threats against short-sellers are nothing new, but what is different in this situation is that it has become “internet vigilantes, and not corporate agents, who targeted the shorts,” as noted by Christopher Smith in a recent thread posted on TradingView.Smith said:The cryptocurrency sector appears to be on the precipice of becoming a mainstream investment and as mobile investing platforms gain more market share and the popularity of social investing grows, it’s possible that the same phenomenon seen with GameStop and Tesla will become commonplace with the low market cap, illiquid tokens that populate the crypto market.Millennials are also becoming increasingly interested in investing and as more of them engage with mobile investment platforms, these social investing phenomena could become more prevalent.A clear example that the two worlds are beginning to merge can be found on the Twitter feed of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, MicroStrategy CEO Micheal Saylor, and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Each frequently references Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin in their tweets and a number of times this has resulted in a temporary price pump of the discussed asset.As 2021 progresses, it will be interesting to see how mainstream financial markets adapt and change to the growing influence of decentralized groups of united retail investors.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

556,"Goldman Sachs senior chairman Lloyd Blankfein has stated that regulators should be “hyperventilating” in response to Bitcoin’s recent success, characterizing the crypto asset as undermining the capacity for lawmakers to monitor the financial system.While appearing on CNBC’s Squawk Box on Jan. 25, Blankfein asserted that Bitcoin’s pseudonymous nature makes it perfect for illicit financing, stating: “You don't know whether or not you’re paying the North Koreans, or Al-Qaeda, or the revolutionary guard.”Despite authorities frequently utilizing the transparency of blockchain to track the use of crypto by terrorist organizations, Blankfein questioned how regulators can allow crypto assets to flourish in their existing form.“If I were a regulator, I would be kind of hyperventilating at the success of [Bitcoin] at the moment, and I would be arming myself to deal with it,” he saidIn order to conform Bitcoin to the existing financial and regulatory apparatus, Blankfein asserts that many of the fundamental freedoms enabled by BTC must be reined in. However, he questioned whether strong demand would continue to exist for Bitcoin without its pseudonymous privacy features:Blankfein also criticized Bitcoin as a store of value, emphasizing its price volatility and the technological literacy required to self-custody BTC.“It’s a store of value that can move 10% in a day, that if you lose the code or if you lose the slip of paper — it's lost forever, or if somebody takes it from you — how will you know,” he said.In August, the U.S. Justice Department announced it has seized millions worth of crypto from more than 300 wallets associated with Al-Qaeda and ISIS.In the announcement, Don Fort, chief of IRS criminal investigation, or IRS-CI, emphasized that the agency had been able to trace the crypto to its source — allowing it to dismantle the groups’ financial networks."
557,"Sometimes, “stablecoins” and variants such as “algorithmic stablecoins” function like historical names, as they refer to projects that call themselves stablecoins, such as Basis Cash, Elastic Set Dollar, Frax and their clones.The word ""stablecoin"" can be used as a logical description for “a cryptocurrency designed to have low price volatility” and has “stores of value or units of account,” or “a new type of cryptocurrency that often have their value pegged to another asset… designed to tackle the inherent volatility seen in cryptocurrency prices,” or a currency that can “act as a medium of monetary exchange and a mode of storage of monetary value, and its value should remain relatively stable over longer time horizons.”On the more metaphysically speculative end, some have defined a stablecoin as “an asset that prices itself, rather than an asset that is priced by supply and demand. This goes against everything we know about how markets work.”Circularity is the core issue, as I see it. The alleged deficiency of Bitcoin (BTC) as money and a vague definition originally inspired a host of stablecoin projects. The design features of these projects have now been incorporated back into the stablecoin definition.Haseeb Qureshi — a software engineer, author and famous altruist — defines a stablecoin as simply a price peg. Yet, it is not obvious that anything with a peg should bear the name of stablecoin. Ampleforth has a “peg” and has been bucketed into the stablecoin category. The founding team routinely clarifies that it is no such thing.Another example of just what exactly is “stable” in a stablecoin — the peg or its value? Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) is perfectly pegged to Bitcoin — one wBTC will always be one BTC. Is that a stablecoin?According to the original motivations for creating stablecoins, BTC is not a stable means of exchange, even though Bitcoin is the canonical “store of value” asset.Having clarified the problem — that no one knows how to define or recognize a stablecoin — the rest of this essay outlines a solution. It provides a well-defined description of value as a relational property, namely, “value in terms of a measurement unit.”Using this description, I then comprehensively classify all digital assets along two dimensions — risk of loss, or the probability of realizing a decrease in value, and risk of gain, or the probability of realizing an increase in value. We can then precisely and logically define stablecoins: assets where the risk of loss and risk of gain are both zero.That is:p(gain)=p(loss)=0I call this a risk-defined stablecoin.It is clear that today’s algorithmic stablecoins have a risk of loss but no risk of gain. Thus, not only are they not stablecoins, but they are terrible financial assets. I finish by considering whether it makes sense to expand the concept of a risk-defined stablecoin to a more general concept centered on expected value; an expected-value stablecoin is one where the probabilities of loss and gain, weighted by the magnitude of loss and gain, are perfectly offset and net out to zero.I conclude that the complexity and ergodicity of such a concept rule it out as a useful stablecoin definition.What “value” means is not entirely clear, as evidenced by continuing debates about the “true” rate of inflation. We can ask: Value in terms of what?That is, we decide to treat value as a relational property between the object being measured and the thing doing the measuring. It is like asking for height — do you want it in inches or centimeters? For our purposes, can we define a function that maps an asset to a set of numerical values in a chosen unit? I call it: Value.For example, if the chosen unit is the U.S. dollar, and the item is a bag of chips,ValueUSD(chips)=$5.We could just as well have written Heightinches(table)=35in.The value of an asset changes over time, so we can expand our Value function to reflect the idea of “the value of an asset, in terms of a unit, at a certain time” by adding the time (\t) at which we are measuring value:ValuetUnit(asset)=xWe can define risks as the probability that, at a randomly chosen time in the future, the Value function would show a decrease or increase in value.In practical terms, this means that if I convert the asset into my chosen unit, I would realize a loss or a gain.We now have enough to create a well-defined description for a stablecoin. A stablecoin is an asset where the risk of loss and the risk of gain are both zero. That is: p(gain)=p(loss)=0.This means that if I sell the stablecoin asset in the future, I will neither experience a loss nor gain in value, as measured in my chosen unit.The Boston Consulting Group’s famous matrix was invented by the company’s founder, Bruce Henderson, in the 1970s. With some rearrangement, we can repurpose the Boston Consulting Group growth-share matrix to classify all digital assets by their risk of loss and risk of gain. The four categories are still stars, dogs, unknowns and cash cows.A star investment, with no risk of loss but a risk of gain, is rare nowadays but abundant in hindsight, such as when one regrets selling Bitcoin back in 2010. Stars also exist in the imagination. Such was the case with the investors in Bernie Madoff’s fund. But those kinds of investments quickly reveal themselves to be dogs. Dogs are sure losers — there is no risk of gain, but if you hold them long enough, the risk of loss becomes an actual loss.Star investments are most abundant in hindsight when we can no longer buy them:I'd be a *billionaire* now if I hadn't sold the 55,000 bitcoins I mined on my laptop in 2009-2010 way too early (mostly before 2012). That is regretful, but then again, with the early bitcoiners we set in motion something greater than personal gain.Unknowns are your regular investments — you could be up or down in terms of value, depending on the day. Most digital assets, even Bitcoin, fall into this category. Lastly, cash cows are investments that have minimal risk of loss or gain. They are dependable. We can now take those projects that have been named as stablecoins to see which truly fit.Let’s put some major digital assets and stablecoins into the gain-loss matrix.Projects called algorithmic stablecoins are stablecoins in name only. Because of their multiple token designs, they have no risk of gain — as all of the new supply is given to investors — but holders retain a risk of loss.Price peg is not enough. The expected value of owning an asset could be positive or negative, but it is not zero. Another lesson is that it is important to specify a unit when discussing value. If our measurement unit is the U.S. dollar, then wBTC is not a stablecoin. But if we are defining value in terms of BTC, then wBTC is the perfect stablecoin.Lastly, risk assessment is hard. I’ve received pushback about classifying Tether (USDT) as a stablecoin, given its counterparty risk.These are all valid points.Except under extraordinary circumstances, no stablecoin is truly free of the risk of loss. Perhaps Tether is a cross between a dog and a cow.Nonetheless, it should be clear that certain projects egregiously appropriate the term “stablecoin” in a bid to grant investors a risk of gain while saddling holders with a risk of loss. Since no sane person would hold these assets on their books, however, it is almost certain that these dogs will go extinct.Astute readers will have noticed that expected value is not just a function of the probability of loss and gain — the magnitude of losses and magnitude of gains is just as important.For example, assume I have a fair die. If I roll a six, I win $60. If I roll any other number I lose $6. The expected value of rolling the die is:EV(dice)=$60∗p(gain)−$6∗p(loss)=$60∗(1/6)−$6∗(5/6)=$5But can we expand the concept of a risk-defined stablecoin into that of an expected-value stablecoin? In other words, would it suffice for the expected value of holding an asset to be zero? Using the die example above, this condition would be met if I won only $30 instead of $60. So, any time I try to convert this “DieCoin” into U.S. dollars, there is a five-sixth chance I will realize a loss in value, and a one-sixth chance I will realize a gain. But because the gain is so much larger than the loss, these cancel out.I think this could be a clever approach that can be realized through a set of derivative contracts. However, it would lose the property of allowing holders to exit their position with minimal impact to their portfolios.This should remind us that, ultimately, definitions are artifacts of a community of speakers. And I find it doubtful that more than a few people will find an expected value definition persuasive.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

558,"After the recent correction, Bitcoin (BTC) will need aggressive inflows to absorb the possible selling from the short-term traders and momentum players as the price nears $40,000. In the past few months, Grayscale Investments has been one of the major entities responsible for the pickup in demand.However, JPMorgan Chase analysts pointed out in a recent note that Grayscale inflows “appear to have peaked” on a four-week rolling average basis. Without a strong tailwind from the institutional investors, many analysts believe Bitcoin may not break above $40,000.The failure to resume the uptrend does not mean Bitcoin will plunge and enter a bear market similar to the one seen in 2018. Lower levels continue to attract investments from institutions, and the latest to disclose a position in Bitcoin is Nevada-based crypto mining firm Marathon Patent Group. The company has purchased $150 million worth of Bitcoin at an average price of $31,168.Even if Bitcoin remains range-bound for the next few days, select altcoins could continue to move toward new highs.Let’s study the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to spot the ones that are in a bull trend.Bitcoin (BTC) broke above the 20-day exponential moving average ($33,851) today, indicating accumulation at lower levels. The current up-move could rise to the downtrend line where the bulls are likely to face stiff resistance from the bears.The flat 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) just above the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.If the price reverses direction from the downtrend line, the bears will again try to sink and sustain the BTC/USD pair below the $30,450 support. If they succeed, the pair will complete a descending triangle pattern, which has a target objective of $18,940.37.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls drive the price above the downtrend line, the aggressive bears who may have sold short in the past few days could cover their positions, resulting in a short squeeze. Above the downtrend line, the pair could rise to $40,000 and then to $41,959.63.Ether (ETH) surged above the $1,350 resistance on Jan. 24 and followed it up with another up-move today, hitting a new all-time high at $1,473.096. However, the long wick on today’s candlestick suggests profit-booking at higher levels.The RSI has also formed a negative divergence, which suggests the momentum may be weakening. If the bears sink the price below the $1,350 support, the ETH/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($1,195).A strong rebound off the 20-day EMA will indicate that the bulls are accumulating on dips. The buyers will then try to resume the uptrend. If they can push the price above $1,500, the pair could rise to $1,675.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below the uptrend line, the pair may drop to the next support at $840, signaling a trend change.Polkadot's DOT has formed a Doji candlestick pattern today with a long wick, which suggests the bears are attempting to stall the current up-move at $19.40. However, the rising moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggests the bulls are in control.If the bulls do not give up much ground from the current level, it will suggest the buyers are absorbing the supply, and that will increase the possibility of a breakout above $19.40. If that happens, the DOT/USD pair could resume the uptrend and rally to the next target objective at $24 and then to $30.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below $16.7951, the pair may drop to the 20-day EMA ($14.51). A strong rebound off this support will keep the uptrend intact, and the bulls will again attempt to resume the uptrend. On the other hand, if bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest a trend change.The daily trading range for XRP has shrunk over the past two days. The gradually downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory suggest a minor advantage to the bears.The Doji candlestick pattern on Jan. 24 and today signals indecision among the bulls and the bears. If the uncertainty resolves to the downside and the bears sink the price below $0.25, the XRP/USD pair will complete a bearish descending triangle pattern that could result in a drop to $0.169.On the contrary, if the pair rises from the current levels and breaks above the downtrend line, it could result in a rally to $0.385.Cardano's Ada continues to trade inside the ascending channel and the price has been sustaining above the $0.34 support for the past two days, which is a positive sign. This suggests the traders are not hurrying to book profits on relief rallies.The bulls will now try to push the price to $0.3971995. A breakout and close above the $0.40 resistance could start the next leg of the up-move that could reach $0.50. The ADA/USD pair could further pick up momentum if the bulls can thrust the price above the channel.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is above 60, which suggests the bulls have the upper hand. Contrary to this assumption, if the pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below $0.34, it will suggest traders are booking profits on rallies. A break below the support line of the channel may signal a trend change.Chainlink's LINK soared to a new all-time high on Jan. 23, but the bulls have not been able to build upon the momentum since then. The altcoin formed a hanging-man candlestick pattern on Jan. 24, which suggested the bulls may be tiring out.The negative divergence on the RSI also indicates that the bullish momentum may be weakening.The buyers attempted to resume the up-move today but the LINK/USD pair is facing profit-booking at higher levels. If the pair breaks below $23.1612, a drop to the critical support at $20.1111 is possible.On the other hand, if the pair turns up from the current level and rises above $26, it will suggest the bulls are back in command. The next target on the upside is $30.Litecoin (LTC) bounced off the 50-day simple moving average ($126) on Jan. 22 and broke above the 20-day EMA ($143) today, but the long wick on the candlestick suggests the bears are aggressively defending the downtrend line.If the price turns down from the downtrend line, the bears will again try to break the $120 support. If they succeed, the LTC/USD pair will complete a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern that may pull the price down to $100 and then to $70.Conversely, if the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, the pair may rise to $165.9709 and then retest the $185.5821 resistance. A breakout of this level could resume the uptrend.However, the flat 20-day EMA and the RSI just above the midpoint are not signaling a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. The indicators suggest the pair may consolidate for a few more days.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently attempting to rise and sustain above the 20-day EMA ($454). If successful, the altcoin could rise to $539. A breakout and close above this resistance could result in a retest of $631.71.Conversely, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the bears may again sink the price to the support of the range at $370. A breakdown and close below $353 could pull the price down to $275.The indicators are currently not indicating an advantage to either the bulls or the bears. The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint suggest the BCH/USD pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.Binance Coin (BNB) bounced off the support line of the ascending broadening wedge pattern on Jan. 22, and the bulls have pushed the price above the 20-day EMA ($41), which is a positive sign.If the bulls can push and sustain the price above $43.0992, the BNB/USD pair could retest the all-time high at $47.2187. A breakout of this resistance could resume the uptrend, with the next target objective at $50.The 20-day EMA is sloping up gradually and the RSI is just above the midpoint, suggesting a marginal advantage to the bulls.This positive view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the support line. If that happens, the bearish pattern will complete and could result in a fall to $35.69 and then $30.Stellar's Lumens (XLM) re-entered the $0.26 to $0.325 range on Jan. 22 and has been sustaining above the 20-day EMA ($0.265) since then. However, the bulls have failed to sustain the recovery and push the price toward the $0.325 resistance, which suggests a lack of demand at higher levels.If the XLM/USD pair fails to rise and sustain above $0.282 in the next few days, the bears may again try to sink the price below the $0.26 support. If they succeed, the pair may drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.211).Such a move will suggest the momentum has weakened. The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI just above the midpoint also indicate a balance between supply and demand.If the bulls push the price above $0.282, the pair may rise to $0.30 and then to $0.325. The bears may mount a stiff resistance at this level, and if the pair turns down from $0.325, it may continue the range-bound action for a few more days.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

559,"The past year has been a crazy journey for the blockchain industry. Between the crippling effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across various sectors and Bitcoin’s marathon bull run, the year has been great for some and catastrophic for many.Decentralized finance is at the epicenter of most of the hype surrounding blockchain today. From the rise of mainstream decentralized exchanges to the overwhelming demand for liquidity mining, DeFi hasn’t just raised a lot of dust — it’s brought billions of dollars onto blockchains.On June 15, DeFi platform Compound started distributing its COMP token to users, handing governance control of its protocol to the people. By Aug. 15, over $1 billion worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) had been sold, allowing even Bitcoin holders to access the world of Ethereum-based DeFi applications.Now, some DEXes even rival centralized exchanges, and the term “vampire mining” will always remind us of blockchain instead of pale bloodsucking creatures with pickaxes and safety helmets. But while DeFi lit the fireworks last year, it was Bitcoin (BTC) that made everyone stop and stare. Its unprecedented rise to nearly $40,000 makes it one of the most profitable and fastest-growing assets in history.But was DeFi at least partly responsible for this? Earlier stages of Bitcoin’s rise were negatively correlated with DeFi, with many even speculating that this resulted from funds being transferred from DeFi platforms to Bitcoin. The total value of digital assets locked into smart contracts has grown a hundredfold in the last two years. However, much of this growth has taken place in the previous few months and is more due to the appreciation of already invested assets than a surge in new investments.Just as many claim DeFi has had a substantial impact on BTC and blockchain technology, Bitcoin also affects DeFi. Blockchain may be the new, exciting financial technology of the coming decade, but it's Bitcoin that brings the brand value. That’s only part of the equation, but is it a truly substantial one?As the total trade volume on DEXes has significantly increased over the past year, some have attributed Bitcoin’s recent growth to the increase in the use of DeFi platforms. According to Robert Leshner, CEO of Compound, “Bitcoin's surge to $40,000 has coincided with a surge of WBTC activity.” The Compound protocol is also the top holder of WBTC, with over $1.2 billion in BTC being used as collateral to borrow stablecoins and other assets.One of the most commonly reported metrics in the DeFi space is its total value locked, or TVL. It represents the value of digital assets locked into DeFi smart contract platforms and has grown from a few hundred million a couple of years ago to reach over $26 billion today. This is primarily due to the recent surge in the value of large-market-capitalization investments like Bitcoin and Ether (ETH).According to Scott Stuart, co-founder and chief product officer of blockchain developer Kava Labs, the rise in Bitcoin’s value is an incredibly positive sign for the DeFi space: “DeFi requires a healthy amount of collateral to be used in products. The more valuable BTC is, the more collateral, and thereby the greater the usage in DeFi.”There has been a lot of hype and misinformation surrounding the TVL metric in blockchain circles. Still, while it isn’t the most accurate representation of what DeFi networks are currently worth, it does highlight how much people are willing to risk on them. Despite the fact that regulatory requirements like customer identification could threaten to collapse most mainstream DeFi applications sooner or later, they only seem to be growing.However, not everyone sees regulation as a threat. “It’s a losing battle for regulators,” said Stuart, adding: “Even if you can squash one product or one platform, it's likely to pop up elsewhere — it’s open-source software.”This is comparable to how peer-to-peer file transfers take place unregulated on the internet. Strict parents create sneaky children. However, the outcomes of a regulatory clampdown on Know Your Customer verification in DeFi could also see more compliant applications. While this is arguably limiting, decentralized finance can’t grow sustainably outside legal bounds. Bitcoin regulation is already complicated, and DeFi is bound to make things a whole lot more challenging. So, the correlation here seems to be more apparent.Last year, DeFi also pushed Ethereum to become the most used blockchain, driving its cumulative transaction fees higher than even Bitcoin’s. This is often a strong sign of a network’s ability to attract greater returns, and the upgraded Ethereum 2.0 promises even better performance and cheaper transactions. With the transition to Eth2 well underway, DeFi could be in for another considerable boost in use. However, despite its impressive growth over the last year, DeFi’s market capitalization is still barely 2% of the total crypto market cap.The amount of Bitcoin used within DeFi is approaching 0.9% of the total BTC supply, with nearly $300 million WBTC alone traded daily. This is probably a good thing because it means DeFi isn’t just discussed due to its profitability but more for its capacity to improve financial systems. The brief negative correlation between Bitcoin and DeFi in 2020 could have been due to traders moving funds from DeFi, but both have grown leaps and bounds since then. According to Jeremy Musighi, head of growth at Balancer Labs, a non-custodial portfolio manager, Bitcoin’s bull run brings a lot of global attention to cryptocurrency overall:Bitcoin and decentralized finance have a very symbiotic relationship where they fuel each other’s growth. More Bitcoin in DeFi brings more platforms that provide value, and with a seemingly endless stream of new DeFi projects springing up all the time, they generate hype and create innovative use cases for cryptocurrencies as a whole.“The biggest challenge facing new DeFi projects is code security & auditing,” said Leshner, adding further: “Auditors are stretched thin, and most developers are writing Solidity for the first time.” Blockchain is still incredibly young, and although millions of people worldwide own cryptocurrencies, it’s still only scratching the surface of mainstream adoption.While some consider the current yield farming frenzy unsustainable, others believe it could be the start of many new things to come. Stuart stated that DeFi lending and borrowing rates will probably normalize, and platforms will start to make efforts to attract long-tail users with better user interfaces and cheaper network fees.The trends that affect DeFi are also bound to affect Bitcoin, but the two appear to be growing independently. Besides its current inability to scale, there are many other issues Bitcoin needs to fix before it hits mainstream adoption. For one, as a safe-haven asset, the liquidity of Bitcoin may be affected, as pegged Bitcoin on DeFi platforms may take off over the coming years.When Bitcoin was created, its vision of a decentralized financial system wasn’t feasible without the decentralized infrastructure that is in place and constantly being developed. After over a decade, DeFi is finally making some headway in pushing us one step closer to that vision.Ultimately, Bitcoin is a digital asset that will never go out of fashion. The first-mover advantage is real here, and newcomers to the space are more likely to test the waters with BTC than an obscure DeFi token. As the global exposure to cryptocurrencies rises, so will the demand for services catering to decentralized assets. People may visit for Bitcoin, but they’ll stay for DeFi."
560,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating since its recent all-time high at $42,000 and has risen back above $34,000 at the time of writing. The current correction is currently at 30% already, as Bitcoin’s price has bounced from the $30,000 region several times.However, it remains to be seen whether Bitcoin’s price will start accelerating once again or whether BTC price needs more consolidation to build up strength.Several periods of accumulation were seen in 2020, where Bitcoin’s price ranged for a period of a few months. Such a period is, in fact, needed to build strength for continuation. The primary question is whether such a range-bound construction will now yield the same results. The three-hour chart shows a downtrend since the peak high at $42,000. This structure is formed using the lower highs and lower lows. In this example, the lower highs are marked in the grey boxes and are significant.Therefore, for any bullish reversal, Bitcoin’s price must break through the critical resistance zone at $34,000 to $34,500, as that’s the previous support. If that level doesn’t flip for support again, the market will classify that as a support/resistance flip, and more downside becomes likely.The price of Bitcoin has been testing the support area at $30,000 for a significant amount of time. The more often a level gets tested, the weaker it becomes. In addition to this are the weaker bounces from the $30,000 region, which have resulted in lower highs.If, therefore, $34,000 doesn’t flip into support, a renewed test of the $30,000 zone should indicate further weakness, putting $24,000 to $26,000 on the tables.The weekly chart for Bitcoin shows a clear confluence between the 21-week moving average (MA) and support as the 21-week MA served as a major support zone for the entire bull cycle in 2017.Another vital signal in this chart is the gap between the 21-week MA and the price of Bitcoin. Once that gap increases, Bitcoin’s price accelerates significantly and may be a sign of Bitcoin becoming overvalued in the short-term perspective.Frequently, the asset price — in this case, Bitcoin — comes back to the mean to test the 21-week MA for support before it continues its run. Currently, the 21-Week MA rests on the $20,000 price level. This is also the previous all-time high and the ultimate bottom for a correction as the market doesn’t want to see the price of Bitcoin drop below the all-time high of 2017.However, the price falling toward the all-time high of 2017 isn’t guaranteed, as most of the markets are eager to buy at that price. A correction toward $24,000 to $26,000 is still very healthy and would be in line with any bull market correction.The total market capitalization of cryptocurrency is consolidating above the previous all-time high of 2017.The previous all-time high of Bitcoin is unlikely to have another test for support, but the total market capitalization could quickly retest this level at $750 billion.Such a test of the support zone would be natural and could be expected as the market went nearly vertical in recent months. A consolidation period is more than healthy and organic for a market to build up strength for the rally to continue.Given the current downtrend in the markets, more downside is likely, which may result in a further rounded bottom.Moreover, February is often a corrective period for the cryptocurrency markets, which means that the summer could see the resumption of the bull market.If Bitcoin’s price can break through the $34,000 area, the next resistance zone at $37,500 is still the previous lower high. Once Bitcoin’s price makes another lower high, the likelihood of a further drop down to the 21-week MA rises.Such corrections could be painful for altcoins but may nevertheless provide massive opportunities for latecomers to join.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

561,"Sequoia Holdings — a software development services provider, not to be confused with the well-known venture capital firm Sequoia Capital — is offering its staff the option to set aside a portion of their salary and invest it in cryptocurrency.Sequoia Holdings is based in Reston, Virginia and provides engineering and analytic solutions to the United States national security sector, including the intelligence, defense and homeland security departments. It is also, notably, an employee-owned firm, which suggests the optional integration of cryptocurrency into salary arrangements could be a good barometer of popular staff sentiment.The company's employees will be able to choose to defer a portion of their salary and have it invested in either Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) or Ether (ETH). While Sequoia Holdings draws an analogy with widespread 401(k) retirement savings plans for other U.S. employees, the difference here is that the deferral will, in this case, be calculated after tax deductions.Sequoia Holdings does not indicate what portion of employees' salary can be deferred if chosen, nor does it name the third-party payroll processing firm that will be responsible for withholding the taxes and converting the remainder into the chosen cryptocurrency. All crypto savings will be held in a digital wallet that will be managed by this same third-party payroll processor.In a statement for the company, Sequoia Holdings's co-founder and CEO, T. Richard Stroup Jr., said:Cointelegraph readers will remember the high-profile story from December 2020 when several news outlets claimed that National Football League player Russell Okung was choosing to receive half of his salary in Bitcoin. After a clarification, a spokesperson for his employer, the Carolina Panthers, confirmed that the player's salary was not being paid directly in the cryptocurrency, even though Okung himself has hinted that he may indeed be choosing to invest a significant portion of his earnings in crypto himself."
562,"Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week with $30,000 reconfirmed as support but also a fresh vote of no confidence from the mainstream.After a more or less steady weekend, the largest cryptocurrency remains firmly in its established trading corridor: between $30,000 and $40,000. What’s next?Cointelegraph takes a look at the factors impacting price performance this week.Stocks showed clear upward momentum on Monday, led by Hong Kong as a new favorite target for Chinese investors.Sentiment received a major boost earlier this month after United States President Joe Biden announced a $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. While already near all-time highs, the cash injection propelled markets still higher.“Investors see continued open-spigot monetary policy and more fiscal stimulus,” Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, told Bloomberg.That “open-spigot” money -rinting position is nonetheless cause for concern among both Bitcoin proponents and more critical traditional market players. Last week, Jeremy Grantham, CEO of asset management giant GMO, flatly warned that stocks were in a bubble and that stimulus would only make it worse.The good times, he warned, could last as little as “a few weeks.”“We will have a few weeks of extra money and a few weeks of putting your last, desperate chips into the game, and then an even more spectacular bust,” he predicted in a Bloomberg interview.The impact of such a crash on Bitcoin remains open-ended. Despite its increasing reputation as a noncorrelated safe haven, BTC/USD continues to be influenced by macro factors, in particular the strength of the U.S. dollar. A scenario similar to March 2020’s cross-asset crash also looms large in traders’ memories.Grantham, meanwhile, was no more upbeat about a post-coronavirus world than the current one.“You will not make a handsome 10- or 20-year return from U.S. growth stocks,” he said.Equities surging ahead, meanwhile, spelled short-term bearishness for the U.S. dollar on Monday.The U.S. dollar currency index (DXY), which pits the dollar against a basket of major trading partner currencies, came down from recent gains to test support at 90 once again.In a reversal of last week’s scenario, the dollar is now on the back foot as Bitcoin displays familiar inverse correlation to the DXY and strengthens above $33,000.Incoming U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will not be drawn on her plans for the currency, claiming that she wants neither an overly strong dollar nor one which has been as weak as during the Donald Trump administration’s tenure.“I think this move higher that we’ve seen this week, I think it’s got some legs to it,” Dave Floyd, founder of Aspen Trading, told TD Ameritrade in a bullish short-term prognosis for the DXY.Zooming out, however, analysts believe that the dollar is headed for sustained losses as a result of increasing debt and the economic damage wreaked by the pandemic.Also at risk of suppression is Bitcoin, traditional finance analysts claimed in a familiar bearish take on the largest cryptocurrency.In a note to investors on Friday, a team at JPMorgan Chase led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou warned that declining demand for industry giant Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust, or GBTC, means that upside is unlikely to return to the market.“At the moment, the institutional flow impulse behind the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is not strong enough for Bitcoin to break out above $40,000,” it reads, as quoted by Bloomberg.Panigirtzoglou and the others pointed to a decline in the GBTC premium — the price of the trust over the Bitcoin spot price — as proof that uptake is slowing after a record few months. Grayscale itself, meanwhile, is busy buying more BTC than ever for its assets under management — Jan. 15 saw its biggest-ever single-day buy-in worth more than $600 million.JPMorgan, however, is not alone. As Cointelegraph reported, analysts at QCP Capital likewise highlighted “institutional exhaustion” as a key market force at work for Bitcoin under current conditions.“The near-term balance of risks is still skewed to the downside,” Panigirtzoglou’s note adds.After recovering from a brief dip below $30,000 last week, BTC/USD is decidedly nonvolatile heading into the new week’s trading.The calmer conditions give some welcome respite to traders, who watched as a combination of rumors and selling sparked dramatic price movements prior to the weekend.“What’s your favourite narrative as to why bitcoin is correcting after going vertical? The answer is in the question,” popular trader filbfilb summarized to Twitter followers on Friday.With a return to relative stability over the weekend, however, eyes are now focusing on a potential move higher within the trading corridor between $30,000 and $40,000 in which Bitcoin has resided this month after hitting new all-time highs of $42,000.“Bitcoin saw a very strong reaction at $31k. Bearish scenario invalidated for now. Prob $36k coming, then reassess,” in-house analyst Joseph Young offered on Monday.Young previously noted that on-chain indicators were slowly shifting to bearish, fuelling already dubious price action without clear direction.Such a move higher would take BTC/USD to familiar levels, but still without breaking the paradigm that has characterized the pair in recent weeks.In favor of bulls is a Jan. 29 expiry of $4 billion in Bitcoin options. Bitcoin cooling and ranging after its vertical phase, meanwhile, provides what some consider to be the perfect conditions for an altcoin rally.Signs that alts were waking up were already present earlier in January, but last week’s volatility in Bitcoin shook out some early gains.In a return to form this week, however, largest altcoin Ether (ETH) outperformed with a return to all-time highs of $1,475 and daily gains of 7.8%. A breakout versus BTC was also visible.The move clearly beats other large-cap altcoins, which were flat on Monday.“At this point and for a while, ETH leads, Alts season follows and bitcoin still explodes higher. Everyone wins,” Raoul Pal, founder of Real Vision, predicted.Ever the optimist, Pal appealed to Twitter followers not to listen to disparaging narratives about the crypto markets.“Enjoy and take on board the FUD with a open mind but remember, in an exponential bull market everyone wants to spook you out of your trade. It’s really not easy,” he added."
563,"Aave (AAVE) price has been on an absolute tear for weeks and today the DeFi-token rallied to a new all-time high at $288.90. The decentralized finance protocol is one of the most popular in the market and the recent rally in the DeFi sector is one of the driving forces behind AAVE’s rally.At the start of 2021, AAVE price was trading at $83 and the recent rally appears to have bolstered the protocol’s surging total value locked, increasing buy volume on spot and derivatives exchanges and the continued development of Aave’s lending platform and flash loan issuance.Data from DeFi Pulse shows that Aave’s TVL rose from $2.03 billion on Jan. 1 and as (BTC) and Ether (ETH) price went parabolic Aave’s TVL also surged.Currently, Aave’s TVL sits at a new all-time high of $3.75 billion, making the platform the second-largest DeFi platform by TVL behind Maker (MKR).The steady addition of new tokens to the lending and borrowing protocol increases the likelihood that its TVL will continue to rise and help AAVE retain its standing as one of the top DeFi projects in the cryptocurrency space.AAVE’s trading volume also surged at the beginning of 2021, increasing from $200 million on Jan. 3 to a high of $928 million on Jan. 16.As AAVE price reached a new high, it’s 24-hour trading volume notched a record $1.06 billion. This volume surge is partially driven by investors acquiring more tokens for staking, with 26.8% of the total supply of AAVE currently staked on the platform earning an APY of 6.1%Another reason for AAVE’s recent surge is the growth of its flash loans.Flash loans allow cryptocurrency holders to collatoralize their portfolio to fund other purchases or new crypto purchases. The loans also help investors utilize the value in their tokens without the need to sell see them and create a taxable event.Since launching flash loans less than 12 months ago, more than $1.7 billion have been issued and it’s expected that this figure will increse as the crypto bull market progresses.As can be seen in the chart above, the most dominant token requested for flash loans is the DAI stablecoin, followed by USDC and ETH. Data from Messari shows that Aave issued $25 million in loans in the first half of 2020, $500 million in Q3, and nearly $1 billion in Q4, including $450 million in December.The expansion of the flash loan concept will likely attract more users to Aave, especially since they can be used for arbitrage opportunities between DEXs, collateral swaps, self-liquidations and a variety of other applications within the DeFi sector."
564,"Over the past two weeks, Bitcoin price appears to have lost momentum and some analysts are suggesting that bears will be in control for the foreseeable future.Taking a look at derivatives market data provides a clearer picture of what is happening on the institutional side and how the moves of larger players may impact the spot markets.After peaking at $10.6 billion on Jan. 14, the open interest on Bitcoin (BTC) scaled back to $8.4 billion. The Jan. 29 monthly expiry continues to stand apart, totaling 47% of the options in play.Although a $4 billion expiry could be significant, one must consider that these options are split among calls (neutral-to-bullish) and the more bearish put options. Furthermore, having an opportunity to buy BTC for $52,000 on Jan. 29 might have made sense a couple of weeks ago, but not so much right now.As the data above depicts, Deribit exchange remains the absolute leader with an 83% market share. Nevertheless, to understand how eventful this expiry could be, one must adjust data and compare both calls and put options near the current $32,000 BTC level.Most exchanges offer monthly expiries and some also hold weekly options for short-term contracts. Dec. 25, 2020, had the largest expiry on record as $2.4 billion worth of option contracts expired. This figure represented 31% of all open interest and showed how options are usually spread throughout the year.Data from Bybt.com shows that Jan. 29 expiry calendar accounts for 107,000 BTC. This expiry date represents 45% of the aggregate options market open interest.It is worth noting that not every option will trade at expiry as some of those strikes now sound unreasonable, especially considering there are less than five days left.As Bitcoin marked its new $42,000 all-time high, some ultra bullish call options were traded but as BTC price adjusted, those short-term options became worthless.Currently, over 68% of Jan. 29 call options at $40,000 and above should be disregarded for calculation. The same can be said for the bearish put options at $25,000 and below. These represent 76% of the open interest.This data leaves an estimated $745 million worth of call options below $40,000 for the aggregate options expiry on Jan. 29. Meanwhile, the more bearish put options above $25,000 amount to $300 million. Therefore, the adjusted Jan. 29 open interest stands at $1.05 billion while holding a 0.40 put-to-call ratio.Analyzing open interest provides data from trades that have already passed, whereas the skew indicator monitors options in real-time. This gauge is even more relevant as BTC was trading below $23,500 just thirty days ago. Therefore, the open interest near that level does not indicate bearishness.When analyzing options, the 30% to 20% delta skew is the single most relevant gauge. This indicator compares call (buy) and put (sell) options side-by-side.A 10% delta skew indicates that call options are trading at a slight premium to the more bearish/neutral put options. On the other hand, a negative skew translates to a higher cost of downside protection and is a signal that traders are bearish.According to the data shown above, the last time some bearish sentiment emerged was Jan. 10, when the Bitcoin price crashed by 15%. This move was followed by an extreme 30% to 20% delta skew as optimism reached 49, a level unseen over the previous past 12 months.Whenever this indicator passes 20, it reflects fear of potential price upside from market makers and professionals, and is considered bullish. On the other hand, the current 0 to 10 range that held since Jan. 20 is deemed neutral.While a $4 billion options expiry might be worrisome, nearly 74% of the options are already deemed worthless. Regarding the Jan. 29 expiry, bulls remain mainly in control due to its much larger adjusted open interest.Despite bulls having an overall advantage, the more bearish put options dominate expiries between $33,000 and $35,000. Nevertheless, this 1,200 BTC contract advantage is more than offset by the 1,950 BTC contract imbalance favoring the call options from $28,000 to $32,000.To conclude, as things currently stand, bulls seem in total control of Friday’s expiry, although incentives between $28,000 to $35,000 are reasonably balanced. Overall there’s not much to gain from either side to create additional volatility ahead of Jan. 29.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

565,"During the second half of 2020, we saw a growing interest in cryptocurrencies from institutional investors and big capital. However, all the attention of the whales, as well as all the attention of the public, was fixed on Bitcoin (BTC). Today, we will look at why Ether (ETH) is a more attractive asset and why this cryptocurrency should become the “first cryptocurrency” for every investor.Let's start with the numbers: ETH’s growth since its March 2020 low after the coronavirus-induced market crash has been 1,200%, whereas BTC has only grown around 700%. ETH’s growth since its March 2020 low after the coronavirus-induced market crash has been 1,200%, whereas BTC has only grown around 700%. Of course, against the backdrop of record highs for Bitcoin, whose price reached $ 40,000, the rise of Ether to $1,400 does not seem so impressive. Moreover, the market capitalization of ETH is five times less than the volume of the BTC market. But what is more important for an investor: nice numbers and records of an asset from a portfolio or high income?There are very strong reasons to believe that Ether will continue to rise in price in 2021 and bring more profit to investors than the “most famous cryptocurrency,” Bitcoin.Related: ETH price sets new all-time high, gains financial momentum to go furtherEthereum is the number-one platform for building blockchain projects and launching decentralized applications. The chart below displays the number of unique ERC-20 tokens traded during the first years since the launch of the Ethereum network. And despite the fact that the rate of expansion of the market for blockchain startups has slowed down since the initial coin offering bubble burst in 2018, their total number is still growing.And even despite the fact that Ethereum has serious competitors — such as Tron, Polkadot, Cardano, Cosmos and Tezos — Vitalik Buterin's cryptocurrency platform continues to be a leader in this direction.During 2020, more than $1 trillion worth of transactions were recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. These figures exceed the transaction volume of payments giants like PayPal, which is used by over 350 million users and has with average volumes that do not generally exceed $200 billion per quarter.Also, keep in mind that each transaction generates network fees paid in ETH. And since the network's growth rates are still high, we can confidently expect the continuation of the “bullish” trend of ETH. In any case, interest in cryptocurrency is increasing, as is the number of active wallets, the number of transactions on the network and the average transaction size.Despite Bitcoin's leadership in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum remains the leader of the young decentralized finance industry. Highly popular in the summer of 2020, DeFi lending and staking projects continue to grow, attracting new investments.Related: Was 2020 a ‘DeFi year,’ and what is expected from the sector in 2021? Experts answerThe total value locked in decentralized finance since the beginning of 2020 has grown nearly 3,300%, from $687 million to $23.2 billion. And it is Ethereum that is the main platform for the creation and launch of most new DeFi projects and stablecoins.The emission of stablecoins is constantly growing, as digital assets backed by the value of less-volatile fiat currencies are a very convenient tool for quick settlements between users, for forming trading pairs on crypto exchanges and for saving capital from high volatility in your crypto wallet.Separately, we should talk about the interest of institutional investors in decentralized finance. While the chaos in the DeFi market nearly eroded institutional confidence in the potential of blockchain in the financial sector in the summer of 2020, public companies continue to show interest in the new asset type.In August 2020, Archax and Algorand revealed plans to develop tools for introducing DeFi among institutions. And in the fall of 2020, it became known that xSigma, a subsidiary of the Nasdaq-traded ZK International, is working on the development of DeFi services and is preparing to launch a decentralized exchange for trading stablecoins.We all remember what big investors' attention to Bitcoin led to last year, right? Now, it looks like other areas of the cryptocurrency industry are in for the same, and some of them are directly related to Ethereum. And the main advantage of Ethereum lies in the versatility of its technology and its growing community.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

566,"As Bitcoin price trade sideways, traders are keeping an eye out for new purchases from institutional investors in order to gauge whether BTC's correction is over.MicroStrategy’s recent purchase of 314 Bitcoin at an average price of $31,808 is a mild sentiment booster but it may not be enough to arrest the decline if buyers do not step in and sustain their purchases at higher levels.A recent timezone analysis by QCP Capital divided the Asia and U.S. trading sessions into a 12-hour bracket and found that since March 2020 Bitcoin price had risen during U.S. hours due to sustained buying from institutional investors. However, this buying momentum from the U.S. has shown signs of exhaustion for the first time since Bitcoin topped out about two weeks ago.While keeping an eye on institutional investor inflow is a good strategy, it's also important to monitor what is happening on the retail side.  In the past few months, retail investor volume has picked up and this is supporting equity markets across the globe.Bitcoin may be struggling to reclaim its all-time high but during this time a handful of altcoins have rallied to new highs. This shows that retail traders are currently focusing on altcoins.Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that could trend in the next few days.Bitcoin’s bounce off the 50-day simple moving average ($28,632) is facing resistance near the 20-day exponential moving average ($33,775). The failure to rise above the 20-day EMA is a negative sign as it shows a possible change in sentiment from buying on dips to selling in each rally.The 20-day EMA has started to slope down and the relative strength index (RSI) has been trading below the 50 level, suggesting that the bears are trying to make a comeback. The inside day candlestick pattern on Jan. 23 and today shows indecision among the bulls and the bears.If the uncertainty resolves to the downside, the bears will try to establish their supremacy and sink the BTC/USD pair below the 50-day SMA. If they succeed, it could result in a deeper correction to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $25,897.42 and then to the 61.8% retracement level at $22,106.73.On the contrary, if the bulls thrust the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may rise to the downtrend line, where they are again likely to face stiff resistance. If the price turns down from this level and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the bears are selling on rallies, but if the bulls push the price above the downtrend line, it will indicate the correction may be over.A close above the downtrend line will increase the possibility of a retest of the all-time high at $41,959.63. A break above this resistance could result in a rally to $50,000.The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative zone on the 4-hour chart shows the bears have the upper hand. The price action shows a bearish descending triangle formation that will complete on a breakdown and close below $30,450. The pattern target of this setup is $18,940.37.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can propel the price above the moving averages, the pair could rise to the downtrend line. This is a critical resistance to watch out for because a break above it will invalidate the bearish setup. If that happens, it could catch the aggressive bears on the wrong side, resulting in a short squeeze that could drive the price to a new all-time high.Ether (ETH) has climbed above the $1,300 overhead resistance, and the bulls are attempting to resume the up-move. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 61 suggest the bulls are in control.If the price sustains above $1,300, the ETH/USD pair could retest the all-time high at $1,438.318. A breakout and close above this resistance may start the journey to the target objective at $1,675.On the other hand, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the pair may drop to the 20-day EMA ($1,166). A rebound off this support will increase the possibility of the resumption of the uptrend.However, if the next drop breaks below the uptrend line, it will indicate a possible change in trend. The next support on the downside is at the 50-day SMA ($882).The bears are currently attempting to defend the $1,350 overhead resistance. If the price turns down from the current level, it could find support at the moving averages. A bounce off this level will suggest bulls are buying on every minor dip, and this will enhance the prospects of a breakout of $1,350.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the moving averages, the pair could drop to the uptrend line. A break below this support will signal a change in sentiment and may result in a deeper correction.Polkadot (DOT) is currently range-bound between the high at $19.40 and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $14.7259. A consolidation near the all-time high is a positive sign as it shows traders are not rushing to book profits.The bears are currently defending the overhead resistance at $19.40. This could extend the stay of the DOT/USD pair inside the range for a few more daysHowever, the upsloping 20-day EMA ($14.11) and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest the bulls have the upper hand. If buyers can drive the price above $19.40, the next leg of the up-move could begin. The first target on the upside is $24 and then $30.This positive view will invalidate if the pair turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could open the possibility of a deeper fall to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $11.8383.The pair has turned down from the overhead resistance, which suggests the bears are unwilling to give up without a fight. The flattening 20-EMA and the RSI near the midpoint on the 4-hour chart shows a balance between supply and demand.If the bears sink the pair below the 50-SMA, a drop to $16 and then to $14.7259 is possible. The bulls are likely to buy this dip and try to keep the price inside the range. The next trending move could start after the price breaks above $19.40 or sinks below $14.7259.AAVE is in a strong uptrend and has been hitting new highs for the past few days, which shows traders continue to buy at every higher level. In an uptrend, the bulls buy the dips to the 20-day EMA and that was seen during the recent fall on Jan. 21.The current leg of the uptrend has a target objective at $263.23 and then $294.229. The wick on today’s candlestick suggests bears are attempting to stall the rally near the psychological resistance at $250.If the price turns down from the current level, the first support is at $200 and then at the 20-day EMA at $166. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone indicate bulls are in command.The first sign of weakness will be a breakdown and close below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that supply has exceeded demand from dip buyers and that could be a sign of a trend change.The 4-hour chart shows the price is trading inside an ascending channel. If the price dips from the current levels, it could drop to the support line of the ascending channel where buyers are likely to step in.A break below the channel could sink the price to the 20-EMA. A strong rebound off this support will suggest that bulls continue to accumulate on dips. However, a break below the moving averages will open the doors for a deeper correction.Synthetix (SNX) witnessed a sharp correction on Jan. 21 but it quickly recovered and is currently attempting to resume the uptrend. Aggressive buying near the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $10.744 on Jan. 22 shows demand at lower levels.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI has bounced from the midpoint, indicating the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the bulls can propel the price above $17.150, the next leg of the uptrend could begin.The next target on the upside is $20 and then $24.083. However, if the price turns down from $17.150, the SNX/USD pair may dip to the 20-day EMA ($13.68), which is likely to act as strong support.The 4-hour chart shows the bears are attempting to defend the $17 overhead resistance. If the price turns down from the current level, the pair could drop to the moving averages and then to $14. A consolidation between $14 and $17 will be a positive sign and increase the possibility of a break above $17.15.Contrary to this assumption, if the price breaks below $14, the correction could deepen to $11.263. Such a move will suggest the bullish momentum has weakened. A break below $11.262 may pull the price down to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $9.232 and then $7.880.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

567,"Anthony Scaramucci, the head of SkyBridge Capital and former White House communications director, believes Bitcoin’s (BTC) value proposition has strengthened significantly now that governments have addressed many of the risks associated with the digital asset. In an opinion article published on CNN, Scaramucci and fellow SkyBridge executive Brett Messing argue that Bitcoin has become a viable option for long-term investors seeking refuge from inflation. The authors also claim that holding Bitcoin is far less risky today than it was a few years ago when regulations and infrastructure were still underdeveloped. Bitcoin’s growth has “caused government and institutions to step in and address many of the risks associated with the digital currency,” the authors wrote, referring to the decision by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency to authorize banks to provide cryptocurrency services.They continued:SkyBridge Capital made a big splash last month when it filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a Bitcoin hedge fund. The SkyBridge Bitcoin Fund LP launched a few weeks later, with Fidelity serving as custodian and Ernst & Young handling the auditing.SkyBridge reportedly invested in Bitcoin during November and December, allowing it to accumulate a large position in the digital asset prior to its parabolic spike. At the time the fund was launched, on Jan. 4, SkyBridge claimed its BTC exposure was worth approximately $310 million.Institutional capital was a major catalyst behind Bitcoin’s 300% rally in 2020, culminating in a new all-time high near $42,000 on Jan. 8. So-called smart money investors are beginning to view Bitcoin as a form of digital gold – one with potentially much higher upside than precious metals."
568,"In a first for professional soccer, Spanish team DUX Internacional de Madrid has used crypto to buy a new player. Ex-Real Madrid player David Barral is a new acquisition for the club facilitated by the cryptocurrency trading company Criptan.Although technically this is not the first recorded Bitcoin (BTC) transfer, amateur Turkish club Harunustaspor bought 22-year-old player Omer Faruk Kiroglu back in 2018 for 0.0524 Bitcoin and 2,500 Turkish Lira. This move was performed to gain attention for the club in international media for doing “something new” but not necessarily sparking blockchain adoption in soccer.DUX’s acquisition is indicative of the adoption of blockchain technology and crypto tokens within the soccer community and its fans. This development came soon after European soccer giant AC Milan joined the blockchain bandwagon by announcing on Jan. 18 the impending launch of their native fan token, ACM, on the Chiliz blockchain, a fan engagement platform.The CHZ blockchain includes 20 other sporting organizations and has reportedly been installed 450,000 times, with token sales exceeding 14 million in number, with the fan token of reigning Italian Serie A champions Juventus ($JUV) being one of the first to be listed on the platform. Alejandro Laplana, CEO and Founder of Shokworks — a company that develops digital platforms for various brands and sports teams — discussed AC Milan’s move with Cointelegraph:AC Milan’s entry into the blockchain domain is an interesting case when compared to other soccer clubs that have joined previously, as it is a club with a huge fanbase. The club’s achievements have been scarce over the last decade, and this move is bound to streamline fan engagement and enable it to acquire new fans, especially given its current push to win the Serie A league title.In addition to AC Milan, other soccer clubs, such as Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain, Arsenal and Manchester City are becoming participants in the blockchain and crypto community. In fact, Spanish giant FC Barcelona generated $1.3 million in less than two hours after launching its token, BAR, selling 600,000 Barcelona crypto-based tokens for $2.20 each back in February 2020. The initial sale was oversubscribed by more than five times, and the price of the BAR rose by 200% in the first five minutes of trading on Chiliz. It currently holds a market capitalization of over $20 million.Laplana further stated how FC Barcelona’s token is unique when compared to the token offerings from other soccer clubs: “It helped inform — via fan interaction — the design of the mural for the first team locker room. [...] The token is designed to reward holders of the tokens (fans) for increased engagement with more tokens.”The coronavirus global pandemic brought sporting events to a standstill, canceling most of them and postponing the 2020 UEFA Football Championship and the Tokyo Olympics 2020 being postponed to 2021 for the first time in history. The soccer industry was hit with empty stadiums due to COVID-19 restrictions and with the general lack of engagement and monetization from the global fan base. Since fans are not in the stadiums, tokens provide them with voting rights in club-specific polls or give them access to VIP experiences or can be redeemed against exclusive club merchandise.Another way to engage fans is through trading cards and fantasy soccer games based on a blockchain. For example, Sorare is a blockchain-based fantasy soccer game that leverages classic soccer trading cards and fantasy league games. It runs on the Ethereum blockchain and uses nonfungible tokens. An NFT is a special crypto token that represents something unique, and thus, it is not mutually interchangeable. FC Barcelona star center-back Gerard Pique is a seed investor for Sorare.Amid the ongoing global pandemic, fan engagement is the most important aspect that the introduction of blockchain within soccer can bring about. However, there are several other use cases that can become vital.Laplana explained that soccer clubs can use the technology to build up liquidity for specific programs such as stadium renovations, adding: “Another use case is clear and transparent elections in a sport that has unfortunately been tarnished by decades of rampant corruption and disputed election results at every level of the sport.”The ongoing global pandemic has been devastating for sporting organizations, including soccer, as stadiums are currently going empty, affecting the revenue and fanbases of teams. Various major international clubs are now resorting to crypto and blockchain to find ways to bridge this gap.These use cases could be employed for clubs that have a considerable fanbase and are currently facing challenges on and off the field. Stefan Ateljevic, founder of BitcoinPlay — a Bitcoin gamification platform — told Cointelegraph how cryptocurrencies could begin to play a larger role in the economics of the soccer world:With the advent of smart contracts, clubs could also use blockchains to code a player’s transfer record, thus enabling soccer organizations to trace a player’s history from the youth academies all the way to global sporting leagues. The same can be done with the player’s medical data history to enable club management to make informed decisions with ease about their picks from the talent pool. This can be done by using tools like PowerAgent, which is a smart contract ecosystem that enables sporting professionals to create and manage smart contracts by connecting all the involved parties of the athlete’s contract negotiation and agreement procedure.Related: Celebs and crypto in 2020: Blockchain cities, Bitcoin newbies and Twitter trollingFans could also benefit from having an easier ticketing exchange mechanism, as the technology makes exchanges safer and more reliable, eliminating tickets being sold on the black market. Another impending use case could be the monetization of proprietary content on Over-The-Top media platforms and current popular general content providers — such as Netflix, Disney Hotstar, YouTube, Amazon, etc. — via smart contracts becoming critical to the growth of teams, clubs, leagues and players.Blockchain technology and crypto can be utilized in various sports across the globe, offering opportunities to engage fans, stakeholders and players alike. Roham Gharegozlou, CEO of Dapper Labs — a blockchain-based gaming company — told Cointelegraph that blockchain technology has been used with other sports in the United States:Even though Dapper Labs is involved with the National Basketball Association of the United States, popular sports in the U.S. such as basketball, football and baseball have a smaller presence in the crypto sports community compared to soccer.Ateljevic further opined that the regulatory situation in the U.S. makes it more difficult for clubs to adopt the technology: “Crypto regulations are different in each country or zone, such as is the case in the EU. In other words, I think it would be a bit more complicated for the NBA or NFL to start using crypto in their customer engagement strategy.” Laplana stated ways in which this regulatory environment can change:"
569,"In the 2013–2017 period, 29 hacks occurred in the Bitcoin market where a total of 1.1 million Bitcoin were stolen. Noting that the average price for Bitcoin (BTC) in December 2020 exceeded $20,000, the corresponding monetary equivalent of losses is more than $22 billion, which strongly highlights the societal impact of this criminal activity. What did crypto exchanges do to address this problem? Nowadays, about 90% of exchanges use some kind of cold storage system, which means that digital assets are stored offline. Keeping Bitcoin offline considerably reduces the threat from hacking attacks.Related: Roundup of crypto hacks, exploits and heists in 2020Nevertheless, Jean Baptiste Su, principal analyst and technology futurist at Atherton Technology Research, highlights that in 2019, hackers stole over $4 billion, which was more than twice as much as in 2018. In fact, cyberattacks are a very serious issue that cast doubts on the security of modern blockchain-based applications in the financial industry. Of course, one can argue that thefts also occur when using traditional payment methods, such as credit cards. For instance, the Annual Fraud Statistics released by The Nilson Report documents that credit card fraud losses worldwide reached $27.85 billion in 2018.Related: Crypto exchange hacks in reviewI think it is important to point out that fraud in the market for credit cards as opposed to fraud in the cryptocurrency market are difficult to compare for at least four reasons:To explore the question of how Bitcoin hacking incidents affect uncertainty in the overall Bitcoin market, I conducted an empirical study where I analyzed how the volatility — which is in financial economics a measure of an asset’s uncertainty — responds to hacking incidents. To do so, I used a so-called Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity model where I included binary dummy variables in the variance equation. The dummy variables measured the impact on the volatility up to five days after a hacking incident in the Bitcoin market.In my study, I found that Bitcoin’s uncertainty in terms of volatility significantly increases. Surprisingly, I found two effects — a contemporaneous effect and a delayed effect. The volatility increases on the day of the hacking incident and then drops down to normal levels again. There is no effect between day one and day four. Then, on the fifth day after the hacking, the volatility substantially increases again. Since there are no other events that took place, the effect is most likely caused by the same hacking incident.A possible explanation for the delayed effect could be that hacking incidents are more likely to occur at small exchanges that probably exhibit a lower level of security standards compared to larger exchanges. As a consequence, information diffusion occurs more slowly.Another interesting finding of the study is that even other cryptocurrencies, such as Ether (ETH), do respond to hacks in the Bitcoin market. Interestingly, the volatility of Ether exhibits only a delayed effect. There is no contemporaneous effect. However, the delayed increase in volatility on day five is virtually the same as we observed for Bitcoin’s volatility.A possible explanation for this finding could be that exchanges trade multiple cryptocurrencies at the same time, and if an exchange was hacked, thieves could steal both Bitcoin and Ether, which could be a possible explanation for volatility spillovers found in my study. Another possible explanation for this phenomenon could be that thieves are using one cryptocurrency to cash out on their theft of the other, thus shifting the demand for cryptocurrencies from Bitcoin to Ether, for instance.To explore this issue, I collaborated with colleagues from the Finance Research Group and the Mathematics Research Group at the University of Vaasa. Together with Niranjan Sapkota and Josephine Dufitinema, we collected 53 hacking incidents in the Bitcoin market totaling in the 2011–2018 period corresponding to 1.7 million stolen Bitcoin. We argue that naïve risk management may dramatically underestimate the risk of those hacking incidents and that naïve risk management may dramatically underestimate the risk of those hackings incidents.In the study, we show that the distribution of hacking incidents is extremely fat-tailed. This means that Black-Swan-like events are more likely to occur. We found that the probability distribution of hacking incidents does not have a theoretical mean, which implies that the mean of the loss distribution is infinite. To compute an estimate of the risk due to cyberattacks in the Bitcoin market, we then employed recently proposed tools from extreme value theory, or EVT.We showed that the shadow mean of the expected risk of cyberattacks is $59.70 million, which is definitely larger (almost two times) than the corresponding sample tail mean of $30.92 million. More specifically, the shadow mean is computed by an application of ETV and corresponds in our research context to the expected risk of cyberattacks above a certain threshold. In our study, we chose as a threshold a loss of $1 million. That means all losses due to cyberattacks that are above $1 million are treated as extreme values.The next step in our calculation was to combine the shadow mean with the expectation of the loss distribution where we collected all losses due to cyberattacks that are less than $1 million. Combining our shadow mean with the sample mean below our chosen threshold, we calculated an overall expected loss of $24.89 million instead of $12.36 million, which is the naïve sample mean of the hacking incident data.Our findings have significant implications. For instance, our results show that standard tools used in traditional risk management can perhaps not be relied upon for making decisions.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
570,"Ki Young Ju, the CEO at CryptoQuant and an on-chain analyst, says Bitcoin (BTC) is neutral to short-term bearish for the time being.There are two major indicators that have been useful in spotting trend reversals in the ongoing bull cycle.First, whenever the Coinbase premium appeared, which means BTC is trading higher on Coinbase than on Binance, for example, BTC saw bullish momentum. Second, the momentum of Bitcoin strengthened when it saw large outflows from Coinbase.In the past several days, however, neither of these two indicators have shown any staying power as the metric dipped into negative territory on Jan. 24.Bitcoin will most likely find a renewed bullish rally if the premium on Coinbase consistently appears with large outflows.The combination of these two indicators would suggest that high-net-worth individuals are accumulating Bitcoin once again. Ki explained:The popular narrative around the recent Bitcoin rally is that high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors are scooping up BTC on every dip.Besides the two Coinbase-related indicators, stablecoin inflows is another important metric that could spot a new rally brewing.Ki noted that stablecoin inflows into exchanges are often a powerful on-chain signal for a rally because it shows the entry of sidelined capital into the cryptocurrency exchange market.For instance, when stablecoin inflows spiked on Jan. 22, BTC proceeded to rally by around 6% in the next 24 hours. He said:In the foreseeable future, if Bitcoin continues to trade sideways, some traders foresee BTC dropping to as low as $27,000.A pseudonymous trader known as “CJ” shared a potential scenario where BTC could bottom at around $26,000 to $27,000.However, even in the worst-case scenario, analysts generally do not see the price of Bitcoin declining to the low-$20,000 area. The trader wrote:Although short-term on-chain indicators signal a slightly bearish outlook, they do not hint at the likelihood of a deep correction.Bitcoin dropping back down to around $20,000, the previous all-time high, would mean a 35% drop from current levels. Such an event is unlikely, but traders should be aware of a possible black swan event such as a regulatory clampdown or a high-profile lawsuit against a major industry player."
571,"The twists and turns of 2020 made it arguably the best year on record to be a trader, especially if you were involved in cryptocurrencies. May’s third Bitcoin halving, coupled with the euphoric market volatility that swept global markets, made 2020 a year of gains and opportunities for crypto traders.By November, it was already clear Bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptocurrencies had cemented their status as a recognized asset class among retail and institutional traders alike, having outshined all other major asset classes in the world. Bitcoin’s renewed bull run deservedly grabbed the headlines across mainstream finance and made the global retail crypto trader the champion of 2020 in the investment world.Related: Did Bitcoin prove itself to be a reliable store of value in 2020? Experts answerUnlike the gains in mainstream financial markets, crypto’s bull run did not evolve from the massive stimulus packages unleashed by governments and central banks that helped prop up equity and bond valuations. Bitcoin increased organically thanks to a growing global retail base, compelled by the asset’s growing allure as a store of value.Above all, crypto’s global accessibility meant retail traders across the world were able to have their voices heard beyond the crypto ecosystem. Crypto’s universality provided a growing pool of traders with the means to express their market positions and uncover newfound market opportunities. It is no coincidence then that Bitcoin finished as the best performing asset class of 2020 — in no small part, due to the newfound aspirations, entrepreneurialism and risk-taking of the global retail crypto trader.The evolving 24/7 nature of the crypto market allowed traders from anywhere in the world, at any time, to capitalize on the increase in market volatility throughout 2020. In this way, the year’s energetic markets created a unique backdrop to play the markets, assisted by the growing sophistication of new trading products and services. In this evolving market landscape, global crypto retail traders began to capture the headlines in mainstream investment circles once again.With Bitcoin’s market capitalization surpassing over $350 billion in November, crypto captured volatility better than many had anticipated. As a result, crypto proved to be a hugely efficient asset for global retail traders to successfully navigate the economic and political uncertainties of 2020 — a trend that should continue into 2021.This year’s global market volatility arose largely from the macroeconomic and political decisions that unfolded in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Perhaps 2020’s market volatility culminated with the U.S. presidential election. The election caused not only a stir in markets but also produced a surge in options contracts tied to the U.S. election.Crypto played a core role in this development, with decentralized and crypto exchanges offering a plethora of prediction-based futures markets tied to the election. The surge in open interest in Bitcoin futures following President-elect Joe Biden’s nomination reflected the widening appeal of crypto as a tradable asset class. Crypto options can capitalize on that demand even further by leveraging the appeal and ease of prediction markets, with simple, engaging and intuitive products that reflect the market’s instincts and desires of a rapidly growing user base. The 24/7/365 makeup of the crypto market makes this all the more possible.Bitcoin’s ability to withstand major macro events, such as back-to-back U.S. presidential elections, Brexit and, of course, COVID-19 are proof of its status as a more mature asset class. As John Authers recently pointed out in an opinion piece in Bloomberg:It is fair to say that cryptocurrencies have lost much of their negative associations of being referred to as “a craze” or more famously by Warren Buffet as “rat poison squared.” Larger industry players are buying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies because they are an alternative store of value and gaining recognition as the most complex yet desirable currency to ever exist.As 2020 drew to a close and traditional markets were looking far more stable than witnessed earlier in the year, investors weren’t necessarily choosing between traditional investing and crypto trading, but rather recognizing how they could co-exist.As we have entered 2021 with positivity and hope that the global COVID-19 pandemic will be neutralized, it’s safe to say that traders and investors at all levels, from retail to large corporates, will be keeping a close eye on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies this year.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

572,"Bitcoin arouses passion, curiosity and has received more and more media attention, especially after having climbed the ranks of the best financial asset of the decade. However, whenever its price goes up, many doubts and questions arise, mainly around its origin and the energy expenditure by miners.To understand how Bitcoin (BTC) is created and what mining is, the key is the double-spending problem.Before Bitcoin, there was neither a digital value to be transferred nor a digital asset to be divided into several parts. That is, if you scanned a $100 bill and wanted to transfer this bill to someone, you could only send a copy of this bill.We are all used to smartphones and computers already. We send emails, photos, but we don’t realize that process in reality: We send a copy of the email (and not the original email), a copy of our photos (and not the original). When we click the send button on a smartphone or computer, a copy of the original will always remain on our device.Likewise, regarding financial transactions, when we click on the send button in our internet banking accounts or at an ATM, there is always an intermediary that transfers the money from one account to another. And that’s the problem Bitcoin aims to solve — the double-spending problem.When you click the send Bitcoin button on your cell phone, for example, you are not sending a copy, you are actually sending a digital object. Once a transaction is made in Bitcoin, it becomes irreversible and cannot be tampered with.For that reason, it is impossible to cancel or reverse a Bitcoin transfer after it has been validated by the blockchain network because the Bitcoin protocol has solved the problem of double-spending. It made a single asset, Bitcoin, digitally unique, enabling value transactions on the internet without intermediaries (independent of a central entity).While traditional money is issued (created) through (central) banks, Bitcoin is issued by algorithms, whose rules are pre-established in its protocol — the Bitcoin blockchain.In turn, the Bitcoin blockchain is a transaction registration system, maintained in an open (distributed) network of “suspicious” participants, who do not know or trust one another.So, when Satoshi Nakamoto wrote the source code for the Bitcoin protocol software and published it on the internet, he proposed the following: If you provide security for this network and help this financial network to operate, you will be rewarded.The logic of the pre-established rules in the Bitcoin protocol was very transparent and was written in a programming language. The breakthrough brought by the first blockchain, after years of research on digital currencies, is not just about computer science solutions.To create the Bitcoin blockchain architecture, Satoshi Nakamoto looked at existing research — bit-gold, b-money, hashcash, time-stamped cryptography — and added game theory.Using game theory, Satoshi implemented an incentive mechanism (consensus mechanism) called proof-of-work that enabled a new field of economic coordination, now called “cryptoeconomics” (the fields of economics and computer science to study the decentralized marketplaces and applications that can be built by combining cryptography with economic incentives).It is this economic incentive system that ensures that Bitcoin network participants behave in favor of the security and the perfect functioning of the system. This is the main reason why the Bitcoin blockchain has yet to be hacked.As more and more people realized the potential incentives in Bitcoin and started to “plug in” their computers to provide security to the network, the Bitcoin blockchain became more and more viable and secure. Now, there is enormous computational power guaranteeing transactions: Bitcoin is computational strength.A Bitcoin is “extracted” from the blockchain protocol by miners (validators) who need to solve mathematical algorithms to earn the right to include Bitcoin transactions in the blockchain network and be rewarded for it.Each Bitcoin transaction, before being added to the blockchain, is sent to the “mempool,” a retention area for pending transactions, where it awaits its inclusion in a block. The miners then take the pending transactions, which are waiting to be recorded, and combine them to create a “block” of transactions.Realize that the miners compete with one another so that their computers are chosen to record the most recent transactions in the next block that will be included in the network. And the best way to win this competition is by solving the algorithms as many times as possible (before someone else reaches the correct result, called a “nonce”).As it takes trillions of attempts to guess the correct nonce, only those who have more computational strength to win this competition will be awarded Bitcoin as a reward for their efforts.We can draw two main consequences from what we have said so far.The first consequence is that PoW prevents miners from circumventing the system and creating Bitcoin from scratch. Miners must burn real computing energy with each attempt and find the nonce to have a chance to win Bitcoin. As electricity to supply miners is not free, proof-of-work, therefore, generates a financial cost for Bitcoin mining.The second consequence refers to the fact that PoW makes Bitcoin’s transaction history immutable. If an attacker tries to change a transaction, that attacker will have to redo all the work that has been done since then to recover and establish the longest network. This is theoretically impossible and that is why miners are said to “protect” the Bitcoin network.As mining has become a legitimate industry over the years, it is supported by dedicated professionals with specialized hardware, which requires large data centers and a lot of electricity.It is worth mentioning that although there are other consensus mechanisms, PoW is the most used in blockchains because it is the most effective in terms of cybersecurity.Cambridge University has been operating a live Bitcoin network energy estimator since 2015. In fact, Bitcoin’s transparency allows anyone to see the amount of hash power applied to the network, which is usually measured in the number of hashes per second that the network is performing as part of the mining process.You can estimate how much power the network is using to perform these hashes based on the energy efficiency for hashing the mining hardware in use.According to Digiconomist’s Bitcoin energy consumption tracker, mining currently consumes 77.78 terawatt-hours per year. That is comparable to the total energy consumption of countries such as the Netherlands and the Czech Republic.Based on the above estimates, many argue against Bitcoin and the use of proof-of-work.However, can we take these “estimates” as an absolute truth? Do these estimates take into account that miners do not always operate with the same efficiency? Is it being considered that the electricity used may be coming from clean sources?Let’s look at these arguments one by one.The arguments against proof-of-work and the incentive mechanism created by Satoshi Nakamoto are:Argument A1 is true, as we demonstrated in the previous topic. It is one of the fundamental reasons why the Bitcoin network is so incredibly secure.Argument A2 used to be true, but the situation is changing, as more regions globally are entering the BTC mining industry. As this does not matter for energy consumption by the Bitcoin network, we will consider it to be true.Regions with great relevance are highlighted in teal, the Sichuan province in China is in yellow, and regions with lesser relevance are in red.Finally, the argument A3 is false, as we will see in the next topic, which debunks arguments A4 and A5.A recent research published by CoinShares Research found that most of the electricity consumed to mine Bitcoin, in fact, comes from clean sources, such as wind, solar and hydroelectric.To be more specific, 60% of global mining takes place in China, where Sichuan alone produces 50% of the global hash rate, with the remaining 10% divided more or less evenly among the Yunnan, Xinjiang provinces and Mongolia.It is important to note that the dominance of Sichuan both in China and in the world has a direct relationship with the hydroelectric-rich provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan in southwest China. During the rainy season, its electricity prices are among the lowest in the world, making Sichuan one of the most attractive global mining regions available.On the other hand, of the remaining 40% of mining companies, 35% of the global hash rate production is equally divided among Washington, New York, British Columbia, Alberta, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Georgia and Iran.Still, the report points to a broader problem of how renewable energy is currently deployed worldwide: Many renewable energy generators are poorly located and underutilized, and thus, Bitcoin mining has become the only viable use for this electricity.In this context, the research concludes that the Bitcoin network obtains 74% of its electricity from renewable sources, making it more focused on clean energy sources than almost all other large-scale industries in the world.Everything requires energy, and the additional use of energy has always improved our standard of living. Are the benefits provided by Bitcoin worth the additional use of energy? Are miners no longer looking for ways to reuse wasted energy, for example, the CO2 released during oil drilling?Since the physical location of mining centers does not impact the Bitcoin network, are miners no longer migrating to areas that generate surplus electricity at lower marginal costs? And in this case, this could not solve the problem of renewable energy that has a predictable capacity and would otherwise be wasted, such as hydroelectric and methane burning.Everything is energy — the waste is in not using it intelligently to improve economic and social living standards.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
573,"Bitcoin (BTC) price opened the weekend trapped within the $33,500 to $32,000 range but at the time of writing the digital asset is struggling to hold above $32,000. A few analysts have warned that the recent price loss of momentum may be a sign of ‘institutional exhaustion’ as selling pressure from Asia has increased since Jan. 19.Despite Bitcoin’s current downtrend, some institutional investors are sticking to their prediction that BTC price will reach $100,000 before the end of 2021. This suggests that institutions are buoyed by rising investor sentiment and the new proposals for a Bitcoin ETF.While Bitcoin still faces resistance around the $33,000 level, on-chain analyst Willy Woo sees one potentially positive development for BTC. Woo said that the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), a metric that shows the profit ratio of BTC by dividing the price sold by the price paid, had “a touchdown”.According to Woo there was a:Woo also suggested that investors are less likely to sell at a loss, an early signal that Bitcoin could be close to finding a bottom.DeFi tokens and altcoins continued to forge their own path as Bitcoin searched for support. Polkadot (DOT), AAVE, Curve DAO Token (CRV) and Sushiswap (SUSHI) all rallied roughly 5% to 7%.The surge in the price of many DeFi-related tokens has in large part been the result of an increase in DEX activity. Data from Dune Analytics shows monthly DEX volumes have increased since July 2020 and currently the total value locked in DeFi is at $23.89 billion.Chainlink (LINK) continued its strong rally, setting a new all-time high at $25.50 and surpassing Litecoin (LTC) in terms of total market cap to become the seventh-largest project listed on CoinMarketCap. Aave price also broke to a new all-time high at $229.39 and the total value locked in the platform is $3.44 billion.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $936.8 billion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 63.5%."
574,"As blackouts and police raids roil the upstart Iranian Bitcoin mining industry, a match between a permissionless currency and a country throttled by inflation that once seemed like a perfect fit is now being called into question. As Cointelegraph has previously reported, Iran joins Pakistan as a cryptocurrency superpower in the Middle East, owing in part due to cheap, heavily subsidized electricity prices, as well as a boost in activity following an approval of Bitcoin mining as an “industrial activity” for power plants in 2020. It’s been estimated that there are well over 1000 legal entities currently engaged in mining activities.However, the short history of cryptocurrency mining in the country has not always been a rosy one. Authorities have moved to shut down at least a thousand illegal farms in recent months, and Bitcoin spot prices have been mispriced at time relative to the rest of the world due to high demand as investors flee the rapidly inflating rial.Now, another source of friction has emerged as the country is plunged into frequent power blackouts in large population centers.On January 16th, multiple outlets reported that Iran suffered blackouts throughout most of the country. Social media reports have indicated that power has been spotty both before and after the outage on the 16th, however, with multiple cities experiencing blackouts all through the past two weeks.Authorities have been quick to blame Bitcoin mining for the outages and have publicized police raids on illegal mining operations, but some experts think the government is simply searching for excuses for a long-decaying power grid.In an interview with the Associated Press on Thursday, former deputy head of Iran’s Department of Environment Kaveh Madani said that Bitcoin was an “easy victim,” and that “decades” of administrative mismanagement are a more likely root cause.Moreover, while retail mining may currently be acting as a scapegoat for the government, it’s clear that authorities aren't entirely turning their backs on cryptocurrency. As recently as last month Bitcoin was used to facilitate import payments from Venezuela.While the relationship may be rocky at the moment, this certainly doesn’t appear to be the end of Bitcoin in Iran."
575,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) recovered in the past two days after dropping to as low as $28,850. Following the swift rebound, however, BTC has been unable to break past heavy resistance at $33,000 on Jan. 23, pulling back below $32,000 at the time of writing.Earlier, when the price of Bitcoin started to drop below $32,000, BTC traded much lower on Coinbase than on Binance.The lack of premium on Coinbase was worrying for two key reasons. First, Bitcoin naturally trades higher on Coinbase due to the minor premium of Tether.Second, when Coinbase sees a lower price than other exchanges, it shows that there is high selling pressure in the U.S. market.As the selling pressure on Bitcoin began to increase in the U.S. market, the price of BTC feel steeply in a short period.But, almost immediately after BTC rebounded from $30,000, the Coinbase premium reappeared. At the time of writing, BTC is around $40 higher on Coinbase than on Binance.The Coinbase premium re-emerging after nearly 12 hours is a positive sign of a potential trend reversal.But everyone is far from bullish in the near term, however. Analysts at QCP Capital, a team of traders in Asia, see several signs of “institutional exhaustion.”Considering that the main narrative around the recent has been the institutional demand for Bitcoin coming from the U.S., the rally may be in danger if the institutional appetite for BTC slows down. They said:The traders empahsized that the strength in the U.S. trading session lost momentum for the first time.In fact, throughout the past week, most of the BTC selling pressure came from Asia. This marks a key shift in market sentiment. They added:Bitcoin is at risk of a corrective phase throughout the first quarter of 2021 if institutional demand for BTC subsides.Various institution-focused platforms and vehicles, like Grayscale, are still seeing large inflows, which is indicative of solid institutional demand. At the same time, MicroStrategy continues its policy of buying Bitcoin on each dip with the latest purchase on Friday totaling $10 million. ""Today, $31,000 was a pocket of strong support, so at least not everyone is selling,"" said Chad Steinglass, head of trading at Crosstower, a digital assets capital markets firm.At the same time, the likelihood of a wider correction remains if the U.S. market continues to see an overall decline in the appetite to accumulate BTC, particularly if the dollar continues to recover in 2021."
576,"Despite Bitcoin price cooling off in recent days, with the premier cryptocurrency currently hovering around the $32,000 mark, it is still showcasing strong technicals as well as a thirty-day price gain of nearly 40%. Not only that, but even since its recent dip — which has seen the digital asset fall from its recently established all-time high of around $42,000 to its present value — the top crypto is still in the green over the last 12 months, exhibiting a value spike of nearly 300%.In this regard, since the fourth quarter of 2019, a number of traditional finance players have been predicting big things for Bitcoin (BTC), especially as governments all over the world continue to print money in the form of “economic stimulus packages,” leading to fears of inflation becoming more prevalent but also of a looming economic disaster that could potentially result in a global recession of unprecedented proportions.For example, during the second quarter of 2020, the economy of the United States plunged at an unprecedented rate, with the global powerhouse’s gross domestic product, which outlines a nation’s total output of goods and services, falling by 31.4%.In the wake of such developments — including an alarming rate of money being printed by central banks globally — many investment houses and banking institutions are now beginning to see a future for Bitcoin, especially as a hedge against monetary inflation, despite its current volatility levels.Earlier this year, American megabank JPMorgan Chase’s strategy team, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, claimed that a theoretical target of $146,000-plus could be sustainable for BTC by the end of 2021, pushing the narrative that the digital currency seems to be a prime candidate for replacing gold as a long-term store-of-value, especially for a budding base of younger, more tech-savvy investors.In a similar vein, new data released by Pantera Capital, an investment firm and hedge fund, reiterates JPMorgan’s sentiments surrounding BTC, suggesting that its price action is closely following the Stock-to-Flow model, thus reaffirming its faith in the digital asset hitting the $115,000 mark by Aug. 1.The S2F model that was developed by PlanB looks at BTC halving events that take place roughly every four years and how they play a direct role in spurring the currency’s value roughly six months after each cycle. In this regard, one can see that following each of the previous three halvings, Bitcoin has shown remarkable growth. For example, after the May 2020 halving, the price of 1 BTC rested at $8,000, only to shoot past the $15,000 threshold after exactly six months.Raiffeisen Bank too employed the S2F model in a recent report to ascertain where Bitcoin might be headed in the near future. According to the company’s research team, price targets beyond the $100,000 mark or even $1 million may be possible to achieve. “The fact is, now that the value has more than tripled in 2020 and momentum remains strong, future further gains should not surprise us,” the study reads.Other prominent players from the realm of traditional finance who have projected big things for BTC in the short term include individuals such as Andy Yee, public policy director for Greater China at cross-border payments provider Visa, who believes that this rally is different from the one in 2017, as it marks a shift from high-speculative, nonfunctioning tokens toward Bitcoin and Ether (ETH).Similarly, Thomas Fitzpatrick, global head of U.S.-based financial giant Citibank’s CitiFX Technicals market insight product, allegedly wrote in a private report — which was leaked online — that by December, Bitcoin has the potential to scale up to a price of around $318,000.Even though the S2F model was at first one of the few technical indicators signaling Bitcoin’s astronomical rise, it now seems that an increasing number of experts and analysts are beginning to see the technological and monetary proposition being put forth by BTC and other cryptocurrencies.Sam Tabar, co-founder of Fluidity — the company behind the AirSwap trading platform — and former head of capital strategy for Merrill Lynch told Cointelegraph that everyone needs to remember that the optimism surrounding BTC at this point is not just fluff, as speculation is now backed by real substance, adding:As a proxy for a global currency, the friction of buying crypto has been significantly reduced, as it’s easier than ever before to acquire Bitcoin. Similarly, as a proxy for gold, Tabar opined that Bitcoin is being used as a hedge against the U.S. dollar, especially as the newly elected President Joe Biden looks to spur U.S. dollar spending in order to prop up the economy against the effects of COVID-19 lockdowns.Providing a more technical breakdown as to why institutions are betting big on Bitcoin, J. P. Thieriot, CEO of asset trading platform Uphold, told Cointelegraph that unlike traditional dollar debasement havens like gold and other commodities, Bitcoin has zero elasticity on the supply side.He highlighted that if/when the price of gold reaches $3,000, marginal gold mines will once again fire up, with the same dynamic being applicable with oil and every other non-math-based unit of account. Thieriot believes that “The unique lack of supply-side elasticity means that, price-wise, BTC will respond more precipitously than things like gold, to the exact same drivers.” He further added:Lastly, the ever-increasing institutional demand seems to be changing the digital-asset market, which in turn is driving many banks to make seemingly outlandish price projections in relation to BTC. For instance, more funds are now looking to enter the crypto game, and recently, American firm Osprey Funds announced that it will be launching its over-the-counter crypto solution, Osprey Bitcoin Trust, which will likely rival Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.When looking at the market sentiment surrounding Bitcoin, the digital currency is increasingly showing correlations with the core functions traditionally afforded by traditional fiat currencies for their users — that is, it has become a unit of account, a standard of deferred payments and, lastly, a tangible long-term store of value.Also, over the course of 2020, an increasing number of e-commerce platforms added support for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a method of transaction to pay for goods and services. PayPal, for example — a company that boasts a 28-million-strong merchant base — now allows users to buy, sell and store cryptocurrencies via its platform.On the subject, Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer of crypto exchange Bitfinex, told Cointelegraph that consumer sentiment around Bitcoin is overwhelmingly bullish right now and that people who are celebrating the rise of various altcoins and other off-chain solutions owe their success to the flagship crypto, adding:Thieriot believes that the sentiment driving BTC is a result of previously unseen levels of currency debasement generated by the monetary response to COVID-19. Beyond retail speculation, he believes corporations are looking to hedge their fiat exposure, evidently seeing some relative advantages of Bitcoin over traditional havens like gold and subsequently jumping in. “The early jumpers have been handsomely rewarded, and so the trend is likely to continue,” he added.Lastly, Tabar highlighted that one of the more recent signs of growing consumer sentiment and institutional acceptance regarding BTC has come in the form of recent filings made by BlackRock, an American multinational investment management corporation with $8.7 trillion in assets under management as of the end of 2020. A quick look at the filings showcases a strong use of crypto-oriented language alluding to the company’s funds potentially engaging in “futures contracts based on Bitcoin.”"
577,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) tumble below $30,000 was short-lived as the top cryptocurrency found a new wave of support, including a $10 million ‘buy the dip’ moment from MicroStrategy. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows the strong inflows have helped lift BTC 4.92% to a daily high at $33,866.As the prospect of the Biden administration passing massive stimulus packages to help get the United States economy going again, conversations about Bitcoin becoming a reserve currency are beginning to pop up again.Although Bitcoin’s recent volatility has some analysts saying BTC is a cyclical asset rather than a hedge, the price recent movements have caught the eye of retail investors who have shown a renewed interest in cryptocurrencies in general.Even the Bank of International Settlements has acknowledged that digital currencies may have use and the organization has outlined plans to roll out a variety of central bank digital currency trials this year.Now that the Bitcoin fear index has flipped from “Extreme Greed” to “Fear,” some investors appear to be taking Warren Buffet’s advice of “buying when there is blood on the streets”.According to Chad Steinglass, head of trading at CrossTower, Bitcoin’s correction may have initially been triggered by critical comments fromU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.Prior to Yellen’s comments, Bitcoin was experiencing a “post-correction consolidation” and was “rangebound between $34,000 and $38,000” with traders “waiting to see which side of the range would be challenged or broken.”Steinglass further explaind that Bitcoin’s next steps will be determined by the actions of institutional investors. He said:Many of the top altcoins also recovered nicely from this week’s correction. Polkadot (DOT) rallied 7.09% to a daily high at $18, while Chainlink (LINK) posted a double-digit gain and topped out at $22.31. Tezos (XTZ) has also seen a surge in interest which boosted the altcoin by 15% to $3.36.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $949.8 billion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 64.4%."
578,"Aggressive profit-booking sent Bitcoin (BTC) spiraling below $29,000 on  Jan. 21 but was this a sign that institutional investors dumped their positions? This is one of the main questions bothering traders because large institutional inflows primarily led the run-up to $42,000.Cointelegraph contributor Marcel Pechman analyzed derivatives data from various exchanges, which showed professional traders might have purchased at lower levels. The fall seems to have particularly hurt the excessively leveraged traders, resulting in $460 million worth of liquidations at derivatives exchanges.Data from CryptoQuant shows that Bitcoin’s biggest mining pool, F2Pool, witnessed daily outflows of 10,000 Bitcoin for three days in a row, starting Jan. 17.Although the outflows do not mean the miner has dumped the entire quantity, it shows a possible intent to reduce a portion of the inventory. This could have attracted selling from traders, fearing a sharp fall if the miners flooded the open market with BTC.Currently, Bitcoin is rallying back toward $34,000 but is the current rebound a dead cat bounce or a resumption of the uptrend?Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin held the 20-day exponential moving average ($34,146) on Jan. 20, but the bulls could not push the price back into the symmetrical triangle, which shows a lack of demand at higher levels. The bears renewed their selling on Jan. 21 and broke the 20-day EMA support decisively. This is the first indication that the bullish momentum has weakened.The BTC/USD pair has bounced off the 50-day simple moving average ($28,103) today, but the rise could face resistance at the 20-day EMA. If the pair turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the sentiment has changed from buy on dips to sell on rallies.If the next dip breaks below the 50-day SMA, the correction could deepen to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $22,106.73. Such a move may delay the resumption of the uptrend.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can propel the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rise to the downtrend line. A breakout of this resistance could result in a retest of the all-time high at $41,959.63.Ether (ETH) plummeted below the $1,300 support and the 20-day EMA ($1,142) on Jan. 21, but the bulls defended the uptrend line today. The buyers are currently attempting to drive the price above the $1,300 resistance.If they succeed, the ETH/USD pair could retest the all-time high at $1,438. A breakout and close above this resistance will suggest the uptrend has resumed. The next target objective on the upside is $1,675.However, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the pair could consolidate in a range for a few days before starting the next trending move. The bears will be back in the game if the pair turns down and breaks below the uptrend line.Polkadot (DOT) is currently consolidating in an uptrend. The bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $14.7259, suggesting that the traders are not rushing to the exit as they expect the uptrend to resume.The upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought zone suggest the bulls are in command. If the buyers can thrust the price above the $18 to $19.40 overhead resistance zone, the uptrend could resume. The next level to watch on the upside is $24 and then $30.If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the DOT/USD pair may remain range-bound for a few more days. The pair could turn negative if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA ($13.25).XRP slipped below the $0.25 support today, but the bears could not sustain the lower levels. The bulls purchased the dip and are currently attempting to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.29).If they manage to do that, the XRP/USD pair may rise to the downtrend line, which has acted as a stiff resistance on two previous occasions. If the price once again turns down from this resistance, the bears will try to sink the pair below $0.25 and complete the descending triangle pattern. If that happens, the pair could drop to $0.169.On the other hand, if the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, the pair may rise to $0.385. A breakout of this resistance could start a new uptrend, but if the price turns down from this level, the pair may continue to consolidate between $0.25 and $0.385 for a few more days.Cardano (ADA) broke below the $0.34 support on Jan. 21 and the 20-day EMA ($0.30) today, but the bulls purchased at the support line of the ascending channel, which shows demand at lower levels.The buyers are currently attempting to sustain the price above the $0.34 overhead resistance. If they succeed, a retest of $0.3971995 is likely. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest bulls have the upper hand.A breakout and close above $0.40 could resume the uptrend with the next target objective at $0.50. This bullish view will invalidate the price turns down and breaks below the channel. The next support on the downside is the 50-day SMA at $0.22.Litecoin (LTC) has formed a head and shoulders pattern that will complete on a breakdown and close below $120. The strong rebound off the 50-day SMA ($122.80) today suggests the bulls are defending the $120 support.The current bounce could face selling at the downtrend line. If the price turns down from this resistance, the bears will again try to break the neckline at $120 and complete the head and shoulder pattern. If they succeed, the LTC/USD pair could drop to $100 and then to $70.This negative view will invalidate if the bulls push the price above the downtrend line. The momentum could pick up above $160 and result in a retest of $185.5821. A breakout of this resistance may resume the uptrend.Chainlink (LINK) rebounded sharply from just below the 20-day EMA ($18.18) today, which shows the bulls are actively buying on dips. The upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory suggest bulls are in command.If the bulls can sustain the price above $22, the LINK/USD pair could retest the all-time high at $23.767. A breakout and close above this resistance may resume the uptrend, with the next target at $27 and then $30.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, a few days of consolidation is possible. The trend will turn in favor of the bears if they can sink the pair below $17.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) broke below the uptrend line on Jan. 21, and the altcoin dropped close to the 50-day SMA ($375) today. The 20-day EMA ($459) has flattened out, and the RSI near the midpoint suggests a few days of range-bound action.If the bulls push the price back above the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair could rise to $539. The bears are likely to mount a strong defense at this level. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair may remain stuck between $539 and $370 for a few days.On the contrary, if the current bounce turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will again try to sink the price below the $370 support. If they succeed, the pair may correct to $275.The bulls defended the 20-day EMA ($40.82) on Jan. 20 but renewed selling on Jan. 21 sent Binance Coin (BNB) tumbling to the support line of the ascending broadening wedge pattern.The bears tried to sink the price below the pattern today but strong buying by the bulls has pushed the price to the 20-day EMA. If the bulls can propel the price above the 20-day EMA, it will indicate accumulation at lower levels. This could result in a rally to $44 and then to $47.2187.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below the support line, it will suggest traders are selling at the 20-day EMA, which indicates a bearish sentiment. If the 50-day SMA ($35.95) cracks, the BNB/USD pair could correct to $30 and then to $26.7273.Stellar (XLM) plunged below the $0.26 to $0.325 range on Jan. 21, indicating the balance had shifted in favor of the bears. The sellers tried to sink the price to the 50-day SMA ($0.205) today, but the buyers arrested the decline at $0.228112.The bulls are currently attempting to push the price back inside the range. If they succeed in sustaining the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.264), it will suggest the break below the range was a bear trap.If the bulls can sustain their buying and push the price above $0.325, the XLM/USD pair could resume the uptrend and rally to $0.40On the other hand, if the pair again turns down and breaks below $0.26, it will suggest the sentiment has turned negative, and traders are selling on minor rallies. This could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

579,"Often touted as a store of value or hedge asset, Bitcoin (BTC) has gained significant mainstream adoption over the past several months. Kenneth Rogoff, a public policy and economics professor at Harvard University, doubts the asset’s success, however. ""I can see Bitcoin being used in failed states,” Rogoff said in a Bloomberg interview on Thursday, adding:Bitcoin has weathered its fair share of criticisms throughout its 12-year history. Gold advocate Peter Schiff often comments against the technology, investor Warren Buffett once referred to the asset as ""probably rat poison squared"" and financial commentator Dennis Gartman expressed skepticism toward Bitcoin in late 2020, just to name a few examples.Bitcoin adoption has continued to grow despite the skeptics, however. The asset broke past previous all-time price highs, hitting a recent peak near $42,000 after multiple large mainstream companies publicized their BTC purchases in 2020.""I certainly think I agree that it's speculative,” Rogoff said of Bitcoin.He added:“I think, over the long run, if there's not a use, yes, the bubble will burst,” Rogoff posited. “I hope there's not such a valuable use, but I suppose it’s a hedge against dystopia.""In contrast, leaders in the crypto industry have presented Bitcoin as a hedge under less abnormal circumstances."
580,"Reserve currency is money held by central banks or treasuries usually for international transactions. Argentina is not going to be able to purchase a Boeing 737 MAX passenger jet, for example, with its highly inflationary peso; it will have to pay with U.S. dollars, which is why Argentina keeps dollars on hand — i.e., in “reserve.”A second basic function is to support the value of a national currency. If the Brazilian real, for instance, plummets during an economic contraction, Brazil’s central bank could bid it up again by purchasing reals with dollars that it holds in reserve.Could Bitcoin (BTC) fulfill these key functions of a reserve currency? “I certainly think so, in the future at least,” Franklin Noll, a monetary historian and the president of Noll Historical Consulting, told Cointelegraph. Bitcoin’s electronic nature makes it well suited for settling payments. “If gold was used in the past to do so, this digital gold should do the job as well, if not better.”Meanwhile, these are unusual times. When markets crashed amid the COVID-19 crisis in March, Bitcoin followed suit. “BTC did not perform well,” Sinjin David Jung, managing director at International Blockchain Monetary Reserve, told Cointelegraph. But in early 2021, the world is facing a different circumstance, one marked by extensive stimulus spending — especially in the United States — and if the dollar falters, according to Jung:But challenges remain, and Bitcoin probably won’t supplant USD anytime soon. Said Noll: “The current problem with Bitcoin — as with gold — is that few, if any, goods or debts are denominated in Bitcoin.” Furthermore, according to him: “It’s hard to see a future where a significant amount of the world’s trade is denominated in Bitcoin. The U.S. dollar is still king.”Jonas Gross, project manager at the Frankfurt School Blockchain Center — a think tank associated with the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management — sees little chance that BTC will be used as a reserve currency by any industrialized country in the near future. “Skepticism remains very high,” he told Cointelegraph, referring to a recent statement made by European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde that called for global regulation of BTC because of money laundering concerns, among others.That said, “the U.S. dollar’s dominance as the world’s reserve currency could indeed be threatened,” continued Gross. China is in advanced testing of its central bank digital currency — i.e., its digital currency/electronic payment project — which could be launched as early as 2022, and foreigners might be allowed to access and use it for transactions. In that event, Gross added:China’s yuan will have to go some distance to catch the dollar, however. USD accounted for 60.46% of the world’s allocated foreign exchange reserves as of Q3 2020, followed by the euro (20.53%), Japanese yen (5.92%) and U.K. pound sterling (4.50%), according to the International Monetary Fund. The yuan was only fifth (2.13%).Campbell Harvey, professor of international business at Duke University, told Cointelegraph that as the rates of borrowing in the United States rise, “the riskier it [USD] becomes as a reserve currency. At some point, it is too risky, and alternatives are sought.” Indeed, economic history teaches that global reserve currencies do not last forever.In August, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy announced that it had adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. At the start of 2021, former Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper raised the ante, suggesting that not only companies but governments might use crypto as a reserve, albeit as part of a “basket of things” that also included gold and fiat.There have been six major world reserve periods since 1450, with an average span of about 94 years. The U.S. dollar has already been the world’s reserve for 100 years, surpassing the average, and is nearly equal to its predecessor, the British pound, which dominated for roughly 105 years.BTC by itself is unlikely to become a reserve currency because of its extreme volatility, though, Harvey said. “Currently, the USD volatility versus 10 leading currencies is about 3%–4% per year. BTC is in the range of 80%–90%.” Gold, he added, has an annual volatility of about 15%.On the other hand, cryptocurrencies could be used as part of a basket in the future, added Harvey. “It would unlikely be a single cryptocurrency in the basket. By the time this happens, all major central banks will have their version of a cryptocurrency.”The idea of a diversified basket is not new, continued Harvey, referencing F. A. Hayek’s 1943 Economic Journal paper titled “A Commodity Reserve Currency.” Still, “there are plenty of issues: What assets do you use and what are the weights?” Also, who actually determines the weightings and if and when an asset is to be added or dropped?“Bitcoin could indeed be used as part of a ‘basket of things’ as a hedge against inflation and political turmoil,” Gross said. One already sees BTC being used as a corporate treasury reserve, he added, mentioning MicroStrategy. Noll, too, viewed some corporations’ recent embrace of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve as a significant development:José Parra-Moyano, assistant professor at Copenhagen Business School, told Cointelegraph: “It could be that if Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies establish and continue showing technical security, central banks will incorporate them to their reserves.” But maintaining technical security over time won’t be easy, he suggested.Is BTC’s infrastructure anywhere close to ready? Jung told Cointelegraph: “At this point, only BTC [among cryptos] could be considered a contender for the last resort reserve currency”; its transparency, simplicity and track record “clearly show it to be engineered for this function.”“There are indeed some hurdles to overcome,” according to Gross. “Lower volatility and higher speed — e.g., implemented through the Lightning Network — would increase BTC’s attractiveness.” Furthermore, he outlined that efforts to educate regulators about cryptocurrencies should be improved so that they understand the potential of the technology “from a portfolio diversification perspective.”Other potential obstacles are Bitcoin’s “newness” — it has only existed for 12 years — noted Harvey, as well as its still-limited adoption, vulnerability to manipulation — “see the academic evidence on USDT and BTC” — and also vulnerability to algorithmic attacks, “a 51% attack is costly but feasible.” Harvey added:Jung believes that the often-cited volatility flaw is exaggerated. BTC can’t help but be volatile in the process of its positioning as the last resort reserve currency. It will “continue to be volatile until the conditions are met when the U.S. dollar value starts to consistently drop even as the excess U.S. dollars are fueling greater market gains.”Finally, in asking about BTC’s potential as a reserve currency, it is assumed that there will always be the need for such a reserve. Harvey, for one, isn’t so sure. “Why do we even need a ‘reserve’ currency?” he asked. “In the future, everything will be tokenized. To pay for something, you will have your choice what to pay in — e.g., BTC, gold, IBM stock, etc. Users will have easy access to millions of cross rates and will be instantly able to ‘pay with whatever asset you choose.’”“Inherently when you speak about a reserve currency, it is all about long-term stability and competitiveness,” said Jung. “As such, the U.S. dollar will always act as the world’s primary reserve in times of geopolitical uncertainty. But what happens when the world and the U.S. dollar is in a continual state of quantitative easing?”In that event, all bets are off, and national governments, beginning with smaller countries, might indeed gravitate to a basket of hard and digital assets as their reserve currency of “last resort.” Crypto and blockchain proponents will just have to continue spreading the word and hope that BTC or any other cryptocurrency will eventually become mature and worthy to take up the mantle of a commonly accepted reserve."
581,"Russia adopted its cryptocurrency law in January, but this legislation does not provide a direct answer to some questions, including how local officials should deal with their crypto holdings. There are at least two other legal initiatives requiring Russian public officials to declare or even get rid of their cryptocurrency holdings entirely in 2021.On Dec. 10, 2020, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree obliging some public officials to disclose their crypto holdings by June 30. The decree was adopted as part of the country’s law “On Digital Financial Assets,” or DFA, which was made effective on Jan. 1.According to the decree, Russian officials or individuals seeking to hold public office must disclose their digital assets, as well as those of their spouse and children. The legislation refers to a general scope of the official establishment, seeking to ensure that the government is as compliant with the local financial declaration rules as ordinary citizens already are.But there is also another regulation that prohibits certain Russian officials from owning any cryptocurrency, in line with the country’s anti-corruption measures. On Dec. 28, 2020, the Russian Ministry of Labour and Social Protection published an informational letter reminding some officials that they are obligated to liquidate their digital financial assets and any digital currencies by April 1, regardless of the country of issuance.This restriction specifically refers to individuals listed in Part 1 of Article 2 of the Russian Federal Law from May 7, 2013 No. 79-FL, which prohibits certain categories of persons to store their funds abroad as well as use foreign financial instruments. The list includes a broad number of key public positions, including running and deputy positions in public office, the board of directors of the Russian central bank, public corporations owned by the Russian Federation, heads of district administrations and several others.In the letter, the ministry mentioned that other categories of public officials are not subject to these restrictions, though they still need to disclose their digital assets in line with a decree signed by Putin.While Russian authorities keep introducing new crypto-related rules for public officials, it’s not immediately clear how they will monitor compliance from a technological standpoint. Artem Grigoriev, head of the research lab at the Russian Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain, told Cointelegraph:Maria Stankevich, a member of the Russian Committee on Blockchain Technologies and Cryptoeconomics, also questioned the technological and legal feasibility of implementing the rules:"
582,"One of the tropes that observers commonly invoke to explain the forces behind the crypto markets’ surge at the end of 2020 and in early 2021 is that the process has been mainly driven by the inrush of institutional investment. While there are many good reasons to believe that the race among the big players of traditional finance to get into digital assets has indeed provided much fodder for the blast, the overwhelming focus on this narrative can make it seem that retail investors had a little role to play.Shifting the spotlight away from the public can be misguided because blockchain is fundamentally a social technology. Bitcoin (BTC) as an investment vehicle would struggle to exist without the bustling Main Street marketplace and a social media arena where market-driving narratives emerge and clash.Heightened social engagement with crypto has been both a precursor for the recent rally and its direct consequence. Is there a way to quantify the crypto industry’s recent gains in terms of user inflow?Perhaps the easiest trend to capture is the surge in search activity coinciding with rapid gains in crypto prices. One established metric is the volume of Google searches of cryptocurrency-related terms. In the week of Jan. 3, Google Trends’ global interest over time index for the term “Bitcoin” reached the value of 68, which amounts to more than two-thirds of the all-time high registered in the week of Dec. 17, at the height of the previous record-breaking bull run in 2017–2018.Frantically, searching for the meaning of basic crypto terms amid the hype waves rocking the internet in the wake of a major price rally could be indicative of a potential newcomer’s first impulse to educate oneself on the subject. While this is a necessary first step for eventually becoming involved with digital assets in a more tangible way, search data alone only reveals a fraction of how deep engagement truly is. Spikes in searches could as well be a marker of a FOMO-driven behavior that does not translate into more meaningful activity once the hype dies down.The volume of traffic going to specialized cryptocurrency analytics websites could be a somewhat more precise marker of the arrival of a new wave of the crypto-curious who are willing to do their reading beyond headlines. CoinGecko, one of the major crypto data aggregators, shared some of its internal analytics to provide a sense of how much more engagement they have received against the backdrop of the recent market surge. The firm’s co-founder and chief operating officer, Bobby Ong, commented to Cointelegraph:Still, there is no way to tell what share of these gains has been driven by newcomers versus returning crypto investors.If we accept that participating in a Twitter discussion about cryptocurrency is more likely to reveal a meaningful engagement with the digital asset space than simply looking up what Bitcoin is, there is some good news in fresh data.While the indicators of generic interest as gauged by Google Trends in the wake of the recent rally failed to surpass the highs of late-2017, several metrics related to Twitter conversations have hit all-time highs. Treyce Dahlem, a research analyst at The Tie — a digital assets data provider — explained to Cointelegraph:Dahlem added that the share of tweets about Bitcoin coming from unique Twitter accounts has also reached a record high at 53.3%, suggesting that the increased volume of conversation is fueled by new users jumping in and not just the intensified discussions among the existing participants of Crypto Twitter.An even more challenging task is to gauge the state of crypto awareness and adoption that predated the latest price spike. This type of insight could lend credence to the argument that increased retail investors’ engagement could not only stem from the crypto markets’ surge but at least partly fuel it.The type of data best suited for answering broad, population-level questions around the share of people who know about digital assets and use them can be obtained through surveys. While there are plenty of crypto-related surveys, few of them even aspire to reach any level of representativeness, much less systematically apply the same methodology across several time points to reliably track the dynamics.One exception is perhaps the Crypto Survey fielded by venture company Blockchain Capital every 18 months, starting in the fall of 2017. It uses a sample of U.S. adults that is weighted such that all key demographic characteristics are represented in a proportion similar to the general population. The latest round of data, collected in October 2020, speaks to the Americans’ rapid progression through what the authors of the report labeled the “adoption funnel.”According to the survey results, less than two months before crypto markets rallied in December, 90% of U.S. residents reported having heard of Bitcoin; 45% were at least somewhat familiar with it; 45% agreed that it is a positive innovation; 41% were convinced that most people will be using Bitcoin in the next 10 years; and 34% said that they were likely to purchase Bitcoin in the next five years. For each of these metrics, sizable increases from respective spring 2019 values were apparent.Related: Access denied: Banks seem prone to cryptophobia despite growing adoptionThese trends are not exclusive to the United States or even to the elite club of the world’s most developed economies. Occasional reports from a wide array of nations, from Australia to Nigeria, highlighted that in 2020, people around the globe have been getting familiar with digital assets and joining the ranks of crypto users at rates that could only be explained by fundamental factors.Granted, newsworthy bull runs and accompanying spikes in online attention help accelerate engagement and subsequent adoption of crypto, but it’s this virtuous cycle that is the expanding adoption that, in turn, allows markets to thrive."
583,"Bitcoin (BTC) showed signs of a resurgence on Jan. 22 after a trip below $30,000 produced fresh buyer support.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView showed a stronger trading day for BTC/USD on Friday, with daily gains at 8.5% at the time of writing.The turnaround follows a turbulent 24 hours in which Bitcoin slid to $28,950 — a key level when it comes to support from whales and only its second dip below $30,000 this year.At the same time, MicroStrategy, well known for its ever-increasing Bitcoin treasury, confirmed that it had purchased 314 BTC to bring its total hoard to 70,784 BTC.""Microstrategy just bought 314 more #Bitcoin for $10M. @michael_saylor bought the dip,"" Twitter-based information resource Documenting Bitcoin summarized, referring to the company's CEO, Michael Saylor. The latest buy-in came at an average cost of $31,808 per Bitcoin and joins asset manager Grayscale's ongoing purchases that defy overall selling action in the past few weeks.Among other major BTC investors, meanwhile, interest remained focused on the area at just below $30,000. According to monitoring resource Whalemap, that area is crucial to hold in order to avert a further price dip on BTC/USD, one that could take the pair closer to $20,000.""Falling below $28,727 and consolidating there will give us another big drop to at least $23,818,"" part of a series of tweets explained, along with an accompanying graphic.""Not many supports below $28,727 right now, so if we start consolidating there, it will probably bring BTC all the way to at least $23,818,"" co-founder Artem Lazarev told Cointelegraph."
584,"2020 will be remembered as one of the most difficult years for contemporary societies: Countries and entire populations have faced lockdowns and economic crises, financial markets still suffer from the severe impacts of the economic recession, and more than 2 million lives have been taken by COVID-19.Despite this, other sectors have been impacted in other ways during the severe global health crisis — which still seems far from over, even though vaccines are beginning to be distributed in wealthy countries. Economies have radically digitalized, hedge assets have attracted mistrust, and the crypto market has had one of its most important years since 2009, the year of Bitcoin’s (BTC) launch.In fact, the crypto and blockchain markets have stood out in the face of a crisis that has spared almost no sector. Cryptocurrency funds are among the most profitable of the year, Bitcoin and the biggest altcoins reach new historic highs, large institutions and investors in the financial markets have allocated investments in Bitcoin, and blockchain technology has broken down barriers in the financial sector and in the production chains of the most varied of sectors.Faced with a year of profound changes, what is to be expected for the future? Cointelegraph Brasil invited some of the country’s top crypto and blockchain experts to chart the next steps for the market.Institutional investment was highlighted in 2020, finally reaching the cryptosphere, and it promises another year of growth in 2021.According to Rodrigo Borges, founding member of the Oxford Blockchain Foundation, large Bitcoin contributions by institutional investors — which have even bought more BTC than the production capacity of miners — will intensify in 2021: “Regarding Bitcoin, I imagine that there will be an increase in demand for institutional investors, enabling the emergence of new products with exposure to Bitcoin,” analyzed Borges. He also sees “2021 as a year of consolidation and strong development in the sector.”As for Tatiana Revoredo, MIT blockchain expert and Cointelegraph Brasil columnist, the custody of cryptocurrencies by traditional financial institutions and the adoption of stablecoins will be key in the new year:Crypto markets experienced a year of extreme optimism — or greed, as demonstrated by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Bitcoin reached a dramatic bottom close at $3,800 in March, and it beat its 2017 historic high of $20,000 on Dec. 16. In Brazil, the currency set a new historical record in November when it reached $106,000 Brazillian reals.Cointelegraph Markets reporter Marcel Pechman highlighted the behavior of the market despite the setbacks suffered during the year. He recalled: “The Bitcoin and Ethereum markets developed in 2020 as never before imagined, both in terms of trading volume, price and the contribution of renowned investors like Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller.”Pechman said that despite the crypto market suffering some setbacks, the impact of those setbacks on market performance was not so significant: “We had, for example, the US Department of Justice suing BitMEX — at the time, the largest derivatives exchange — and KuCoin’s $280 million hack, and none of those affected the market.”Pechman also recalled that the 2020 DeFi race led to expensive transaction costs on the Ethereum network but did not impact market sentiment.OriginalMy CEO Edilson Osório agreed with the promising future of the DeFi sector, but he cautioned against fraud:About 2020’s innovations, and the digitalization imposed by the COVID-19 crisis, Pechman also said that it will go even deeper in 2021:On the domestic markets, Osório is betting on the tokenization market in Brazil, which is already used by the country’s largest crypto exchange, Mercado Bitcoin. According to him, 2021 will be a year for “maturing the security tokens market.”“Existing protocols are beginning to be well regarded by regulators, since most of them provide for greater participation and visibility on the part of the regulator itself and allow the mitigation of various risks inherent in this market. In this race, there is a great chance that Brazil will gain prominence because the local regulator has established a regulatory sandbox and the first projects are already beginning to mobilize to have their applications running in a more legally secure environment,” – noted Osório.Another player at the Brazilian crypto markets, João Paulo Mayall — head of operations at QR Asset Management — is also optimistic about the tokenization market in 2021. He highlighted the role of regulators in the sector’s expansion in the South American country: “I believe that the future is the tokenization of assets, debentures, court bonds, government debts. Brazil is very advanced in its banking system and we will have many surprises in this sector, so I am very optimistic. Tokenization is a billion-dollar market, but it lacks the infrastructure. Innovation came in front of the regulators, but I think they are open to listening and working on it. I think [the regulation] will happen next year, even before March 2021.”Finally, blockchain expert Tatiana Revoredo argued that crypto adoption in Brazil, which saw its currency melt in 2020, will intensify, with Bitcoin once again asserting itself as an economic-protection asset. She believes that the crypto markets will see “an increase in the interest of Brazilians, with consequent increase in the Brazilian market, with a prominent role for Bitcoin being adopted as a protective asset.”The digitization of economies has placed the discussion of central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, at the center of debates by financial authorities around the world. One of the countries that has definitely entered this race is China, which is already conducting real tests of the digital yuan in the country. Its main geopolitical rival, the U.S., announced that for the time being, it does not intend to digitize the dollar, but it is already seeing internal pressure from not following the Chinese leadership in the sector.The Central Bank of Brazil has also commented on the transformation of the Brazillian real into a digital currency a few times, although there are no concrete plans for that in the short term.Osório believes the European Union will join the hype soon, further accelerating the global race for CBDCs: “Although China appears to be leading the CBDC race, other countries are also beginning to move in this direction. Among them, Estonia, which recently started an internal consultation for the launch of its currency in the digital version. In particular, I believe that in Europe a more comprehensive and organized movement should take place in this sense, given the incentives promoted by the European Union.”Many experts try to predict the impacts of CBDCs on economies — one of the main concerns of economic regulators. Governments, which largely study the adoption of blockchain in their public processes, should also enter the debate on privacy and the digitization of money.According to Tatiana Revoredo, “in the government sector, the forecast is for the growth of [blockchain] applications in document registration and health applications, as well as a greater concern, by the citizens, regarding the relationship between privacy and CBDC.” She also claims that payments processors should closely monitor this innovation:Governments have also viewed blockchain technology through a positive lens. In Brazil and Latin America, several state entities already use the technology to certify documents, including customs and notary offices. Big companies are also adopting blockchain to certify production, with use cases that are only expected to grow going forward.Borges said that the acceleration of blockchain adoption by large companies and governments can positively impact crypto assets:Revoredo agreed and highlighted the advancement of technology in the agricultural sector: “There has been a significant advance in agribusiness, with use in the identification of devices (drones, for example), integration with IoT and artificial intelligence to provide greater reliability and certify quality of agricultural production.”Osório defended the growth of the blockchain market in 2020 and its prospects for the near future: “When we look at advances in blockchain with applications beyond digital currency, we see a growing market in the area of decentralized digital identity, including with the approach of governments. We have seen movements in governments in the US and Japan, interested in modernizing their digital governance models. And the pandemic has certainly helped to accelerate and advance discussions on the issue around the world, as it understands that the digitization of analog and traditional services is a necessity.”The end of 2020 was a milestone that closed out one of the most dramatic years in the history of contemporary societies, but it also revealed ways to combat global economic and health crises.Blockchain technology has helped societies fight corruption, adopt more transparent processes and even contributed to the certification of medicines and vaccines during the most serious health crisis of the last 100 years, in addition to helping companies to improve procedures, products and services.Meanwhile, Bitcoin has strengthened as an economic protection and investment product, has attracted institutional investment giants, and — together with other crypto technologies — has even laid the foundation for central banks around the world to start implementing their own digital currencies.We still do not know the depth of the revolution we are experiencing with the digitalization of societies and the weakening of national currencies around the world, but by the end of 2021, we will certainly know many of the answers to the questions that still plague us at the beginning of this new year."
585,"A chip shortage is significantly affecting the Bitcoin mining hardware distribution chain, according to Reuters on Friday.Indeed, Bitmain — one of the major Bitcoin miner makers — has seen its inventory sold out until August 2021, according to information on its website. Apart from being out of stock, Bitmain’s mining rigs are now at a massive price premium.For instance, back in November 2020, the Antminer S19 shipped for $1,897 per unit. As of the time of writing, the same miner is priced at $2,767 on the company’s website — a 45% markup.Speaking to Reuters, Alex Ao, vice president of semiconductor manufacturer Innosilicon, said, “There are not enough chips to support the production of mining rigs.”What little supply is available is reportedly being scooped by major mining establishments in North America. Back in 2020, United States-based mining giants like Riot Blockchain, Bitfarms and Marathon significantly upscaled their inventory with massive purchases from Bitmain and rival MicroBT.These capacity expansions occurred even as Bitcoin went through its quadrennial halving that saw block reward subsidies cut in half. Thus, while China still dominates the global hash rate distribution, North American mining interests are reportedly “squeezing supply to China.”Chinese miners have also suffered notable disruptions of late including a frozen-card tide back in 2020 that prevented some operations from being able to pay for electricity. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, authorities in China’s Yunnan province also shut off the power supply to miners in the region.Smaller mining operations are also in danger of being priced out of the market. Premiums on hardware, even for second-hand rigs, on top of the reduced block rewards could significantly impact their bottom lines.Already, other industries dependent on semiconductors are beginning to feel the effects of the continued shortage. Car manufacturers such as Ford have announced shutdowns of some of their plants."
586,"Bit Digital, a Bitcoin mining company traded on the Nasdaq stock exchange, is the subject of a class-action lawsuit that alleges the company fabricated the extent of its Bitcoin (BTC) mining operations.According to the lawsuit, which was filed in the Southern District of New York court on Wednesday by plaintiff Anthony Pauwels, Bit Digital misled investors and made materially false claims about the extent of its Bitcoin mining business, causing significant financial harm for investors.Specifically, the plaintiff references an investigative report by J Capital Research that claims Bit Digital simply lied about having Bitcoin mining farms in operation across China. The firm’s website claims to have over 40,000 mining rigs currently in operation, exerting a hash rate of 2,253 petahashes per second, having successfully mined over 1,500 BTC since the beginning of 2020.However, researchers at J Capital say they contacted government officials in the Chinese provinces in which Bit Digital claim to operate, only to find that no one had ever heard of them.When J Capital’s research hit news headlines, Bit Digital’s stock price plummeted 25%. From BTBT’s peak valuation of $29.27 in early January, the stock price has since fallen 44% to the current valuation of around $16.On Tuesday, Bit Digital issued a response to the claims made by J Capital, pointing out that the company had filed all of its documentation with the Securities and Exchange Commission and had always sought to update investors and regulators with accurate data.However, the plaintiff in the lawsuit against Bit Digital says the firm’s executive leadership — CEO Min Hu and chief financial officer Erke Huang — were in a position to dictate the contents of any and all documents relating to the running of the business:Pauwels seeks reparations for the 1,000 units of Bit Digital shares he purchased at a price of $21.81 each on Dec. 12, 2020, as well as other compensatory damages, court fees and expenses.The plaintiff has demanded a trial by jury. No legal response has been made by Bit Digital at this time, nor did the company respond to Cointelegraph's request for comment."
587,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is continuing to reject the $35,000 resistance level, falling below $30,000 briefly overnight on Jan. 22.BTC has pared some losses since, bouncing above $31,500. At these prices, however, BTC/USD is headed for its worst week ever, losing over $5,000 in the past four days, as the bulls attempt to establish $32,000 as new support.There are three main reasons why the price of Bitcoin dropped so steeply overnight. First, the options market was overheated with growing put options. Second, a critical resistance area was rejected. Third, the speed of the sell-off possibly led to a panic drop in a short period.In the options market, there are two types of contracts: puts and calls. Puts are sell orders and calls are buy orders.According to Laevitas, a data analytics platform, the options market has $3.1 billion in notional open interest with near-term put volume rising. They said:Currently, the options market accounts for around 33% of the futures market’s open interest. With over $3 billion in open interest, the options market can have a significant impact on the price of BTC.The $35,000 level was a critical short-term resistance area. As soon as BTC rejected the level, it quickly fell below $30,000.Scott Melker, a cryptocurrency analyst, said that Bitcoin swept the lows, even though it dipped below the previous support area. Hence, if the bullish structure remains intact, a rally back to $35,000 is a possibility. He wrote:In the near term, traders will likely be watching the $35,000 level for confirmation of where BTC will be headed next. As the price of Bitcoin dropped below $33,500, the previous support level, a panic sell-off ensued. In fact, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index plummeted to ""fear"" for the first time since October after spending months in ""extreme fear.""A pseudonymous trader known as “Kaleo” emphasized that the market sentiment in crypto tends to shift quickly. He said:However, one bullish catalyst for Bitcoin in the near term is the continuous accumulation of BTC by Grayscale. On Jan. 19, the fund added a record 16,244 BTC ($607 million) in one day to its holdings or 18 times the amount of new BTC that's mined per day.  "
588,"VanEck, a major American investment management firm, is making another attempt to launch a digital asset-related exchange-traded fund, or ETF.According to a Jan. 21 filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, VanEck’s new ETF is called the Digital Assets ETF. The new fund would track the price and performance of the Global Digital Assets Equity Index run by its subsidiary MV Index Solutions.According to the document, the new Digital Assets ETF “normally invests” at least 80% of its total assets in securities that comprise the Fund’s benchmark index. The index tracks the performance of the digital assets segment.VanEck elaborated that digital asset companies refer to companies that operate digital asset exchanges, payment gateways, mining operations, software, equipment and technology or services to the digital asset industry, and others. In order to be initially eligible for inclusion in the index, a company must generate at least 50% of its revenues from digital assets projects or projects having the potential to generate such revenues, the filing reads.“Companies with less than 50% of their revenues from the global digital assets segment, including semiconductor and online money transfer companies, may be added to the Index to reach a minimum component number,” VanEck noted.VanEck is famous for being the first company to file for a Bitcoin (BTC) ETF in the United States. After several failed attempts, VanEck filed a new Bitcoin ETF application on Dec. 31, 2020. As reported by Cointelegraph, VanEck is facing a lawsuit from blockchain firm and former-partner SolidX over its latest BTC ETF for alleged plagiarism."
589,"With the Bitcoin (BTC) price dipping below a $29,000 threshold, the investor mood is worsening and the Crypto Fear and Greed index has plunged to October 2020 levels.On Jan. 22, the Crypto Fear and Greed index sharply dropped to a value of 40, moving the market sentiment from “Extreme Greed” to “Fear.” The index dropped to this low for the first time since Oct. 3, 2020, when Bitcoin was trading at around $10,500.Similar to the fear and greed indexes in the traditional markets, the Crypto Fear and Greed index is a tool that measures two of the primary emotions that influence how much investors are willing to buy crypto like Bitcoin. According to Alternative.me, the extreme fear level can be a sign that investors are too worried, which could mean a good buying opportunity. In contrast, when investors are getting too greedy, it could be a sign that the market is due for a correction.Indeed, prior to dropping to 40, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index topped at 95 on Jan. 6, demonstrating that investors turned very greedy amid Bitcoin hitting its all-time highs of $42,000 on Jan. 8. The Bitcoin price subsequently saw a major correction, dipping to as low as $28,750 on Jan. 21.As Bitcoin has been suffering a sharp correction in recent days, more people in the industry have been commenting on the price moves. On Jan. 21, Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at financial services firm Guggenheim, predicted that Bitcoin is poised to drop to $20,000. The exec still believes that Bitcoin will hit $400,000 in the long-term, but not this year.Mike Novogratz, the founder of Galaxy Digital, is confident that Bitcoin will rally again. He tweeted on Jan. 21, “Humans aren’t meant to live in 150% vol environments. That was the tell. When vol recedes will we bottom, base and resume the rally.”At publishing time, the Bitcoin price has slightly rebounded at around $31,000. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is down more than 10% over the past 24 hours but is still up about 30% over the past 30 days, according to Cointelegraph’s Bitcoin price index."
590,"On Jan. 21 the cryptocurrency market experienced an increased wave of selling pressure and within the last hour Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped below the $30,000 mark for the first time since Jan. 4. Now that Bitcoin has lost the $32,000 and $30,000 support, a growing number of analysts are suggesting that the price could retest the $24,000 support. One theory behind the dip suggests that institutional investors viewed Bitcoin as a crowded trade and decided to take profits.As reported by Cointelegraph, Scott Minerd, the Guggenheim’s chief investment officer, recently suggested that the price of Bitcoin has “likely put in a top” for 2021 and could see a “retracement back toward the 20,000 level.”JPMorgan strategists John Normand and Federico Manicardi also warned that investors using BTC “as a portfolio diversifier are putting themselves at risk” as Bitcoin is more of a cyclical asset than a hedge.This note of caution seems to have been well timed given today’s show of volatility. Although sell-offs can be painful for investors who are overleverged, taking a closer look at some of the social activity that occurred during the downside move hints that the current volatility might not be a macro trend change.In private comments with Cointelegraph, TheTIE analyst Erik Saberski noted that during previous dips in Bitcoin price “its market cap dominance did not really change.”Saberski said:The traditional markets continue to be boosted by the prospect of a wide-ranging stimulus package from the Biden administration.The S&P 500 and NASDAQ both etched new all-time highs on Jan. 21 and closed up by 0.03% and 0.82% respectively. The Dow also closed the day with a 0.04% gain.Out of the top-100 coins, the only project with notable gains was CELO, which gained $48.87% and trades at $3.37. Ether (ETH) corrected by 21.28% and Polkadot lost 8%.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $871 billion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 64.3%."
591,"Capital has flooded into crypto investment products in recent weeks, with the value of assets invested into crypto exchange-traded products, or ETPs, increasing by more than 90% in the last 30 days.The spike in the assets under management, or AUM, locked in crypto ETPs was noted in the latest report by Crypto Compare, which estimates that almost $36 billion is now invested in crypto ETPs — a 93.7% increase in one month.Grayscale’s various trusts represent more than 83% of the sector’s total AUM, with the firm’s Bitcoin Trust housing $22.6 billion or 63% of all capital invested in crypto ETPs.Crypto Compare estimates that ETP volumes tripled during January,with aggregate daily volume pushing above $1.5 billion. Grayscale’s products were found to represent 64% of the sector’s volume, driving $972 million in daily trade.Despite Grayscale’s dominant share of trade volume, its products were found to have underperformed the spot markets as the historic premium on Grayscale’s shares fell by 8% during January.Trade volume for crypto Exchange-traded notes, or ETNs, nearly tripled over the month. ETC Group’s BTCE product dominated ETN volumes with nearly $50 million in daily trade — representing more than two-thirds of total ETN volume.WisdomTree’s BTCW/USD was the second-most traded ETN with $7 million in daily volume after its trade activity increased more than 210%, followed by VanEck’s Bitcoin Vectors with $5 million — owing to a nearly 500% jump in volume .Trading in exchange-traded certificates, or ETCs, more than doubled, with XBT Provider’s Bitcoin Tracker Euro and Bitcoin Tracker One products representing more than half of combined ETC volume — driving $45.6 million and $34.9 million in respective daily trade.XBT provider’s Ether-derived products are the next-most popular ETCs, with Ether Tracker One and Ether Tracker Euro pushing $18.2 million and $17.8 million respectively."
592,"In the last 24-hours Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped 14% and tested the $32,000 support for the fifth time this year. Traders probably became even more worried as the price fell to $31,050 but at the time of writing the 4-hour chart suggests that the selling could be slowing down. Currently the shorter-term charts indicate that Bitcoin is still flirting with bearish territory but a number of derivatives indicators and the top traders flow reflect neutral to bullish levels.The last three times Bitcoin price fell below $32,000, an extensive rally of up to 30% followed. Data shows that the top traders at OKEx have been heavily buying the dip and the futures premium has held in an optimistic range.Even though traders are buying this current dip, the sharp $4,200 drop did inflict serious damage on some investors. The move down to $31,270 was followed by $460 million in liquidations at derivatives exchanges. Interestingly, this occurred just as the open interest on BTC futures reached a $13.1 billion all-time high.Today's price action might seem worrisome, but it pales in comparison to the Jan.10 24% crash that wiped out $1.5 billion in long contracts.Veteran traders are more accustomed to Bitcoin's 120% annualized volatility so a 12% price swing isn’t particularly frightening. In fact, top traders and arbitrage deks remained relatively calm during the dip.To understand whether or not Bitcoin is flashing bearish signals, traders can analyze top traders' long-to-short ratio at crypto exchages, the futures premium, and the options skew.Exchange-provided data highlights traders' long-to-short net positioning. By analyzing every client's position on the spot, perpetual and futures contracts, one can obtain a clearer view of whether professional traders are leaning bullish or bearish.With this said, there are occasional discrepancies in the methodologies between different exchanges, so viewers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.OKEx top traders have been adding long positions since Jan. 19, driving the indicator from 0.96 (slightly net short) to a 2.49 ratio which favors longs. This is the highest level in 30 days and indicates an unusually extreme imbalance.On the other hand, top traders at Huobi averaged a 0.91 long-to-short ratio over the last 30 days, favoring net shorts by 9%. On Jan. 20, they added net short positions down to a 0.86 ratio but repurchased them as BTC plunged during the early hours of Jan. 21. Thus, they are back to their monthly average of 0.91 long-to-short.Lastly, Binance top traders averaged a 21% position that favored longs over the past 30 days. These traders seem to be getting liquidated as their net longs were cut to 1.02 from 1.18 since late Jan. 20. According to data from Coinalyze, 40% of total BTC long liquidations over the past 24 hours took place at Binance.Professional traders tend to dominate longer-term futures contracts with set expiry dates. By measuring the expense gap between futures and the regular spot market, a trader can gauge the level of bullishness in the market.The 3-month futures should usually trade with a 6% to 20% annualized premium (basis) versus regular spot exchanges. Whenever this indicator fades or turns negative, this is an alarming red flag. This situation is known as backwardation and indicates that the market is turning bearish.On the other hand, a sustainable basis above 20% signals excessive leverage from buyers, creating the potential for massive liquidations and eventual market crashes.The above chart shows that the indicator ranged from 3.5% to 5.5% since Dec. 13, translating to a moderately bullish 19% annualized basis. Meanwhile, the recent 6.5% peak is equal to a 29% annualized premium, indicating excessive buyers leverage.Although this is not the exact reason for today’s correction, market makers and arbitrage desks know precisely how to play this situation. Pushing the price down would certainly trigger a vast amount of liquidations and it should also be noted that the futures open interest had just reached an all-time high.Currently, the BTC March contracts premium has stabilized near 2.5%, equivalent to a healthy 14% annualized basis.It's important to consider that Bitcoin holds a 60 day volatility of 4.2%. Therefore, these large corrections should be expected.Bitcoin faced a 20% crash and tested sub-$28,000 levels on Jan. 4, and this was followed by a 27% intraday decline on Jan. 11. For those brave enough to buy each of these dips, a recovery of up to 30% followed less than four days later.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

593,"Would Bitcoin and its blockchain be able to handle mainstream adoption as a store of value without requiring second-layer solutions? Genesis Mining’s head of mining operations, Philip Salter, holds a mixed view. ""I think Bitcoin is a good store of value regardless of transaction fees,” Salter told Cointelegraph. “The issue is — the higher the fees are the larger is also the minimum value that can be efficiently transferred.”Bitcoin (BTC) has stood the test of time up to this point, with BTC maintaining its place as the crypto industry’s highest market cap asset for the past 12 years. Bitcoin is seen as more of a store of value than digital cash these days, however, and Salter thinks complications may still arise from this shift in perceptions:“That's why I think that 2nd Layer solutions are a necessity not only for the use of BTC as a currency but also for the long term feasibility of BTC as a store of value,” Salter added. Industry players have worked on layer-two scaling solutions, such as Lightning Network, in an effort to facilitate small transaction capabilities.Salter himself uses Lightning Network solutions for his own Bitcoin endeavors. “I personally upgraded my personal phone wallet to a lightning-only wallet (Phoenix), so that I can even in these crazy times pay with coins quickly and cheaply,” he said. “To anyone who tried to use lightning two years ago and found it confusing, I strongly suggest that you give it another try now that it's far more established and user friendly to use.”Bitcoin’s scaling debate was a focal point of discussion in 2017 and 2018. In September 2020, MicroStrategy said it faced no major issues during one of its BTC accumulations. The firm bought 38,250 BTC using a combination of off-chain and on-chain avenues."
594,"A recent report from CoinMetrics suggests that when a new altseason starts it will play out in a way that is vastly different from the market of 2017-2018. According to the authors of the report, the arrival of institutional investors and their interest in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) has fundamentally shifted the cryptocurrency market landscape. Tokens with real world utility, Layer 2 technology or attractive staking ecosystems will outperform the large cap tokens from pre-2017.Institutional inflows firmly established Bitcoin and Ethereum as the chosen Layer 1 (L1) blockchains and this is reflected in the price action of the market since Dec. 1, 2020. As shown on the chart below, the only L1 coins to outperform BTC and Ether during that period were Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Decred (DCR).Competitor L1 blockchains from previous runs, such as Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), have underperformed compared to BTC and both continue to see their share of the marketcap decrease as the conversation shifts payments capacity to store of value performance.So called ‘Ethereum Killers’ like Tron (TRX) and EOS have failed to live up to their lofty claims and are plagued with concerns regarding block producer collusion and centralized networks.Polkadot is the main stand-out L1 blockchain that has emerged over the past few months and what sets it apart is the team’s decision to facilitate the overall growth and interoperability of the blockchain ecosystem rather than dominate it. This explains why the altcoin has rallied 85% in 2021.Here is where this altseason begins to diverge from the last. Staking, governance tokens, and the integration of DeFi are the primary drivers in this market as users want more involvement in the growth and direction of each project.Decred (DCR) is a perfect example of this emerging trend. Created in the image of Bitcoin with a maximum supply of 21 million tokens, the network combines PoW with PoS to allow all members of the community the opportunity to get involved and earn rewards.A built-in governance mechanism gives token holders a direct say in the future of the project, and the release of the Decred Decentralized Exchange (DCRDEX) on Oct. 21, 2020 triggered the DCR price to rally from 11.68 to a new high of $67.80 on Jan. 8.Cardano is making the case for its value as an L1 blockchain through the implementation of staking and discussions from creator Charles Hoskinson about bringing DeFi to developing countries once smart contract functionality is fully integrated. These developments helped propel a 100% increase in the price of ADA since the beginning of 2020.The DeFi boom has been incredibly attractive to investors who are looking for a more hands on approach to interacting with emerging blockchain projects.The sector is a clear driving force in the market and since Dec.1 Uniswap (UNI), AAVE, Synthetix (SNX), MakerDAO (MKR), SushiSwap (SUSHI), and Curve (CRV) have all outperformed Ether and BTC. Note that they all include staking and governance functionality.Perhaps the 2018 bear market that followed the euphoric 2016 to 2017 rally has created a more discerning investor who wants more say in the development of the project rather than buying into the detail lacking whitepapers and lofty promises of anonymous developers.As can be seen in the chart above, the total value locked in DeFi continues to grow and recently hit an all-time high of $25 billion, a figure larger than the market cap of many of the top projects combined.Cryptocurrencies that offer real world use cases that meet the sector’s demands and the ability to govern project decisions have emerged as the most desirable features for today’s retail investor.Institutions may have chosen Bitcoin and Ether as their preferred investments but the battle for Layer 2 dominance between tokens that function as Ethereum alternatives is clearly where retail investors are placing their attention and this is what will drive the next altseason.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

595,"The unfolding drama surrounding the ownership of the Bitcoin (BTC) whitepaper could very well make its way to the courts, after both sides embroiled in the dispute told Cointelegraph they’re ready to “go all the way.""On Jan. 21, the owners of two Bitcoin websites were threatened with legal action by lawyers representing Craig Wright, the man who claims to be Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. Wright claims to be the original copyright holder of the Bitcoin whitepaper, and demanded that both sites remove their locally hosted copies of the document on threat of legal action.One website, Bitcoincore.org, has since removed the whitepaper, reasoning that becoming entangled in a costly legal battle with the litigation-happy Wright would achieve little, and isn’t a hill worth dying on.However, the owner of Bitcoin.org, which was also targeted by Wright, has so far refused to remove the whitepaper, and said he has no intention of doing so.Speaking exclusively to Cointelegraph, the pseudonymous developer known as Cobra said he’d be willing to defend himself in court should legal proceedings be brought against him.Ed Pownall of CoinGeek, who has spoken on behalf of Craig Wright in the past, told Cointelegraph that Cobra and others who refused to comply had 4 options ahead of them:When presented with this 4-point ultimatum from Wright’s team, Cobra’s response was blunt, appearing to signal a preference for option number 1. He said:Pownall said that should Cobra fail to respond to legal proceedings, Wright’s counsel would be willing to apply to the courts for a default judgement, where a defendant who fails to respond or offer a defence is judged without trial.In 2019, Wright attempted to sue Ethereum (ETH) creator Vitalik Buterin for defamation after Buterin ridiculed Wright’s claim of being Satoshi Nakamoto, calling him a fraud. In this instance, Buterin simply didn’t respond to the letter and the deadline eventually ran out.Wright has previously launched lawsuits against numerous figures in the cryptocurrency space, including Bitcoin podcaster, Peter McCormack, Bitcoin developer, Adam Back, and founder of Bitcoin.com, Roger Ver — all with varying degrees of success."
596,"Ethereum is not the only blockchain platform seeing a significant increase in value as the decentralized finance space continues to move in tandem with the booming cryptocurrency ecosystem. The new year has continued to be good to the DeFi space, evident in the sheer amount of value that has been injected into various platforms.The value staked in DeFi protocols briefly surpassed $27 billion on Jan. 20, according to DappRadar, driven in part by the increase in value of a large majority of cryptocurrency tokens. Nevertheless, the space has seen growing adoption and development in recent months.Ethereum currently holds the mantle as the most popular smart contract blockchain application for developers and projects on which to build and launch apps and platforms. The DeFi space is intrinsically linked with Ethereum in its current state, with a large majority of the biggest DeFi projects and protocols running on its blockchain. Uniswap, the biggest automated market maker according to DeFi Pulse, runs on Ethereum, while the rest of the top 10 DeFi projects listed also operate on the blockchain network.While the growth and success of DeFi platforms have put a strain on the Ethereum network’s ability to process transactions and have increased fees, these platforms have led to an enormous amount of value being locked in the Ethereum ecosystem. With that being said, a couple of Ethereum’s market competitors are enjoying resounding success in early 2021, suggesting that there are more participants pushing the pace in the DeFi space.Polkadot is seen as one of the most prominent rivals to Ethereum. It’s a new-generation blockchain that connects private and public blockchains and networks. The project was started by the Web3 Foundation and hopes to drive interoperability between blockchains to power a decentralized internet of the future.Polkadot essentially operates a multichain protocol using what it calls “parachains,” which allow other blockchains to connect to its network as sidechains. The protocol also has the capacity to handle thousands of transactions per second, which has pitted it against Ethereum in the eyes of some commentators. Polkadot has seen immense growth in 2021, with its DOT token’s price nearly doubling since the start of the new year.Near Protocol is another smart contract blockchain platform that has been growing in popularity since its launch in April 2020. Its native token, NEAR, recently saw a rise of more than 100% in value. The project operates on its own proof-of-stake protocol that uses sharding, which Ethereum is still working toward implementing this year.Cardano, which runs on its own proof-of-stake blockchain, has also seen some growth. Its native token, Ada, moved past Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to become the six-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The platform has yet to roll out functional smart contract capability but is expected to do so this year, which will allow DeFi platforms to be built on the protocol.Chainlink is also featured on this list for its role in the smart contract blockchain and DeFi space. Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that serves as an intermediary providing data to smart contracts on different blockchains. According to the project, Chainlink has become a major tool for the DeFi space, as it provides tamper-proof, high-quality price data to various DeFi protocols.The network’s native token, LINK, moved into the top 10 biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in January as Chainlink continues to enjoy the indirect effects of DeFi’s success.The phrase “The Great Repricing” was thrown around in the DeFi space as the native tokens for popular platforms Synthetix and Aave also moved into the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap early in the new year. Synthetix Network Token (SNX) and AAVE have seen considerable growth in value and have a combined market cap of over $3.5 billion. SNX is the native token of Synthetix, a derivatives liquidity protocol, while Aave is a liquidity protocol that allows users to deposit and borrow various cryptocurrency assets. Both run on the Ethereum blockchain.The DeFi space is clearly a burgeoning sector that has plenty of room for more than one blockchain to power the plethora of applications and offerings that have been developed over the past year. Dan Reecer, head of Polkadot growth at the Web3 Foundation, acknowledged that Ethereum is the incumbent leader in the DeFi space by total value locked.However, that does not mean that users are not willing to try alternatives, according to Reecer: “The surge in DeFi platforms built on blockchains other than Ethereum is absolutely a clear sign that DeFi, crypto, and blockchain in general is becoming multi-chain.” He also stressed that a move to a multichain DeFi ecosystem will become a necessity in the future, considering how centralized, mainstream applications and networks currently operate:Bette Chen, co-founder and chief operating officer of decentralized finance “hub” Acala, told Cointelegraph that the DeFi space is still in its infancy, as an average of just 4,000 to 5,000 addresses are active every day.Nevertheless, Chen believes that the emergence of new smart contract blockchains is a positive development for the DeFi space: “We don’t think in the frames of competition, we’re at the very early stage of a new disruptive technology, we think the multi-chain future that we are evolving into will collectively grow the DeFi space and help mass market adoption.” She went on to add that it will likely be “a hybrid of CeFi and DeFi offerings that help deliver the real values and user experiences to end users.”Pavel Bains, co-founder and CEO of decentralized data hosting project Bluzelle, told Cointelegraph that Ethereum’s dominance might not necessarily be threatened, but its transition to Ethereum 2.0 is becoming increasingly important, as other protocols already offer the capabilities it’s working to incorporate:As Reecer said, competition is always healthy for an industry, and he noted that the cryptocurrency space is no exception. He stressed that Ethereum’s percentage share of TVL, users and developers in the broader ecosystem will depend on the project’s ability to scale and keep pace with its peers, especially sharded, multichain ecosystems: “It’s likely not rational to expect there to be 10-20+ protocols that win out in the end. This decade should see chain mergers and acquisitions, some teams fizzling out, and a handful of FAANG-esque winners emerging for the long haul.”"
597,"The Bitcoin (BTC) bull market has put the flagship cryptocurrency on par with cyclical assets as opposed to a hedge against market stress, according to analysts at JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan strategists John Normand and Federico Manicardi say anyone betting on Bitcoin as a portfolio diversifier is putting themselves at risk. In a Thursday report obtained by Bloomberg, the strategists called Bitcoin the “least reliable hedge during periods of acute market stress.”They added:Cyclical assets typically refer to stocks that follow the trend in the overall economy, which means their performance depends on the business cycle. These companies produce goods and services that are in demand when the economy is performing well. Consequently, these are some of the first items people forego when the economy weakens.Cyclical stocks include companies in the restaurant, hospitality, airline, furniture, automobile and other discretionary industries.While seemingly arguing against Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative, the strategists acknowledged that the cryptocurrency may be suitable for investors worried about policy shocks and the systemic devaluation of fiat currencies.In that vein, their views seem to diverge from fellow JPMorgan strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou who believe that Bitcoin is drawing investors away from precious metals. As Cointelegraph reported last month, Panigirtzoglou and colleagues argue that only a small reallocation from gold to Bitcoin would generate “structural” headwinds for the precious commodity.They said at the time:Against the backdrop of these competing views, Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset. The cryptocurrency more than doubled in price over a three-week period, going from $20,000 to nearly $42,000, before seeing a pullback in bullish momentum earlier this month. It has since corrected roughly $10,000 from its all-time high, including a 20% drop over the past seven days."
598,"From refusing to bank crypto trading desks to closing accounts held by platforms, the mainstream financial sector appears to be putting up roadblocks to seamless cryptocurrency commerce. Without banking support, exchanges are often forced to depend on other fiat on-ramps to service the deposit and withdrawal needs of their customers.The apparent discrimination against crypto exchanges also goes beyond the refusal of banking services. In countries such as South Korea, banks have increased the level of scrutiny involved in renewing operating licenses for platforms. The cost of compliance for these added regulatory provisions has led to several smaller-sized exchanges exiting the country.These crypto-phobic practices by banks often draw from arguments that cryptocurrencies are a conduit for illegal activities. However, actual investigative data from several sources show that there is hardly any truth to the claim that crypto promotes money laundering and terrorist financing.Meanwhile, banks continue to be docked for aiding and abetting criminal organizations. From the United States to Australia, commercial banks are paying huge fines for laundering dirty money for syndicates like the mob and violent drug cartels. Yet a more transparent and trustless system is treated as a villain. But is the tide about to turn?In Australia, one crypto trading desk operator appears determined to call out the alleged discriminatory banking practices by banks against cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Allan Flynn, a Bitcoin exchange owner, has petitioned the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal over alleged discriminatory practices by Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and Westpac, two commercial banks in the country.The exchange owner that services over 450 customers said his business has suffered sudden account closures from 20 banks over the last three years. According to Flynn, both banks shut down his accounts without prior notice.Flynn filed a similar case against banks back in 2020, but the Australian Financial Complaints Authority ruled that Westpac acted in accordance with the bank’s policy. According to Flynn, Westpac offered a settlement of 250 Australian dollars, which is yet to be paid.At the time of writing, ANZ is yet to respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comments. A spokesperson for Westpac did tell Cointelegraph that customer confidentiality policies prevent the bank from commenting about the case.Cointelegraph also reached out to a cross-section of stakeholders in the Australian crypto scene, and the consensus among the respondents was that the banks in question were “habitual deniers of service.” Commenting on whether Australian banks could be described as being “crypto-phobic,” Steve Vallas, CEO of industry body Blockchain Australia, told Cointelegraph:In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Michael Bacina, partner at commercial law firm Piper Alderman — an advisor to major Australian crypto exchanges — described Australian banks as being conservative by nature and thus struggling with the innovation associated with cryptocurrencies. “As a relatively new industry, banks understandably don’t have a significant amount of data to identify transactions of concern and seem to be erring on the side of greater caution,” Bacina said, adding:For Vallas, Blockchain Australia will continue to liaise with the banking sector and financial regulators such as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. “There has been a visible increase in discussion in ASIC, APRA and the Reserve Bank of Australia around the subject matter as understanding within government has grown,” Vallas said, adding: “We are optimistic that the banking sector will take confidence from the Federal Government’s lead in driving initiatives in the sector.”In May 2020, JP Morgan accepted its first crypto exchange customers in Coinbase and Gemini. This move came after a rigorous vetting process owing to the massive regulatory moat around banks in the United States when it comes to onboarding startups.U.S. banks such as JP Morgan were among one of the first fierce critics of Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies in general. Thus, it’s unsurprising to see JP Morgan only onboarding its first crypto exchange clients in 2020.Indeed, major crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Bitfinex have been known to lose important banking relationships in major markets like Europe, the U.S. and the United Kingdom. Between 2017 and 2018, Bitfinex was forced to pause deposits and withdrawals after several banks, including Wells Fargo, severed ties with the company. Bitfinex even sued Wells Fargo, but the case was later dropped. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Barclays and Coinbase also parted ways back in August 2019.In September 2020, crypto exchange Kraken became the first in the U.S. to receive a banking license. As part of its support page, Kraken expressed difficulties in working with some “challenger bank,” stating: “Ironically, most of the issues we’ve seen with funding have been with online-only ‘cloud’ banks. In contrast, traditional banks with physical branches have generally worked fine with our clients.”Indeed, Kraken lists Monzo and Revolut as cloud banks that do not process deposits or withdrawals from Kraken and other crypto exchanges. Oddly, Revolut began offering crypto support back in 2019, expanding its services to all standard users in April 2020.Apart from banks not offering services to exchanges, some crypto traders in the U.K. are reportedly unable to withdraw their profits to their bank accounts. Earlier in January, reports emerged that HSBC had barred customers from making deposits and withdrawals using their bank accounts.Before banning initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency trading in September 2017, China instructed banks not to offer services to crypto exchanges back in 2014. Hong Kong is presently moving toward a full-fledged prohibition on retail crypto trading as part of a sweeping money laundering crackdown.In Asia as a whole, the situation regarding crypto-phobia among banks varies across different nations. Jurisdictions such as Singapore, Japan and South Korea with clear-cut cryptocurrency laws have banks ready to do business with exchanges.However, South Korean banks, in particular, are known for demanding strict compliance with anti-money laundering laws before issuing licenses to crypto exchanges. Banking services renewal that used to be a breeze became a legitimately tougher affair as of July 2019, when South Korean banks reportedly began applying new guidelines by the Financial Action Task Force. Singapore and South Korea appear to be global leaders in complying with FATF crypto travel rule regulations.As part of the revamped crypto regulations in South Korea, platforms must also work with their banking partners to ensure real-name account trading for their users as anonymous cryptocurrency trading is banned in South Korea. This particular rule was codified in the revised bill passed by the country’s National Assembly in March 2020.Like China, India’s government has espoused anti-crypto sentiments on numerous occasions. In April 2018, the Reserve Bank of India banned banks from servicing crypto exchanges, which led to almost two years of legal challenges by several members of the Indian crypto industry.India’s Supreme Court overturned the ban in March 2020, but several crypto exchanges report difficulties in securing bank accounts. Months after the Supreme Court’s verdict, the RBI even issued a statement declaring that there was no rule prohibiting banks from facilitating transactions of crypto firms.Clear-cut crypto regulations are nonexistent in Sub-Saharan Africa despite the huge popularity of digital currencies on the continent. Nigeria accounts for the highest Bitcoin search interest in the world, according to Google Trends.However, crypto investors in Nigeria face challenges in utilizing their bank cards to purchase cryptocurrencies from exchanges. In the first instance, the Central Bank of Nigeria reduced the monthly offshore spending limit on naira debit cards to just $100.Apart from this limitation, banks are also preventing traders from buying crypto with their naira debit cards. According to Osita Nwanisobi, acting director for corporate communications at the CBN, there is no policy prohibiting the use of bank cards for crypto purchases. Responding to Cointelegraph via email, Nwanisobi stated:On the subject of regulations, the senior CBN official revealed that the central bank is studying the ecosystem to determine possible regulations for exchanges and trading desks. Back in September 2020, the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission officially recognized digital assets while promising to establish a regulatory framework for digital tokens.In South Africa, there is significant crypto-phobia among the major banks in the country. In November 2019, First National Bank, one of the “big four” banks in South Africa, closed accounts belonging not just to exchanges but to cryptocurrency businesses in general.In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Richard de Sousa, CEO of crypto exchange AltCoinTrader, bemoaned the discriminatory practices of FNB toward cryptocurrency firms, stating: “They are against crypto and will not bank you if your business works with crypto.”He also stated that Absa, another big four bank in South Africa, has an anti-digital currency stance. He has also taken Absa before a South Africa High Court after the bank reportedly instructed the exchange’s payment gateway to stop offering services to the platform. For de Sousa, Absa’s actions amount to corporate bullying and discrimination.On the other two major banks, the crypto exchange operator pointed to Standard Bank as the only pro-crypto financial institution among the lot. As for Nedbank, de Sousa said that his exchange is the only platform that is a customer of the bank. Farzam Ehsani, CEO of Valr — another South African crypto exchange — told Cointelegraph:Banks such as FNB have cited the lack of regulatory clarity as the reason for not banking crypto exchanges. According to Ehsani, the government is moving toward the establishment of a firm legal framework for cryptocurrency commerce in the country, adding: “The South African regulators are progressive and are in the process of providing a regulatory framework to support legitimate players in the crypto asset class.”At the heart of the apparent crypto discrimination among some banks is the notion that cryptocurrencies are used for illegal activities. Some reports show illicit deals only account for an insignificant proportion of global digital currency transactions. While other facts point to crypto being more transparent and requiring less trust in comparison to the legacy systems.Meanwhile, commercial banks are still the preferred conduit for money laundering and other illegal financial transactions. Recently, authorities in Australia revealed that banks in the country helped funnel about $350 million in dirty money for drug cartels between 2014 and 2017. The likes of Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank have also been slammed with fines for illegal financial dealings."
599,"Sberbank, the largest state-owned bank in Russia, has reportedly filed an application with the Bank of Russia to launch a blockchain platform for its “Sbercoin” stablecoin.Sergey Popov, director of the transaction business at Sberbank, announced the news on Jan. 21 at a local financial event Russian news agency Interfax reports.At “Digital transformation and prospects for regulating the digital economy,” Popov said that Sberbank applied with the central bank in early January, explaining that the registration procedure usually takes no longer than 45 days. As such, the bank may launch its platform and stablecoin by the spring this year, the official said. However, Sberbank is still working out how to tax Sbercoin:Popov reportedly added that Sberbank is “ready to work with such a fiat currency” from a technological standpoint so far. “We have completed an internal testing to see that the solution works,” he said.Sberbank did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.As previously reported, Sberbank broke the news on developing its native Sbercoin token at the end of November, following long-running speculation about these plans. Sberbank’s latest announcement comes shortly after Russia officially adopted its crypto law “On Digital Financial Assets” on Jan. 1, 2021.In late 2020, Anatoly Aksakov, a member of the Russian State Duma, said that the Duma’s Committee on Financial Markets expects Russian crypto issuance to surge after the adoption of the country’s new crypto law."
600,"Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a massive surge in the past two months, in particular, as institutions jumped into the new asset class. The latest is Blackrock,  announcing interest in trading in Bitcoin futures while Grayscale continues to scoop up BTC at an accelerating pace. However, after a massive surge, the asset’s price has to come down for some tests of support as investors take profit. This is the beautiful cyclical nature of supply and demand.BTC/USD is currently in a corrective phase since Bitcoin’s rally became overextended above $40,000. The primary question is how far the correction will go from here or whether the $30,000 level will be strong enough to fend off the bears.The daily chart for Bitcoin shows a tremendous rally in recent months. However, some weaknesses are emerging since the recent high, after which the price corrected by roughly 30%.One of these weaknesses is the continuing lower highs since the recent peak high at $42,000. These lower highs are confluent with weaker bounces from the support area.In this case, the $30,000 area has held before. However, to the concern of the bulls, the bounces from this area are getting weaker.If the $30,000 area doesn’t hold, a further correction toward $24,000 becomes likely, which would mean a retrace of 40% since the recent highs.This weekly chart shows the previous bull cycle from 2015 to 2017 highlighting some corrective phases.First and foremost, the 21-week MA (the orange line) is an important indicator for the bull cycle to continue. As long as the price of Bitcoin sustains above this 21-Week MA, the bull cycle is ongoing.Traders and investors should be aware of the fact that nothing goes up in a straight line. Corrections are healthy and organic for the markets to occur and could be used as an opportunity to buy the dip.The second important thing to note in this chart is the magnitude of the corrections. During the previous bull cycle, there were multiple corrections of 30-40%that were quickly bought up before the bull cycle continued.It is worth noting that altcoins could see more downside as they are less liquid and hence, always more volatile than Bitcoin.Therefore, the ultimate end of the correction could occur toward the 21-week MA. This indicator is currently moving around the previous all-time high at $20,000. However, it’s a lagging indicator, and corrections don’t happen within one week, meaning the 21-week MA would continue to go even higher in the meantime.One possible scenario is the 21-week MA moving around the $24,000-26,000 in a few weeks from now. Such a correction would also be 30-40%.The total market capitalization chart is a great chart to watch during corrections.While the likelihood that Bitcoin will retest its previous all-time high is very small. However, the likelihood that the total market capitalization will test its previous all-time high is significant.This retest would put the 21-week MA of the total market cap chart around the level of $750 billion, an important confluence with the 2018 all-time high. Therefore, investors and traders should be watching the $750 billion zone as crucial support for a potential bounce in the cryptocurrency market.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

601,"Older generations have started recognizing the potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain in global payment systems, a new survey says.On Jan. 21, digital payment platform Wirex released a special report devoted to the topic of cryptocurrency adoption in 2021. Compiled in partnership with the Stellar Development Foundation, the report includes survey results from 3,834 people across 89 countries, aiming to understand the latest trends in the global adoption of blockchain-powered digital payments.The survey was conducted over the course of three weeks, with both Wirex and the SDF sending out emails asking for voluntary participation in a survey related to the use of cross-border transactions. Total responses included 81% European residents and 17% participants from the Asia Pacific region.As part of the report, Wirex and SDF emphasized that age is “no barrier to adopting blockchain technology,” discovering that there is a sufficient appetite for the benefits of blockchain across all age groups. Nearly 60% of all survey participants were aged 45 or older, with many experimenting with blockchain-powered payments.According to the survey results, more than 30% of respondents between the ages of 45 and 54 — the largest survey’s age group — were using crypto. The study also found that 26% of women aged from 55 to 64 invested in crypto, compared to 14% of men in the same age group.Consumers are more likely to consider digital assets as an alternative to traditional money transfer services if they send higher amounts of up to $1,000, the report notes. Additionally, the survey found that 86% of respondents felt safe using cryptocurrency.Other firms have also noticed a trend of older generations moving into Bitcoin. In June 2020, British crypto trading app Mode reported that Baby Boomers and Generation-X investors increased their monthly crypto investments by a factor of nine amid the COVID-19 pandemic."
602,"Little by little, cryptocurrencies are becoming a bigger part of the financial ecosystem. Mainstream platforms such as PayPal are allowing users to buy and sell digital assets, Bitcoin is attracting favorable column inches in newspapers, and countries are unveiling regulatory frameworks that allow virtual currencies to thrive.But one startup argues that there’s a major hurdle that’s yet to be meaningfully addressed: Giving crypto enthusiasts a trusted marketplace where they can spend their coins freely. DeFi For You says it is building an e-commerce platform that’s based on the Binance Smart Chain where goods can be bought, sold, rented and even pawned. The company’s founders believe the crypto space needs to build its own ecosystem where merchants and shoppers can transact, rather than wait for the likes of Amazon to wade into the space.Whereas pawn shops have attracted a rather shady reputation in some parts of the world over recent years, DeFi For You believes this centuries-old approach to finance is a largely untapped market that could bolster levels of financial inclusion dramatically. According to DeFi For You’s founders, the pawnbroking market is worth $14.5 billion in the U.S. alone — and $400 billion in South East Asia. But until now, this concept has struggled to make the leap into the online world because it has been impossible to achieve without smart contracts.Through DeFi For You’s platform, users will be able to open their own pawn shops and lend money to people around the world while holding collateral in exchange. In a true form of decentralized finance, executives say this will enable consumers to become their own bank. Lenders and borrowers can determine the terms of any loan directly, with all this information stored in an irrefutable smart contract.In time, DeFi For You believes that this could enable billions of people who have been shut out from mainstream financial services to access loans in an easy way. To reduce the risk of someone defaulting on their obligations, it will be possible to verify the reputation of each user on the blockchain — offering a more modern alternative to old-fashioned credit scores.The conditions offered for loans will depend on a lender’s reputation and the type of collateral they are willing to offer, with preferential terms offered to those who have a strong track record.Those behind the project are building their infrastructure on the Binance Smart Chain, and a BEP20 smart contract token known as DFY is being created.Although BSC is less decentralized than Ethereum, DeFi For You’s founders said they were drawn to this blockchain because of how it delivers quicker transaction fees and lower costs, with a block time of between three and five seconds.Apps are going to be available on Apple’s App Store and via Google Play soon, putting the platform at the fingertips of anyone who owns an Android device or an iPhone.DeFi For You was founded by Adam C. Chaplin, who was also one of the co-founders of the crypto-friendly travel site Travala.com.In its white paper, the project explains that its goal is to make the global credit system much more inclusive than it is at present — and injecting some much-needed competition into the lending sector. “We believe access to credit is one of the most important tickets to success today,” the team added.Disclaimer.

603,"100x Group, BitMEX’s parent company and the holding structure for its platform, has joined Global Digital Finance, or GDF, a major industry association advocating for the adoption of digital assets. As a GDF patron board member, 100x will advocate for a more inclusive and better regulated digital financial system, BitMEX announced on Jan. 21.The new partnership with GDF extends 100x’s efforts to promote collaboration between the public and private sectors to drive mainstream adoption of crypto. “Greater public-private collaboration is the only way to realise the wide-scale adoption of digital assets and we will be championing an advance in industry-wide operational standards and governance,” 100x Group CEO Alexander Höptner said.GDF was launched in March 2018 with a mission to convene both the crypto assets industry and financial services professionals and regulators to build an efficient and transparent ecosystem for each type of digital asset. The association has so far secured a number of high-profile members from the industry including Coinbase, ConsenSys and Huobi. Malcolm Wright, 100x’s chief compliance officer, joined the GDF previously in 2018, and is a chair of its advisory council and co-chair of the GDF Anti-Money Laundering working group.100x’s entrance into GDF comes amid an ongoing legal action brought against BitMEX by the United States securities regulators. In late 2020, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed civil complaints against the firm, accusing BitMEX of offering unregistered derivatives sales to U.S. retail investors. BitMEX is now expected to provide a response to the CFTC’s complaint by Feb. 12, 2021.BitMEX has been struggling to boost its regulatory and compliance efforts since the action was brought. On Jan. 12, the company announced a new collaboration with blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis to “identify, investigate, and stop illicit transactions.” Earlier in January, BitMEX claimed that its entire user base completed the obligatory Know Your Customer checks."
604,"Craig Wright, the Australian computer scientist who claims to be Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto, has threatened legal action against the owners of two Bitcoin (BTC) websites whom he accused of stealing his whitepaper and other intellectual property.As announced on Jan. 21, Bitcoin.org along with another website, Bitcoincore.org, had received allegations of copyright infringement from Craig Wright’s lawyers. The counsel reportedly claimed that Wright, as Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto, was the legal copyright holder of the Bitcoin whitepaper, that he owned the Bitcoin name and trademark, as well as the two websites listed above. The announcement stated:The announcement continues, “They also claim he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, and the original owner of bitcoin.org. Bitcoin.org and Bitcoincore.org were both asked to take down the whitepaper. We believe these claims are without merit, and refuse to do so.”But while the owner of Bitcoin.org (a pseudonymous developer known as Cobra) has stated his refusal to be intimidated by the threat of what they’ve called “false allegations”, the owner of Bitcoincore.org has already thrown in the towel.According to Cobra, their co-accused over at Bitcoincore.org acquiesced to the requests of Craig Wright’s lawyers almost immediately. Cobra’s announcement stated:Cobra said the local copy of the whitepaper hosted on Bitcoincore.org was removed within less than two hours, adding a link to the Github modification which shows the change was made:All references to the Bitcoin whitepaper have apparently been removed from the Bitcoincore.org website. Cobra declared that this act of self-censorship would only lend credence to the notion that Craig Wright’s claims were legitimate:However, the owner of Bitcoincore.org, and current maintainer of the Bitcoin code, Wladimir J. van der Laan (@orionwl on Twitter), responded quickly, telling his Twitter audience that this issue was not a hill worth dying on:Craig Wright has brought several lawsuits against various figures in the cryptocurrency space for in some way refuting the notion that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, and the true proprietor of Bitcoin. None of the cases have been settled in his favor thus far.Van der Laan appeared to suggest that the easiest course of action was to play ball with Wright’s lawyers, adding that his focus remained on the Bitcoin system itself. He tweeted:Cobra ended his announcement on Bitcoin.org by reiterating the open-source status of the MIT license under which Bitcoin and its whitepaper were published, stating:Cobra said the Bitcoin whitepaper will continue to be hosted on Bitcoin.org, and that they hoped other websites would follow suit in resisting Craig Wright’s attempts at intimidation."
605,"The coronavirus pandemic has shaken up the world of work — igniting an entrepreneurial spirit in the hearts of thousands. A recent article in The Wall Street Journal claimed that applications for new U.S. businesses have been rising at the fastest rate since 2007.But one crypto-focused company says aspiring business owners face a big problem: The current solutions for getting their ideas off the ground are slow, expensive and centralized. Ideaology’s goal is to bring everything that a budding entrepreneur would need under one roof — and the organization has the ambitious target of reaching 100,000 people this year.It all begins when someone realizes that they have a great idea. The challenge now is getting the support they need — and building a team who can bring a vision to fruition. ActiveIDEA.com does this by enabling entrepreneurs to find the perfect employees, and even secure a partner who shares their goals.Ideaology’s dedicated creative market also makes it far easier to acquire crucial services, such as code, templates and tutorials. This thriving part of the ecosystem also encourages collaboration with other members of the community. And better still, entrepreneurs also have an opportunity to apply for crowdfunding by pitching their ideas to pools of investors.Users don’t need to have their own business idea to get involved. As freelancing goes from a fringe activity to a popular way of making a living, Ideaology gives talented individuals the opportunity to apply for part-time positions across the many projects under development. Crucially, this site offers far fairer employment terms than rival platforms, meaning they’ll end up keeping more of the cash they earn.An ERC-20 token called IDEA is a central part of this proposition. As well as serving as a payment method for the goods and services sold through this community, it also unlocks discounts on fees and the opportunity to vote on which crowdfunding projects should be supported next. The organization’s blockchain-driven platform also offers a secure crypto wallet where these tokens can be stored safely.IDEA is being sold on the Bitcoin.com exchange this month, and Ideaology’s co-founder and CEO, Khaled Alkalbani, says this is a crucial step. He added: “With Ideaology’s Active IDEA platform in the final stages of development, we feel the demand to list IDEA coin on one of the world’s leading exchanges in terms of popularity and traffic volume is the best strategy for our IEO. As a modern and innovative exchange, we believe Bitcoin.com can provide the marketing capabilities that IDEA needs to reach beyond our current estimated number of potential users.”The gig economy was becoming a major trend even before the coronavirus pandemic, with data suggesting that one in three Americans were already operating in a freelance capacity. Globally, this means that there is a big opportunity to create lasting connections between businesses and skilled workers.One problem that Ideaology is hoping to tackle centers on the experience of using mainstream sites such as Upwork and Fiverr. The company says it has received reports that freelancers struggle to showcase all of their skills — in part because of a lack of space on their profiles. In some cases, startups can also be wary because of how some of these accounts aren’t verified.Ideaology originates from the United Arab Emirates, and now has a team of 20 people based around the world. The company prides itself on being built using the very model it is now promoting — with employees who work remotely.The second round of the initial exchange offering for IDEA tokens begins on Jan. 26, 2021 and will last for 10 days.Disclaimer.

606,"A senior executive at financial services firm Guggenheim Partners — which is planning to seek investment exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) — has argued that BTC is poised to drop to $20,000.Scott Minerd, Guggenheim’s chief investment officer, believes that Bitcoin will not hit another all-time high in 2021, according to a Jan. 21 episode of CNBC's Closing Bell.After hitting $42,000 price level on Jan. 8, Bitcoin is unlikely to climb any higher until 2022, Minerd said:Despite Minerd’s bearish short-term Bitcoin prediction, the CIO apparently still maintains a stance that one bitcoin will be worth as much as $400,000 one day. In late 2020, when Bitcoin was on its way to cross its new ATHs, the CIO called for a $400,000 long-term price target for Bitcoin. He subsequently went bearish on BTC in the short term, claiming that ""Bitcoin's parabolic rise is unsustainable in the near term"" on Jan. 10.Some in the crypto community have gotten mixed signals from Minerd’s varying predictions. One Twitter user juxtaposed two separate headlines with Minerd's comments on the Bitcoin price:The Guggenheim CIO Scott Minerd ladies and gentlemen. I will just leave this here, draw your own conclusions#Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/TSrtF759mMGuggenheim Partners moved into the crypto industry in late 2020 after the company filed an application with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to “seek investment exposure to Bitcoin through Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust product.Minerd’s bearish Bitcoin prediction comes amid another negative Bitcoin correction, with BTC dipping below $34,000 on Jan. 20. As Cointelegraph reported, the selling pressure on Bitcoin mostly came from Asia in the first two weeks of January, while the United States market also started to see weakness amid a correction on Jan. 19.At publishing time, Bitcoin is trading at $32,997, down over 5% over the past seven days but still up about 45% over the past 30 days, according to Cointelegraph’s Bitcoin price index."
607,"Bitcoin (BTC) slid under $33,000 for the first time in over a week on Jan. 21 as selling pressure gathered to drive price action lower.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView showed BTC/USD continuing its downtrend on Thursday, dropping 7.% on the day and failing to bounce off $33,000 support.The latest move, which brings Bitcoin down over 13% versus its highs from Tuesday, came amid increased selling at Coinbase Pro, the professional trading arm of United States cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.As Cointelegraph reported, major spikes in volume at Coinbase Pro had accompanied price volatility in recent weeks. This time, it was a dip in the so-called ""Coinbase Premium"" which signalled selling was underway — the difference in price between the BTC/USD pair at the venue and others suddenly decreased.""It seems $BTC sellers came from #Coinbase. Coinbase Premium Index has been a negative value since an hour ago,"" Ki Young Ju, CEO of on-chain analytics resource CryptoQuant, summarized on Twitter uploading the accompanying chart.A day earlier, Ki had highlighted a corresponding increase in deposits across exchanges from whales, indicating a potential desire to trade or sell BTC at prices at or below the mid-range of its trading corridor between $30,000 and $40,000.Another trend since Bitcoin began ascending to new all-time highs was a transfer of wealth from small investors to whales, the latter buying up the supply during every price retracement.Despite the sell-off, it was buyers hitting the headlines this week, chief among the investment giant Grayscale, which fixed its biggest-ever one-day BTC purchase worth more than $600 million. In the 24 hours to the end of Wednesday, the company increased its balance by a further 8,000 BTC — far more than the supply being added to the market by miners.At a virtual conference this week, CEO Michael Sonnenshein outlined nation state adoption of digital assets and increased interest from financial advisers as two of the major trends which believes will characterize 2021."
608,"The website of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, is no longer formally blacklisted in Russia, according to a new court ruling.According to a Jan. 21 report by Russian news agency Kommersant, the Arkhangelsk Regional Court has annulled a previous decision to blacklist the Binance website in Russia. Gleb Kostarev, Binance’s head of operations for Russia and the CIS, confirmed the news to Cointelegraph, stating that the court hearing took place on Jan. 20.The latest court decision reverts a previous ruling made in 2020. In September, Binance announced that its website came on the list of prohibited websites by Russian telecom regulator Roskomnadzor. The regulator blacklisted the website based on a court decision charging the site for disseminating prohibited information. Despite the block, the website was still available in Russia without additional access tools like VPNs.At publishing time, the Binance website still appears on Roskomnadzor’s list of prohibited sites, but access is not restricted.Kostarev said that Binance is still waiting for the court documents on the latest decision, which the company expects to receive in the next two weeks. “After getting a document we will send a notification to remove us from the list,” he said.The executive also said that the blacklisting has not impacted Binance’s trading volumes in the Russian market. “Though the September ban had no impact on our volumes in Russia, for us it was important to protect our reputation and appeal in this case,” Kostarev stated.The blacklist reversal comes shortly after Russia officially adopted its major crypto law “On Digital Financial Assets” on Jan. 1, 2021. In August 2020, Roskomnadzor banned another major cryptocurrency website in Russia, BestChange.ru."
609,"BitMEX Research has identified a suspected double-spend transaction valued at 0.00062063 BTC or roughly $21 — and it doesn’t appear to be an instance of that popular replace-by-fee wallet hack.On Jan. 20, BitMEX’s ForkMonitor noted that “multiple blocks were produced at height 666833.” BitMEX Research tweeted:One hour later, BitMEX Research attributed the orphaned block to an RBF transaction, which is where an unconfirmed transaction is replaced with a new transfer paying a higher fee. However, ForkMonitor has since updated its advice to say: “No (RBF) bumps have been detected.”Twitter-user and BSV’s Australian advocate Eli Afram noted the “mixed messages” from BitMEX Research, asserting the double-spent transaction should be cause for concern despite its small value:Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin Whitepaper is credited with having solved the double-spend problem in 2009. The challenge of ensuring that a decentralized network can autonomously verify that the same coins have not been transferred more than once had stymied earlier attempts at digital cash. In July, crypto security firm ZenGo identified a double-spend exploit targeting several popular Bitcoin wallets. While the wallet manufacturers moved to address the exploit, Bitcoin Cash proponent Hayden Otto warned the vulnerability may be inherent to BTC’s replace-by-fee functionality. He’d earlier exploited the same vulnerability in a viral video.Update: The headline to this article has been updated to note that BitMEX Research suspected a double spend. Subsequent analysis has determined that their suspicions were incorrect."
610,"Despite surging prices, Bitcoin investors are rapidly locking up their BTC for the long-term, with 270,000 BTC being taken out of liquid supply in the last 30 days.According to data published by crypto market data aggregator Glassnode, “liquid” Bitcoin wallets have shed 270,000 BTC over the past month, up from 175,000 Bitcoin at the start of January.The data shows that Bitcoin’s (BTC) liquid supply has consistently fallen over the last nine months, with liquid supply currently sitting at 21.3% and showing no signs of reversing.Bitcoin’s increasingly illiquid supply could be bullish for its price, with new retail and institutional traders vying for an increasingly diminishing supply. Glassnode estimates that nearly 80% of the 18.6 million circulating Bitcoin are currently stored in “illiquid” wallets.According to Glassnode, a Bitcoin wallet is considered illiquid if less than 25% of the Bitcoin received has been transferred out across the entity’s life. In contrast, to be deemed highly liquid, the majority of Bitcoin must be transferred back into circulation, with less than 25% of the inflows held onto.Of the 3.9 million BTC Glassnode describes as being highly liquid, 61% or 2.38 million is held by centralized exchanges. Their balances have also been dropping, with data from analytics firm CryptoQuant indicating exchanges’ reserves have shrunk by 13.8% since July.Increasing institutional investment may be a significant force driving the depletion of Bitcoin’s liquid supply, with wallet tracking service Bitcoin Treasuries currently estimates that 33 institutional entities have accumulated more than 1.2 million BTC or 6.5% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply.In the last few days, Grayscale has increased its holdings by approximately 25,000 BTC with a portfolio of 641,523.7 BTC as of January 20, 2021. To put this in perspective, approximately 900 Bitcoin are minted each day. According to Glassnode, however, on average only one-third of those are actually being sent to exchanges since July 2020.Data from Investment firm SwissBorg shows that in the second half of 2020, institutional investors purchased on average more than 230% of the newly minted BTC. Adding in the purchases from PayPal and Square (along with the estimated amount of Bitcoin lost each day) demand could be running as high as 500% of the new supply.Earlier today, the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock filed with the SEC, listing Bitcoin Derivatives as a possible investment. The firm entered 2021 with $7.81 trillion in assets under management, more than seven times crypto’s entire market cap."
611,"A new report from crypto fund provider CoinShares has indicated that some institutional investors have been realizing profits during BTC’s recent consolidation.CoinShares’ weekly digital asset flows report identifies $85 million in outflows from institutional crypto products this past week, asserting the data suggests “some investors are continuing to take profits after [BTC’s] strong price appreciation.”The report noted the rising (trade-weighted) U.S. dollar, stating the USD index “is typically inversely correlated to Bitcoin prices,” and could explain why some investors are taking profits at the current levels.The firm also identified modest outflows from Ethereum-derived investment products, with $3 million leaving the markets.Despite the profit-taking, institutional inflows remain strong, with $359 million flooded into crypto investment products this week. Institutions still appear almost single-mindedly focused on BTC, with Bitcoin products representing all but 1% of the week’s total capital flows.CoinShares notes that crypto inflows have returned to their pre-Christmas levels, following the 97% drop over three weeks seen after the holiday break. Daily volumes are currently up more than 450% year-over-year.Institutional products currently represent 6% of combined Bitcoin volume — down from 14% at the start of the month.Much has been lately of the growing institutional appetites for crypto, with major global companies recently filling their treasuries with BTC.After hosting more than 11 million BTC worth of futures trade in 2020, Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced last month that it plans to launch cash-settled Ethereum futures contracts in early February, pending regulatory approval.On Jan. 20, Ninepoint Partners filed its final prospectus for a Bitcoin Trust conditionally approved by the Toronto Stock Exchange."
612,"Bitcoin price is finding soft support at $35,000 after dropping 7.4% in the later hours of Jan. 19.According to Cointelegraph contributor Joseph Young, the correction was primarily the result of an overheated derivatives market and uncertainty over whether BTC can recapture the $40,000 level. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows that the price of Bitcoin (BTC) fell as low as $33,400 before recovering to the $35,000 level. Not all is lost for the top cryptocurrency though, as news BlackRock, a multi-trillion-dollar asset manager, had submitted filings to the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission that mention the possibility of using Bitcoin derivatives and other assets as part of its investment scheme.According to Decentrader analyst filbfilb, Bitcoin could be “trapped in consolidation between $30,000 and $38,000,” with a lot of buy orders currently “stacked between $30,000 and $33,000.”According to filbfilb’s analysis:The analyst went on to say that a further drop is not expected and a longer consolidation is more likely. Filbfilb also noted that new Tether (USDT) output had recently been on hold but new money was released on Jan. 20 following a request from iFinex Inc for a 30-day extension to produce trial documents for the New York Attorney General.The traditional markets saw a surge in optimism on Jan. 20 as the U.S. swore in Joseph R. Biden as the 46th President.The S&P 500, NASDAQ and Dow all finished the trading day off in the green, up 1.39%, 2.31% and 0.83% respectively. The S&P 500 and NASDAQ also reached new all-time highs during the course of the trading day.While the majority of cryptocurrencies are posting losses, Polkadot (DOT) resumed its uptrend by rallying 5.04%. The only other top 30 cryptocurrency that posted notable gains is VeChain (VET), which is up 11.47%.Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) has also displayied a stand-out performance, surging 44% overnight and currently trading around $0.0984. REN also broke out today, gaining 15.94% in the past 24-hours.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $995.5 billion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 64.8%."
613,"When an asset is in an overbought condition and traders are sitting on large profits, even minor negative news and events could trigger profit-booking. This seems to have happened following Janet Yellen’s adverse comments on cryptocurrencies during a virtual hearing with the U.S. Senate Finance Committee.In the same meeting, Yellen also told Congress to “act big” in order to support the U.S. economy. Another round of stimulus would probably further weaken the U.S. dollar and drive investors into assets that are considered as a store of value. This means Yellen's comments may have inadvertently boosted the sentiment surrounding gold and Bitcoin (BTC).As the fundamental factors supporting the current bull run are still intact, the institutional investors who had missed out on the rally at lower levels may use the current dip to build positions.Glassnode data shows that large investors have been aggressively adding Bitcoin to their portfolios and the number of wallets holding over 1,000 Bitcoin has risen to a new all-time high. Since the start of 2021, 164 new wallets with over 1,000 Bitcoin have been created, indicating that whales are bullish despite the current BTC price correction.Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot the critical support levels where buyers may start cherry-picking.Bitcoin has broken below the symmetrical triangle pattern but the bulls are currently attempting to defend the 20-day exponential moving average ($34,626). In an uptrend, traders buy the dip to the 20-day EMA as it offers a low-risk entry opportunity and a bounce off it reiterates the strength in the trend.The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the relative strength index (RSI) has gradually dropped from the deeply overbought territory to the midpoint, which suggests a balance between supply and demand.If the BTC/USD pair sustains below the 20-day EMA, it could drop to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $29,688.10. The bulls are likely to defend this support aggressively. If they succeed, this level may act as the support of the range while $40,000 could act as the resistance.The positive view could be negated if the bears sink the price below the 50-day simple moving average ($27,596). Such a move could open the possibility of a fall to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $22,106.73.Ether (ETH) rallied to a new all-time high on Jan. 19, indicating that the bulls are in command. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.Usually, after every breakout from a resistance, the price returns to retest the level. The same has happened in the ETH/USD pair where the bulls are trying to flip $1,300 into support. If they succeed, this level will act as a new floor.The long tail on today’s candlestick suggests traders are buying on dips below $1,300. If they manage to close the price above $1,300, the pair may attempt to resume the uptrend. If the bulls push the price above $1,438.318, the pair could rally to $1,675.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair sinks and sustains below $1,300, the next drop is likely to be the 20-day EMA ($1,129). A bounce off this support will suggest the sentiment remains bullish, but if the bears sink the pair below the 20-day EMA a short-term top may be in place.After the sharp rally of the past few days, Polkadot (DOT) has entered a minor correction. The altcoin had today dipped to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $14.7259, which is acting as a strong support.The long tail on today’s candlestick shows that traders are not waiting for a deeper correction to buy as they anticipate higher levels in the future. If the bulls can push the price above $19.40, the uptrend could resume with the next target objective at $24 and then $30.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below $14.7259, the selling may intensify and the pair could drop to the 50% retracement level at $13.2821 and then to the 20-day EMA ($12.32).If the pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the uptrend remains intact but if this support cracks, the decline could extend to $11.8383. The deeper the correction, the longer it is likely to take for the uptrend to resume.XRP rose above the 20-day EMA ($0.297) on Jan. 19 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels, indicating traders are offloading their positions on every minor attempt to rally.The price action of the past few days has formed a descending triangle pattern. If the bears sink the price below the $0.25 support, the XRP/USD pair could drop to the critical support at $0.169. A break below this level could resume the downtrend with the next target objective at $0.10.On the other hand, if the bulls defend the $0.25 support and push the price above the downtrend line, the pair may rise to $0.385 and stay range-bound between these two levels for a few more days. A new uptrend could begin on a breakout and close above $0.385.Cardano (ADA) has pulled back from the stiff overhead resistance at $0.40, which shows short-term traders may be booking profits. The shallow correction and the long tail on the day’s candlestick show the bulls are attempting to flip the previous resistance at $0.34 into support.If they succeed, the bulls will make one more attempt to thrust the ADA/USD pair above the $0.40 resistance and resume the uptrend. If they manage to do that, the next stop could be the psychological resistance at $0.50.The upsloping moving averages suggest the trend remains in favor of the bulls but the negative divergence on the RSI indicates the momentum may be weakening. If the price sustains below $0.34, a drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.30) is likely.A strong rebound off this support will indicate the uptrend remains intact but a break below it will suggest the possibility of a deeper correction to $0.26.The bulls pushed Litecoin (LTC) above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $157.6904 on Jan. 19 but could not sustain the higher levels due to the bear onslaught, as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick.If the bears can sustain the price below the 20-day EMA ($145), the LTC/USD pair could drop to $130 and then to $120. This is an important support to watch out for because a break below it could signal the bears are back in the game.The flat 20-day EMA and the RSI close to the midpoint suggests a balance between supply and demand. This could keep the pair range-bound between $130 and $160. On the upside, a breakout and close above $160 may resume the uptrend.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) broke above the $539 resistance on Jan. 19, but the long wick on the day’s candlestick suggests the bears had other plans as they sold aggressively, trapping the bulls who may have purchased the breakout.The BCH/USD pair dipped to the uptrend line but the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests the bulls aggressively defended this support. If the bulls can push the price above $539, a rally to $630 is possible.On the contrary, if the pair breaks below the uptrend line, it will suggest the bears have overpowered the bulls. This will signal a possible trend change and the pair could then drop to the next critical support at $370.Chainlink (LINK) is currently correcting the sharp up-move of the past few days. Aggressive profit-booking by traders had pulled the price below $20.1111, but the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests strong buying at lower levels.Both upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest bulls have the upper hand. If the LINK/USD pair rebounds off the current levels, the bulls will try to push the price above $23.767 and resume the uptrend. The next level to watch on the upside is $27 and then $30.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sustain the price below $20.1111, the pair may drop to $17.7777, which is just above the 20-day EMA ($17.58). If the pair rebounds off this level and rises above $20.1111, the bulls will try to resume the uptrend.This positive view will invalidate if the selling breaks the 20-day EMA support. Such a move will indicate the bulls are not buying the dips anymore, signaling a change in sentiment.Stellar Lumens (XLM) continues to trade inside the $0.26 to $0.325 range. The bulls tried to push the price above the range on Jan. 19 but failed, which shows the bears are active at higher levels.The sellers will now try to sink the XLM/USD pair below the support of the range, but they are likely to encounter strong buying from the bulls. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest the bulls are unlikely to give up easily.A strong rebound off the 20-day EMA ($0.263) could extend the consolidation by a few more days. Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the $0.26 support, the selling could intensify and that may pull the pair down to the 50-day SMA ($0.201).Binance Coin (BNB) tried to resume the uptrend on Jan. 18 and 19 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. Aggressive profit-booking on Jan. 19 started a correction that has reached the 20-day EMA ($40.99).If the bears can sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, the BNB/USD pair may drop to the support line of the ascending broadening wedge pattern. The bulls will attempt to defend this support and if they succeed, the pair may extend its stay inside the pattern.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the support line, it will complete the bearish setup, which has a target objective at $26.7273. But the pair is unlikely to plunge to the target level in a hurry because the bulls could offer strong support at $35.69.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

614,"BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, could be preparing its entry into the Bitcoin (BTC) derivatives market, according to a pair of filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. The two prospectus filings — BlackRock Funds V and BlackRock Global Allcoation Fund, Inc. — appeared on the SEC website on Wednesday. Both filings mention the possibility of using Bitcoin derivatives and other assets as part of its investment scheme. However, neither filing makes a definitive statement about the use of Bitcoin futures now or in the future.The prospectus states:BlackRock also cited Bitcoin when referring to the various risk factors for derivatives. In Bitcoin’s case, the digital asset may induce illiquidity risk:BlackRock’s executive brass has spoken positively about Bitcoin in recent months, mirroring a broader shift in institutional sentiment towards digital assets. In November, CIO Rick Rieder said Bitcoin has the potential to “take the place of gold to a large extent.”Larry Fink, BlackRock’s CEO, says Bitcoin has caught his attention and could possibly evolve into a global market.As Cointelegraph reported last month, BlackRock is looking to hire a blockchain VP with experience in crypto assets. The person hired for the role will be tasked with implementing strategies “designed to drive demand for the firm’s offerings.”"
615,"Since then, the price of Bitcoin has suffered a correction, and most of the crypto market followed. Bitcoin is currently sitting at just over $35,000, and while traders suggest the pullback to be a healthy correction required for Bitcoin to maintain its bullish momentum, some believe the cryptocurrency may plunge below the $20,000.The Bitcoin price action has also been reflected in the altcoin market as it usually does, with many popular cryptocurrencies surging alongside BTC. Noticeably, Ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum platform, has doubled in value in the last month and is currently sitting at over $1,300.While Bitcoin has blasted through its previous all-time high, multiple coins in the top 100 have yet to do so despite seeing substantial price surges. This may suggest that a new alt-season may be coming, especially as multiple DeFi tokens break into the top 20 market cap even as the direction of Bitcoin’s price remains uncertain. Jonathan Hobbs, the author of The Crypto Portfolio and a former digital asset fund manager, told Cointelegraph:While the latest crypto rally has taken the global cryptocurrency market capitalization to the $1-trillion mark, there have been a few notable cryptocurrencies that have failed to keep up with Bitcoin’s growth for different reasons.After some bullish action in November, XRP’s price began to drop heavily on Dec. 22, following reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was preparing to take legal action against Ripple, its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, and co-founder Christian Larsen. Since the company has overcome other issues with regulators in the past, many hoped that the news would not amount to anything.However, by Dec. 23, XRP had plummeted by 41%, and exchanges began delisting the cryptocurrency. By the end of December, XRP was delisted from major exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance US and OKCoin, with a few exceptions like Uphold and GateHub leaving the crypto for trading until the court decision. Currently sitting at $0.28, XRP has dropped around 47% in the last 30 days.As Bitcoin rallied throughout the month of December and January, Ether has rallied alongside it. Since Dec. 18, Ether has grown substantially, although so far, it has barely managed to reach its all-time high. However, other smart contract-centric projects have failed to follow along even with Ether’s rally. These include NEM, EOS and Tron, which are all in the top 30 for the biggest monthly value losers in the top 100 cryptocurrency list by market cap.While NEM has lost 21.6% of its value in the last 30 days, it did so after a considerable price increase during the month of November. EOS and Tron prices have dropped 11.6% and 2.69%, respectively. Both Block.one, the company behind the EOSIO ecosystem, and Tron have faced issues with regulation in the past, with the former receiving a $24-million fine from the SEC in October 2019 and the latter currently facing a lawsuit pertaining to its 2017 initial coin offering.However, it seems that a more plausible reason as to why these projects are failing to grow alongside Bitcoin is that they are seen as direct competitors to Ether, which has had a great run in the past month and hosts most of the DeFi industry. Hobbs told Cointelegraph:Privacy coins also came under regulatory fire in 2020. On Jan. 1, U.S. exchange Bittrex announced that it would be delisting Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC) and Dash, the three biggest anonymity-centric cryptocurrencies on the market. While unlisting these cryptocurrencies was an initiative by Bittrex, it does not come as a complete surprise, especially as regulators continue to crack down on crypto.On Dec. 23, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued a proposed rule change, in which it stated that anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies, like those mentioned above, are becoming more popular and are believed to be more closely associated with illicit activity such as money laundering and ransomware attacks.As frequent hacks on decentralized finance and other sets of crypto continue to occur, with the funds being disposed of in crypto exchanges, it also makes sense that the venues would want to disassociate themselves from untraceable money laundering and to comply with any upcoming regulation.As a result, trust in privacy coins seems to be shaken. Monero and Dash rose 0.79% and 3.79%, respectively, in the last 30 days. While these numbers don’t seem bad, they pale in comparison to Bitcoin’s price action. According to Dr. Octavius, co-founder of DeFi protocol OctoFi, the growth of the DeFi space may help these types of coins survive any upcoming regulatory hurdles:Another predominant type of token that seems to have stayed on the sidelines during the BTC rally was tokens issued by centralized exchanges, including Nexo, Unus Sed Leo (LEO) and Crypto.com Coin (CRO). While the fundamental value proposal for these tokens remains the same, they are somewhat tied into the success of the venues they are associated with, being used mostly for discounts on trading or lending fees or other perks.With DeFi on the rise, it seems likely that people would rather speculate on DeFi-related tokens or invest in the yield farming protocols themselves, which could account for the slow price action on these assets. LEO has dropped 1.66% and Nexo has surged by 11.3% in the last 30 days.While it is unclear what the road holds for coins like XRP, Dash, Monero and ZEC, whose future seems to be heavily tied to upcoming regulation, it looks like there’s a general shift in interest taking place when it comes to altcoins, especially as multiple DeFi tokens begin to take their place in the top 20 market cap list.As for smart contract platforms, it also seems unlikely that Ethereum will be dethroned soon, especially as the network continues to make strides toward the full release of Eth2. Not all Ethereum competitors are doing badly, however, as for example, the price of Near Protocol (NEAR) has recently soared 106% amid the current DeFi craze.Some have noted that the current bull market is likely to do away with speculative coins, as more value is now concentrated on Bitcoin and Ethereum, a clear divergence from what was observed in the 2017 rally that took BTC to its previous all-time high.On Dec. 16, Bitcoin’s price breached its previous all-time high of just over $19,500, previously reached on Dec.17, 2017, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Since then, Bitcoin (BTC) has seen an incredible bull run, which has led the cryptocurrency to new heights, having reached an all-time high of $41,941 on Jan. 8 and rallying by over 115% during this time."
616,"Bitcoin (BTC) whales clearly expect massive price rises in future as the number of wallets containing over 1,000 BTC ($35 million) hits an all-time high.Data from on-chain analytics resource Glassnode confirms that as of Jan. 20, there were in excess of 2,400 large-balance wallets.In 2021 alone, 164 new 1,000+ BTC entities were created, together controlling around $6 billion. While these may not all denote whales increasing their positions, the numbers feed into an existing narrative of wealth transfer which has characterized Bitcoin's latest bull run.As Cointelegraph reported, the 1,000+ BTC wallet category was the only one to increase in recent times, with smaller wallet holder numbers conversely dropping. While some appealed to hodlers not to sell out to whales, others argue that these newly-minted big players will aggressively protect the value of their investment.""Large inflows to whale wallets were happening at $29,314. They will be protecting their btc... This should be strong support for bitcoin in the short term, and hopefully long term,"" monitoring resource whalemap summarized on Twitter this week.Bitcoin remains at a crossroads in terms of spot market price action, trading in a corridor between $30,000 and $40,000 throughout the week. At the same time, institutional giant Grayscale unveiled its largest-ever one-day BTC buy-in, which totalled over 16,000 BTC worth around $700 million.Looking ahead, however, and indicators continue to reveal extreme bullish upside potential for BTC/USD.After Bitcoin's thermocap pointed to the price being in the early stages of a bubble setup, volatility now suggests that the market is just getting going on its gains. A reference point, macro investor Dan Tapeiro suggests, seems to be early 2017 — the start of almost a year of uptrend.""Phenomenal chart. Strong part of the #bitcoin upmove has not started yet.

617,"iFinex — the parent company of crypto exchange Bitfinex and stablecoin issuer Tether (USDT) — has written to the New York Supreme Court requesting that its upcoming trial date be pushed back even further.According to a filing submitted to the New York court system on Jan. 19, the legal counsel for iFinex Inc requested another 30 days to produce the documents demanded by the Office of the Attorney General (OAG).The document production process was supposed to be completed by Jan. 15 — a date which itself was an extension on the original deadline of Dec. 16. Legal counsel for the defendant, Charles Michael, said in Tuesday’s court filing that a “substantial volume” of material had already been handed over to the OAG, but that there remained “supplemental agreed-upon items” that still had to be sourced.The filing noted that, in addition to the time it will take to produce the documents in question, extra time will also have to be set aside for the OAG to analyze their importance. The filing states:The ongoing legal battle extends back to April 2019, when New York's attorney general alleged that Bitfinex had attempted to cover up the loss of $850 million of customers’ funds by taking illegal loans from Tether, with which it shares executive leadership. The defendants are also alleged to have operated an illegal securities offering.The investigation by the attorney general had previously revealed that no more than 74% of Tether stablecoins were actually backed up by real cash reserves. This hasn’t stopped over $24 billion worth of USDT being issued to date, and the stablecoin is still involved in the largest volume of crypto market spot trading on a daily basis.Chief technology officer of Bitfinex Paulo Ardoino recently took to his Twitter account to remind observers that Tether was registered and regulated under the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and that any suggestion that USDT represented a security was just an example of fear, doubt and uncertainty, or FUD.Reminder: #Tether is registered and regulated under FinCEN as all the centralised competitors. Strict KYC/AML is applied to all Tether direct users, as the other main issuers are doing. Less regulated is just FUD. Ask yourself who benefits from spreading such misinformation? https://t.co/0izlgpJ75rBitfinex General Counsel Stuart Hoegner told Cointelegraph that:Hoegner continued to note that: ""We have met all of our obligations to the AG's office under the 354 Order in full and on time. Bitfinex and Tether have produced approximately 2.5 million pages of material. We anticipate that this will take some time for the New York AG’s office to review. Furthermore, there were supplemental information items that came out of our discussions with the AG's office over the last several weeks. We will, as before, produce those additional agreed-upon materials on time.""Given Tether’s perceived influence in driving up the price of Bitcoin (BTC), and the extent of its everyday use by cryptocurrency traders, some fear a negative outcome on behalf of iFinex may wreak havoc on the value of BTC and the rest of the cryptocurrency market.Updated Jan. 1 at 8:48 pm UTC with a comment from Bitfinex 's general counsel."
618,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropped sharply from $37,800 to $35,000 overnight, liquidating $572 million worth of cryptocurrency futures positions.There are three major reasons why the price of Bitcoin declined steeply in the past 12 hours. The reasons are an overheated derivatives market, growing doubt in the market, and the lack of upside volatility.Before the pullback occurred, the Bitcoin derivatives market was extremely overheated. The futures funding rate was hovering at around 0.1%, which is 10 times higher than the average 0.01%.The futures funding rate is a mechanism that achieves balance in the futures market by incentivizing long or short contract holders based on market sentiment.If there are more long contracts or buyers in the market, then the funding rate turns positive. If it becomes positive, then buyers have to compensate short-sellers with a portion of their contracts every eight hours, and vice versa.Almost all major cryptocurrencies saw their funding rates spike to around 0.1% to 0.3%, which meant the market was extremely overleveraged.When the market is this overcrowded, the likelihood of a long squeeze increases, which could cause many futures contracts to get liquidated in a short period.According to researchers at Santiment, there is “trader doubt” in the market on whether BTC would hit $40,00 again. They wrote:The fundamentals of the Bitcoin blockchain network, such as address activity and trade volume, remain strong. However, the market sentiment has dwindled in the past week as BTC continues to struggle to break out of the $38,000 resistance area.Bitcoin has been seeing weak reactions from buyers throughout the past several days, compared to the initial rally to $42,000 in early January.During the early phase of the rally, whenever Bitcoin dipped to key support levels, like $35,000, there was often a big reaction from buyers.However, since mid-January, there have been weaker reactions from buyers at key support levels. This indicates that the expectations of a rally toward the $40,000 to $42,000 resistance area have subsided, at least in the near term.The selling pressure on Bitcoin mostly came from Asia in the first two weeks of January. But, as shown in the overnight correction on Jan. 19, Bitcoin has started to see weakness in the U.S. market as well.The combination of limited upside volatility and the lack of upside momentum is seemingly causing traders to become cautious in the near term. This likely means that BTC sees a prolonged consolidation phase until February."

620,"Research by Messari has delved into the Asian crypto landscape and revealed the region accounts for almost half of all digital asset trading, and boasts six of the top ten largest crypto unicorns.The report, penned by research analyst Mira Christanto, confirmed that China, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore, are market leaders with deep pools of liquidity, adding that other Asian countries also have great potential to scale.China also dominates in terms of whale activity and larger trades, the report added;Citing data from Chainalysis, the report stated that over the 12 months to June 2020, Asia accounted for 43% of global cryptocurrency activity, or almost $300 billion in transactions. Crypto activity in Asia alone is equivalent to the U.S. and Europe combined Christanto added.During the recent crypto market rally there were several selloffs during the Asian trading session sparking commentary on crypto social media about the region’s influence on markets.God bless The Asian markets bang on time they dump #Bitcoin

621,"On Tuesday, Ether (ETH) underwent a bullish breakout which propelled the price to a new all-time high at $1,428. While the move may have been technical, the fundamentals for Etheruem continue to improve as less than one month after launch there is now $3.8 billion worth of ETH locked on the Eth2 blockchain.The rapid rise in price has clearly attracted the attention of pro traders but Cointelegraph analyst Marcel Pechman warns that Ether’s rise to a new high was also accompanied by a large increase in short positions.Ether’s break to a new high had little effect on Bitcoin price and it appears that critical comments from former U.S. Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet Yellen, had a negative impact on the wider market today.Yellen, who has been nominated as President-Elect Biden’s Treasury Secretary, said that cryptocurrencies are being used ""mainly for illicit financing."" She issued the comments during a hearing with the Sentate Finance Committee and also advocated for major fiscal stimulus by telling Congress to “act big” when it comes to aid for the ailing U.S. economy.Despite today’s slight correction, institutional investors are still bullish on Bitcoin’s long term prospects. A recent projection from hedge fund Vailshire Capital Management called for an “imminent breakout” and PlanB, the creator of the popular Stock-to-Flow model, has predicted that Bitcoin price could close the month near $48,000.Unlike the crypto market, traditional markets ended the day with strength as Yellen’s call for additional economic stimulus are viewed as a positive by Wall Street. The S&P 500, Dow and NASDAQ all finished the trading day off strong following Yellen’s remarks, closing up 0.81%, 0.38%, and 1.5% respectively.Despite the negative view expressed by Yellen, positive developments for several blockchain projects helped drive select altcoin prices higher.Enjin (ENJ) price rallied 71% after the project was legally authorized for trade by the Japanese Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA). Aside from Ether (ETH), the best performing top 20 coin over the past 24-hours was Bitcoin Cash (BCH), up 7.46% and trading at $546.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.046 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 65%."
622,"Can Bitcoin’s (BTC) blockchain handle full mainstream adoption as a store of value, without needing layer-two scaling solutions? Konstantin Richter, founder and CEO of blockchain infrastructure company Blockdaemon, seems to think so.“Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency suited for store of value,” Richter told Cointelegraph, adding:Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, produced the digital asset as “A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” as noted in the asset’s 2008 white paper. As price and adoption rose, however, Bitcoin’s role seemingly changed from a transactional, cash-like asset, to a gold-like store of value, due to relatively slow transaction times and high fees.Near the end of the last Bitcoin bull run in 2017 and early 2018, Bitcoin’s transaction fees rose significantly. Since then, teams have worked on various layer-two solutions for moving BTC around, such as the Lightning Network — although as a store of value, Bitcoin’s blockchain may work fine as-is for now, based on Richter’s comments.“Infrastructure and liquidity provisioning are also converging, allowing for new business models to be tested,” he included, adding:Bitcoin still has the largest market cap of any crypto asset, even after a decade that ushered in thousands of new cryptocurrencies."
623,"Bitcoin (BTC) has travelled an eventful path since its creation in 2009. TradingView.com recently unveiled a BTC chart showing major events in the digital asset’s history, alongside the cryptocurrency's ever-changing price.Released on Tuesday, the chart points out potentially significant events on Bitcoin’s price path, showing a ""consolidated history of Bitcoin overlaid on the de facto crypto charts (by TradingView),"" the platform’s general manager, Pierce Crosby, told Cointelegraph.TradingView’s team intends to update the chart every 14 days — though if major news breaks, the team says they will adjust the metrics sooner. Clicking various bubbles on the chart produces an explanation of each event. The site also lists events in blog-like form below the chart.Crosby said:Worth less than $1 in its earliest days, the digital asset rocketed up past $40,000 in 2021. Many major events have occurred along that price path, such as the Mt. Gox ordeal.""Our initial observations show the immediate impact of historical events on the price of the asset,"" Crosby said. The BTC timeline shows a barrage of events, although the most recent headlines focus on the numerous price hurdles broken by the asset.""Looking at some of the early historical events, they are dwarfed by the price action in 2015 - 2017 the first period of time when current events captured the mainstream imagination of investors,"" Crosby observed from the chart.Such a timeline adds a tool for discussions on Bitcoin’s price as it pertains to events and possibly correlated reactions. ""Looking solely at BTC price movements in the market gives an incomplete view of why its price fluctuates the way it does, in a seemingly volatile manner,"" Crosby said, adding:"

""Update on #Bitcoin technicals... Breakout imminent. Direction still undecided. Macroview: Wildly bullish. On-chain analysis: Wildly bullish,"" he wrote.His comments come as Bitcoin sentiment appears to return to ""business as usual"" after the holiday break, with asset management giant Grayscale making its biggest one-day BTC buy ever — around $700 million as of Tuesday.As Cointelegraph reported, both network difficulty and hash rate have hit new all-time highs, and expectations are mounting that price will rise to follow suit. Ether (ETH), the largest cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin, beat its record highs from 2018 on the day.Vailshire meanwhile is not alone in its optimism over Bitcoin's prospects this week. In the latest update to his stock-to-flow Bitcoin price model, quant analyst PlanB eyed the possibility of BTC/USD soon passing the ""point of no return.""This, he explains, would occur should January's monthly close be substantially higher than the current spot rate — around $48,000, for example.In so doing, Bitcoin would cement its status within stock-to-flow's theories, including its transition to an asset with a market cap of up to $29 trillion, as dictated by PlanB's stock-to-flow cross-asset model (S2FX).""A larger monthly jump to #bitcoin $48K would create a nice gap between monthly dots. These gaps usually mark the point of no return (red arrows), i.c. the phase transition to #phase5,"" he commented while uploading the chart to Twitter.Not everyone was convinced. In an update on Tuesday, Cointelegraph Markets analyst filbfilb warned that the next few days would be critical if Bitcoin is to avoid bearish pressure.The reason, he said, came from repeated warning signals delivered by his Predator trading tool. ""Predator printed its second yellow candle in the Bitcoin run-up,"" he explained."
625,"In another throwback to the 2017 bull market, a major United States bank fund manager survey, or FMS, has put Bitcoin at the pinnacle of positive investor sentiment.According to Reuters, 36% of respondents identified a long Bitcoin bet as the most crowded trade ahead of long tech in a Jan. 2021 survey from Bank of America.January’s report marks the first time that ‘long tech’ has not been number one in BofA’s fund manager survey since Oct. 2019. The result also marks a steady increase in positive investor sentiment for BTC seeing as Bitcoin was third on the list back in Dec. 2020.Indeed, the Dec. 2020 edition showcased a healthy appetite for risk assets with the majority of asset managers dropping cash for the first time since 2013.However, tech stocks are currently experiencing significant struggles in the market with both the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones down by 150 and 90 basis points respectively, in the second week of January.Back in 2017, long Bitcoin was chosen as the most crowded trade in BofA’s and Merrill Lynch’s global fund manager survey.In another survey reported by Reuters, this time from Deutsche Bank, respondents characterized Bitcoin as being in a bubble. According to the report, more than half of the investors in the poll predicted a 50% price decline for Bitcoin before the end of 2021.Bitcoin is currently showing signs of consolidation above the $36,000 mark which could be a catalyst for another attempt at its all-time high above $40,000. According to JP Morgan analysts, BTC needs to re-take $40,000 or risk another 30% correction.at the time of writing, Bitcoin is up more than 26% year-to-date despite being about $4,000 shy of its ATH price achieved back on Jan. 8."
626,"Retail investors in the U.S. will now be able to trade a SEC-qualified token offering for the first time.Following the launch of the Stacks 2.0 mainnet, OKCoin has announced that it has listed the Stacks token (STX.)Stacks, formerly known as Blockstack, shares a native connection with the Bitcoin network. As reported by Cointelegraph, the layer-one blockchain has an ambitious vision to bring smart contracts and decentralized finance to BTC — enabling developers to build cutting-edge applications and explore new use cases.America is not the only market where STX can be purchased and traded on OKCoin, as this cryptocurrency will also be available in a number of other international markets, with the exception of the EU, Singapore and Brunei.OKCoin’s chief marketing officer Haider Rafique said: “Stacks is expanding Bitcoin’s value proposition beyond a store of value by bringing apps and smart contracts to its network. This paves a way for creating new ecosystems utilizing Bitcoin’s best features.“In the case of Stacks, we are rooting for a future of DApps that ultimately create a network of a user-owned internet, one that brings digital ownership to the forefront. It’s an exciting time for this release with the backdrop of Bitcoin’s new all-time highs and where Bitcoin may go when the vision of Stacks is fully realized.”As well as being used for executing smart contracts and processing transactions, STX enables holders to participate in “stacking” — an action that supports blockchain consensus and helps to keep the Stacks network secure, with users receiving Bitcoin rewards in return.According to the Stacks Foundation, this layer-one blockchain’s approach provides a new way of earning Bitcoin at a time when it is difficult to acquire — amid speculation that BTC is heading for a supply squeeze because of increasing levels of institutional adoption.Users do need to hold a minimum amount of STX in order to take part in stacking, but OKCoin users are able to pool their funds — meaning they can get involved with as little as 50 STX (about $25 at the time of writing.)The Stacks Foundation’s executive director Brittany Laughlin told Cointelegraph: “The listing of STX on OKCoin is a major milestone that was achieved through careful attention to regulations and open information sharing. With U.S. persons now able to purchase STX and participate in the Stacks 2.0 network, the user-owned internet is even closer to having a truly global presence.”OKCoin offers a range of easy-to-use fiat onramps, allowing newcomers to the crypto markets to convert their local currency into digital assets.OKCoin’s listing of STX comes weeks after Blockstack PBC — now known as Hiro PBC — shared the summary of a legal memorandum supporting plans for STX to no longer be considered a security under U.S. law once the Stacks 2.0 mainnet launched.This followed a Reg A+, SEC-qualified token offering of STX and a concurrent Asia strategic round in September 2019, which resulted in $23 million being raised.During the livestream for the Stacks 2.0 mainnet launch event, Haider Rafique added that one of OKCoin’s top priorities was simplifying DeFi for crypto natives — as well as those who are curious about digital assets.“We try and remove all of the jargon we can, so people are clear on the utility and it’s really easy to understand,” he said during the broadcast.Disclaimer.

The framework will include a number of digital asset types like tokenized securities and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC):A spokesperson for the DFSA told Cointelegraph that the authority plans to publish two consultation papers seeking feedback on the upcoming rules in 2021. Depending on feedback from the consultations, the agency expects to adopt the new rules in the second and third quarters of 2021.The representative added that the upcoming rules would represent a comprehensive regulatory framework, drawing on best practices from global jurisdictions. The framework will specifically include Anti-Money Laundering measures, the spokesperson said:The UAE’s first cryptocurrency-related rules emerged more than two years ago. In June 2018, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority, or FSRA, of the Abu Dhabi Global Market published guidance on cryptocurrencies, exchanges and initial coin offerings. The FSRA continued to actively engage with the industry, granting several regulatory approvals to companies like the BitOasis cryptocurrency exchange in 2019."
628,"A hidden Biblical message has been found embedded in a transaction in block number 666,666 of the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain.The message is a quotation from the sixth book in the New Testament, the Epistle to the Romans. First spotted by @emzy@bitcoinhackers.org, it reads:The transaction in question saw an equal amount of Bitcoin — 432,100 satoshis ($160) — sent to two different addresses. The first several characters of those addresses contain the words “God” and “Bible.”Whoever sent the transactions paid over $50 in fees, equating to five times more than Bitcoin’s peak average transaction fee on the day, according to Bitinfocharts.com. This implies the sender’s goal was to have their transactions, and message, included in block 666,666 specifically.This is not the first time a hidden message has been found embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain. The most famous example is the message found in the first block ever mined, known as the “genesis block.”A follow-up was staged amid the first phase of the United States Federal Reserve's money-printing spree in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Block number 630,000 revealed the following message:Implanting messages in the blockchain has become a common occurrence in recent years. Previous messages have come in the form of marriage proposals, poetry, eulogies and general profanity."
629,"Asset manager Grayscale added 18 times more Bitcoin (BTC) than miners added to the supply in just one day on Jan. 18.As various data sources confirm, Grayscale, which remains the biggest institutional buyer in the Bitcoin space, purchased a total of 16,244 BTC ($607 million) on Monday.The giant sums are some of the biggest on record and are an order of magnitude above what even Grayscale was attempting just last week. The company previously saw daily buys but stopped over the holiday period and reduced its allocations in the first week of the new year.Monday’s activities bring its total assets under management (AUM) to almost $23 billion. As Cointelegraph reported, the total increased tenfold during 2020.“Grayscale were buying $251 M of #Bitcoin on avg per week in Q4 2020,” Danny Scott, CEO of United Kingdom-based cryptocurrency exchange CoinCorner, tweeted.The move underscores both Grayscale’s continued faith in Bitcoin as a long-term play and that of institutions choosing Bitcoin over any other form of macro asset.Despite mixed messages from fellow asset manager Guggenheim, set to begin its BTC exposure this month, industry sources state that public announcements hide the true extent of institutional involvement.“There is huge institutional demand and most of it is silent,” Gemini exchange co-founder Tyler Winklevoss said last week while berating gold bug Peter Schiff for claiming that players were actually not interested in Bitcoin.Data from on-chain analytics resource CryptoQuant meanwhile reveals changes in Grayscale’s buying habits, with late 2020 seeing the largest short-term increase in BTC holdings for the year.Earlier, analysts at JPMorgan argued that inflows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust would need to maintain $100 million per day in order for Bitcoin to have a chance at reclaiming $40,000 price levels."
630,"Trezor, a major hardware cryptocurrency wallet supplier, has warned its users about a fake Trezor application on Google Play.According to Trezor, the fake app is malicious and has no relation to Trezor or SatoshiLabs, a company that created the Trezor wallet. Announcing the news on Jan. 18, Trezor asked its clients to not install the malicious application, reminding users that they should never share their seed phrase with anyone.Warning to all Trezor owners using Android devices!

This app is malicious and has no relation to Trezor or SatoshiLabs. Please, don't install it.

Remember that you should never share your seed with anyone until your Trezor device asks you to do it! pic.twitter.com/6C3iKfPDnRTrezor also provided its users with a short manual on using Trezor wallet with Android. In the manual, the company listed major third-party Trezor apps including Mycelium, Sentinel or Walleth.At publishing time, the malicious app is still available on Google Play. As of Jan. 18, the app was reportedly downloaded more than 1,000 times. The doppelgänger app also has about 200 reviews on the app store, with the majority warning that it is a scam. “This app is a scam. Never enter your recovery phrase in anything except an official hardware Trezor. Anyone that asks for this phrase (besides a physical Trezor) is trying to scam you),” one supposed user wrote.Trezor did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.This is not the first time that a fake app has been listed on Google Play. In May 2019, Cointelegraph reported on a malicious Google Play app imitating Trezor wallet. The app was found by ESET antivirus researchers, who said that they expect more crypto scam apps to enter the Android store as the crypto market grows.Online scammers have been targeting other popular crypto companies to impersonate their apps on Google and steal money from users. In May 2020, a cybersecurity researcher discovered 22 malicious Google Chrome extensions imitating crypto services like Trezor’s rival Ledger and major Ether (ETH) wallet MetaMask."
631,"It is especially important for countries to become more aware of cryptocurrencies, especially with components like decentralized finance rising in prominence. Now that the Middle East is becoming more mining-friendly, the future suddenly looks bright once again for this region.The Pakistani government appears to be moving quickly toward a pro-crypto stance. Following a commitment to integrate Bitcoin (BTC) into its financial system last December, the country is taking steps to legalize mining.Sumera Shams, a member of the provincial assembly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, announced on Twitter that the body had voted to pass a law legalizing mining:Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is one of the major provinces in Pakistan. It is located in the country’s northern region and is a driving force behind the country’s development. According to further confirmation from Zia Ullah Bangash, chief advisor on science and information technology to the region’s chief minister, the area voted to legalize mining.Local news sources claimed that the assembly had passed a draft legislation showing a commitment to embrace what could possibly be the future of money. Legislators explained that they believed cryptocurrencies would replace fiat currencies eventually and that it is important for them to be at the forefront as this development comes.By embracing mining, they hope to usher in the next financial revolution. The bill passed in a unanimous vote, showing that legislators were indeed looking forward to bolstering their digital and financial spaces.Waqar Zaka, an influencer and pro-crypto activist, tweeted that this was “one province done, three more to go.” While this doesn’t mean that all of Pakistan has embraced mining, it is indeed a step in the right direction.It is unclear how the northern region wants to move forward with its mining strategy. However, it should be able to develop a robust regulatory regime that will encompass the entire industry and allow for investment to flow.Pakistan is not the only country in the Middle East that is moving quickly toward the legislation of mining. In fact, it currently trails Iran in that regard.Iran’s embrace of crypto mining has been swift. The country initially outlawed the activity after noticing that citizens had begun operating mining outfits in mosques. Most mosques get electricity subsidies from the government, and these miners had set up their operations to ensure that they would profit from it.The situation was particularly dire because crypto had started gaining traction in Iran at the time. Sadly, it turned sour when the government began to seize mining equipment found in mosques. A report on the issue claimed that Mostafa Rajabi Mashhadi, an official at the Iranian Ministry of Energy, pointed out a 7% jump in the consumption of electricity in June 2019.Mashhadi reportedly added that crypto miners had been responsible for the rise in consumption levels. So, the government chose to take preventive steps to avert any issues with Iran’s power grid. He pointed out that the government will identify miners and immediately cut them off the power grid — until all parties reach a reasonable agreement over pricing policies for miners.In November 2018, Iran was ranked on top of the global energy subsidy list, providing up to $45.1 billion annually. That figure represented a 10th of its annual gross domestic product that year. Considering that Iran had been dealing with stringent economic sanctions from the United States government and the international community over its nuclear program, it couldn’t afford to pay more in subsidies.However, these same policies have forced the country to rethink its policies. In July, the Iranian government officially ruled to declare crypto mining an industrial activity in the country. A report from the Mehr News Agency stated that the government had held a cabinet meeting, chaired by President Hassan Rouhani.The legalization essentially made mining an official industry. At the same time, individuals and businesses looking to engage in the activity would need to get licenses from the Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade.It was a perfect match. Electricity prices are pretty cheap in Iran. Statistics from Global Petrol Prices at the time showed that the country charged almost $0.005 per kilowatt-hour. Considering that this is much better than what other countries charge, it is no doubt that this will be lucrative.So far, over a thousand individuals and entities have jumped into the Iranian mining space, taking advantage of the cheap electricity. In return, the country has enjoyed a boost in revenues and taxes. The economic sanctions from the United States and the international community have continued to grow, and this means that the country is strapped for cash. With a fledgling industry like cryptocurrency mining, it can offset some of these costs.It is unclear whether any countries in the Middle East will join the fray anytime soon. Saudi Arabia is growing to be the blockchain hub, although most of its efforts have been aimed at using the technology to improve its government and private industries. With the prospect of crypto legislation rising there, there is no reason why mining can’t become more of a recognized activity as well.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
632,"The daily volume of transactions on the Ethereum (ETH) network is now 28% greater than on Bitcoin (BTC), according to crypto analytics firm Messari.On Jan. 19, Messari’s Ryan Watkins tweeted that Ethereum’s daily transaction volume “is going parabolic” alongside a chart indicating that Ethereum and Ethereum-powered stablecoins have processed $12.3 billion in transactions over the past 24 hours — dwarfing Bitcoin and Omni-based USDT’s $9.3 billion.The data excludes non-stablecoin ERC-20 transactions for Ethereum to avoid double-counting DEX volumes.According to Blockchain Center’s “Flippening Index,” which uses eight key metrics to track whether the Ethereum network has surpassed Bitcoin in size and activity, Ethereum is 63.5% of the way to having flipped Bitcoin. While Blockchain Center’s data suggests Ethereum is yet to beat out Bitcoin’s transaction volume, the Flippening Index notes Ethereum is already beating Bitcoin by transaction count and total transaction fees. The data also has Ethereum’s node count at 94% after briefly flipping Bitcoin several times in recent months, and estimates Ethereum’s trade volume is equal to 57% of Bitcoin’s after bouncing off a record high of 76% last week.Despite momentum building for Ethereum, the index shows Google search volume is only 14% compared to Bitcoin, and Ether’s market cap to be just 21% of Bitcoin’s. However, Messari estimates the entire Ethereum ecosystem to be worth $212 billion — equal to 31% of Bitcoin’s market cap.Polkadot, the brain-child of Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, completed its own flippening last week to overtake Ripple’s XRP and rank as the third-largest non-stablecoin crypto asset by capitalization behind Ethereum."
633,"Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade in a tightening range within a pennant pattern and while the price has moved above the 20-day moving average, it's clear that the bulls and bears are fighting over the direction the digital asset will take. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView show that BTC traded in a range between $34,955 and $37,850 over the weekend but traders buying each dip appear to be doing so with less bullish conviction.JPMorgan research analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou recently stressed the importance of Bitcoin breaking out above the $40,000 level soon in order to avoid being hurt by an exodus of “trend-following” investors who could worsen last week’s correction.According to Yves Renno, Head of Trading at Wirex, Bitcoin is in a “consolidation above the $35,500 level” but Renno still sees an overall positive trend in the market.Renno also said that the most recent correction was actually viewed as an opportunity to buy for large, institutional-size investors, as evidenced by an increase in the number of BTC whales and a “low to average” miner supply.Renno said that investors should expect to see a “continued period of high volatility with a positive medium-trend,” in the upcoming weeks and months based on action in the derivatives market.He said:Ether (ETH) also looks to show “continued strong price momentum” as Renno sees it, driven by the Eth2 launch and upcoming CME futures launch in February. Eth2 is also expected to provide a boost to the DeFi economy in general as the ecosystem as a whole will benefit from a decrease in transaction fees and less congestion.News that incoming President Joe Biden intends to choose Gary Gensler, a professor who previously taught a blockchain and cryptocurrency course at MIT, as Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, provided the crypto sector with a short-term boost in sentiment.Bitcoin also received a significant vote-of-confidence from Stephen Harper, the former prime minister of Canada. Harper suggested that there may be a place for Bitcoin as part of “a basket of reserve currencies to replace the dollar.”While Bitcoin price has been trading sideways, crypto pundits have been calling for Ether to breakout and follow BTC’s parabolic move. Within the last hour, Ether did manage a bullish breakout in its BTC pair and USD pair. At the time of writing, the top-ranked altcoin is up 5.43% and trades $1,327.Despite pulling back on Monday, Polkadot (DOT) also continues to be one of the top-performing altcoins, seeing a 75% increase in price last week and flipping XRP as it sets sight on the $20 mark. Currently, DOT trades at $16.80.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.03 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 65.7%."
634,"Tokenized Bitcoin is booming, with the increasing demand from DeFi combined with BTC’s recent meteoric price rise has resulted in three Bitcoin tokenization protocols ranking among the 70 largest crypto markets.According to popular market data aggregators CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) currently ranks as the 13th-largest market boasting a capitalization of $4.04 billion, with roughly 0.6% of Bitcoin’s supply currently locked in the protocol. Huobi BTC (HBTC) ranks 56th with a market cap of $660 million, followed by the 63rd-ranked renBTC (RENBTC) with a capitalization of $510 million.However, the emergence of Bitcoin (BTC) tokenization protocols as top-ranked crypto markets is problematic for data aggregators as it risks double-counting a portion of Bitcoin’s supply when estimating the total market capitalization of the crypto sector.At the time of publication, WBC, HBTC, and RENBTC represent more than 1.4% of the combined crypto capitalization excluding Bitcoin, according to bothCoinGecko and CoinMarketCap.With many analysts expecting Bitcoin to continue pushing into new all-time highs, and the DeFi sector’s appetite for tokenized BTC growing significantly in recent months, the share of crypto capitalization represented by Bitcoin tokenization services is likely to keep expanding.Speaking to Cointelegraph, CoinGecko COO and co-founder Bobby Ong confirmed that “the tokenized BTC market capitalization [...] is included in the total cryptocurrency market capitalization calculation” provided by his company. He added:Bitcoin currently represents more than 65% of the combined crypto capitalization.Cointelegraph contacted CoinMarketCap for comment, but did not receive a response as of press time."
635,"The United States Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, recently proposed a series of new regulations applying to financial institutions dealing with digital currencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC). To summarize the proposed regulations, exchanges would essentially be required to file a report with FinCEN when a customer makes a purchase in excess of $10,000, and gather Know Your Customer information any time a transaction of $3,000 or greater is conducted using a non-custodial wallet. This means that if a customer buys $3,000 worth of Bitcoin and withdraws it to a wallet they control, they would have to not only prove ownership of that wallet but also provide their name and physical address, along with additional identifying information.Personally, my life stands to change very little. I’ve been living entirely off of cryptocurrency since 2015, unbanked since 2016, and have never used a centralized exchange, receiving all of my coins as compensation for goods and services. But as few live as I do, we will likely see a significant impact on how most cryptocurrency users conduct their business. I would hazard a guess that most users have interacted with a centralized platform requiring KYC.For the rest of cryptocurrency users, the newly proposed regulations would put a significant friction point on deposits and withdrawals. At present, a user signs up to an exchange, submits KYC documents for approval, and can buy and withdraw Bitcoin to a wallet they control, including a hardware wallet for cold storage. When wishing to realize gains, they can then move the funds back onto the exchange and sell for spending money in the bank.In the future, however, they may be required to prove ownership of the wallet to which they withdraw, including providing their physical address, and similarly, prove the origin of the funds when moving back on to an exchange. This may lead many users, including the privacy- and autonomy-conscious (of which there are many in the Bitcoin world), to seek other, less intrusive ways of using their digital funds. Making payments directly for the goods and services they desire, rather than first selling for fiat currency, avoids the headache of passing through the regulation-induced friction point every time.There’s a reason why relatively few people have engaged in regular transactions and purchases with Bitcoin — they haven’t needed to. The average user signs up for an exchange account, buys crypto, and may sell to realize some gains. Some of the more hardcore users may even buy a hardware wallet and transfer funds to it from an exchange, which could be an infrequent transaction of significant amounts with no real requirement for speed or particularly low fees. The basic process of buying for investment purposes, and occasionally selling to realize gains or to spend, is relatively smooth with centralized exchanges, which is why so few have ventured far out of this closed loop so far.Many Bitcoiners have opted to stay inside this closed loop for exactly the same reason they may soon seek to exit it — avoiding friction. Sure, many will simply deal with the extra regulatory steps, but many more, particularly thought leaders and longtime community staples, will choose to stay closer to the cypherpunk ethos.Bitcoin was born and bred for decentralized digital payments. At some point, this use case took a backseat to a digital store-of-value, and the tools necessary for it to reclaim this purpose haven’t adequately developed yet — foremost among these, of course, is scaling.Bitcoin chose to pursue off-chain scaling solutions (Lightning Network) and on-chain transaction optimizations (SegWit). Both of these have seen lackluster development over the past several years, with SegWit transactions making up less than half of daily transactions over three years, and Lightning Network growth similarly stagnating, with very few exchanges or other major ecosystem players having integrated it at this point. As noted above, this hasn’t been that much of an issue with the current state of things.However, when the average user gets direct exposure to the Bitcoin network as it functions today, they’re in for a rude awakening that will either prompt them to disengage entirely or will place pressure on wallets and service providers to prioritize SegWit and Lightning. In a free market, which the cryptoverse largely is, consumer demand drives innovation to meet its needs. If enough Bitcoiners start demanding that Bitcoin work seamlessly for small and efficient transactions (beyond simply posting about it on Twitter), the market will seriously push for the ecosystem to develop to meet its needs.Of course, Bitcoin is far from alone in the competition for cryptocurrency for direct purchases. Since its transition to a more digital gold-focused role starting in 2016 or 2017, quite a few hungry competitors have emerged. In the forefront of people’s minds are, naturally, the main Bitcoin forks, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV). Both have pursued an on-chain scaling approach and have the capacity to field a large number of transactions cheaply, but neither has achieved a compelling enough differentiator yet to fully take over Bitcoin’s share of the payments market. Bitcoin Cash has the clear advantage in terms of integrations into valuable services such as Purse.io but lost significant momentum due to repeated forks, each one taking with it a portion of the community and mindshare. Bitcoin SV has quite a few innovations going for it, including social media platforms and rudimentary human-readable username systems. But with a market ranking firmly outside of the top 10 and with far fewer major integrations than Bitcoin Cash, there’s certainly an uphill battle ahead. Additionally, the mark of Craig Wright has soured the project in the eyes of much of the greater cryptoverse, making partnerships and publicity difficult.Litecoin (LTC) presents an interesting case as the longest-running payments-focused Bitcoin alternative, but so far, it has not yet managed to come into its own. From 2014 to 2017, its transaction volume trended downward, only to rebound significantly as Bitcoin’s scaling issues began to arise. Since then, it has served as a testnet for Bitcoin of sorts, as well as an off-chain scaling solution. Litecoin’s own scaling path seems to be uncertain, as its own Lightning Network implementation found even less success than Bitcoin’s, while its current 4x on-chain capacity compared to Bitcoin still leaves plenty of growing room. Will Litecoin remain as a substitute until Bitcoin or another project evolves to fully take the payments lead, or will this be the opportunity it needs to take over the digital cash role? Either way, its fate seems to be inexorably tied with that of Bitcoin.The dark horse in this division may very well be Dash, whose name is literally an abbreviation of “digital cash” and has competed for this use case longer than any other alternative except Litecoin. And despite steady growth in transaction numbers, regardless of a bull or bear market, it has largely gotten lost in an increasingly crowded field of payments coins, some with crypto celebrity backers, especially after the realignment from a privacy focus to an everyday payments focus.Unlike its competitors, however, Dash has spent years working on quite a few real improvements to the payments experience, including instant transaction settlement and anti-51% attack protection, making a Dash transaction arguably more secure in seconds than what its competitors could achieve in minutes or even hours — an experience that’s particularly useful for in-person retail payments. This, combined with the recent release onto testnet of the long-awaited “Evolution” upgrade, which not only provides human-readable usernames and contact lists but also fully-decentralized digital identities, could make 2021 an interesting year for the crypto payments space. It remains to be seen whether the combination of instant payments with protocol-level ease of use will be enough to catch the attention of an industry with a notoriously short attention span.The new U.S. regulations regarding non-custodial wallets may push more cryptocurrency users to skip the exchanges altogether and use their coins to directly buy and sell goods and services. Will this be enough to push Bitcoin to reclaim its peer-to-peer digital cash purpose by finally getting scaling solutions, such as the Lightning Network, developed enough so that they’re easily usable by the average person? Or will one of its children choose this time to shine, taking over the payments space while Bitcoin holds down the investment use case?The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
636,"Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest digital-asset manager, could hold the key to Bitcoin’s (BTC) short-term price outlook, according to JPMorgan Chase. As Bloomberg reports, strategists led by Nikolas Panigirtzoglou believe Bitcoin could lose its luster over the short-term unless it can “break out” above $40,000. The flagship cryptocurrency breached that key level on two occasions this month, once in the lead-up to new all-time highs near $42,000 and the other just last week.The strategists determined that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which currently has $23 billion in assets under management, will play a crucial role in whether BTC returns to that level or not.They wrote:If BTC fails to re-take $40,000, trend-following traders “could propagate the past week’s correction,” the analysts said. That means the path of least resistance could be lower.Since breaching $20,000 in December, the Bitcoin price more than doubled in just three weeks. The digital currency has been rangebound in recent weeks as traders look for the next major catalyst.In the meantime, Grayscale continues to exert considerable influence over the cryptocurrency market. Average weekly inflows into Grayscale’s digital-asset products reached $250.7 million in the fourth quarter, marking a new all-time high. The Bitcoin Trust generated $217.1 million in weekly inflows, on average.As Cointelegraph reported last week, Bitcoin’s price rose sharply after Grayscale reopened its services to new investors on Jan. 13."
637,"Investors are beginning to worry that Bitcoin’s (BTC) uptrend could be in peril after the top-ranked cryptocurrency failed to pull above the $40,000. Some traders are afraid that a repeat of the crushing 2018 bear market is on the cards again if BTC fails to find bullish momentum.However, a study of both the bull markets shows distinct differences that are noteworthy. Research from Pantera Capital found that after the current bull move, 86% of the crypto market's value is concentrated in Bitcoin and Ethereum, largely because institutional funds have flowed into each cryptocurrency.In 2017, the top two coins only held about 52% of the value, with the rest being held in several altcoins that turned out to be ""non-functioning"" coins. In the current bull market, retail investors seem to be largely absent so the type of speculation witnessed in 2017 has yet to appear in 2021.Guggenheim Partners’ chief investment officer Scott Minerd recently said that his long-term Bitcoin price target of $400,000 remains and his recent tweet asking his followers to “take some money off the table” was based on the short-term price movement.Although Minerd has not included Bitcoin in his mutual fund portfolios, he said purchases have been done in some private funds managed by Guggenheim.While Bitcoin consolidates after the recent bull phase, select altcoins are extending their up-move. Can this continue? Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin is attempting to rebound off the 20-day exponential moving average ($34,380) but the weak bounce suggests a lack of urgency among bulls to accumulate on dips. As the price is stuck inside a symmetrical triangle, technical traders may wait for the price to break out of the pattern before buying.If the price does not rise to the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle, the bears may smell an opportunity and will try to sink the price below the triangle. If they succeed, the BTC/USD pair may drop to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $29,688.10.This is an important level to watch out for because, if the bears sink the price below this support, the drop could extend to the 50-day simple moving average ($26,932). The deeper the fall, the longer it is likely to take for the uptrend to resume because every rise will be met with a wave of selling by traders who are stuck at higher levels.Another sharp correction could be avoided if bulls thrust the price above the triangle. The all-time high at $41,959.63 may act as a stiff resistance but if the bulls can drive the price above it, the pair could reach $50,000.Ether (ETH) remains in a strong uptrend and is currently consolidating near the $1,300 to $1,349.10 overhead resistance. The upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought zone suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.The ETH/USD pair formed a Doji candlestick pattern on Jan. 17 and again today, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears. If the uncertainty resolves to the upside and the bulls push the price above the overhead resistance, the uptrend could resume. The next target is $1,420 and then $1,675.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below $1,152, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($1,079). A strong rebound off this support will suggest accumulation at lower levels and the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend.However, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the decline could deepen to $1,000 and then to $900.Polkadot (DOT) is in a strong uptrend and the momentum picked up after the altcoin broke above the $10.68 resistance on Jan. 13. The up-move reached $19.40 on Jan. 16, recording a 143% rally in four days.Some short-term traders may have booked profits after the sharp rally, but the shallow correction suggests that the majority of the traders are not panicking. If the bears fail to pull the price below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $14.7259, the uptrend could resume.If the bulls can push the price above $20, the DOT/USD pair could rally to $24 and then to $30. However, if the bears sink the price below $14.7259, the pair may consolidate the recent gains for a few days before starting the next trending move. The bears will signal a comeback if they can sustain the price below the 20-day EMA ($11.47).The bears have been defending the 20-day EMA ($0.297) for the past few days but they have not been able to capitalize on the weakness and sink XRP below $0.25, which suggests a lack of sellers at lower levels.The bulls will now attempt to push the price above the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the XRP/USD pair may rally to $0.385. The bears are likely to defend this resistance aggressively.If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair could extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. On the other hand, if the bulls push the price above the range and the 50-day SMA ($0.406), a new uptrend could begin.ADA/USDCardano (ADA) soared above the downtrend line on Jan. 16, signaling the resumption of the uptrend. The bulls pushed the price near the overhead resistance at $0.40 on Jan. 17, which may act as a stiff barrier.However, the upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest that bulls are in command. If the bulls do not allow the price to dip and sustain below $0.34, the likelihood of a break above $0.40 increases. The next target on the upside is $0.50.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below $0.34, it will suggest aggressive profit-booking at higher levels. The ADA/USD pair could then drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.288).A strong rebound off the 20-day EMA could keep the uptrend intact but a break below it may signal a short-term top.The bulls and the bears have been battling it out near the 20-day EMA ($144) for the past few days. The buyers are currently trying to push Litecoin (LTC) above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $157.6904.If they succeed, the LTC/USD pair could rally to $170 and then to $185.5821. A breakout of this resistance could open the doors for a rally to $225.However, the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight. They will pose a stiff challenge at $157.6904. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair may remain range-bound between $130 and $160 for a few days.The trend will turn in favor of the bears if they can sink and sustain the price below the 50-day SMA ($118).The bears are defending the $515.35 resistance but they have not been able to sink Bitcoin Cash (BCH) below the uptrend line. This shows the bulls are buying on dips.If the bulls can push and sustain the price above the $515.35 to $539 resistance zone, the BCH/USD pair could rally to $631.71. The bears may defend this level aggressively but if the bulls can propel the price above it, the uptrend could reach $833.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance and breaks below the uptrend line, it will suggest the sentiment has turned negative and traders are closing their positions on a rally. This could result in a fall to $370.LINK/USDChainlink (LINK) is in a strong uptrend, making a new all-time high at $23.767 on Jan. 17. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($16.91) and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest bulls are in control.However, bears are not willing to give up easily. They had attempted to stall the rally on Jan. 16 as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick and they are again trying to pull the price down today. The bears will have to sink and sustain the price below $20.1111 to gain the upper hand.But if the LINK/USD pair rebounds off $20.1111, it will suggest the level has flipped to support and may act as a floor during future declines. If the bulls can push the price above $23.767, the uptrend could reach $27 and then $30.Stellar Lumens (XLM) has been trading inside the $0.26 to $0.325 range for the past few days, but the upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.257) and the RSI in the positive territory suggest bulls have the upper hand.If the buyers can push the price above $0.325, the XLM/USD pair may rally to $0.409 and if this level is also scaled, the up-move may reach $0.50. The longer the time spent in the range, the stronger will be the breakout from it.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the range and the 20-day EMA, it could attract profit-booking by traders and the pair could drop to the 50-day SMA. Such a move will indicate advantage to the bears.Binance Coin (BNB) rose to a new all-time high on Jan. 17 and followed it up with another new high today at $46.8888. However, the bulls are struggling to sustain the higher levels, which suggests some traders are booking profits.The BNB/USD pair has formed an ascending broadening wedge pattern and the RSI is also showing signs of a bearish divergence. Both these suggest the bullish momentum may be weakening.However, in a strong uptrend, bearish developments get negated as bulls resume their purchases after a break. Traders can watch the price action near the 20-day EMA ($40) because, if this support cracks, the bears will try to sink the price below the wedge.But if the BNB/USD pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that traders continue to buy on dips. Such a move could resume the uptrend with the next target at $50.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

638,"A little-known altcoin known as Metacoin (MTC) surged to 486% gains in just 24 hours on Jan. 18, after Bittrex Global announced it would be listing the coin against Bitcoin (BTC).Metacoin is built on the Hyperledger network, an umbrella project of open-source technologies focused around building permissioned blockchain ecosystems for large cross-industry enterprises. Metacoin became the first cryptocurrency of Hyperledger’s to achieve mainnet status when it went live in 2018.Hyperledger was founded by the Linux Foundation, and is overseen by a host of “premium members”, comprising leading technology and finance companies, such as IBM, J.P. Morgan, Fujitsu, Hitachi, and more.On Jan. 15, the Bittrex Global cryptocurrency exchange announced that it had opened its Metacoin wallet for deposits of MTC, and that trading against Bitcoin would soon follow.Little over 48 hours after the announcement was made, the value of each MTC coin had more than quintupled. From a starting price of $0.026540 on Sunday night, the dollar value of the coin increased more than fivefold, climbing to a brief peak of $0.155600 by Monday afternoon - a 486% increase.Metacoin trade volume hit an all-time high of $482,000 on the day, all emanating from a single BTC trading pair on the Liquid exchange. This just exceeds the $444,000 volume recorded in August 2020, during the coin’s first two weeks on the open market.Notably, despite the surge following hot on the heels of the announcement by Bittrex Global, no trading data for Metacoin yet exists on the site, and the BTC/MTC pair was still signalled as being “offline”.Taking Hyperledger’s cross-industry modular toolkit as a starting point, Metacoin acts as a multi-function blockchain platform where tokens for businesses and commerce can be issued on-chain. The platform also plays host to a number of DApps, including ColdBank, a crypto custody service which utilizes IBM’s LinuxONE technology, as well as blockchain gaming apps."
639,"Throughout 2020, we saw a consistent flow of news about legacy finance, major investment companies and large corporations looking to enter the digital assets industry. The value proposition for investing in Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital currencies started to move beyond just a store of value or thinking of Bitcoin as a commodity like digital gold.In 2021, we’ll see the market’s understanding of Bitcoin maturing even further. The narrative will shift from a store of value to a powerful and appreciating currency. In 2020, Bitcoin was a commodity that institutions felt pressure to own. In 2021, Bitcoin and crypto will morph from a curiosity (2017) to a commodity (2020) to real money (2021).Related: What lies ahead for crypto and blockchain in 2021? Experts answerThe dramatic reduction of the dollar’s purchasing power during the COVID-19 pandemic will stay with people for a long time. Depreciation has a psychological effect, one that MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor calls “financial energy.” The experience of watching purchasing power vanish is a drain on people’s emotional and financial energy.Heading into 2021, consumers and investors are looking for ways not only to protect their purchasing power but increase their peace of mind. Consumers want sound money. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies can make people feel powerful.Updating Saylor’s concept, I call this psychological effect “Crypto Chi,” for the eternal circulating life force that exists in everything, according to Chinese philosophy. Crypto can act as something that enhances your financial life and overall health.Investing and using crypto can reconnect people to the notion that they control their destiny and can harness and channel their energy (whether that is in the form of money, actions, relationships, etc.) in positive ways.The idea that Bitcoin is digital gold is becoming obsolete as it reaches beyond its 2017 high. By making that leap, Bitcoin becomes the catalyst for a new idea — that fiat currencies will have digital cousins. It’s possible that major fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, euro, yen, British pound, Swiss franc and Australian dollar will have a group of digital cousins trading in the cryptocurrency market. In the foreign exchange market, daily turnover is roughly $6 trillion per day. It’s a massive market relative to crypto.This idea of crypto increasing personal health and financial power can lead cryptocurrency investors to think beyond just Bitcoin. Just as kung fu master Bruce Lee had a wide variety of ways to fend off an attack, investors now have a variety of digital currencies to invest in to protect their purchasing power and, ultimately, make their lives better — not just materially but spiritually as well.Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), Dash and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) are used as payment methods in the emerging market world. Contrary to popular belief, we see governments taking a positive outlook toward cryptocurrencies. If 2021 is a more challenging economic environment than 2020, governments may look to crypto to help their citizens in a way they can’t. That could be why the director of National Intelligence recently urged U.S. regulators to create a more favorable environment for the expansion of crypto in the United States.As you delve into crypto research, you can see the vast potential. For example, if you research how Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance can empower people, you will see a wide variety of opportunities. For example, the big technology companies — Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google — are like mature redwood trees in a crowded forest. How much bigger can they get? In contrast, the altcoin world is like a bright green shoot popping up through fertile soil created by the Bitcoin rain. They are just getting started, and only the sky is the limit.Technology is now intricately tied to finances, which, for better or for worse, has a deep impact on our lives. When our idea of money can be elevated to a spiritual level, we can see just how important it is to invest in the things that bring us joy.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

640,"Bitcoin (BTC) is still at the “low end” of a 2021 bubble, new data tracking miner and investor behavior suggests. In the latest signal that BTC price action still has major growth potential, researcher Geert Jan Cap showed bullish signs coming from Bitcoin’s thermocap.Thermocap is a metric which aims to track Bitcoin price cycles based on actions taken by miners and investors with regards to buying and selling BTC.It employs the so-called thermocap multiple, which divides the Bitcoin price on a certain day by the cumulative block subsidy, or all rewards earned by miners from day one.The resulting value gives an insight into how profitable it is to sell at a given price point, and therefore why price volatility may have ensued at various times in Bitcoin’s history.“It shows when a bubble in the price was present with a very high signal to noise ratio,” an introduction to the metric explains, adding that thermocap also “enables comparison of the bubble peaks” and “appears to show a relatively constant value of the multiple for ‘healthy’ price levels” among other benefits.As of Jan. 17, 2021, Bitcoin’s thermocap multiple stood at 17.5, down from a recent high of 20 earlier in the month.Given that bubble activity historically occurs between 16 and 60, it is immediately apparent that Bitcoin still has considerable room to explore this bull cycle.“We're still in the low end of the '21 bubble phase,” Cap summarized in accompanying Twitter comments.In terms of how hodlers cause and react to price events, meanwhile, statistician Willy Woo believes that a cycle of weak hands selling during every bear market in Bitcoin’s lifespan is a provable phenomenon which takes precedence over changing narratives.On Sunday, Woo highlighted Bitcoin’s realized price — U.S. dollars stored in the network — being higher than the spot price during bottoms both in late 2018 and March 2020. In the former instance, BTC/USD fell 85% versus its prior top near $20,000.“Weak hands (buyers who buy under FOMO) always capitulate allowing strong handed thoughtful buyers to get bargains,” he commented.The comments are particularly timely given recent market trends as Bitcoin climbed to $42,000, sold off to $30,000 and then hit $40,000 once more, all within a week.As Cointelegraph reported, data highlighted small-balance wallets decreasing, while the number of wallets with a balance of 1,000 BTC or more grew. A transfer of bitcoins from small investors to whales was in progress, analysts warned, appealing to sellers not to part with their funds during such volatile conditions.“The narrative for each bear and bull market changes cycle to cycle, but the effective mechanism is the same,” Woo concluded."
641,"The crypto industry has boomed over the past 12 months. While 2019 began with a total market cap of $200 billion, the explosion in Bitcoin’s value resulted in this figure surging fivefold as 2020 began — and according to CoinMarketCap, the digital assets space was collectively worth $1 trillion at one point.However, as the crypto sector continues to grow and flourish, so too does crypto-related crime. Virtual assets worth $3.8 billion were lost to fraud in 2019. This figure rose to almost $4.9 billion in 2020.Fraud, money laundering and the financing of terrorism are not issues that are exclusive to the cryptocurrency sector — and every financial system on Earth has had to take action to ensure its infrastructure isn’t used for illicit purposes. But now, regulators around the world are stepping up their efforts to clamp down on criminal activity — and this has the potential to affect operations for crypto service providers, many of whom are still behind the curve.Mainstream media coverage of digital assets has increased dramatically in recent months, with countless column inches devoted to BTC’s current bull run. This increased exposure also results in newfound scrutiny, especially when exchanges fall victim to high-profile hacks. Thankfully, there are ways for crypto businesses to take action, to protect their operations, and to work in the interests of their consumers in the process.Amid the fractured landscape of regulatory developments for crypto, one of the most important sets of guidelines has come from the Financial Action Task Force, which has 39 members including the European Commission, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.The FATF recently unveiled a series of red flag indicators that suggest potentially suspicious activity is taking place — or possible attempts by entities to evade law enforcement. For example, the size and frequency of transactions could set off alarm bells for compliance officers, especially if such repeated payments are made that fall just underneath the threshold for reporting.Other issues may arise where deposits are made using bank accounts that use a different name to the one registered with a crypto exchange, where mixers and tumblers are used to obfuscate the origins of BTC payments, or where potentially suspicious IP addresses are used.At first, it might seem like a nightmare for virtual asset service providers to introduce safeguards that quickly detect when these red flag indicators emerge. In a competitive marketplace, some will be concerned about the costs associated with stopping high-risk transactions in their tracks — as well as the disruption that their operations could face if legitimate activity is mistaken for something more sinister.But platforms do exist that can monitor new transactions in real time — instantaneously assigning a risk score to each and every transaction. This is by no means a straightforward task, as the high volume of transactions running through blockchains daily means that analysis needs to take place continuously and without interruption.The speed with which bad actors can execute transactions also means that compliance systems need to be fast acting — identifying centers of suspicious activity, and creating meaningful connections to other wallets where potentially illegally acquired funds are distributed. Past data may also be used to anticipate future events, meaning that exchanges can receive a warning that potentially risky activity is about to happen — even if a transaction hasn’t been confirmed yet.The benefits associated with this type of software aren’t hypothetical. In late September, KuCoin announced that close to $280 million was stolen from its exchange as a result of a security breach. Analytics tools enabled the company to track down and freeze these funds so they couldn’t be laundered further — and 84% of the assets taken were later recovered.The technical nature of blockchain — along with the prevalence of crypto scams — has caused a significant image problem for Bitcoin in society. But despite missteps in the first decade of its existence, aspects of blockchain design champion transparency and security — meaning it can offer far greater levels of protection than older financial systems. If $500,000 in banknotes are stolen from a bank vault, the funds could end up being far harder to track down than if the same amount was taken in BTC from an exchange that has safeguards in place.Crystal Blockchain says its analytics platform enables compliance officers and anti-fraud departments to stop illicit activity in its tracks — and monitoring can either be performed manually or automatically as settings are configurable by the user.This is achieved by understanding the provenance of funds being sent over the blockchain, their connections, their flow paths, and by alerting crypto service providers if these assets are stolen or fraudulent. Addresses and bank cards can be linked to fraud, extortion, ransomware and darknet marketplaces. Businesses can also be alerted when entities are attempting to deposit to or withdraw funds from accounts and exchanges that have little or no due diligence procedures in place.Institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies is happening at a staggering rate — and as we head into 2021 and beyond, Wall Street is ramping up efforts to ensure it has the infrastructure required for traders to gain exposure to digital assets. But this comes with an expectation of a mature marketplace, meaning crypto service providers need to take the necessary actions to ensure they aren’t operating in the Wild West any more.Marina Khaustova, the CEO of Crystal Blockchain, told Cointelegraph: “The crypto industry is relatively young, and as the technology develops it also brings with it unique compliance requirements. We need to combine the best practices of the more mature financial industries with the knowledge amassed by crypto market experts to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism. By assisting with fraud identification and suspicious activity monitoring on the blockchain, Crystal aims to improve safety and trust in the global financial markets.”Disclaimer.

642,"Huobi Korea, the South Korean arm of the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has been certified by a major regulator.According to an announcement on Jan. 18, the Korea Internet and Security Agency, or KISA, has granted Huobi Korea an information security management system, or ISMS, certification. The ISMS certification will provide Huobi Korea with a comprehensive management system to ensure security and compliance with the Special Payment Act — new legislation requiring local crypto businesses to report transactions in line with revised Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering policies. Specifically, exchanges must report the real names of their users to the Korean Financial Intelligence Unit in addition to verifying them against personal data, such as resident registration numbers. The Special Payment Act will come into force in March 2021.Park Si-deok, CEO of Huobi Korea, said that the acquisition of ISMS will further strengthen the company’s position as a provider of institutional-level crypto services. As previously reported, Huobi Korea officially launched trading in March 2018.While Huobi continues to cement its position in South Korea, some global crypto exchanges have faced some issues in maintaining their business in the country. Binance KR, the South Korean wing of the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance, shut down operations due to low volumes in January 2021."
643,"Some analysts say that the price of Bitcoin (BTC) could drop to $27,000 in a bearish scenario if it falls through the $30,000 support area.The potential drop to $27,000 is conditional in that BTC would have to break down below $30,500, where it strongly bounced from on Jan. 11.In the foreseeable future, there are three key technical levels at play for Bitcoin: $34,500, $30,500, and $27,000.$34,500 has been acting as a critical support area throughout the past 72 hours. Each time BTC dropped to this level, it recovered fairly quickly to around $36,300.If $34,500 breaks, the next major support level is $30,500. This is where Bitcoin recovered from in the big correction on Jan. 11, when $2 billion worth of futures contracts were liquidated.A pseudonymous trader known as “Alex,” for example, said that if Bitcoin heads back down to $30,000 with no visible buyer reaction, the trade would be to wait for $27,000 or a move back up above $30,000. He said:Similarly, another popular pseudonymous trader known as “Mayne” said that losing $33,000 would likely result in $27,000. Prior to the weekly candle open on Jan. 18, the trader wrote:Alex emphasized that altcoins would likely get “obliterated” with 30% to 50% corrections if Bitcoin falls back down to $27,000.Altcoins are typically less liquid and have a much lower volume than Bitcoin. Hence, during a bear cycle, altcoins often see steeper pullbacks compared to BTC. The trader explained:So far, Bitcoin is slowly recovering from the $34,500 support level, which is a positive trend. It also marks a whale cluster support level, meaning that whales are likely to protect that level with buy orders.The presence of whale clusters at $34,500 explains why Bitcoin has been seeing strong bounces in that area in the last 48 hours. In the near term, the key to a convincing recovery would be protecting this level."
644,"Russian cryptocurrency exchange Livecoin has announced it is shutting down after abruptly halting operations in late December 2020.According to Livecoin’s main page, the exchange is unable to continue operations due to financial and technical damages caused by an alleged attack on its servers in late 2020. Livecoin announced the shutdown on Jan. 16 on Twitter, linking to its new domain “Livecoin.news.” Livecoin’s previous domain Livecoin.net is not available at publishing time.Livecoin said that it is looking to “pay the remaining funds” to its clients, asking users to contact the exchange via email to complete verification. In order to initiate the procedure, Livecoin users have to send their usernames and the registration date on the platform.The exchange promised to provide detailed instructions in a reply, noting that reimbursement claims will be accepted until March 17, 2021. “After this date no new requests will be accepted,” Livecoin said. The exchange did not specify when Livecoin expects to repay its customers.Livecoin also warned users about unofficial Livecoin chat groups that may be spreading false information and trying to defraud users. “Participating in these groups you run a high risk, because we [do not have any] groups,” Livecoin wrote, claiming that its website is the only source of official information. The company also said that there is an ongoing investigation.Livecoin did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.As previously reported, Livecoin halted operations on Dec. 24, claiming that the exchange suffered a “carefully planned attack” causing it to lose control of all of its servers.As part of the incident, hackers managed to take over Livecoin’s infrastructure and modify the prices on the exchange to abnormally high values. As such, Livecoin reportedly traded Bitcoin (BTC) at above $300,000, while its market price amounted to around $24,000 at the time. Some users subsequently suggested that Livecoin's “hack” could be an exit scam.While Livecoin urges its users to stay away from media channels, its supposed clients are struggling to get their funds back using Livecoin’s unofficial Telegram group. Some reported users speculated that Livecoin’s latest announcement could have been made by hackers, while others filed complaints with local enforcement proceedings.Some users have refused to send their personal data to Livecoin over privacy concerns. One alleged exchange user provided a list of data supposedly required by Livecoin’s reimbursement procedure including passport scans, residence information, high-resolution selfies, data about the first transaction on the exchange, devices used on the platform, as well as a video of a withdrawal of the first incoming transaction."
645,"Bitcoin (BTC) is back in familiar territory as the week begins after a weekend spent ranging in its new, albeit large, trading corridor above $30,000.With the United States presidential inauguration just days away, Cointelegraph takes a look at what else may be able to shake up BTC price action.The inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden comes as the strength of the U.S. dollar continues to rebound.On Monday, the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY), which measures USD relative to a basket of major trading partner currencies, hit its highest level since Dec. 21.The sustained upside in DXY tends to mean that Bitcoin growth takes a breather, this inverse correlation forming a conspicuous pattern throughout 2020. In the event, BTC/USD had little to lose during the latest gains, the majority of which were preserved despite huge volatility.DXY was likewise unfazed by Biden’s decision to spend another $1.9 trillion in debt-financed coronavirus support, something that was described last week as “another multi trillion dollar advertisement for Bitcoin” by Gemini exchange co-founder, Tyler Winklevoss.As Cointelegraph reported, however, analysts still favor dollar weakness to continue in the long term. Even traditional market participants continued to eye the extent of USD supply increases, a move which has shocked many into considering Bitcoin as an alternative store of value.“A currency market isn't different from any other market,” William Dinning, chief investment officer of U.K. fund manager Waverton Asset Management, told the Wall Street Journal over the weekend.Nonetheless, incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Biden has said that the U.S. will not deliberately aim to maintain a weak dollar for the benefit of trade advantages.On the markets, stocks showed indecisiveness as the week got underway, having calmed down from Biden’s announcement.Asia saw mixed performance, and with Wall Street closed for Martin Luther King Jr. day on Monday, U.S. futures were just a tad higher from Friday.The lackluster gains were curious for some, coming despite the fact that China had delivered Q4 economic growth statistics which dwarfed any expectations. As Bloomberg reported, the world’s second-largest economy grew 6.5% during the quarter, making it the only major economy to avoid a coronavirus contraction last year.“Markets needed a breather or even a pull back to justify reflationary expectations,” Ben Emons, managing director of global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors, explained to the publication.As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin continues to outpace any traditional assets in terms of gains in 2021, with correlation trending further and further towards zero for both stocks and safe havens such as precious metals.Also taking a breather in recent days is Bitcoin itself. After weeks of intensely volatile trading conditions, investors were treated to a quiet weekend, which also came as a welcome surprise to exchanges.Previously, U.S. platforms Coinbase and Kraken had suffered outages at critical price points, and fellow trading platform eToro last week warned that it may have to limit Bitcoin buy orders should the weekend produce fresh volatility.In the event, things were much quieter than anticipated, thanks to BTC/USD remaining rangebound with no real changes up or down.As Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe noted, attention was instead beginning to refocus away from Bitcoin towards altcoins.In a tweet on Monday, he reiterated the narrative that other cryptocurrencies would begin to take the limelight in the short and mid term. He summarized:A glance at the rankings confirmed the beginning of what is popularly called “Altseason,” with five of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap posting daily gains of more than 20%. In terms of weekly performance, seven tokens were up by more than 100%.Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin, was itself heading towards all-time highs, climbing past $1,200 again after a dip which saw it at one point lose $1,000 support.With that, Bitcoin’s market cap dominance was slipping further on Monday, reaching 66.3% compared to 69.5% at the start of the year.For the spot market, Bitcoin was steadily decreasing volatility as the week began. The past three days saw a narrowing of the trading range within the $30,000-$40,000 corridor, with a pattern of lower highs and higher lows known as compression taking over.As Van de Poppe noted last week, this is a welcome sign which gives the market time to recoup the strength required for an ultimate breakout of the compression structure. In Bitcoin’s case, this should result in a push towards or even through current all-time highs of $42,000.Considering the longer term, meanwhile, he forecast that in this bull cycle, Bitcoin would reach between $275,000 and $350,000. For Ether, the top lay between $7,500 and $12,500, he told Twitter followers on Friday.For fellow analyst filbfilb, meanwhile, there was still a way to go before any form of significant upwards volatility returned to Bitcoin.“Interesting fractal going on here. Turn break 40k and turn into support and its a full moon mission,” he summarized to subscribers of his dedicated Telegram channel, highlighting a chart structure which may allow a trip to the top of the trading corridor.Finally, a familiar bull signal returned to investors’ radar in recent days. A classic sign that further upside is in store for price, Bitcoin’s network fundamentals hit fresh all-time highs.For hash rate, which gives an estimate of the computing power dedicated to the Bitcoin blockchain, this came in the form of 155 exahashes per second (EH/s) on Sunday.The metric has been on a near-constant ascent since the end of December, adding 25 EH/s in just two weeks.Just as bullish was difficulty, arguably the most important fundamental metric for Bitcoin, as it offers an insight into miner health and competitiveness.After a 10.8% increase at the last automated readjustment on Jan. 9, difficulty hit a new record high of 20,607,418,304,385. The next readjustment, due in four days’ time, will add another 6%, current estimates say.Sustained upside for both indicators has traditionally been associated with price gains, these occurring after a grace period which can last up to several months."
646,"Over the past two months the open interest on Bitcoin options has held reasonably steady even as the figure increased by 118% to reach $8.4 billion as (BTC) price rose to a new all-time high. The result of Bitcoin’s price appreciation and the rising open interest on BTC options has resulted in a historic $3.8 billion expiry set for Jan. 29. To understand the potential impact of such a large expiry, investors should compare it to the volumes seen at spot exchanges. Although some data aggregators display over $50 billion to $100 billion in daily Bitcoin volume, a 2019 report authored by Bitwise Asset Management found that many exchanges employ a variety of questionable techniques to inflate trading volumes.This is why when analyzing exchange volume, it’s better to source the figure from trusted data aggregators instead of relying on the data provided by the biggest exchanges.As the above data indicates, BTC’s spot volume at exchanges averaged $12 billion over the past 30 days, a 215% increase from the previous month. This means the upcoming $3.8 billion expiry translates to 35% of spot BTC daily average volume.Exchanges offer monthly expiries, although some also hold weekly options for short-term contracts. Dec. 25, 2020 had the largest expiry on record as $2.4 billion worth of option contracts expired. This figure represented 31% of all open interest and shows how options are usually spread out throughout the year.Data from Genesis Volatility shows that Deribit’s expiry calendar for Jan. 29 holds 94,060 BTC. That unusual concentration translates to 45% of its contracts set to expire in twelve days. A similar effect holds at the remaining exchanges, although Deribit has an 85% market share overall.It is worth noting that not every option will trade at expiry as some of those strikes now sound unreasonable, especially considering there are less than two weeks left.The bullish $46,000 call options and above are now deemed worthless and the same has happened to the bearish put options below $28,000, as 68% of them are now effectively worthless. This means that only 39% of the $3.8 billion set to expire on Jan. 29 are worth exploring.Analyzing open interest provides data from trades that have alreadyd passed, whereas the skew indicator monitors options in real time. This gauge is even more relevant as BTC was trading below $25,000 just thirty days ago. Therefore, the open interest near that level does not indicate bearishness.When analyzing options, the 30% to 20% delta skew is the single most relevant gauge. This indicator compares call (buy) and put (sell) options side-by-side.A 10% delta skew indicates that call options are trading at a premium to the more bearish/neutral put options. On the other hand, a negative skew translates to a higher cost of downside protection and is a signal that traders are bearish.According to the data shown above, the last time some bearish sentiment emerged was Jan. 10 when Bitcoin price crashed by 15%. This was followed by a period of extreme optimism as the 30%-20% delta skew passed 30.Whenever this indicator surpasses 20, it reflects fear of potential price upside from market makers and professionals, and as a result, is considered bullish.While a $3.8 billion options expiry is spine tingling, nearly 60% of the options are already deemed worthless. As for the remaining open interest, bulls are mainly in control because the recent price hike to a new all-time high obliterated most of the bearish options. With the expiry moving closer, a growing number of put options will lose their value if BTC remains above the $30,000 to $32,000 range.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

647,"New data from Pantera Capital, an investment firm and hedge fund, suggests that Bitcoin’s (BTC) current price action is closely following the stock-to-follow model’s trajectory and the firm’s analysts believe BTC will reach $115,212 by Aug. 1. Bitcoin’s parabolic rally may have placed the price a bit ahead of the model’s projection and this week’s 28% correction sent temporary shivers across the market but sharp corrections and short consolidation periods are characteristic of bull markets.The model focuses on the price impact of Bitcoin halving events that cut the amount of Bitcoin minted every block in half every 4 years.According to the model, the impact of decreasing Bitcoin’s supply becomes present roughly 6 months after each halving. When Bitcoin price halved on May 11, 2020 the price was around $8,000 and 6 months later BTC was trading above $15,000 and on the verge of entering a parabolic rally to a new all-time high.The chart above shows the progress of Bitcoin’s price in the days after each halving. A similar pattern developed over the past two halvings, just with a differing time span. The current BTC performance appears to be in between the 2012 market 2016 cycles, which has the potential to lead to a price of Bitcoin between $300,000 and $400,000 around 450 days after the last halving, or roughly Aug. 4.Another significant difference between this rally and 2017 has to do with the overall market composition and where value is located. A majority of the value of the current market is consolidated in Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) as institutional investors have thus far chosen the most established chains to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency sector.Andy Yee, a Public Policy Director for Visa in Greater China, pointed to this development in a Tweet response to Pantera’s report:As shown in the chart above, Bitcoin and Ether have 86% of the value. The other 5,000 chains have 14%. While BTC was peaking late in 2017, the two top coins had a total of 52% of the value, indicating that BTC and ETH have consolidated their market share over the past three years.Possible reasons for this shift in funds include institutional money focusing on Bitcoin as an entry point into the cryptocurrency market due to its network security and vast mining infrastructure, and the burgeoning decentralized finance ecosystem which is predominantly built on the Ethereum network.As the DeFi ecosystem continues to grow it will also attract institutional attention, further boosting the price of Ether as it is required to interact with all smart contracts and DeFi platforms on the Ethereum network.Data from defipulse shows that the total value locked in DeFi now stands at $29.98 billion, near its all-time high of $23.116 billion.As the TVL increases, so does the value of the top ecosystem coins including AAVE and Synthetix (SNX). Trading volume on the top decentralized exchanges, such as Uniswap and SushiSwap, continues to grow with data from Dune Analytics showing that the combined weekly DEX volume recently surpassed $13 billion.While Bitcoin and Ether currently hold 86% of the cryptocurrency market value, past market cycles would indicate the possible flow of funds out of the top cryptocurrencies and into promising new projects. This dynamic has led analysts like Raoul Pal to suggest that after Bitcoin and Ether’s stellar rally, the “next stop will be higher risk alts.”Media have also reported that Goldman Sachs is rumored to be preparing to offer custody services for cryptocurrencies could set the stage for the next hype cycle for Bitcoin. A sustained inflow of money from the institutional class could be the catalyst that lifts the price of Bitcoin and keeps it in line with the projections of the stock-to-flow model.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

648,"Bitcoin (BTC) price has yet to recapture the $40,000 level and traders who were expecting a quick resumption of the uptrend may have been caught off guard by the recent pullback. This could have led to the liquidation of about $500 million worth of cryptocurrency futures positions in the past 24 hours.Over leveraged positions provide the necessary ammunition during the uptrend, but they become a liability when the trend reaches an inflection point.When the markets turn down, leveraged long positions quickly turn into a loss, resulting in margin calls from brokers. When the margin requirements are not met, the brokers dump the positions at market price, leading to a sharp plunge.Therefore, data indicating a reduction in leveraged Bitcoin positions in the past few days is a positive sign as it decreases the risk of cascading liquidati.While a sharp fall is usually avoided when the markets are not overleveraged, sustained buying is needed to maintain the higher levels. If that does not happen, the price continues to correct gradually.Grayscale Investments has been one of the major buyers in the past few months but they now have a new competitor, Osprey Funds, which began quoting in the over-the-counter market on Jan. 15 under the ticker symbol OBTC. The firm is offering a competitive management fee structure compared to Grayscale.This is a positive sign for crypto markets because if both these firms attract institutional investors, the buying may resume and Bitcoin can reverse course to pursue new highs.While Bitcoin remains stuck in a range, select altcoins are running hard. Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may be favored by the bulls in the next few days.Bitcoin is currently consolidating in an uptrend. The price action of the past few days has formed a symmetrical triangle, which generally acts as a continuation pattern. The long tail on today’s candlestick shows the bulls are buying the dips to the 20-day exponential moving average ($34,241).The upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive territory suggest that bulls are in control. If the buyers can push the price above the triangle, the next leg of the uptrend could begin.The first stop could be the current all-time high at $41,959.63, but if the bulls can propel the price above it, the BTC/USD pair may rally towards the pattern target at $50,000.Contrary to this assumption, if the rebound fails to find buyers at higher levels, the bears may try to sink the price below the triangle. If they succeed, the pair may drop to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $29,688.10.This level may attract buyers but if the bulls fail to push the price above the 20-day EMA, then the correction could deepen to the 50-day simple moving average ($26,581).The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls have purchased the drop to the support line of the symmetrical triangle but they may face resistance at the moving averages that are sloping down.If the price turns down from the moving averages, the bears will try to sink the price below the triangle. If they succeed, a deeper correction is likely.On the contrary, if the bulls can push the price above the moving averages, the pair may rise to the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle. A breakout of this resistance may start the uptrend.However, if the price turns down from the resistance line of the triangle, the pair may trade inside the triangle for a few more days.Chainlink (LINK) broke above the $20.1111 resistance on Jan. 15 and followed it up with another up-move on Jan. 16, hitting a new all-time high at $22.96. But the long wick on the Jan. 16 candlestick suggests profit-booking at higher levels.The price rebounded off the $20.1111 breakout level today, suggesting that the bulls have flipped this level to support. If the bulls can now push the price above $23, the LINK/USD pair could rally to $27 and then to $30.The upsloping 20-day EMA ($16.25) and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest bulls are in control.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below $20.1111, the next stop is likely to be $17.7777. This is an important support because a break below it will indicate a possible change in trend.The 4-hour chart shows the breakout above $20.1111 had pushed the RSI deep into the overbought territory, which may have attracted profit-booking from short-term traders.However, the positive sign is that the bulls aggressively purchased the dip to the 20-EMA. If the bulls can sustain the price above $21.5709, the pair may retest $22.96. A break above this resistance may resume the uptrend. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest bulls have the upper hand.This bullish view will invalidate if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-EMA. Such a move could pull the price down to $17.7777, indicating the momentum has weakened.Uniswap (UNI) is currently in an uptrend but is facing selling above the $9 mark as seen from the long wick on Jan. 16 and today’s candlestick. If the bulls do not give up much ground, it will suggest traders are not rushing to the exit after the recent rally and are buying on dips.The upsloping 20-day EMA ($6.15) and the RSI in the overbought territory suggest bulls have the upper hand. If the UNI/USD pair stays above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $7.4725, the bulls will try to resume the uptrend.If they can push the price above $9.3776, the rally could extend to $12.4597 and then to $15.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below $7.4725, the pair may drop to the 20-day EMA. Usually, a deep correction suggests that the momentum has weakened and that may result in a few days of range-bound action.The 4-hour chart shows the pair is currently consolidating after the recent sharp up-move. The bulls are buying the dip to the $8 support and the bears are selling above $9.If the bulls can push the price above the $9 to $9.3776 overhead resistance, the uptrend could resume.On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below the 20-EMA, the decline could extend to the 50-SMA. Such a move could keep the pair range-bound for a few days.Tezos (XTZ) had been stuck inside the $2.85 to $1.85 range for the past few weeks. The bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the range and start a new uptrend.However, the long wick on the Jan. 16 candlestick shows that the bulls are finding it difficult to sustain the price above the range. Today, the long wick and the tail on the candlestick indicates indecision among the bulls and the bears.If the bulls can sustain the price above $2.85, the possibility of the start of a new uptrend increase. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($2.48) and the RSI above 66, suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.The first target objective on the upside is $3.90 and then $4.4936. This bullish view will negate if the XTZ/USD pair drops and breaks below the 20-day EMA.The 4-hour chart shows the bulls had pushed the price above $2.85 but they could not build upon the strength, which led to a correction. However, the bulls aggressively purchased the dip to the 20-EMA and are now trying to drive the price above $3.1838. If they succeed, the uptrend could resume.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and drops below the 20-EMA, it could correct to the 50-SMA. A break below this support could signal that the recent breakout above $2.85 was a bull trap.Cosmos (ATOM) rose above the stiff resistance at $8.877 on Jan. 16 and made a new all-time high at $9.60. Whenever the price hits a new all-time high, it is a sign that bulls are in command.However, the bears have not given up yet as they have pulled the price back below $8.877 and are attempting to trap the aggressive bulls. The bullish momentum could weaken if the bears sink the price below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $7.093.Conversely, if the bulls can defend the zone between the 38.2% retracement at $8.05 and the 50% retracement at $7.572, it will suggest strong demand at lower levels.If the price turns up from this support zone, the bulls will try to resume the uptrend. A break above $9.60 could push the ATOM/USD pair to $12.10 and then to $13.974.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in positive territory, indicating that bulls have the advantage. The pair has bounced off the 20-EMA and the bulls will now try to push the price above the $8.877 overhead resistance.If they succeed, the pair could rise to $9.60 and a break above it will signal resumption of the uptrend. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the 20-EMA, it will suggest that the momentum has weakened and a drop to $7.50 and then to the 50-SMA is possible.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

649,"Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million, but a significant proportion of that total sum is likely lost forever. This situation is due to a variety of reasons such as lost private keys and discarded storage devices containing substantial amounts of Bitcoin (BTC).When Bitcoin owners are not being careless with their wallet passwords, they can sometimes be targeted by hackers looking to steal their precious crypto. Those who utilize third-party custodial solutions place their Bitcoin fortune at the mercy of the security protocols adopted by such services.Indeed, several attack vectors are constantly being utilized to try and gain access to people’s Bitcoin funds. These exploits, which range from the simple to the sophisticated, target any perceived weaknesses inherent in any storage method.Crypto exchanges cater to millions of customers, and it’s reasonable to assume that a significant proportion of that number uses these services as their primary Bitcoin custodian. Under such a custodial arrangement, the cryptocurrency owner does not possess the private key of the wallet.“Not your keys, not your coins” is a popular refrain in the crypto space, and the maxim serves to warn people of the risks involved in storing cryptocurrencies with third-party entities. Indeed, the crypto landscape is dotted with numerous exchange hacks where cybercriminals broke into poorly-secured platform wallets to steal customer funds.Sometimes, the exchange recovers from the theft, and other times, the platform goes bankrupt. Mt. Gox and QuadrigaCX serve as examples of the latter, with affected customers still striving to recover their funds.These days, exchanges are attempting to upgrade their security protocols to prevent hacks. Exchanges holding uninsured and substantial crypto sums in vulnerable hot wallets is now greatly discouraged. Some platforms still make this grave error and often pay the price.Crypto forensics is also evolving by the day, making it more difficult for cybercriminals to liquidate their loot. In all, 2020 saw a significant decline in the number of crypto-related thefts with rogue actors reportedly stealing $3.8 billion from over 120 attacks throughout the year. However, the emergence of decentralized exchanges has opened up another way for criminals to launder money.The reduction seen in 2020 has broken a four-year trend of increasing cryptocurrency crime. However, decentralized finance now seems to be the new playground for crypto thieves and other rogue actors with the novel market niche accounting for more than half of the stolen cryptocurrency in 2020.When it comes to robust security for self-hosted Bitcoin storage, it’s perhaps important to realize that there is no magic bullet. Indeed, Ruben Merre, CEO of hardware wallet maker NGrave, touched on this point, telling Cointelegraph that BTC owners are often torn between the choice of keeping their coins on exchanges with decreased security or in cold wallets that are typically not user-friendly.In theory, every conceivable method for holding BTC has tradeoffs, and some of the drawbacks associated with any of these systems can act as an entry point for malicious actors.Take air-gapped devices for instance. On the face of it, simply isolating a computer from the internet should provide robust security against hacks. However, according to a study recently published by Mordechai Guri, a cybersecurity researcher at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, it is possible to “generate covert Wi-Fi signals from air-gapped computers.”In the research paper, Guri established that “air-gapped networks are not immune to cyber attacks.” Indeed, a skilled hacker can exfiltrate sensitive data like keylogging credentials and biometrics from air-gapped computers.Perhaps even more alarming are portions of the research study devoted to the possible means of data exfiltration from air-gapped computers placed in Faraday cages, shielded enclosures that block electromagnetic fields. So, relying only on a Bitcoin wallet stored in a computer isolated from the internet might not be as secure as previously thought. A person utilizing this method might need to run signal jammers continuously.Then, there are hardware wallets that offer robust security with private keys stored offline. Though these devices interface with a computer when in use, they never actually connect to the internet.A hardware wallet owner needs to either encrypt their keys or store them in a safe place. For the former, if the encryption is performed using a computer that has or will be connected to the internet, then there is a significant risk of losing the keys to malware.A user can even utilize every security measure available with hardware wallets and still lose their Bitcoin. Hardware wallet maker Ledger has suffered severe breaches leading to the theft of sensitive customer information. With their phone numbers and personal addresses out in the open, several Ledger customers are facing the threat of physical attack.For Monero’s former lead developer, Riccardo Spagni, Ledger’s failure to protect customer information has exacerbated the difficult nature of secure crypto self-custody, telling Cointelegraph:An ongoing survey by NGrave revealed that 25% of crypto users are not securing their coins as well as they think. While hardware wallets might not offer the ease of use associated with keeping Bitcoin on an exchange, the consensus among commentators was that the former option is still the safest method.According to Merre, when the user opts to own their own assets, they can no longer use the centralized exchange model and have to move to decentralized exchanges, or hot wallets, like mobile apps, adding:For Spagni, Bitcoin self-custody for the less tech-savvy is a balancing act between security and ease of use. The easiest methods tend to have the least security and the most secure methods require a fair few configuration protocols.Back in November 2020, Whirlpool Stats’ Matt Odell tweeted his favorite Bitcoin storage setup that combined running Bitcoin Core and desktop-based wallet Specter with a ColdCard hardware wallet. According to Odell, the setup costs about $150 and required at least 10 gigabytes of storage space. Specter works directly with the Bitcoin Core, so combining both eliminates the need for running an Electrum server. The user can then verify transactions on ColdCard directly.For users who might find the above setup overly daunting, it’s important to include as many security layers as possible on top of their chosen storage method. These include two-factor authentication and encrypted keys, among others.It is also important to note that backups and retrieval processes for additional security protocols must be carefully stored. According to Spagni, Bitcoin owners should treat information such as seed words, wallet passwords, passphrases and encryption keys as though they were physical gold bars and keep them safely ensconced.The inability to remember key wallet data has led to many Bitcoin owners locked out of their accounts. As many as 3.7 million BTC, or 20% of the circulating supply, is thought to be lost forever. Some examples of such stories include an IT engineer accidentally discarding his BTC into the trash and now offering $72 million for an opportunity to dig it up. Meanwhile, another early-day crypto enthusiast has forgotten a password for his hard drive containing around $266 million in BTC and only has two password tries left to unlock his stash or it will be lost forever.To ensure that one does not add to that sad statistic, it’s important to treat seed words, encryption keys and the like as valuable data and guard them accordingly."
650,"Amid all the excitement of crypto’s biggest bull run in history, some assets have been outperforming even the current high-performing market. In particular, Synthetix (SNX) has been on an epic tear, leading the growth of the whole niche. The news of a Coinbase listing in December helped account for some of this. However, at the time of writing, SNX has increased by over 225% since mid-December, currently trading above $16.7 and cementing its position as one of the best-performing tokens in the ongoing rally.Beyond the Coinbase effect, the main reason for the increase in SNX’s price is the genuine demand for what Synthetix has to offer — namely digital, synthetic assets. So, why all the excitement about these instruments, and what are they used for?Like many other elements of the cryptocurrency markets, synthetics arrived from the traditional financial sector. Synthetics are used to simulate particular instruments while altering some key characteristics. This allows investors to gain exposure to underlying assets without necessarily having to hold them.In the cryptocurrency space, tokens are a digital synthetic representation of any other asset, including those in the real world, such as stocks, commodities or fiat currencies. Crypto synthetics can also be used to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies and tokens. A simple example could be some of the “wrapped” assets used in Ethereum’s DeFi applications.Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) has succeeded over recent months, which is a testament to the appetite for such assets, having risen from a market cap of around $1.1 billion in September to $4.7 billion at the peak of Bitcoin’s recent rally above $40,000. The recent release of a synthetic version of Monero could help would-be investors get around the exchange clampdown on privacy coins. It offers investors exposure to Monero (XMR) without having to navigate the ongoing delistings, while also providing an opportunity to stake Wrapped Monero (WXMR) in the various Ethereum-based decentralized finance applications.Synthetix benefits from being the first to market with a decentralized exchange that also allows users to mint synthetic assets, known as Synths, using cryptocurrencies as collateral. The platform operates SNX as its native token. Holders can use SNX as collateral to mint Synths and earn a share of fees paid by Synthetix DEX users. Therefore, the SNX token offers real utility, as it incentivizes users to create Synths on the platform and create further value for the token itself.Over the last three months, Synthetix has been undergoing significant growth, rising from around $500 million locked in late October to over $2.3 billion at the time of writing, according to DeFi Pulse.Although there are Synths that allow traders to speculate on the price of non-crypto assets, such as oil, it’s evident that the vast majority of users are taking advantage of Synthetix to gain access to synthetic USD and crypto assets, with sUSD, sEther and sBitcoin being the most popular on the platform. They account for over 75% of the total market cap of all synths, according to the Synthetix stats page.The sUSD Synth alone is around 50% of the total Synth market cap, indicating that DeFi users continue to have an appetite for stable currencies for trading. However, sUSD is also the most liquid Synth, which is tradable on centralized exchanges including Binance and KuCoin, as well as on decentralized exchanges Curve and Balancer.The most popular is the sUSD/sETH pair on the Synthetix Exchange, which currently has around $10 million in daily volume. Despite this, the number of traders using the platform is quite low, with an average of around 130 in the last 30 days. This indicates that liquidity is highly concentrated.Given the rapid expansion of decentralized finance, it seems likely that other companies will enter the space. Currently, there are two major contenders in operation.Universal Market Access is an open-source protocol that allows users to set up priceless financial contracts on Ethereum, based on templates, and prices are determined according to an oracle. Put simply, this means that developers can set up ERC-20 tokens to trade a synthetic version of any asset.Currently, there is over $63 million locked in UMA across nine projects. Of these, PerlinX allows users to generate their own synthetic assets. Like Synthetix, PerlinX uses a native token called PERL, which is staked as collateral against the synthetic asset generated. The platform launched in the third quarter of 2020 and currently has $250,000 locked, although it hit a peak above $600,000 in December, according to DeFi Pulse.At the time of writing, PerlinX hasn’t yet switched on the feature that enables a user to create their own synthetic assets, so, like Synthetix, it’s up to the application owners to decide which ones make it onto the platform. This is likely to limit the utility of the platform, so PerlinX could become a more significant rival to Synthetix once users can mint their own assets.Another project, Mirror Protocol, has recently launched on the Terra platform, which is one of the most used blockchains thanks to the Chai payments app, which has a base of 2 million users in South Korea, according to the company. Mirror appears to be in a developed state, with many “mAsset” synthetics already live. They track stocks, indexes and commodities.Currently, Mirror Protocol has around $93 million locked, so it has quite some way to go before it’s a genuine rival to Synthetix. However, liquidity has risen sharply since the launch in December. It’s also evident from the types of assets available that Mirror is attracting those wanting to speculate on the broader financial markets, whereas Synthetix is a base for the Ethereum DeFi crowd.Due to the popularity of Synthetix and the fact that there are other new market entrants poised to launch in 2021, it seems likely that synthetic crypto assets are fixed into the DeFi landscape and that the market will continue to grow.With the potential for disruption in the traditional financial markets, it’s reasonable to expect to see more competition emerge for digital synthetics that mirror all kinds of real-world assets. This is one corner of the DeFi space that’s definitely worth watching as the year pans out."
651,"Roughly $500 million worth of cryptocurrency futures positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours. The mass liquidation of positions happened before the price of Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $34,000 on Jan. 17.Overnight, the price of Bitcoin rose by 6.7% from $35,500 to nearly $38,000. Meanwhile, the futures funding rate sharply increased, indicating an overleveraged market.Across major exchanges, the funding rate of the Bitcoin perpetual swap futures contract surged to around 0.07%.Considering that the average funding rate typically hovers at around 0.01%, the futures market was overcrowded on the way up towards $38,000.As such, Bitcoin price began to drop when several large sell orders hit the market at just above $38,000.  The overheated futures market further intensified the correction.Overall, $500 million in liquidation is not a large figure compared to the past week, for example, when Bitcoin saw $1 billion in futures contracts liquidated on peak days.But the drop has not led the futures market’s open interest to decline, causing concerns for a bigger pullback. There are still a large number of traders betting on Bitcoin in the futures market, which opens up the possibility of another long squeeze.A pseudonymous trader known as “Salsa Tekila” said that if Bitcoin falls below $30,000, it would enter “bear market territory.” Hence, in the near term, it is crucial for BTC to maintain $30,000 as a macro support area. He said:Additionally, according to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, the open interest in the futures market is still skyrocketing. All the while, the on-chain signals that indicated buyer demand have stagnated in the past few days.Based on the combination of the overcrowded derivatives market and the lack of buy signals, Ki wrote that the market is uncertain and that it may retest $30,000 again. He wrote:As Cointelegraph previously reported, traders on Binance, the largest futures exchange by open interest, have started to use lower leverage in the past week. This is indicative of a heightened level of fear in the market and the lack of certainty in the short-term price trend of BTC.On the other hand, some traders remain optimistic in the medium term, explaining that the current pullback from $40,000-levels was not only expected but also much-needed for the rally not to overheat.

652,"Similar to 2017 and the popular cryptocurrency bull run, last year created a fresh buzz in the world of crypto and Bitcoin (BTC) particularly. From setting new all-time highs to making various news rounds and capturing mainstream finance’s attention, the pandemic year was exciting for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and believers.Related: Did Bitcoin prove itself to be a reliable store of value in 2020? Experts answerOne conversation that perhaps stands out amid the buzz is institutional investors’ increasing activity in crypto. Companies, financial advisers and institutions that mocked Bitcoin five years ago, or during the Silk Road saga, are now at the forefront of crypto investments. Notable big guns in finance such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have reneged on their previous stances and are now willing to make a bet on the future of digital currencies. With a market capitalization of over $600 billion, Bitcoin is quickly rising ahead of gold as a popular choice of hedge over inflation.Remember, Bitcoin was not just another asset proposed as a hedge against inflation in Satoshi’s original Bitcoins white paper. However, Bitcoin’s whole idea stemmed from the failed financial institutions and third parties and a possible solution that would be effective in everyday life.Of course, with every institutional investor and the big guns of finance swinging into Bitcoin investment, Bitcoin’s popularization as an asset has become inevitable. However, here are some of the ideal, real-world applications that could challenge failing fiat currencies and propel Bitcoin into the mainstream.In the past, Bitcoin was mostly perceived as a means to bypass the government and engage in illegal activities. However, crypto adoption has continued to soar tremendously, and many more companies are now open to accepting Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrencies as payment for goods or services.In 2014, using BitPay as its payment processor, Microsoft became one of the first tech companies to accept Bitcoin to purchase digital goods. In October 2020, the popular American payments company PayPal announced that it would enable cryptocurrency as a funding source for purchases in 2021. With different fiat payment merchants now recognizing Bitcoin, there’s an increasing likelihood that Bitcoin will be used by everyone soon enough in every corner of the world.Related: Will PayPal’s crypto integration bring crypto to the masses? Experts answerIf there’s any lesson learned from last year and throughout the ravaging global pandemic, it is the ever-increasing need for digitization. While there are several ways to send and receive money globally, cryptocurrencies are quickly becoming a preferred option. Besides the fact that cryptocurrency is a global currency, factors including speed, convenience and lower transaction fees are pushing Bitcoin as the popular option for cross-border transactions.Related: How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the crypto space? Experts answerMany countries that once outlawed Bitcoin are now open to it, and the mainstream media has been more than receptive in the past couple of months. Some companies already provide travel packages that allow tourists and travelers to book flights, hotels and transportation using cryptocurrency. With time, the foreign exchange market’s many disadvantages may popularize traveling with crypto ahead of local or fiat currencies.In all fairness, the goal has never been to phase out local currencies but to create a world where Bitcoin is as relevant as any fiat currency. Bitcoin ATMs are, without a doubt, a huge part of this goal. They essentially allow anyone to purchase Bitcoin with a credit card; with some Bitcoin ATMs, you can also sell Bitcoin for cash.The number of Bitcoin ATMs worldwide is more than 13,000 in 71 countries. While there’s a long way to go with these ATMs, there has been an increasing trend every year with an average of one ATM now being added every hour. Without a doubt, Bitcoin ATMs are a big part of the crypto revolution, and they’re only going to get better in operation.While cryptocurrencies are quickly becoming part of our digitized world, the underlying blockchain technology has also played a crucial role in revolutionizing many industries. Supply chains, healthcare, and the food and auto industries have benefitted immensely from this revolution over the past 10 years.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

653,"Bitcoin’s parabolic increase well above its previous all-time-high has many experiencing déjà vu from 2017 and a number of analysts are concerned the market is overdue for a sizable correction. On Jan. 8 With Bitcoin (BTC) price reached a new all-time high at $41,940 and this week’s 28% collapse to $31,076 had professional and retail investors afraid that a strong trend reversal was in the making.Bitcoin’s historical data shows that rapid parabolic ascents are usually followed by equally catastrophic corrections like the one seen after the 2017 bull run. Because of this, the current market’s similarities to the euphoric mania of 2017 to 2018 bull run have not gone unnoticed.Cane Island global macro investment manager Timothy Peterson recently pointed out that:In a follow-up private conversation with Cointelegraph Peterson noted that there remains a short term bull case for Bitcoin stating:There are some telltale signs that Bitcoin’s quick gains reflect a manic market on the verge of a correciton and the current bull versus bear debate centers around whether this week’s volatility is a healthy pullback to test lower supports before the price initiates the next move higher.LookIntoBitcoin founder and Decentrader analyst Philip Swift recently made the case that Bitcoin’s recenet price action reflected a “needed pullback/slowdown” and he noted that several indicators were flashing red, indicating that the rate of BTC’s price appreciation was reaching extremes.Swift said:Swift’s analysis indicates that BTC is likely to trade sideways and slowly ascend in the near term but at a slower rate “as some money/profit rotates into altcoins.” Recent price moves in altcoins, especially DeFi-related tokens indicate that this rotation might already be underway.While analysts and chart watchers are calling for Bitcoin to take a breather, bullish traders may have indicated that they have different plans. At multiple instances this week, bulls defended retest of lower support by buying into each dip and there is also the expectation that institutional inflow into BTC will resume now that Grayscale has re-opened its GBTC family of products.A look at the 30-day average daily sentiment score for Bitcoin shows that despite the pullback, the average score has only decreased slightly from recent highs and is well above the lows seen during previous downcycles.While few know the exact course Bitcoin’s price action will take this weekend, the strengthening fundamentals from a technical perspective, increased institutional inflow and positive announcements by government regulators suggest that the recent dips were nothing more than healthy corrections that were bound to occur before Bitcoin gears up to reach for a new all-time high.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

654,"Risk management is a vital element of success for any trader in any market. No matter the size of the capital you’re trading with or investing in, losses are going to be inevitable, particularly in highly volatile markets like cryptocurrency. Learning how to manage risk to minimize losses is vital. Yet, it’s also necessary to master risk management in order to ensure maximum gains. After all, the more you’re willing to risk, the greater the potential reward.Even experienced traders with impressive track records of reading the market can lose it all on one or two bad trades if they fail to employ proper risk management or let their emotions get in the way. The enticement of “hitting the jackpot” or chasing market sentiment can be too strong, allowing traders to become clouded or overconfident.To prevent sweeping losses and allow traders to trade with a cool head, the very basic trading tools and forms of risk management must be used at the very least. These include establishing trading rules, such as market orders, limit orders and stop-loss orders, that allow traders to limit their losses by triggering an action when certain conditions are met.With these types of mechanisms in place, traders can take a break from the screen and trade with confidence, knowing that they can limit their losses or take profit at an acceptable level. At what limit this is set will depend on the risk appetite of the investor and the amount of capital they are willing to lose on a given trade.Another way of managing risk is, of course, the golden rule of always keeping a diversified portfolio spread out over several assets. This will allow you to gain exposure to more assets while hedging losses and ensuring that one bad investment doesn’t wipe out all your capital.Last year in the cryptocurrency space, we saw astronomical growth with astounding gains from most major coins. Decentralized finance ignited a passion for yield farming and earning an attractive passive income on crypto assets, as well as enabling an entire ecosystem of borrowing and lending away from traditional finance. Against the backdrop of a struggling global economy due to the global pandemic and near-negative yield on cash savings, investors are turning to the crypto space in droves.We’ve seen massive endorsements from institutional investors and major names, such as MicroStrategy, Guggenheim, PayPal and Square all lending legitimacy and fanning the flames of “institutional FOMO.” Bitcoin (BTC) has shot up like a rocket this year, blasting through its previous all-time high thanks to this action from institutions. MicroStrategy alone purchased more than 70,000 BTC last year, showing continued bullish support.And as adoption from institutional investors grows, so does the need for more sophisticated ways of managing risk that go beyond basic market orders and allow professional and institutional traders to execute highly flexible and creative strategies that spread their risk across all assets and amplify the potential rewards.Until now, such institutional-grade products in regards to risk management have been out of the purview of cryptocurrency exchanges. However, if we are to respond to the needs of this type of investor, serious exchanges must provide the infrastructure that institutions require, including the ability to cross-collateralize their positions and manage their risk more effectively.Through features such as unified account management (otherwise known as Portfolio Margin), traders can manage all their accounts, trades and crypto assets from within one single interface. But more importantly, they can unify all their assets and trade with any instrument, using all of their purchasing power.For example, let’s say a trader wants to enter an ETH/USD futures trade. With a unified account, they can do this efficiently without having to purchase Ether (ETH) and by simply using any of their existing crypto collateral. This is much more convenient for traders and also reduces the fees associated with buying altcoins with Tether (USDT) or BTC. It also allows them to take a much larger risk and position to amplify their earnings and substantially improve margin efficiency.Risk management is probably the most important part of investing. If the crypto space is going to continue to grow and attract and retain the interest of institutional traders, we need advanced risk-management tools that can maximize gains for investors — and nudge the crypto market cap into the trillions of dollars where it rightfully belongs.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

655,"The leverage used in the Bitcoin (BTC) futures market has fallen significantly in the past several days. This indicates that traders are generally uncertain about where BTC is heading in the near term.In the Bitcoin futures market, traders can borrow up to 125 times of their initial capital to trade Bitcoin.This allows traders to enter into massive Bitcoin positions that are often much larger than the capital that they have.During uptrends, traders tend to overleverage their positions because they anticipate bigger upside price movements. But, when the market becomes choppy and extremely volatile, traders become fearful.If the leverage used in the Bitcoin futures market drops, it simply means that traders are borrowing less capital to trade BTC. It shows a sign of fear, which is likely prompting traders to enter into safer positions with a lower risk of liquidation.There are a few reasons why traders could be fearful in the current phase of the market. First, Bitcoin rejected the $40,000 resistance level after $42,000. Second, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) is recovering. Third, the high selling pressure coming from Asia.Filbfilb, a pseudonymous Bitcoin trader, referred to the sell-off on Jan. 16 as a “high IQ play.” He noted that the rise of the U.S. dollar gave it momentum and traders continued to buy every dip.As a result, despite the price of Bitcoin declining, the funding rate of the futures market consistently increased. Filbfilb wrote:The trader also noted that there was a high level of selling pressure coming from Asia. Hence, he explained that buy bids needed to get filled, which led to a correction. He said:After a major shakeout, a bullish reversal typically ensues. Many traders were likely shaken out of their positions in the recent correction, considering that it dropped below $36,000.The funding rate of the Bitcoin futures market also briefly reset, hinting that the number of long contracts significantly decreased after the drop.With the derivatives market cooled off, the probability of a reversal to the upside has increased. In the short term, the key resistance area for Bitcoin still remains $40,000, followed by $42,000.David Puell, a Bitcoin trader, also noted that the Grayscale premium has increased, which is indicative of a bullish uptrend."
656,"The wonder of the universe is that it is always in motion and, because of this, that everything changes over time. So, anything can be something completely different tomorrow, just like that — no guarantees.Karl Marx expressed this brilliantly with the phrase ""All that is solid melts into air."" The same occurred with Bitcoin (BTC), which over the years has undergone transformations, and from a cypherpunk idea, it has become a simple Che Guevara T-shirt.The following words, which Eric Hughes published in “A Cypherpunk's Manifesto,” was the great orientation of the developers in the creation of e-cash, or electronic money, that was universal, private and without control:It was this idea that gave rise to Bitcoin, a decentralized money oriented toward privacy and for each one to be their own bank.“Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”: This phrase from The Times is even recorded forever in the genesis block of the Bitcoin blockchain. However, time has transformed Bitcoin, and from a restricted circle of cryptographers, BTC has conquered the world and arrived at the International Monetary Fund, Bank for International Settlements, G-20 and G-8. Who knows — before the moon, it can reach Mars.So, as Bitcoin changed, so did the ideas around it. The desire for privacy gave way to “to the moon,” and the fruit of a manifesto became just another product of what we wanted to “fight.”Today, instead of the phrases “include unbanked people” and “be your own bank,” we celebrate that major traditional banks advertise Bitcoin custody services. Instead of privacy, we rush to take selfies with documents in search of higher limits for trades, leverage, options and futures. We are happy that billionaire funds and big companies and corporations are buying all the Bitcoin they can, believing that they are now also “Bitcoiners.”In politics, there is a phrase that says that if you did something so good and so wonderful to change the world that even your opponents are applauding you, it means you did everything wrong.We are applauding the great capitalists — those who were bailed out by the governments, those who caused the economic crises and those same banks that spit in our face. We are happy today to sit beside them and sell our Bitcoin to them, believing that they love us.We celebrate that countries create “regulations” for Bitcoin, highlighting that it brings “security” to the crypto industry, and we’re “proud” to see that the biggest companies in the market are collaborating with authorities to “reveal” hackers and malicious agents.Many big players are ashamed to say that Bitcoin is used by hackers, and they forget the history of BTC and its main objective: to be anonymous money.We accept giving up our privacy to sit at the table with those we criticize all the time, thinking that they really love us when, in fact, they are only looking for profits.Stamping “Fiat is a shitcoin” on dollar bills is like being an ""independent"" teenager who decides to live alone but whose parents pay rent, buy food and do the laundry. What matters is the dollar value that Bitcoin will break — $30,000, $50,000, $100,000 or $300,000 — inventory, and flow... To the moon.“Fiat sucks,” but the more Bitcoin is worth in U.S. dollars, the better. After all, what matters is that 1 Bitcoin will always be equivalent to 1 Bitcoin. It matters how much I bought and how much I hope to sell in order to buy more.We went so far as to find “silly” people who traded Bitcoin for pizzas or acted like Sirius, who sold 5,000 BTC to help create the first Bitcoin exchange. Hold, hold and hold so that it can be worth more and more — I just heard that.Accumulate, accumulate, accumulate and accumulate more and more value in Bitcoin. After all, it is the “digital gold” and “value reserve” of a new era. But the new normal is nothing but the old normal with a new face.Whales went from names like “Joe007” to Paul Tudor Jones, MassMutual, MicroStrategy and other “institutional” investors — the same ones that will be bailed out by the government if a bankruptcy approaches.I have nothing against this. After all, ""Lamborghini"" and ""Bitcoin lifestyle"" were already part of this market, and the world, like all things, is always in transformation.I am happy to buy my Bitcoin, just as I buy a Che Guevara T-shirt and light a cigarette, believing that I am “fighting” the system while I wait for my mom to bring me dinner.To the moon. Or better, “to Mars,” in Elon Musk style.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

657,"Calls for Bitcoin (BTC) to rally above $40,000 were dashed as the top cryptocurrency hit a wall of resistance which sparked a sell-off in the early trading hours. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView show the price of BTC fell as low as $34,368 before rebounding to its current price of $37,300.It’s possible that the excitement surrounding the announcement of a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill from the incoming Biden administration quickly morphed into a buy the rumor, sell the news event as questions begin to emerge on the feasibility of parts of the bill.Bitcoin’s dip also comes after renewed criticism from global regulators as European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde recently stated that the top cryptocurrency is ""totally reprehensible money laundering activity."" This was followed by an announcement on Jan. 15 that a British financial advisor has petitioned the U.K. Government and Parliament to ban cryptocurrency transactions.Tough words from government officials weren’t the sole cause of the downturn in the cryptocurrency market as a scan of the global financial markets shows signs of mounting pressure.The S&P 500 and NASDAQ faced pressure from the opening bell and finishing the day down 0.72% and 0.73% respectively. The Dow managed to push back against bears to close the day up by 0.3%A broader survey of the global markets show gold and silver closed down 1.07%, and 3.17%, while oil and the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond lost 2.93% and 3.59%.Despite increased sell pressure across the market, several altcoins showed strength. Chainlink (LINK) experienced a surge overnight and currently trades at $20.50, up 13.9% in the 24-hours. Cosmos (ATOM) has gained 21.62% and trades at $7.81.Meanwhile, Ether (ETH) has faced the same pressures as the broader Bitcoin. At the time of writing the top-altcoin is down 4.8%% and trades for $1,172.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 68%."
658,"A firm called Osprey Funds is offering an over-the-counter, or OTC, Bitcoin (BTC) trust under the ticker symbol OBTC. The trust is similar to Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust, known as GBTC.“The Osprey Bitcoin Trust provides easy access to bitcoin,” the firm’s website says. “With a 0.49% management fee, it is the lowest cost solution.” Osprey is an entity that “builds digital asset solutions for intelligent investors,” claiming OBTC as its “flagship offering,” the website adds.""OBTC began being quoted in the OTC market today, Friday 1/15,"" Osprey Funds' CEO, Greg King, told Cointelegraph, adding:Competitor Grayscale has become one of the largest Bitcoin holders in the world, possessing over 500,000 BTC as of November 2020. The firm is behind GBTC, which serves as a way to buy Bitcoin in stock share form. Each share of GBTC represents a fraction of a Bitcoin — 0.00094 BTC per share at the time of publication, based on Grayscale’s website. Interested parties buy and sell shares over-the-counter, available on mainstream brokerage platforms.GBTC, in part, offers the public easier access to Bitcoin through more traditional avenues, without requiring them to custody their own funds. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust comes with a yearly 2% management fee, however. Osprey’s recently unveiled BTC trust touts a fee of 0.49%. “Osprey is likely trying to capture some of that market share by undercutting GBTC’s fee, according to Bloomberg Intelligence,” Bloomberg wrote in a report on Friday. Osprey has called on Fidelity as the custodian for the endeavor. Osprey's Bitcoin fund, however, operates under a Reg. D SEC exemption, while GBTC holds Reg. A and D exemptions, allowing for non-accredited investors to access the fund, albeit with limits on total shares that can circulate among non-accredited investors.“We are always happy to see digital currency access products enter the market, especially here in the U.S.,” Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein told Bloomberg. “Accredited investors face a $25,000 minimum to buy directly into the trust,” Bloomberg wrote. “Shares have a lock-up period of one year before they can be sold in the secondary market.” In contrast, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust requires assets to be locked up for six months. Osprey could see its 12-month lock-up cut in half in the future, however, based on King’s comments to Bloomberg.Wilshire Phoenix, an investment firm, filed for a similar product with the Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2020."
659,"Grayscale products witnessed $3.3 billion in inflows in the fourth quarter of 2020, a large jump over the $1.05 billion seen in the preceding quarter. According to Grayscale, institutional investors accounted for 93% of the new investments. The significance and magnitude of the investments can be gauged from the fact that in 20, Grayscale received $5.7 billion in investments, which is four times the cumulative inflow between 2013 and 2019Data from Glassnode also shows that since July 2020, only about one-third of the 900 Bitcoin (BTC) mined each day have made their way to exchanges. During that period, Grayscale alone purchased about 1,200 Bitcoin every day. This shows how demand exceeded supply by a huge margin, resulting in the sharp rally which was ignited in the latter half of 2020.However, after Bitcoin’s recent rise, larger inflows are needed to sustain the momentum. If this does not happen, select investors may be tempted to lock in their gains and that could start a correction with speculators and short-term traders rushing to the exit.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the path of least resistance.Bitcoin’s recovery hit a barrier at $40,0129 on Jan. 14 and the price has again turned down today. The bulls are currently attempting to defend the 20-day exponential moving average at $33,795.The price action of the past few days has formed a symmetrical triangle, which generally acts as a continuation pattern. If the bulls can drive the price above the triangle, the uptrend could resume. The pattern target of the setup is $52,000.On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below the triangle, the selling could intensify and the BTC/USD pair may drop to the 50-day simple moving average at $25,826. Even if the price falls to this level, the uptrend will not be broken.Lower levels are likely to attract fresh buying from traders and that could result in a few days of consolidation where the bulls gradually accumulate before starting the next leg of the uptrend.Ether’s (ETH) rebound off the 20-day EMA ($1,024) is facing resistance at $1,258.30. However, the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests that traders are buying on dips to the 20-day EMA.The upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive territory suggest that bulls are in command. If the buyers can propel the price above the $1,258.30 to $1,349.10 overhead resistance zone, the ETH/USD pair could rally to $1,462.However, if the bulls fail to push the price above the overhead resistance zone, it may attract profit-booking from short-term traders and that could pull the price below the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the pair may drop to the critical support at $840.93.The bulls could not push XRP above the 20-day EMA ($0.30) in the past four days, suggesting bears are defending this resistance. If the sellers can sink the price below $0.25, the altcoin could drop to $0.169.A strong rebound off $0.169 will suggest that the bulls are accumulating at lower levels. If the buyers can then push the price above the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USD pair may extend its stay inside the $0.169 to $0.385 range for a few more days.This view of a range-bound action will invalidate if the bears break the $0.169 support. Below this level, the downtrend could resume with the next target objective at $0.10.Polkadot (DOT) surged to a new high on Jan. 13 and followed it up with another strong rally on Jan. 14. The altcoin is currently facing resistance near $15 but the shallow correction suggests traders are not booking profits in a hurry.If the DOT/USD pair does not break below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $11.9819, the bulls will attempt to resume the uptrend. If they can scale the price above $15, the next stop could be $18 and then $20.On the contrary, if the bears sink and sustain the price below $11.9819, the pair could drop to the 61.8% retracement level at $10.1422. A deep correction will suggest the momentum has weakened and that could keep the pair range-bound for a few days.Cardano (ADA) rose above the downtrend line today but the bulls could not sustain the breakout, which suggests profit-booking at higher levels. The bears will now try to sink the altcoin to the 20-day EMA ($0.259).The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory indicate bulls have the upper hand. If the ADA/USD pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will attempt to push the price above the downtrend line and resume the uptrend.A break above $0.3542857 could push the price to $0.40 where the rally may again hit a roadblock. This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the price to the 50-day SMA ($0.192).Litecoin’s (LTC) attempt to recover after the sharp fall from $185.5821 on Jan. 10 to a low at $112.5672 on Jan. 11 hit a barrier near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $157.6904.After a deep correction, the price usually consolidates in a range for a few days before starting the next trending move. The flat 20-day EMA ($143) and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.If the LTC/USD pair sustains below the 20-day EMA, a drop to $120 is possible. A bounce off this support could keep the pair range-bound between $120 and $160.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair rebounds off the current levels, the bulls will try to push the price to $185.5821. A break above this resistance could resume the uptrend.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) rose above the $515.35 overhead resistance on Jan. 14 but the bulls could not sustain the breakout, which shows that bears are active at higher levels. The sellers are currently attempting to sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($443) and the uptrend line.If they manage to do that, the BCH/USD pair could drop to $370. This level is likely to act as a strong support and a rebound could keep the price between $370 and $515.35 for a few days.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can build up on the rebound off the 20-day EMA, a rise above $515.35 is likely. Such a move could increase the possibility of a rally to $600. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest advantage to the bulls.Chainlink (LINK) rallied for the past two days and closed above $17.7777 on Jan. 14, indicating strong demand at lower levels. The bulls continued their purchase today and drove the price to a new high at $21.4533.However, the long wick on today’s candlestick suggests profit booking at higher levels. If the bulls do not allow the price to dip back below $17.7777, it will suggest buying on dips.If the price rebounds sharply from $17.7777, the bulls will try to resume the uptrend with the next target objective at $27. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($15.07) and the RSI above 65 suggest bulls are in control.However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They are currently attempting to sink the price back below $17.7777. If they succeed, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA.Stellar Lumens (XLM) broke above $0.2864 on Jan. 13 but the Doji candlestick pattern on Jan. 14 suggested indecision among the bulls and the bears. The uncertainty has resolved to the downside today and the bears are currently trying to sustain the price below $0.2864.If they manage to do that, the XLM/USD pair may drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.24). A strong rebound off this level will suggest that traders continue to accumulate at lower levels. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest bulls have the upper hand.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the current level and rises above $0.32, the pair could rally to $0.35. The bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance at this level but if the bulls can push the price above it, the rally could extend to $0.409 and then to $0.50.Binance Coin (BNB) broke above the 20-day EMA ($39) on Jan. 13, indicating that the selling pressure had reduced. However, the bears are unwilling to give up without a fight and they are selling above $42.If the bears can sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, the BNB/USD pair may drop to the $35.69 support. A bounce off it could keep the pair range-bound between $35.69 and $43 for a few days as both the bulls and the bears try to establish their supremacy.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair rises from the current levels, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price to $45.1620. If they succeed, the pair may reach $50.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

660,"From the COVID-19 pandemic to mass-scale money printing and social unrest, 2020 was a wild year. Alongside a barrage of newsworthy events, Bitcoin (BTC) also turned in a standout year in the price category, ultimately rising from $3,600 to past $41,950, besting its 2017 all-time high of $19,892. A number of events, both crypto-specific and mainstream, appeared as catalysts for Bitcoin’s price action. Several crypto industry players weighed in on the events they believe affected BTC’s price action the most in 2020.Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano labeled Bitcoin’s halving as the event with the greatest effect on the asset’s price action, according to his comments to Cointelegraph. “The incoming daily supply decreased and demand has increased significantly, which has led to an increase in the USD price,” Pompliano said.Bitcoin’s halving occurred on May 11, 2020. The third such event since the asset’s launch in 2009, BTC’s halving resulted in miners receiving 6.25 BTC for block rewards instead of 12.5 BTC. Previous Bitcoin halvings brought price declines followed by sideways price action, although tremendous upswings eventually occurred after each halving.The event in 2020 was no exception, as Bitcoin soared past record highs several months after the May event. The Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow model from analyst Plan B serves as a popular forecasting tool in the crypto space. The model predicts increasing future BTC prices based on halvings decreasing the asset’s incoming supply.Pierce Crosby, general manager for crypto asset charting platform TradingView, told Cointelegraph about three developments that he believes impacted the value of Bitcoin the most in 2020. The first aspect he noted: “Consumer continued adoption, apparent in Coinbase’s planned IPO.”Major United States-based crypto exchange Coinbase recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for approval to conduct an initial public offering. The move would take the company public, resulting in tradable company shares on the mainstream U.S. stock market. The news actually coincided with moderately downward BTC price action on the day of the development, although Crosby’s comment appears to indicate the IPO as simply a result of underlying and ongoing demand.The “institutional adoption, seen in MicroStrategy’s treasury re-allocation to Bitcoin” was another rousing event on BTC’s price in 2020 according to Crosby. A slew of large mainstream companies unveiled large Bitcoin positions in 2020. It all began as billionaire hedge funder Paul Tudor Jones revealed his Bitcoin position in May 2020.In the latter half of the year, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy picked up hundreds of millions of dollars in Bitcoin. Other firms, such as Jack Dorsey’s Square and MassMutual, also publicized BTC purchases as part of a buying trend for big players.Crosby also said, “the boom of DeFi and the corresponding leveraged products that were built by this space” affected BTC’s price in 2020. Last year, a bevy of DeFi solutions entered the crypto industry, giving participants new ways of leveraging their capital.Resembling 2017’s ICO bubble at times, decentralized finance moved significant money around in 2020. Related assets saw dramatic price swings, while shady projects also surfaced during the boom. Meanwhile, in line with the hype, Bitcoin rode an upward price trend toward record levels after recovering from its COVID-19-related price drop in March.Speaking of the pandemic, Cheds, a crypto trader and analyst on Twitter, said COVID-19 steered Bitcoin’s price significantly last year.Cheds said:In March 2020, amid rapidly rising COVID-19 concerns and prevention measures, mainstream markets and crypto assets fell sharply in price. Bitcoin, however, rebounded more quickly than traditional financial assets. “Without a doubt, it sped up the process of finding a bottom, and since then, we have ripped back up to all-time highs, helped along by news of institutional investment,” Cheds said of the pandemic.“Events like the public purchases of MicroStrategy and the addition of $BTC to PayPal’s arsenal have added a veneer of legitimacy that was missing, and help pave the way for even more of these types of investments in 2021,” Cheds added. PayPal unveiled the addition of multiple crypto assets to its platform back in October.When asked what events had the least effect on Bitcoin’s price, Pompliano said, “most people’s opinion on Twitter,” with a smile. Meanwhile, Crosby pointed toward a detachment of Bitcoin from the political arena. “Very little impact came from politics this year, which is a substantial difference versus previous years,” he said. “We expect the impact of governments to be more visible with Bitcoin in 2021.”Rounding out the year, the U.S. government proposed a ruling to monitor self-custodied crypto-asset wallets, for which the short comment period recently ended. The SEC also filed a movement against Ripple and its XRP asset in late-December. Both events could signal the beginning of increased government involvement.Pompliano has often called Bitcoin a non-correlated asset when it comes to other financial instruments. An October 2020 report from Fidelity lends validity to such a view, concluding that Bitcoin holds virtually zero correlation to the price action seen across other markets.Over the course of 2020, the world gave Bitcoin’s price plenty of headlines to react to. Some news events seemed impactful, while others did not, although definitively proving any direct correlation may be impossible.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

661,"Neil Liversidge, a veteran financial advisor, has called on the government of the United Kingdom to ban transactions in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC).Liversidge, the owner of the independent financial advisory firm West Riding Personal Financial Solutions, started a petition urging local financial authorities to stop crypto transactions in the U.K. The petition reads:Liversidge cited a common anti-crypto narrative, arguing that cryptos like Bitcoin have no intrinsic value and “can be a destabilising influence on society, and often used for criminal activity.” The advisor also thinks that cryptocurrency mining is “harmful to the environment.”According to the U.K. Government and Parliament website, the petition’s deadline is July 7, 2021. At time of publication, the petition has collected 108 signatures.In a Jan. 13 interview with finance-focused publication Professional Adviser, Liversidge noted that a blanket ban on crypto transactions in the U.K. will help the enforcement to reduce the power of criminals using cryptos like Bitcoin for illicit activity. “Law enforcement will never catch them all, it won't even catch most of them, but destroying their financial base reduces their power,” the IFA argued.Liversidge also said that a crypto ban would immediately trigger a crash on the market: “If the UK government takes a lead by banning transactions on cryptos as my petition requests, that will set off a chain reaction, crashing cryptos overnight,” he said.The IFA’s verdict is that all crypto investors should immediately sell their holdings: “So if you're holding cryptos now, my advice to you is to find a bigger fool than you and dump them quick.” Liversidge also told Cointelegraph that he has “never owned any and never would buy any,” crypto, even if he knew that it would bring him hundreds of percent of returns.Bitcoin’s ongoing rally driving its price up to $42,000 has definitely pushed global Bitcoin naysayers to finally talk Bitcoin after mostly keeping silent in 2020. On Jan. 14, Russian State Duma member Anatoly Aksakov suggested that global authorities should ban crypto payments because Bitcoin is a bubble that is poised to burst “sooner or later.” On Jan. 13, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde declared that Bitcoin is a “highly speculative asset” and a “funny business” helping money launderers."
662,"Stacks, an open-source network for building smart-contract and DeFi bridges to Bitcoin (BTC), has secured several major partnerships in the wake of its mainnet launch — sending a strong signal that industry players are keen to back new use cases for BTC.The Stacks 2.0 mainnet officially launched on Thursday, bringing the promise of new use cases for Bitcoin based on the Clarity smart contract language. As Cointelegraph reported, Stacks 2.0 is attempting to broaden Bitcoin’s utility beyond the digital-gold narrative to include decentralized finance and smart contracts. That includes putting to work the roughly $700 billion in Bitcoin capital currently on the sidelines.Foundry Digital, a Digital Currency Group company, has since announced that it will provide mining services for STX, the native cryptocurrency of the Stacks ecosystem. Foundry said the move sends a “clear signal to miners about the opportunity to mine STX.”Foundry was one of several independent miners to launch the Stacks 2.0 network on Thursday.Blockdaemon, a blockchain infrastructure platform, has also announced integration with Stacks 2.0, which will allow institutions and investors to become node operators.“We are currently witnessing unprecedented institutional investment into the crypto sphere, demonstrating the need for enterprise-grade infrastructure to connect and scale blockchain networks,” said Blockdaemon CEO Konstantin Richter.Regarding Stacks 2.0, he added:Stacks 2.0 is based on a proof-of-transfer, or PoX, consensus mechanism. The novel mining system utilizes proof-of-work to create new blockchains that are rooted in Bitcoin's security. Stacks co-founder Muneeb Ali said that PoX can incentivize network participation by offering Bitcoin rewards, something that wasn’t possible before the protocol was conceived."
663,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $35,000 on Jan. 15 as renewed strength in the U.S. dollar piled pressure on the largest cryptocurrency. BTC bounced off support at $34,300 and is trading at $35,300 at the time of writing. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView shows BTC/USD hitting its lowest in over 24 hours at publication time on Friday, with $34,000 so far acting as support.The previous day saw the pair reclaim $40,000 for a brief instant before falling back to range in a corridor that had formed at the start of the week. The latest drop reinforced the assumption that Bitcoin would continue in this corridor, which has $30,000 as support and $40,000 as a rough ceiling.""#Bitcoin consolidating is very healthy for the market after the massive impulse move to $41,500,"" Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe explained in a series of tweets.The fresh downturn for Bitcoin coincided with an uptick in the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) coming on the back of President-elect Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus plan. Despite the gravity of this U.S. dollar supply expansion, markets appeared to react favorably to the plans, leading the DXY upwards at the expense of Bitcoin, to which it typically exhibits inverse correlation.""Context: The dollar is breaking out on multiple time frames. Quite a strong recovery at a multi-month support area. Some argue this is bad for Bitcoin, gold and risk-on assets, hence the narrative,"" Cointelegraph in-house analyst Joseph Young summarized.Young noted that on derivatives markets, investors ""buying the dip"" was causing an extra headache, potentially dampening the prospects of a relief rally.Zoom out, however, and Bitcoin was if anything underperforming compared with previous bull cycles. According to on-chain analytics resource Ecoinometrics, this left the door open for further conspicuous gains.""This bull market doesn't stop at $40k,"" part of a tweet with a comparative chart read."
664,"Digital assets marketplace Bakkt is set to go public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021, which could pave the way for more cryptocurrency service providers to follow suit. The Intercontinental Exchange announced on Jan. 11 that its cryptocurrency marketplace Bakkt would soon be listed on the NYSE public stock market. This will be done through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings.The shell company will be used to merge with Bakkt in order for it to be listed on the stock market without having to undertake an initial public offering. Initial reports suggest that Bakkt will be valued at over $2 billion after the merger, and the exchange intends to raise a further $532 million to bankroll the ongoing development of its application, a wallet and rewards app targeting retail users, which is expected to be launched in March.The company has indicated that the merger is expected to be wrapped up in the second quarter of 2021. This will then see the newly formed Bakkt Holdings Inc. listed on the NYSE.A lot has been made of the investor presentation that was submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The document outlines the potential for the cryptocurrency market to be valued at $3 billion by 2025, underpinning the potential value of the space in the coming years. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization topped $1 trillion for the first time in January 2021.Bakkt CEO Gavin Michael told Cointelegraph that the merger makes sense, given the amount of capital that has already flowed into the cryptocurrency space and the potential growth it predicts over the next three years:Michael added that the merger will give Bakkt access to the necessary capital to expand and provide more opportunities for consumers to unlock trillions of dollars held across various digital assets. The company also expects to benefit from the brand recognition that will come from becoming a publicly-traded company.Mati Greenspan, crypto analyst and founder of advisory firm Quantum Economics, told Cointelegraph that the timing of the merger and Bakkt’s decision to go public is not surprising, given that the cryptocurrency markets are currently booming.Noting that the move will no doubt be lucrative for Bakkt, Greenspan also agreed that the push to go public is an indication that the traditional finance sector is beginning to recognize cryptocurrency and blockchain-focused businesses as mature and valuable: “It’s a reflection of where these companies are in their life cycle and how it coincides with the readiness of the traditional market to accept them.”While some major institutional investors like MicroStrategy have made waves across the industry with their billion-dollar purchases of Bitcoin (BTC) in recent months, Greenspan highlighted the efficacy of diversifying investment in the space. While holding cryptocurrencies is a direct way to gain exposure to the ecosystem, Greenspan said investing in the right companies could potentially be more beneficial:Joel Edgerton, chief operating officer of U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange bitFlyer, told Cointelegraph that the timing of the initial public offering was opportune, given the current market highs and a strong interest in cryptocurrencies. He also offered an alternative stance on the reasons behind the ongoing surge, suggesting that small investors and independent firms are driving the cryptocurrency boom: “Coinbase and Bakkt are taking advantage of the IPO window to allow their investors an exit event and use the subsequent publicity of their early moves to strengthen their brands.”Edgerton also believes in the propensity of smart investors to fund companies involved in the cryptocurrency space without actually buying BTC or other altcoins. The lack of options to gain widespread exposure to cryptocurrency also plays a role:Ben Caselin, head of research and strategy for digital asset exchange AAX, told Cointelegraph that Bakkt’s move does not necessarily reflect recognition from the wider financial industry. In contrast to the sentiments of Greenspan and Edgerton, Caselin also highlighted the fact that shareholders of Bakkt, when it is finally publicly traded, will be banking on the assumption that the exchange is successful in the future. While this is intrinsically tied into the cryptocurrency markets, Caselin draws a clear line between investing directly into cryptocurrencies and exchanges:The likes of Bakkt and Coinbase have seemingly gained a headstart in the race to access public funding and publicity as they look to build on their current offerings. Despite Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs on separate occasions in recent weeks, Edgerton believes that the space is still in its youth, and investment from the wider public will become a key driver of growth over the next decade: “IPOs are obviously a major source of funding, and a successful IPO should also encourage VCs to invest in the next major crypto unicorn.”Related: Coinbase IPO to further legitimize crypto, but limitations remainGreenspan also sees more billion-dollar deals on the horizon for the cryptocurrency space, while suggesting that some of these might just be done using the nascent technology powering the future of finance: “As the industry grows, there will be many more crypto-related mega-deals. Perhaps one day soon, all IPOs, acquisitions and mergers will happen using distributed ledger technology.”"

The new milestone demonstrates QBTC’s parabolic growth after 3iQ launched the fund in April 2020. QBTC is now up 900% from its previous milestone of $100 million recorded in October 2020.As previously reported, 3iQ’s QBTC is Canada's first public Bitcoin fund listed on a major stock exchange, the Toronto Stock Exchange. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss' Gemini provides custody services for 3iQ’s QBTC.At publishing time, QBTC.U is trading at $48.63, up 330% from $11 when it was listed in April.3iQ is apparently one of the largest cryptocurrency firms in Canada. In January 2018, 3iQ reportedly became the first crypto fund regulated by the Ontario Securities Commission and the Canadian Securities Administrators. In February 2020, 3iQ also partnered with blockchain startup Mavennet to launch a stablecoin pegged to the Canadian dollar that will be regulated by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada.3iQ’s former senior executive Shaun Cumby is now also the CEO of Arxnovum, a company that on Jan. 11 filed an application with OSC for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.

667,"The Bitcoin (BTC) network has been steadily recovering in terms of running BTC nodes after a major outage on the Tor network.According to the latest data from node monitoring resource Bitnodes, Tor-enabled Bitcoin (BTC) nodes are back to normal following almost a full-swing crash in early January 2021. As of Jan. 13, the number of reachable Tor-based BTC nodes amounted to 2,581, up from as few as 122 nodes on Jan. 9.Based on Bitnodes data, Tor-enabled Bitcoin nodes make up a significant part of the Bitcoin network, normally accounting for about 25% of totally reachable running nodes. According to the latest recorded data, Tor-based nodes made up over 23% of total BTC nodes on Jan. 13.According to Bitnodes, the current number of Bitcoin nodes amounts to 11,190 nodes, up from around 8,300 on Jan. 7.A Bitcoin node is a computer connected to other computers to host and synchronize a copy of the entire Bitcoin blockchain and essentially keep the entire network running. Tor-based Bitcoin nodes are a type of node implemented privately using the Tor anonymous network.The latest dip in Tor-enabled BTC nodes is likely to be caused by a recent crash on the Tor network. On Jan. 10, Tor Project officially announced that the Tor network was experiencing instability due to an implementation bug in its v3 onion service. Tech-focused news agency TechNadu reported that the outage was likely due to a hacker attack.The downtimes in the Tor network subsequently affected a large number of Tor-enabled or so-called “onion” websites including private Bitcoin wallets and exchanges like Wasabi and Bisq. On Jan. 11, Wasabi reported that it managed to keep its services intact using a fallback system. “If the Tor onion service of the backend becomes unavailable for the user, the wallet falls back to communicating with the backend's clearnet endpoint, still over Tor,” Wasabi wrote.A spokesperson for Tor Project told Cointelegraph that there is no evidence that the Tor Network was under an attack but was rather triggered by traffic overload. “The outage may have come from a poorly written custom Tor client requesting directory information too often,” the person said. There is also no evidence that the traffic overload was actively trying to hurt v2 onions, the representative noted.According to the spokesperson, the network “was always fully intact"" but the traffic overload “destabilized v3 onions” due to a bug. As a result, v3 onion services were inconsistently reachable for a few hours on Jan. 9 and again for a few hours on Jan. 10, the person stated. A fix for the underlying bug is now in an alpha release on the Tor Project website.Disclaimer: This article was updated to add comments from a spokesperson for Tor Project."
668,"Galaxy Digital — the financial services and cryptocurrency investment management firm founded by Mike Novogratz — has set its sights on establishing a footing in the Bitcoin (BTC) mining sector.After a year of increasingly diversifying its products and activities, the company has announced two new forays into the Bitcoin mining sector for 2021. The first project will be a new business unit that Galaxy describes as ""a one-stop financial services platform for miners."" Dubbed Galaxy Digital Mining, the unit is being led by Amanda Fabiano — formerly the director of mining at Fidelity Investments. In a brief snapshot of her background in financial services, Galaxy notes Fabiano's experience in working with non-traditional securitization, real-asset financing, structured products, investment banking, and strategic advisory.Galaxy's services for miners will, at the outset, encompass trading and risk management, investing and lending, as well as corporate advisory. Co-president Chris Ferraro has given some insight into where Galaxy Digital Mining fits into the company's overall roadmap:Alongside miner-focused financial services, Galaxy Digital Mining has also created a proprietary Bitcoin mining operation and is reportedly hosting its rigs at a third-party datacenter in the United States. Fabiano claimed that the two aspects of the unit's activities will be complimentary, saying that ""by mining ourselves, we are able to deeply understand and solve for the financial needs of miners.""As previously reported, Galaxy Digital had a bullish 2020, mirroring the fortunes of the wider industry and signaling increased institutional investor participation in crypto. Its third-quarter earnings report showed a 75% year-on-year rise in trading volumes, which it attributed to an expanding counterparty base, the launch of its electronic trading platform, and the growth of its crypto derivatives business."
669,"Anatoly Aksakov, a member of the Russian State Duma, has reiterated his negative stance on Bitcoin (BTC) shortly after the cryptocurrency briefly retouched $40,000 on Jan. 14.In an interview with local news agency TASS, Aksakov argued that Bitcoin is not backed by anything and thus the Bitcoin bubble is poised to burst sooner or later:Aksakov also urged for strict regulations on Bitcoin, hinting that global jurisdictions should probably ban it as a payment method. Russia has already banned crypto-powered payments effective from Jan. 1, 2021. Aksakov stated, “It is necessary to cut off all channels for using Bitcoin to finance drug trafficking, terrorist operations, money laundering, corruption schemes, and so on.” Aksakov also noted that Bitcoin is “the mother of blockchain.” “Blockchain technology has existed for a long time, but thanks to Bitcoin it became popular and is now widely used,” he said. Aksakov is not alone in maintaining that Bitcoin is a bubble. Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America Securities, argued that Bitcoin looks like “the mother of all bubbles” in early January 2021.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Aksakov emerged as one of the biggest Bitcoin critics in 2020. He is confident that Bitcoin “has no future” and that crypto payments would destroy the global financial system.Following Bitcoin’s massive rally driving its price to as high as $42,000 in January, a number of global authorities have expressed criticism of the world’s largest cryptocurrency. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde argued on Jan. 13 that Bitcoin is a “highly speculative asset” and a “funny business” contributing to money laundering."
670,"RIF, the utility token for smart contract network RSK, shot up over 30% in price after an appearance by its founder on the Jan. 13 edition of The Pomp Podcast. The gain equates to a $36 million increase in market cap for RIF, most of which has occurred in the last 12 hours.$RIF up 20% now and it's just the beginning.

Building infrastructure on top of #bitcoin

The most secure network in the world.RIF, short for “RSK Infrastructure Framework,” is the token used as payment for decentralized infrastructure services which operate under the RSK protocol, such as e-commerce solutions and network bridges. Services are purchased at a marketplace hosted by the network and are constructed using RSK’s protocol. This renders them interoperable among a number of smart contract-enabled platforms like Ethereum and EOS.During the hour-long interview RSK and IOVLabs founder Diego Gutierrez-Zaldivar discussed the origins of his fascination with Bitcoin, the genesis of RSK and IOVLabs, and why he is confident that 2021 will be a productive year in terms of readying Bitcoin’s infrastructure for mass adoption.He also fielded questions from listeners and offered his opinion on a number of hot subjects, including censorship by service providers, DeFi, and what he thought the endgame should be for developers in his industry.Gutierrez-Zaldivar praised Ethereum’s successes while reiterating his long-held belief that Bitcoin should be the base layer for development of smart contracts running on decentralized networks. His conclusion is based on six years experience developing bridges to connect independent crypto platforms.With a roadmap for RSK that extends over a decade into the future, Gutierrez-Zaldivar stressed a long-term mindset for his company and hopes that one day it will be “an important protection layer for the Bitcoin economy and infrastructure.”Gutierrez-Zaldivar believes that RSK reflects a culmination of advances made in decentralized software and that in 2021 all of the components necessary for “crypto systems to work exactly as fintech” are available, with the last step getting the systems to converge.On Jan. 6, Binance announced that it would list RIF trading pairs. The price of RIF is currently up 40% since the start of the year."
671,"EOS has largely under performed during this crypto rally and has dropped out of the top ten by market cap, but one industry executive believes it could be one of the best risk/reward digital assets right now.Chartered Financial Analyst and Arca CIO Jeff Dorman made the assertion based upon Block.one’s extensive Bitcoin holdings.Before delving into that, Dorman observed that EOS is the only major crypto asset apart from XRP that has not made significant gains during this rally. Over the past twelve months, EOS prices have declined by 26%, with losses recently accelerating due to the resignation of co-founder and CTO of Block.one Dan Larimer.But with plenty of “zombie projects” up 300% to 1,000%, he believes EOS provides a good risk/reward opportunity.Block.one owns 140,000 BTC worthh an estimated $5.5 billion at current prices according to data compiled by a financial comparison platform Bankr.nl. The CFA compared the market capitalization of EOS with that of its Bitcoin holdings;Dorman stated that generating a Return On Investment, or ROI, from Book Value is essentially taking a gamble on what management will do with that capital. Block.one team has done very little to instill confidence, he added.But Dorman suggested that at this point, EOSIO and Block.one CEO Brendan Blumer need to create value for token holders as soon as possible, or return the capital, or expect huge lawsuits.He concluded that any one of these three options will unlock this value and close the gap between EOS' market cap and the value of the Bitcoin on Block.one’s balance sheet, which currently stands at $1.5 billion more than the company raised in its May 2018 ICO.Not all were in agreement with the CFA with one respondent pointing out that buying EOS is not the same as buying BTC:The enormous amount of Bitcoin on the Block.one books may lend weight to outspoken crypto podcaster Peter McCormack’s comment:At the time of writing, EOS was trading at $2.80, flat on the day and down almost 13% over the past week."

Including last quarter’s intake of $3.3 billion, which is mostly BTC, Grayscale’s crypto portfolio sits at $27.6 billion.Bitcoin isn’t the only coin to see strong support since January 13 with the entire crypto market adding $137 billion to surge once again past a $1 trillion market cap.Grayscale is back！Grayscale gains another 2172 #BTC in 24 hours. Their total AUM now $26.39 billion.
https://t.co/r1tmKT6a3r pic.twitter.com/lZlcJdNvTkWith the increasing demand from institutional investors, Bitcoin’s available supply is becoming increasingly scarce. Yesterday, major exchange eToro announced to users that it expects to experience liquidity problems for its crypto platform, warning that it could limit margin trading and BUY orders over the weekend to cope.Since Bitcoin’s halving late last year, approximately 900 BTC are being mined each day. According to crypto analytics platform Glassnode, however, on average only one-third of those are actually being sent to exchanges since July 2020.During the same period, Grayscale has purchased roughly 224,930 Bitcoin, equating to more than 1,200 BTC per day. Not taking into account other institutional investors, the available supply is quickly drying up.Not all stats suggest institutional investors are playing a core role in crypto’s price however with Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust not receiving the same interest over the last month. The balance has actually reduced by 6036 Ether since December 9 when it reached an all-time high of 2.94 million ETH. During that period, Bitcoin rose by 116%, but Ethereum increased by more than 122%."
673,"The total cryptocurrency market capitalization is back above the $1 trillion level as Bitcoin (BTC) bulls pushed the price back to $40,000 on Jan. 14.Bitcoin price rallied to $40,099 in the early trading hours on Jan. 14 according to data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView before pulling back to $39,500. This marks a rapid turnaround from the recent drop below $31,000 and shows that professional and retail traders are keen to see BTC price rise higher despite this week’s massive $1.5 billion liquidation.Establishing $40,000 as support is an important psychological level and a key support that traders are watching. If traders are able to flip the level to support, then extension toward $45,000 is the line of thinking followed by many traders.While the previous rally above $40,000 was driven in part by a flurry of buying from retail investors, Guy Hirsch, the managing director for eToro’s U.S. wing sees institutions as the driving force behind the current rally. According to Hirsch, it “wouldn’t be a surprise to see a new all-time high during or even before this coming weekend.”In private comments to Cointelegraph, Hirsch said:While Bitcoin’s recent price volatility has given some of the newer institutional investors a cause for a pause, the more seasoned of the financial powerhouses bought the dip from the weak hands, taking full advantage of the sharp downturn.Noticeably, it’s not just BTC that is receiving institutional attention as the current market cycle progresses. Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Bequant, sees the growing trend as a positive development for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.Vinokourov said:As reported by Cointelegraph, since BTC’s drop on Jan. 11 some of the more prominent figures in the space have been more bullish than ever and are likewise calling for Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high in the near future.Decentrader founder filbfilb said, “The immediate future for the top cryptocurrency is “50/50 as to what happens at this point.” A move above $40,000 will establish a new support level at which point “retest of the all-time high is very likely.”In a private conversation with Cointelegraph the analyst stated:Regardless of what happens, the analyst sees $40,000 as a “key pivot point which will dictate the next couple of weeks.”Altcoins are also seeing positive price action for a third day in a row. Ether (ETH) rose by 9% to $1,245 and Polkadot (DOT) found additional momentum as it rallied 33% to a new high at $14.92.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.04 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 69.1%."
674,"Bitcoin (BTC) price recovered by 27% just three days after testing the $31,000 support and earlier today bull recaptured the $40,000 level.This quick recovery occurred despite the digital asset facing one of the largest buy-side liquidations in a single day as $1.5 billion was wiped off the books. Interestingly, futures contract traders appear to have returned with an even larger appetite.After such a large liquidation event, an increased appetite from futures traders is somewhat unexpected but professional investors are skilled at hedging their positions and executing complicated strategies involving options.To measure the impact of the recent liquidations and better understand how these futures traders have been positioned, one should start by analyzing the open interest. Large reductions in this indicator could show that traders were caught by surprise and currently unwilling to add positions.As the above data indicates, BTC futures open interest reached a $13 billion all-time-high on Jan. 14, a 74% increase from the previous month.For those unfamiliar with futures contracts, buyers and sellers are matched at all times. Every long contract is betting on further upside and has been traded against one or more entities willing to short it.Bitcoin’s swift recovery from its recent low signals that either traders are risk-takers and hence unaffected by those large price swings, or that most of this activity is composed of hedge and arbitrage trades.Hedge strategies are used to provide traders with protection. For example, selling futures contracts while simultaneously holding a larger BTC position in a cold wallet. Meanwhile, arbitrage strategies also involve little to no directional exposure, meaning price swings do not impact the trading performance. One could sell longer-term BTC futures contracts while buying the perpetual one, aiming to benefit from eventual price distortions.The best way to analyze whether directional trades and leverage bets have been dominating the scene is to look at the futures premium and the perpetual futures funding rate.These indicators tend to oscillate massively during unexpected price swings if leverage trades have been behind the move. On the other hand, those metrics will remain relatively steady if traders have no directional exposure because they are primarily deploying hedge and arbitrage strategies.Perpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate, usually charged every eight hours. When buyers (longs) are the ones demanding more leverage, the funding rate turns positive. Therefore, the buyers will be the ones paying up the fees. This issue holds especially true during bull runs, when there is usually more demand for longs.As shown above, the funding rate has been ranging from 0% to 2% since Jan. 5, thus indicating that no anomaly took place. Had there been moments of panic among perpetual contract traders, the rate would have shifted to the negative side, as those betting on the downside (shorts) would be paying the fee.The average 1% weekly funding rate seems exceptionally modest considering Bitcoin's 74% rally over the past three weeks.Professional traders tend to dominate longer-term futures contracts with set expiry dates. Thus, by measuring how much more expensive futures are versus the regular spot market, a trader can gauge how bullish they are.The 3-month fixed-calendar futures should usually trade with a 2% or higher premium versus regular spot exchanges. This equals an 8% annualized yield, which can also be interpreted as a lending rate, as the seller is postponing settlement.Whenever this indicator fades or turns negative, this is an alarming red flag. Such a situation, also known as backwardation, indicates that the market is turning bearish.The above chart shows that the indicator has been holding a 4% minimum. Meanwhile, a 5% rate translates to 21% annualized, which is higher than most decentralized finance applications are returning for stablecoin deposits.Therefore, the indicator has been flirting with overbought levels, indicating optimism from professional traders. This data is a positive reading, as the recent unexpected swings have not reduced their appetite.At the moment, it's clear that the recent volatility has not shaken out derivatives traders. Meanwhile, the growing futures open interest and the 3-month premium indicate that there are no sizable bets on a downturn or lack of confidence in the market.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

675,"The sharp correction in Bitcoin (BTC) may have shaken out many leveraged traders, but the data shows whales and institutions aggressively purchased the dip and now bulls have shown they are determined to push Bitcoin price back above $40,000. The total crypto market capitalization has also recovered and surged back above $1 trillion. Pantera Capital founder and CEO Dan Morehead said he stands by his earlier prediction of $115,000 for Bitcoin by August of this year. Morehead believes China's digital yuan developments may boost crypto adoption and prove to be a bullish trigger.Several altcoins have also turned positive and are following Bitcoin higher. Let’s investigate the fundamental reasons for their rise in order to determine whether there are possible targets on the upside.European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde recently reiterated her view that Bitcoin should be regulated of Bitcoin. Regulation can be a two-edged sword, and those against it have argued that it has repeatedly failed in traditional finance. Therefore, as voices for regulation grow, some investors may prefer privacy coins such as Zcash (ZEC).The Zcash Foundation wants the community to increase shielded adoption and for applications to allow for transactions using shielded Zcash. To do that, the foundation plans to speed up the development of Zebra, a consensus-compatible Zcash node client written in Rust.Zcash also completed its third major network upgrade called Blossom on Dec. 11. The upgrade cut block times in half, enabled faster transaction confirmations, lowered fees and doubled the network's throughput.While Zcash is taking necessary steps to improve user adoption, the project is continuing to face heat due to its privacy tag. Recently crypto exchange Bittrex announced that it was delisting ZEC along with two other privacy coins starting on Jan. 15. Let’s see whether any of these developments are working in ZEC's favor.ZEC soared from an intraday low at $54.3150 on Jan. 1 to an intraday high at $120.7119 on Jan. 13, a 122% rise within two weeks. This rally has invalidated a bearish descending triangle pattern and this is a strong bullish sign.However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily and they are currently attempting to defend the $125.3626 resistance. The ZEC/USD pair could now retest the recent breakout level at $102.6824.If the pair rebounds off this support, it will suggest that the level has flipped to support and this may be used as a launchpad for a break above $125.3626.If the buyers succeed in achieving that, the pair could rally to $140 and then to $160. A breakout of this resistance could pave way for a rally to $220.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink and sustain the price below $102.6824, the decline could extend to $84. Such a fall will suggest the momentum has weakened.The recent crypto bull run has not only boosted Bitcoin’s price, it has also rewarded altcoins that offer solutions to the issues bogging down existing projects. Polkadot (DOT) aims to address interoperability and scalability issues and recently traders have pushed its price into the top-five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This has also benefited its cousin, Kusama (KSM).The upcoming Substrate 3.0 release will bring Ethereum compatibility and it's expected to launch in the first half of this year. The upgrade could further boost Polkadot’s popularity. Meanwhile, the Plasm network became the first parachain on Polkadot’s testnet parachain, Rococo V1. The same code will run on Kusama and a growing number of projects aiming to win the Polkadot parachain slots auction might first try out Kusama.Although Kusama is its own unique network, its fortunes will closely follow the trajectory of Polkadot.The charts show KSM in an uptrend and its price has risen from a Jan.11 intraday low at $57.877 to an intraday high at $85.239 today. This represents an impressive 47.27 % rally within four days. Both moving averages are sloping up and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive zone, indicating bulls are in control.The bears had attempted to start a correction on Jan. 11 but the bulls aggressively defended the 50-day simple moving average ($58). This suggests strong demand at lower levels. The KSM/USD pair may rise to $88 and then to $100.However, the long wick on today’s candlestick suggests selling at higher levels. If the bears pull the price below $76, the pair may drop to the 20-day exponential moving average ($67). A strong rebound off it will keep the upside targets intact.On the other hand, a break below the 20-day EMA could result in a fall to the 50-day SMA. If this support cracks, it may signal a trend change.Traders use leverage through derivatives in strong trending markets to maximize their gains. However, crypto markets can turn volatile, resulting in the quick liquidation of futures positions. Therefore, professional traders use options to limit their risk and participate in the rally while also hedging their futures positions. In fast-moving markets, demand for options are likely to remain high and this has benefited Hedget (HGET), the decentralized protocol for options trading.When trading options, pricing is an important factor to consider for both the buyer and the seller. Hedget recently announced partnership with the Umbrella Network will provide volatility metrics from Genesis volatility to efficiently price DeFi options contracts. As more crypto traders understand and use options to hedge their risks, Hedget may continue to do well.HGET has risen from $1.675 on Jan. 11 to an intraday high at $3.20 today, a gain of 91% within a short time. This rally has pushed the price above the downtrend line, indicating a possible trend change.If the bulls can sustain the price above the downtrend line, the HGET/USD pair may rise to $3.945 where it may face stiff resistance from the bears. If the price turns down from this level but does not sink back below the downtrend line, it will suggest the start of a new uptrend.A break above $3.945 may push the price to $5. This level may act as a stiff resistance but if the bulls do not give up much ground, the up-move may resume. There are no significant resistance levels once $5 is crossed, hence the momentum may pick up.The 20-day EMA ($2.23) has turned up and the RSI is in the overbought territory suggesting the path of least resistance is to the upside. This positive view will become invalid if the price dips below $2.75.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision."
676,"As a result of the ongoing uptrend, many prominent institutions from the realm of traditional finance have sought to join the crypto bandwagon so as to not miss out on the ongoing action. For starters, a jump in open interest and trading volume for Bitcoin futures has been witnessed across the board over the course of the last couple of months. While that may have been expected, what may come as a surprise is that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a global derivatives exchange, recently became the world’s largest Bitcoin futures trading platform.In this regard, data released by crypto analytics platform Bybt indicates that CME accounts for $2.4 billion of the $13 billion overall open interest in Bitcoin futures, closely followed by crypto exchange OKEx’s total of $2.17 billion and ahead of other prominent players such as Binance, Huobi and Bybit.It should come as no secret that Bitcoin’s (BTC) meteoric ascent since December 2020 has increasingly been grabbing the eyeballs of investors all over the world. To put things into perspective, despite BTC’s recent dip that saw it drop to just under the $32,000 mark, the currency is once again trading well above the $38,000 threshold — thereby showcasing a net 30-day profit of around 95%.The recent volatility has sparked concerns over the sustainability of the current bull season and has raised questions regarding if institutional interest in Bitcoin is starting to reach a plateau. Konstantin Anissimov, executive director of United Kingdom-based cryptocurrency exchange CEX.IO, told Cointelegraph that it is important for new entrants to realize that the game is not simply about institutions making their way into the market but rather that they see a drop in the risks:Quinten Francois, host of the YouTube channel Young and Investing, believes that most institutions that wanted a piece of the action have likely already made their way in, adding that during parabolic phases like these, it’s hard to imagine more big-name moneyed players making their entry into this space, at least until the end of the year when things become more stable.That being said, he did add that most institutions that have boarded the crypto gravy train are now likely to accumulate during dips, and when they do stop, retail money will slowly pour back into the market, pumping the value of BTC even further: “They are smart money and know what they are doing, they are not going to buy into parabolic moves.”Jonathan Leong, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange BTSE, told Cointelegraph that “Institutional inflow into cryptocurrency has just started.” He further added: “The fast price appreciation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies during Q4 has a direct correlation with this institutional inflow or the expectation of such inflow.”There’s no denying that Bitcoin is a much more mature asset than during the bearish phase of 2018, especially with regulations having progressed significantly in certain jurisdictions. Furthermore, the crypto market now has a substantial number of professional trading houses and non-crypto businesses participating in it. These factors can help greatly with dampening Bitcoin’s volatility and increasing its liquidity as an investment asset, according to Anissimov: “Institutional investors are not so much the key to driving Bitcoin’s bull run as they are a path through which this market as a whole can be tempered, becoming more stable and efficient.”That being said, if established institutions come into the crypto industry, they will have an effect on the price movement of most cryptocurrencies. In the end, this may help the industry as a whole, especially when considering that most traditional finance players will aim for long-term deals that can potentially help protect Bitcoin from crashing in a manner similar to what was seen in 2018.Earlier this month, CoinShares, a European firm that deals with crypto-finance and exchange-traded products, announced that it had successfully facilitated the trade of more than $202 million in XBT (Bitcoin) certificates on the market’s first day of 2021. It is worth noting that the Bitcoin exchange-traded-note provider is approved by Sweden’s Financial Supervisory Authority and that the company’s aforementioned offerings are currently available for purchase via Nasdaq.Also, according to CoinShares’ “Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly” report from Jan. 11, $34.5 billion worth of capital is held in crypto investment products as of Jan. 8. Of this total, $27.5 billion, or 80%, is in Bitcoin funds, while $4.7 billion, or roughly 13%, is invested in Ether (ETH) products.Comparing the performance of Bitcoin funds during this ongoing bull run with that of the one witnessed in 2017, the report states: “We have seen much greater investor participation this time round with net new assets at US$8.2bn compared to only US$534m in December 2017.”Also, last year, the United States Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said in a landmark decision that national banks can custody crypto assets. This announcement was followed by another major development wherein the OCC also stated that American banks can even provide services to stablecoin issuers, such as holding reserves.While some traditional institutions were already indulging in this practice prior to the above-stated decision, there was an air of uncertainty around this space due to a lack of legal clarity. Now that an official clarification has been given, stablecoins that are backed one-to-one by fiat currencies that are held in a bank’s reserves are not deemed a risk in the United States."
677,"After its rise past $40,000, and a correction back to nearly $30,000, Bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded once again. Stalling before jumping back up past highs near $42,000 could be good for the asset, however, according to Brian Krogsgard, a trader and podcaster going by the name LedgerStatus on Twitter. “Bitcoin's correction was healthy in a strong bullish environment, mean reverting back to the 20 day moving average,” Krogsgard told Cointelegraph on Thursday. “With a strong bounce now, it is time to see if it will immediately continue upward, or spend longer in prolonged consolidation, which I believe would be healthy.”Bitcoin barely surpassed $40,000 on Thursday morning before retracing slightly, falling back into the $39,000 range, according to TradingView.com data at time of publication.Surpassing the $36,000 mark was an important move for the asset, according to comments from CryptoWendyO, a trader and analyst on Twitter. “Unless we reclaim $36,000 I am not ruling out a further drop,” she told Cointelegraph on Jan. 12, before Bitcoin’s recovery past the level. The asset recently pushed past $36,000 with conviction. Bitcoin’s four-hour price chart now shows a higher low.Updated commentary from CryptoWendyO shows bullishness on price at present. She told Cointelegraph on Thursday:Regarding recent price action, Krogsgard sees a correlation with one of the mainstream market's Bitcoin products. “It appears the GBTC's closing and re-opening for deposits had a real impact on demand for coins, as the re-opening of their market marked the bottom,” Krogsgard posited. “I believe we'll continue to see institutional demand on any dips.”Run by Grayscale, GBTC is essentially the stock form of Bitcoin, with each share backed by a fraction of one Bitcoin. The company put BTC trust investments on hold back in December and reopened them this month."
678,"Coinbase Ventures, the investment arm of the major crypto exchange, has invested an undisclosed amount into Titan, a developer of software and services targeted at industrial Bitcoin (BTC) mining.According to Titan’s announcement, the investment will help continue development of the company’s products and improve efficiency and profitability of Bitcoin mining companies.Ryan Condron, co-founder and CEO of Titan, said that “mining has advanced from hobby, to industry, to critical global computing infrastructure, and Titan is prepared to help world-class miners meet these challenges.”Titan offers advanced pool and mining software targeted specifically for professional U.S.-based miners. Its network of nodes and mining dashboards allows miners to better compete on a global scale, according to the company.Previously, Titan launched the Titan Pool in collaboration with CoinMint and CoreScientific, two major mining infrastructure providers in the U.S. Among the benefits offered by the pool, Titan cites better transparency and, crucially, solving some jurisdictional issues for U.S. miners.China currently accounts for the vast majority of the Bitcoin hashrate. The relative dominance can be attributed to a combination of attractive electricity costs and a localized supply chain.The Sichuan region is particularly attractive for miners due to its cheap hydroelectric power. Its importance is so pronounced that local seasons have a strong effect on Bitcoin’s hash rate. But cheap electricity is not unique to China, with some regions in the U.S., Canada and Europe being just as competitive.The mining supply chain, on the other hand, sees a much stronger dominance of Chinese companies. Mining hardware manufacturers are almost exclusively based in China. This gives local miners a powerful home field advantage, as there may be difficulties in exporting and importing certain chips and devices. Though the U.S. is catching up in terms of mining hash rate, accounting for 14% of the total, local firms are still using Chinese-made devices.This may be particularly problematic in today’s geopolitical environment, where the U.S. is actively banning Chinese-made products and services, and going as far as prohibiting investment in Chinese companies. The mining industry has already begun responding, with some operators repatriating hash rate. Though the departure of President Trump may help ease tensions somewhat, some analysts believe that there may be no reset in sight for the U.S.-China relations.Titan is primarily focusing on the software side of the mining supply chain, offering a national pool for miners to join. There have also been some developments in local maintenance infrastructure, with Bitmain offering technician certification courses in the U.S. in May 2020.Interest in diversifying the mining industry away from China’s dominance appears to be high, but full independence is unlikely to be achieved until ASIC manufacturers from other countries step in."
679,"Bitcoin's market capitalization was briefly flippened today as Wrapped Bitcoin suddenly gained quadrillions of dollars in value.WBTC showed a behemoth market cap of about $432 quadrillion for a brief period (the total world money supply is estimated at $1.2 quadrillion, including derivatives, according to Rankred.com.) It sat listed atop all the other assets, even Bitcoin (BTC), which had a valuation of roughly $733 billion at the time. But crypto aficionados and maximalists need not worry about the usurpation of the Bitcoin crown: The move was a glitch on CoinMarketCap, which briefly displayed Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) as worth more than all other assets in the world combined. A spokesperson for CoinMarketCap told Cointelegraph:Even a Google search for four hundred and thirty-two quadrillion, nine hundred and forty-nine trillion, two hundred and forty-seven billion, four hundred and thirty-two million, eight hundred and sixty-five thousand, six hundred and sixty-four displayed Wrapped Bitcoin's supposed market value. And if it's on the internet, it must be true...CoinMarketCap quickly fixed the glitch, subsequently putting WBTC back in its rightful place: 13th in the rankings, with a market cap of about $4 billion at the time of publication. Before fixing the glitch fully, however, WBTC remained in the top position for a few moments, even after its market cap was corrected.But what is WBTC anyway? It's Bitcoin in an Ethereum wrapper. This allows participants to use WBTC within the Ethereum ecosystem, as the network runs on a different blockchain. This way, participants can use Bitcoin for Ethereum-based activities, such as decentralized finance. Each WBTC has the same value as 1 BTC, backed one-to-one by actual Bitcoin, which is managed by a custodian, as detailed by BitGO in a blog post. Another asset flipped Bitcoin once before on CoinMarketCap, during the height of pandemic lockdowns when toilet paper became one of the world's most desired commodities. Toilet Paper Token rose above Bitcoin on March 31, 2020 — as an April Fools joke. So, this isn't the first time Bitcoin has been Number Two.Cointelegraph will be sure to report on the next time CoinMarketCap's data ""cwraps"" out."
680,"Bitcoin (BTC) surged higher on Jan. 14, reaching $40,000 on Coinbase amid fresh evidence of new large buys on exchanges.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView tracked BTC/USD as the pair delivered even more bullish surprises during Thursday trading, adding over 17% in 24 hours.The uptick is the latest bullish sign to come from Bitcoin price action, which just days ago focused on levels not much above $30,000.The revisiting of $40,000 came hours after BTC/USD entered and appeared to flip a crucial resistance zone to support at around $38,000.""That one needs to flip. If it does, we'll be eager for new all-time highs. If not, more consolidation likely,"" Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe summarized in a prior tweet.Others were already bullish beforehand. Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of exchange Gemini, referenced various press reports of a ""crash"" in Bitcoin as it slid to $30,250 earlier in the week. He told Twitter followers:""Did nocoiners really think #Bitcoin wouldn't bounce back? This is the year of the Metal Bull. $100k is inevitable,"" Blockstream chief strategy officer Samson Mow added.Bears losing their grip complements wary sentiment on the U.S. dollar as President-elect Joe Biden is set to announce a new coronavirus stimulus package reportedly worth trillions of dollars. While official details were still forthcoming as of publication, it was thought that it would include personal stimulus checks of $2,000 to eligible Americans.“I think positioning in risk assets is becoming a concern, so there could be a squeeze in the dollar near-term,” Shusuke Yamada, chief Japan FX strategist at Bank of America in Tokyo, told Reuters about the U.S. dollar outlook.The U.S. dollar currency index (DXY), with which Bitcoin traditionally shows inverse correlation, nonetheless continued its march higher on the day prior to announcements from Washington.Accompanying that rise was a similar rebound in funds removals from Bitcoin exchanges. As noted by on-chain analytics resource CryptoQuant, a single hour on Thursday saw ""unusual"" outflows from three large trading platforms, indicating mass-buying had taken place.Binance led the interest, with 6,051 BTC ($233 million) withdrawn during that time, followed by BitMEX with 951 BTC ($37 million).""Binance sent BTC to a couple of unknown cold wallets. These transactions could be related to internal transfers or OTC deals,"" CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju told Cointelegraph in private comments.As Cointelegraph reported, similar spikes in exchanges' outflows have occurred during recent upward price trends."
681,"A blockchain project says it makes Bitcoin programmable in a way that it hasn’t been before — enabling apps and smart contracts to be brought to the network.Stacks (formerly known as Blockstack) aims to position BTC as the foundation for a better internet that’s owned by users.Those behind this ecosystem argue that the internet is broken, with tech giants dominating the landscape.Stacks is a Layer 1 blockchain that uses Bitcoin’s infrastructure as a secure base layer. Smart contracts and apps can be enabled with little modification, with “minimal transaction load” on the network.Underpinning how scalable Stacks can be, developers claim that thousands of transactions result in a single hash — and microblocks result in quick confirmations. Crucially, this means that Stacks can scale independently of Bitcoin.Whereas the Bitcoin blockchain relies on the energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism, Stacks uses a novel alternative called proof-of-transfer, which reuses energy already spent on a proof-of-work chain — in this case Bitcoin. Known as PoX for short, those building Stacks claim that this is the first consensus algorithm between two blockchains — and it has the objective of “eliminating the choice between flexibility and security.”To eliminate the risk that a smart contract might perform in an unexpected way, which has become a common problem, a new programming language is being introduced with Stacks 2.0 called Clarity. This open-source project was jointly developed with Algorand, and is designed to give developers a safe way of building complex agreements.“Clarity makes it much harder to have smart contract bugs and allows developers to write logic around Bitcoin state directly. We believe bringing smart contracts directly to Bitcoin can make BTC more valuable as it can be put to productive use instead of being a passively held asset,” the Stacks whitepaper says.Stacks 2.0 has been designed in recognition of the fact that “Bitcoin is the most valuable, most secure blockchain in the world” — the world’s biggest cryptocurrency that has gained increasing levels of acceptance among institutional investors and media organizations.In time, the project believes that Bitcoin could become a new source of liquidity — as well as the default reserve asset for DeFi, eating into a market that has been dominated by Ethereum until now.“People are trying to bring BTC to Ethereum whereas we’re going the other direction, bringing Ethereum-like functionality to Bitcoin in a more secure, scalable way. With Stacks, we can take Bitcoin from passive to active capital,” the team added.As well as unlocking new cases for Bitcoin, Stacks pointed out that its ecosystem is also well developed — with more than 400 DApps built on its network to date. The latest figures suggest that at least 300,000 people hold STX tokens globally.Whereas “staking” has become a major buzzword in the crypto community in recent months — in part due to how the Ethereum blockchain is making the transition to proof-of-stake — Stacks says that it has come up with a Bitcoin-focused alternative: Stacking.Stacking involves locking STX to the network and sending periodic transactions, helping to keep things secure. Stacks says that regular Bitcoin rewards are offered in exchange — adding that this approach helps crypto enthusiasts avoid the need for costly mining setups and DeFi products that have been built on insecure smart contracts.One crucial difference with stacking lies in how user funds cannot be slashed based on network activity. A user’s funds never leave their wallet, and no special hardware is required to get involved.As 2021 gets underway, Stacks is aiming to build a better financial system on top of Bitcoin that makes capital worth hundreds of billions of dollars programmable.Disclaimer.

682,"Swiss SIX Exchange, Switzerland’s principal stock exchange, continues to expand its crypto products with a new Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded product, or ETP.On Jan. 13, SIX launched trading of the BTCetc Bitcoin ETP (BTCE), a new crypto ETP product issued by London-based investment firm ETC Group. The newly listed ETP tracks the price of Bitcoin, providing investors with a new way to get exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Each BTCE unit provides holders with a claim on a predefined amount of BTC.ETC Group specializes in building new digital asset-backed securities and is backed by shareholders like XTX Markets’s venture capital arm XTX Ventures and financial services firm ITI Capital.SIX is one of the world’s biggest ETP trading platforms, listing a wide number of crypto investment products. After listing the world’s first crypto ETP in late 2018, SIX has been actively introducing diverse ETPs including several products backed by 21Shares. In July 2020, SIX listed the Bitcoin Capital Active ETP, an actively managed ETP trading BTC against 14 top altcoins like Ether (ETH).An ETP is a type of security that is priced derivatively and trades based on investment tools such as a commodity, a currency, a share price, or an interest rate. Opposed to crypto exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, crypto ETPs are always 100% backed by the assets they are tracking. However, while crypto ETPs increasingly pop up on exchanges, especially in Europe, the digital asset industry is still waiting for the first crypto ETF.The crypto community has made numerous attempts to launch a crypto ETF in recent years, with investment management firm VanEck becoming the first company to file for a Bitcoin ETF in July 2018. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission pulled back many ETF efforts, including two applications by Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.In the end, these applications were eventually dismissed by regulators, many of whom still believed that the crypto industry hadn't sufficiently matured in order to support an ETF. The United States Securities Exchange has also expressed concern over the volatility of crypto assets and the issue of custody vis-a-vis a Bitcoin ETF. Despite many failed attempts, the crypto industry continues its efforts to list a Bitcoin ETF on a major exchange. On Jan. 11, Canadian investment fund manager Arxnovum Investments filed a prospectus for a Bitcoin ETF with Canadian securities regulators."
683,"It has stated a variety of reasons for why the products cannot be “reliably valued” by retail consumers, such as financial crime, volatility and an inadequate understanding of crypto assets being the main ones. It was estimated that retail investors will save $53 million due to this ban. This is despite the FCA releasing a research stating that U.K. consumers have invested an estimated $2.6 million in crypto assets.Although the main intention of this ban is to protect retail investors from the complexity of these products, the assumption that retail investors in the U.K. have an inadequate understanding of crypto assets might be incorrect. Jesse Spiro, global head of policy and regulatory affairs at Chainalysis — a blockchain analysis company — told Cointelegraph: “Given the amount of available information and market intelligence that is now regularly produced on the cryptocurrency ecosystem, there are many retail investors that have a high degree of technical expertise and knowledge.”Last year saw crypto derivatives go through an enormous growth phase, where the open interest in Bitcoin options multiplied threefold in 100 days, reaching a yearly high of $6.8 billion on Dec. 31 before growing even further in early January amid a bull run, reaching an all-time high of $10.5 billion on Jan. 7. Even though this growth must include an increased interest from retail investors as well, there are several indicators pointing to the fact that it has mainly grown due to the involvement of institutional investors.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is one of the most important exchanges for institutional investors to give themselves exposure to digital assets through Bitcoin futures and options. The platform has reported that Bitcoin’s (BTC) average daily volume grew 114% year-on-year in 2020, which took the average daily open interest on CME up by 252%. The unique active accounts also rose to 6,700, showing an 84% growth year-on-year. The main indicator of institutional interest, the number of large open interest holders, grew to a record of 110 in December as evident from the chart below.The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority banned the sale of crypto derivatives and exchange-traded notes to retail investors effective Jan. 9, 2021. The FCA’s main underlying reason for this is the products are “ill-suited for retail consumers due to the harm they pose.” Jay Hao, CEO of crypto and derivatives exchange OKEx, told Cointelegraph that “crypto assets are indeed volatile as the FCA points out, and many investors have lost a lot of money when trades don’t go their way.” However, he added: “The problem is that when retail traders make a loss, they are not in a position to absorb it as comfortably as high-net-worth individuals or institutional investors.”The reduced risk appetite of retail investors as compared to institutional investors is one of the reasons that retail investors need protection from a regulatory body. But this doesn’t necessarily mean that all retail investors are unsophisticated and that they shouldn’t have an option to use derivatives to hedge risk in their portfolio.Haohan Xu, CEO and founder of Apifiny — a global liquidity and settlement solutions provider — told Cointelegraph: “Derivatives do more than amplify gains and losses. They also help investors hedge risks. Just because someone is unsophisticated does not mean that someone should be denied certain options to hedge risks.”The risks in the crypto derivatives market are comparable to the risks of the foreign exchange markets, which are also highly leveraged. In these markets, governments and regulators all around the world step in and enforce maximum leverage limits for investors. The FCA could resort to solutions like that instead of a blanket ban, according to Hao:Another issue that a blanket ban brings up is that retail investors who are persistent in investing in these banned products will need to circumvent this rule and invest in markets that are not under the FCA’s protection. Hao further stated: “These investors would be outside of the purview and protection of the FCA — which is obviously counterproductive.”Xu alluded to another method to circumvent the ban using decentralized finance markets, which have seen 30% growth since the beginning of this year: “Although not favored by regulators across the world, DeFi derivatives platforms are always an option for crypto derivatives since most of them can be accessed by anyone from anywhere with just a wallet.”It seems evident that there might be a better solution than a blanket ban, as it could possibly do more harm than good at this point, leading U.K. investors to marketplaces with no regulations or to lowering Know Your Customer standards, which brings more risk to retail investors who don’t have the same safeguards as institutional ones.Even after announcing the blanket ban on crypto derivatives and exchange-traded note products, Bitcoin’s price drop to $33,000 on Jan. 11 led FCA to issue a public warning about the high risks underlying all crypto assets and assets linked to them. The agency has also stated: “If consumers invest in these types of products, they should be prepared to lose all their money.”Hao elaborated on how education would be a more effective method to protect retail investors than outright bans: “Education is key, and giving investors the chance to demonstrate their level of knowledge and skill before accessing complex products is crucial.” He further stated: “Unfortunately, if retail investors are forced onto exchanges with lower security standards in virtual asset storage, they could end up suffering more harm from this ban.”The crypto community has been contributing to these initiatives on education by establishing points and platforms for retail investors to be educated of any risks that are involved in trading within leveraged derivatives markets. Various exchanges have education and blog sections on their website tailored for retail investors to educate them on all these aspects. There are also exclusive blockchain and cryptocurrency education platforms, such as Blockchain Education Network, which was started by students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Michigan.It’s also essential for the crypto community to engage with governments and regulatory bodies to establish frameworks that enable retail investors to navigate these markets with ease. Spiro stated: “The regulators’ priorities lie in protecting the financial ecosystem and consumers. Working collaboratively is the best way to pacify regulatory concerns while avoiding onerous regulation.”Due to the size and volumes of the U.K. retail market in comparison to the global crypto derivatives market, it is highly unlikely that this ban will have a significant impact on the accelerated growth of the crypto derivatives that continues into 2021. According to Hao:"
684,"Dan Morehead, founder and CEO of Bitcoin (BTC) investment firm Pantera Capital, has maintained his bullish Bitcoin prediction for 2021.Bitcoin is poised to hit as much as $115,000 by August 2021, surging 200% in the next eight months, Morehead reportedly said at a conference call on Jan. 12. The exec initially made this prediction in August 2020, when Bitcoin was trading at about $11,600. At publishing time, the cryptocurrency is trading at over $38,000. On Tuesday, Morehead said that Bitcoin still has lots of room for growth:Morehead believes that major global digital currency developments like China’s digital yuan will positively impact the crypto market by boosting mainstream adoption. “There are over a billion people on earth that do not have access to a bank, but do have access to a smartphone, and that’s all you need to use a cryptocurrency,” Morehead said.Joey Krug, co-chief information officer of Pantera, said that Bitcoin’s ongoing bull run is different from previous rallies and will not end the same way as its previous run in 2017. Krug said that the latest rally is much stronger in terms of adoption fundamentals. “The high level fundamentals for 2017 was that there really wasn’t much fundamentals at all, most projects were just an idea on a piece of paper, most things hadn’t launched, most things didn’t have live products,” he stated.Morehead is not alone in believing that Bitcoin will reach $100,000 in 2021. In early January, Binance.US CEO Catherine Coley predicted that Bitcoin could hit $100,000 by the end of the year. PlanB, the creator of the stock-to-flow model, also predicted that Bitcoin should achieve the $100,000 to $288,000 range by December 2021.On Jan. 8, Bitcoin set a new historical high of $42,000, following a massive rally breaking $20,000 at the end of 2020. Following a correction, Bitcoin is steadily rebounding, trading at $38,600, up about 12% over the past 24 hours at publishing time."
685,"A German-born programmer in San Francisco has now used up eight of 10 password attempts he has to unlock the hard drive containing the private keys to his Bitcoin wallet, which contains 7,002 Bitcoin (BTC). As of press time, those holdings would be worth $268 million — that is, if only they were accessible.As a New York Times profile on Jan. 12 outlined, Stefan Thomas uses a hard drive called an IronKey, but lost the paper on which he wrote down the password for the device ""years ago."" If Thomas fails to remember it, 10 failed guesses will result in the drive encrypting its contents forever. He has, so far, tried eight guesses with no luck. Nearly 20% of all existing Bitcoin — 18.5 million BTC — is thought to have been lost for good, in so-called ""stranded"" wallets, according to Chainalysis data. Thomas is not alone in his self-avowed desperation: a Los Angeles entrepreneur, Brad Yasar, told the Times that over the years ""I would say I have spent hundreds of hours"" trying to get back into inaccessible wallets. Yasar has stored away his hard drives ""in vacuum-sealed bags"" so that he is no longer ""reminded every day that what I have now is a fraction of what I could have that I lost.""Neither story is uncommon: Wallet Recovery Services, a company that specializes in recovering lost digital keys, reportedly gets 70 requests each day from clients seeking help. That number is three times higher than it was before the bull market.Thomas's experience has apparently turned him off the concept of a technology that places the onus on individual users to take their finances into their own hands — with all the freedom, and risks, that it entails. Having originally received the 7,002 BTC as a gift in exchange for producing a video to educate people about the currency, he's now skeptical about leaving users with that degree of control: Aside from his extraordinary losses, Thomas nonetheless held on to enough Bitcoin over the years to make a fortune — he is reportedly so wealthy that he barely knows what to do with it, to paraphrase the report. He also later joined Ripple and acquired XRP, although the company's recent legal difficulties may now cast a shadow over the project's future prospects.The report notes that similar risks exist when users entrust third-party custodians with their keys — citing Mt. Gox and other industry crimes — but does include input from those who believe the trade-offs of digital currency are, at the end of the day, worth it.An entrepreneur in Barbados, despite having lost 800 BTC in the past, claimed that ""the risk of being my own bank comes with the reward of being able to freely access my money and be a citizen of the world."" His view, from a corner of the globe where financial inclusion remains a concern, provides an insight into why many individuals may continue to think likewise."
686,"James Howells, the owner of a discarded hard drive with 7,500 Bitcoin (BTC), has made a fresh plea to excavate a landfill site and possibly recover the device.Back in 2013, Howells accidentally threw away a hard drive containing 7,500 BTC while cleaning his house. The Bitcoin stash came from Howell’s mining activity back when it was still possible to use CPUs to mine Bitcoin.By November 2013, the Bitcoin  in the hard drive was already worth $6.5 million and Howell has been trying to recover it ever since.Now, according to Newport daily tabloid, the South Wales Argus, Holler has tendered a fresh appeal for the right to excavate a landfill site in the city.Following successive rejections by the Newport city council, Howells has upped the ante, offering up 25% of the value of the lost Bitcoin as a COVID-19 relief donation to the city. At the current price of Bitcoin, the hard drive holds almost $290 million, meaning the city could earn about $72 million if the drive is recovered successfully.According to Howells, all he needs is access to the landfill records to identify the exact grid location of the hard drive for a targeted search of the facility. The IT engineer also revealed that the search team would create an air-tight seal to prevent the release of poisonous landfill gases while excavating.Commenting on the possibility of being able to recover useful data from the hard drive, Howells remarked:However, Newport city council officials say the environmental risks associated with the excavation are significant given the likelihood of the exercise not yielding any fruit. Should the data be unrecoverable, council officials say the city would be left to foot the bill.Meanwhile, Howells says he is prepared to commit funds to an escrow account to cover the excavation costs.Howells is one of many Bitcoin owners to have lost access to their funds over the years. In 2012, Campbell Simpson, a former Gizmodo editor also discarded a hard drive holding 1,400 BTC, now worth $53.6 million.From lost private keys, to mistakenly sending BTC to burn addresses, as much as 20% of the current circulating supply may be lost forever. Indeed, data from crypto analytics provider Chainalysis and on-chain aggregator Glassnode puts the number of lost Bitcoin between 3 million and 3.7 million “coins.”Recently, a student was fortunate to recover the private keys to a wallet holding 127 BTC worth $4.8 million."
687,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has extended its recovery on Jan. 14, reclaiming the $38,000 level. What's more, the weekly candle has now turned green for the fifth consecutive week despite the 28% crash earlier this week. Meanwhile, stablecoin deposits are flooding into cryptocurrency exchanges, according to data from CryptoQuant. This inflow may act as a short-term catalyst for Bitcoin as it suggests that sidelined capital is moving back into BTC.In the cryptocurrency market, many traders sell crypto assets, like Bitcoin, to stablecoins rather than cash.Stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT), is pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar and are tradable across exchanges.Most exchanges require a complicated Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process for bank transfers, and cash deposits into exchanges could take a long time.As such, if a whale or a high-net-worth investor wants to buy and sell millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin, stablecoins can be far more convenient than cash.The high demand for stablecoins from traders has led the valuation of Tether to increase in recent months. Last month, the market cap of Tether surpassed $20 billion. A month later, this number is already above $24 billion, indicating a rise in sidelined capital within the cryptocurrency market.Meanwhile, stablecoin deposits into exchanges have increased substantially over the past 24 hours. CryptoQuant tracks the wallets of exchanges and observes stablecoin deposits and outflows.Across major exchanges, stablecoin deposits spiked noticeably on Jan. 13, right as the price of Bitcoin began to recover.On Jan. 13, the price of Bitcoin dropped to as low as $32,500 after nearly $1 billion worth of futures contracts were liquidated.Investors were actively buying the dip, as shown by the increase in stablecoin deposits and the increasing open interest of the Bitcoin futures market. As a result, Bitcoin saw a quick turnaround, rallying by more than 10% overnight.Alex Saunders, a cryptocurrency analyst, said that stablecoins are “flooding exchanges,” which is often indicative of a bullish trend.Prior to the recovery, Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said an all-time high is likely for Bitcoin if it surpasses $38,000 again.Overnight, the price of Bitcoin pierced through the $38,000 resistance area, which Van de Poppe pinpointed. Hence, in the short term, BTC is on track to retest its record-high. He said:Bitcoin’s rally also coincides with the opening of Grayscale’s products on Jan. 13. If the value of Bitcoin continues to rise, it could propel more institutional and accredited investors to obtain exposure to BTC through the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).There is also a strong argument to be made that the reopening of GBTC kickstarted the rally, to begin with, signifying that the uptrend is led by institutions, not by retail investors."
688,"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey cited his passion for Bitcoin and decentralization in a 13-Tweet thread today explaining why the company banned U.S. President Donald Trump from the platform last week. Although claiming this was the “right decision for Twitter,” Dorsey admits it sets a dangerous precedent.Having to take these actions fragment the public conversation. They divide us. They limit the potential for clarification, redemption, and learning. And sets a precedent I feel is dangerous: the power an individual or corporation has over a part of the global public conversation.Trump was banned from Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and other social media platforms on January 7 after he was blamed for inciting supporters to storm the Capitol building, resulting in the death of four individuals. The social networks stated concerns that Trump would use them for “further incitement of violence.”In today's Twitter thread, Dorsey gives a more in-depth explanation, admitting the decision was not taken lightly, and that it will have “real and significant ramifications.” He said that even though this event was simply “a company making a business decision to moderate itself,” it can feel very similar to “government removing access.”Dorsey explained that he didn’t want Twitter’s unilateral action to “erode a free and open global internet” and suggested that Bitcoin’s model of decentralization is a better way to approach control and moderation on the internet in future.Bitcoin demonstrates “what the internet wants to be, and over time, more of it will be,” adding:The CEO also reminded readers that Twitter is actively trying to progress towards a decentralized future, “funding an initiative around an open decentralized standard for social media.”Twitter is funding a small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media. The goal is for Twitter to ultimately be a client of this standard.Dorsey posted the explanation as news emerged of Trump being impeached for a second time by the House of Representatives. The thread, although only two hours old, has already received more than 41,000 likes."
689,"Israel-based exchange platform eToro is struggling to keep up with the demand from crypto traders according to an email sent to users earlier today.As a result, the platform is warning of “possible limitations to crypto BUY orders” and that “spreads on crypto assets may also be much wider than usual.”@MatiGreenspan I know you have a mega position on $BTC on eToro, A sat for your thoughts. pic.twitter.com/Xt12bAJGxJEToro has become a victim of its own success. Yesterday marketing manager Brad Michelson revealed that in the previous 11 days, 380,000 new users had opened accounts and that trading volumes had surged 25 times higher than the same time in 2020. As of January 9, eToro boasted more than 17 million registered users.Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan — formerly a market analyst for eToro — told Cointelegraph that the warning notice was “a symptom of a potential upcoming liquidity crunch.” He advised users on Twitter against trying to move funds off the platform.I wouldn't be moving anything right at this time. Buckle up bro.Should eToro implement the foreshadowed measures, users will be restricted on their maximum exposure per cryptocurrency, and potentially be unable to place new buy orders. Greenspan explained that it simply means some users “might need to wait in order to buy in.”An eToro spokesperson told Cointelegraph that ""In response, in the first eleven days of 2021, we have had over 380,000 new users register with eToro and crypto trading volumes of over 25x compared to the same period in 2020. We have therefore communicated with clients about the possibility of limitations to crypto buy orders this coming weekend. Our experience of the 2017 crypto rally means that we understand the possible consequences of extreme volatility in crypto markets. We want to ensure that our clients fully understand the possible risks.""Last week, the exchange restricted European users from margin trading due to increased market risks and increased the minimum deposit amount by 400% to $1,000 in an attempt to get on top of new user registrations.Other exchanges are also seeing surging trade volumes, with Coinbase’s daily volume reaching $9.5 billion on January 12, up more than 50% from its previous all-time high of $6.5 billion on January 9. Binance has also powered past its peak of $23.7 billion, recording over $30 billion on January 12.It is only a matter of time before we see other exchanges start to hit liquidity issues Greenspan believes, saying it is “highly likely” that we will see this situation occurring on other platforms in the near future.Concerns around the limited Bitcoin supply available have risen to the foreground over the last six months with investment giant Grayscale snapping up Bitcoin at an alarming pace.

690,"Bitcoin (BTC) price broke through the $35,000 resistance and appears to be stepping into a new range that would see the price trade between $38,000 to $40,000. Today’s recovery from the $34,000 level also appers to have invalidated what looked to be a bearish head and shoulders pattern forming on the 4-hour timeframe. Reclaiming the $36,000 level as support may also assist with squashing the infantile narrative that Bitcoin price was entering a new bear market after this week’s 26.5% plunge shaved off $200 billion from the total cryptocurrency market capitalization.Despite this plunge, financial advisers continue to develop a more positive outlook on the top cryptocurrency as well as the growing DeFi sector.The recent announcement from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) allowing banks to transact and custody stablecoins is being interpreted as a green light by the sector as a whole.Proof of this comes today as custody provider Anchorage was just granted the first digital bank charter by the OCC. According to outgoing OCC chief Brian Brooks, the online future for finance is inevitable.The current market conditions continue to mirror the trend of previous cycles where Bitcoin price corrects sharply then consolidates after experiencing a period of parabolic growth.During these consolidation phases traders tend to shift funds into altcoins and today’s increased volume and rallies from a number of altcoins re-enforces this theory.As Bitcoin spent the early part of the day trading between $32,000 and $35,000 Ether (ETH) pushed higher, gaining 3.96% to trade at $1,120 at the time of writing.Meanwhile, Polkadot (DOT) was the breakout coin of the day, up 36.89% and trading near $11.30. Its sister chain Kusama (KSM) also received a boost in price as it rallied 21.25% to trade at $77.59The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $983.5 billion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 68.7%."
691,"The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or CME, has recorded significant volume for its Bitcoin (BTC) futures trading product over the course of the last 12 months. “More than 2.2+ million contracts were traded in 2020,” a CME representative told Cointelegraph. Each cash-settled Bitcoin futures contract at the CME is worth the dollar value of 5 Bitcoin.The trading hub recorded higher than normal numbers as Bitcoin’s price heated up in December 2020 following a break of its 2017 all-time price high of $19,892 on Dec. 1. “BTC average daily volume (ADV) reached 11,179 contracts (55.9K equivalent bitcoin) in December, up 114% YoY [year over year],” the CME representative said.Average daily open interest, or ADOI, “reached a record of 11,108 contracts (55,540 equivalent bitcoin) in Q4, up 233% vs. Q4 2019,” according to a statement from CME Group. Big players also showed up for trading, evident in the exchange’s large open interest holders, or LOIH, count. “The number of LOIH grew to a record of 110 in the first week of December, indicating strengthening institutional interest,” the CME representative said.The CME is planning a February launch for its Ether (ETH) futures, which were initially announced in December 2020. A number of large financial entities expressed interest in Bitcoin in 2020, including MicroStrategy and Square, which allocated large sums of capital to crypto’s first asset."
692,"The top 100 richest Bitcoin (BTC) addresses have added 334,000 Bitcoin to their existing holdings over the past 30 days, a clear signal that whales and institutional-size investors bought the dip. A positive sign is that most of them have not reacted to the recent fall in Bitcoin’s price. This suggests that large investors are bullish on Bitcoin for the long term rather than looking to make a quick gain.An important element in the recent rally is many of the purchases have come from institutional investors who were critical of Bitcoin in the past. The list is likely to get bigger as Oaktree Capital’s co-chairman and co-founder Howard Marks is revisiting his previous “skeptical view” on Bitcoin. In his latest investor memo, Marks said that “thankfully,” his son had purchased a meaningful amount of Bitcoin for the family.Several institutional investors have been critical of the central banks’ expansionary monetary policies but until now, they primarily used gold to hedge their portfolios. The ones who shifted even a small portion of their gold portfolio into Bitcoin are reaping huge gains.One such firm, Ruffer Investment had redeployed 2.5% of its Multi-Strategies Fund from gold to Bitcoin in November, and since then, gold has returned a meager 4%, and Bitcoin, even after the recent fall is still up by about 92%.These outsized gains, even on a small percentage of the portfolio, can easily outperform the peers. To keep up with the competition, institutional investors who may have missed buying earlier could quietly open Bitcoin positions on each new correction.Many analysts have suggested that institutional investor inflow propelled the current Bitcoin rally and for this reason, traders will be looking out for signals that large investors are buying again.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.The long tail on the Jan. 11 candlestick shows the bulls aggressively purchased the dip below the 20-day exponential moving average ($32,705). However, the failure of the bulls to resume the uptrend on Jan. 12 shows the bears continue to sell on every minor rally.The bears want to break and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA while the bulls are attempting to defend it. If the BTC/USD pair does not rebound sharply within the next few days, it may lead to capitulation from buyers and the short-term traders stuck at higher levels.If the selling intensifies, the BTC/USD pair may break below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $29,688.10 and fall to the 50-day simple moving average ($24,983). Such a move will suggest the bullish momentum has weakened and that may lead to a few days of range-bound action.On the other hand, if the pair rebounds off the current levels, the bulls will try to resume the uptrend. The momentum could pick up if the bulls drive the price above $41,959.63.The bulls aggressively purchased Ether (ETH) during the dip below the 20-day EMA ($982) on Jan. 11 but they could not sustain the recovery on Jan. 12, suggesting that demand dries up at higher levels.However, the positive sign is that the bulls again bought the dip to the 20-day EMA today. The buyers will now try to push the price above $1,150 and if they succeed, the ETH/USD pair may rise to $1,300. A breakout of this resistance may resume the uptrend.On the contrary, if the pair turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, the decline could extend to $840.93 and then to the 50-day SMA ($732). A break below this support will signal that the bears are back in the game.XRP is currently range-bound in a downtrend. The price is oscillating between $0.169 and $0.384998. The flat 20-day EMA ($0.30) and the relative strength index (RSI) just below the midpoint, suggest a balance between supply and demand.If the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USD pair may rise to $0.384998. A breakout and close above this level will form an inverse head and shoulders pattern, indicating a possible reversal.Conversely, if the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance, then the pair may remain range-bound for a few more days. A break below $0.169 could resume the downtrend.Litecoin (LTC) bounced off the 50-day SMA ($110) on Jan. 11 but the bulls could not push the price back above the 20-day EMA ($142) on Jan. 12, indicating selling at higher levels.The long tail on today’s candlestick suggests buying at lower levels. The bulls will once again try to push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the LTC/USD pair may move up to $160 and then to $180.However, if the bears successfully defend the 20-day EMA, the pair may trade between the moving averages for a few days. The flat moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint also suggest a balance between supply and demand.Cardano’s (ADA) strong rebound off the 20-day EMA ($0.247) on Jan. 11 suggests the sentiment remains bullish as traders are buying on dips. But the long wick on the Jan. 12 candlestick suggests the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight.Today’s inside day candlestick pattern suggests indecision about the next directional move. However, the upsloping moving averages and the RSI in positive territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside.If the bulls can push the price above $0.3141252, the ADA/USD pair may rally to $0.3542857. A break above this level may result in a rally to $0.40.This bullish view will invalidate if the pair turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($0.186).Bitcoin Cash (BCH) rebounded from just below the 20-day EMA ($427) on Jan. 11 but the bulls could not sustain the recovery and push the price back above $515.35 on Jan. 12, indicating selling at higher levels.Today, the bulls have again defended the 20-day EMA and will now try to push the price back above $515.35. If they succeed, the BCH/USD pair may pick up momentum and rally to $631.71.Conversely, if the up-move turns down from $515.35, the pair may drop to the 20-day EMA and remain range-bound between these two levels for the next few days.Polkadot (DOT) completed a successful retest of the breakout level on Jan. 11 when it rebounded sharply from $7.1642. The sharp recovery from the intraday lows carried the price back above the 20-day EMA ($8.39), which is a positive sign.The DOT/USD pair formed an inside day Doji candlestick pattern on Jan. 12, indicating indecision about the next directional move. This uncertainty resolved to the upside today and the bulls are currently attempting to resume the uptrend.The up-move may face resistance in the $10 to $10.68 resistance zone, but if the bulls can thrust the price above it, the pair could rally to $12.50. Conversely, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the pair may consolidate near the highs for a few days.The long tail on the Jan. 11 candlestick shows the bulls aggressively purchased the drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.23). Stellar Lumens (XLM) attempted to extend the recovery on Jan. 12 but the long wick on the day’s candlestick shows profit booking at higher levels.The bulls are currently trying to sustain the price above $0.2864. If they are able to do that, the XLM/USD pair may move up to $0.35 where it is likely to hit a roadblock.If the price turns down from this resistance, a few days of range-bound action between $0.35 and $0.25 is possible.On the contrary, if the price fails to sustain above $0.2864, the pair may retest the 20-day EMA. A break below this support could tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.Chainlink (LINK) had dipped below the 50-day SMA ($13.21) on Jan. 11 but the bears could not capitalize on this weakness, resulting in a strong rebound. Today again, the altcoin has bounced off the 50-day SMA, suggesting strong buying at this support.If the bulls push the price above $15.50, the LINK/USD pair may rise to $17.7777 where it is likely to face stiff resistance from the bulls.The flat moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.If the price turns down from $15.50, the pair may consolidate in a tight range for a few days. The trend will turn in favor of the bears if the price breaks below the uptrend line.Binance Coin (BNB) bounced off the $35.69 support on Jan. 11, indicating accumulation at lower levels. However, the bulls could not build up on the recovery on Jan. 12 and the altcoin formed a Doji candlestick pattern, suggesting indecision between the bulls and the bears.The buyers are currently trying to push the price back above the 20-day EMA ($38.74). If they succeed the BNB/USD pair could move up to the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the most recent leg of the fall at $40.0997.Above this level, the up-move could reach the 61.8% retracement at $41.2944 and then to $45.1620.However, the flat 20-day EMA and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a possible range-bound action in the near term. The trend could turn in favor of the bears if the pair slips below $35.0374.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

693,"In the short term, the crucial technical resistance level is $35,500. Throughout the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has continuously rejected at that level. When Bitcoin rose to around $35,500 on Binance earlier on Jan. 13, it saw an 8% drop shortly thereafter, indicating that there is strong selling pressure.A pseudonymous trader known as “Byzantine General” outlined that there are additional sell orders on Coinbase in the $36,500–$37,000 range, saying “I’m still not taking bets” and adding that he is “casually buying dips with spot.” There is significant uncertainty in the market due to the large price swings between $31,000 and $35,000 with no breakouts or bearish invalidations. The trader also noted that Bitcoin is currently at “VWAP” resistance, with high selling pressure at key resistance levels.The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is ranging between $32,000 and $35,000 after the big flush drop on Jan. 12. Traders remain mixed around BTC’s short-term trajectory due to various conflicting signals. Some are bullish because of the quick recovery from $30,500 and Grayscale reopening its products to new investors. Others are cautious due to the continuous rejection at the $35,000–$36,000 resistance range.However, the overall sentiment around Bitcoin has been increasingly positive over the past 24 hours. The swift correction from $41,000 to $30,500 flushed a lot of overleveraged buyers and long contracts. Prior to the correction, the Bitcoin futures funding rate was hovering at over 0.1% most of the time, meaning that the market was significantly overleveraged and overwhelmingly long.The futures funding rate is a mechanism that balances the market by rewarding buyers when the market is majority short and sellers when the market is majority long. In the Bitcoin futures market, the average funding rate is 0.01%. This means that long contract holders have to pay 0.01% of their position every eight hours to their short-seller counterparty. Because the market was overleveraged for such a long time, when the first big drop happened, the price of Bitcoin began to plummet as consecutive liquidations occurred.Following the drop, the futures market has become significantly less heated, and most derivatives products have normalized after seeing a rise in interest. Although the Bitcoin futures market’s open interest still remains near its all-time high, the market is healthier than before. This increases the probability of a renewed rally in the foreseeable future.According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of trading data platform CryptoQuant, many institutional investors bought Bitcoin at around $30,000. As such, if the price of Bitcoin drops to the $30,000–$32,000 support range, institutions would likely protect that level with large buy orders. This is mainly why Bitcoin saw a large reaction from buyers on Coinbase and other major U.S. exchanges when it dropped to $30,500 on Jan. 12. “The Coinbase outflow on Jan 2nd was a three-year high,” wrote Ju. “Speculative guess, but if these guys are behind this bull-run, they’ll protect the 30k level. Even if we have a dip, it wouldn’t go down below 28k.”Atop the likelihood of a prolonged whale accumulation at $30,000, there are two key macro narratives that could buoy the sentiment around Bitcoin. First, several mainstream media publications have reported that U.S. President-elect Joe Biden is expected to name Gary Gensler as the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Gensler previously taught a “Blockchain and Money” course, which has since been released for free on MIT OpenCourseWare. Considering this, Mechanism Capital partner Andrew Kang said that the “probability of #BTC ETF approval just went up significantly.”If a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund is approved after years of rejection, it would lead to two things. First, it would further legitimize Bitcoin as an established asset class and a store of value. Second, it would enable accredited investors and institutions to reliably invest in Bitcoin. Currently, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund are some of the go-to institutional vehicles to invest in cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin.Grayscale has reported a significant increase in demand in recent months. On Jan. 12, Grayscale reopened its products to new investors, including investment in GBTC after closing it down in December 2020. If institutions were the main driver of the recent Bitcoin rally, new inflows into GBTC could result in a newfound uptrend in the near term. Coincidentally, it was during the period of the fund’s closure when BTC saw a relatively large correction.In the foreseeable future, the bullish and bearish scenarios of Bitcoin revolve around two key levels: $30,000 and $35,500. As long as Bitcoin maintains $30,000 as a strong support area, the probability of a breakout above $35,500 increases. A clean move above $35,500 would likely mean a continuation of the rally, which could result in a new leg upward beyond its current all-time high.Traders and technical analysts say that the current price trend of Bitcoin is quite similar to when Bitcoin dropped to around $16,000 in late November 2020. At that time, Bitcoin consolidated for two weeks before finally breaking out and rallying to $20,000. The BTC price could see a similar trend where it bounces off of the $30,000 support and attempts to break the $35,500–$36,000 resistance range in the near term.A pseudonymous trader known as “Neko” said that Bitcoin’s rebound has been encouraging thus far. He anticipates BTC to retest $36,000 soon, which would leave the path open for a potential rally back to all-time highs above $42,000: “Very impressive buy backs shown. I’m really liking those wicks on the bottom side of those h4 candles. I think we have found the local bottom for now.”Another variable to consider in the short term is that the so-called “Kimchi premium” in South Korea has started to decline. When Bitcoin saw trading over $40,000, the premium was consistently hovering over 5%. Ever since the drop, the premium has been hovering at around 2% to 3%. This could indicate that the retail demand for cryptocurrencies in the South Korean market has cooled down slightly following the correction.Bitcoin has been trading lower on Coinbase as well, which is unusual, as it has been consistently higher than Binance throughout the rally. Coinbase also naturally has a higher BTC price than other major exchanges that use Tether (USDT), due to the minor difference between Tether and the U.S. dollar in the exchange market. Ideally, for the bull trend to resume, the premium on both South Korean exchanges and Coinbase would have to return."
694,"Nearly $1 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) futures contracts were liquidated on Jan. 13, a day after the big shakeout. The continuous loop of liquidations is causing extreme volatility and large price swings in the cryptocurrency market.In the Bitcoin futures market, traders borrow additional capital to bet against or for Bitcoin. The technical term for this is leverage, and when traders use high leverage, the liquidation threshold gets tighter.For example, if a trader borrows 10 times the initial capital, a 10% price move to the opposite direction would cause the position to be liquidated. Once it is liquidated, the position becomes worthless and all of the initial capital is lost.When Bitcoin saw the big 20% drop from $41,000 to $30,500 on Jan. 12, nearly $2 billion worth of futures contracts were liquidated.However, within 24 hours, another $1 billion worth of contracts were liquidated. Yet, there were no large price swings other than the range between $32,000 and $35,500.The data indicates that many traders have been overleveraging their positions to short BTC after it recovered from $30,500. Hence, as Bitcoin rallied to $35,500, many short contracts were liquidated.The cascading liquidations of short contracts are most likely the main reason behind BTC’s swift 20% relief rally from $30,500 to $35,500.The market is less leveraged compared with the past two weeks. The futures funding rate is moving in between 0.01% and 0.05%, which means buyers still represent the majority of the market but are not dominating the market.By comparison, when Bitcoin was above $40,000, the futures funding rate consistently remained at around 0.1% to 0.15%. This meant that the market was overwhelmed by buyers and overleveraged traders.Although extreme volatility is not favorable, the shakeout of an overleveraged market is healthy and essential for the continuation of the rally.If the Bitcoin market remains extremely overleveraged while rallying above $40,000, it risks a much larger correction than 25%.In previous bull markets, Bitcoin frequently saw 30% to 40% pullbacks, and as such, the recent drop from $42,000 to nearly $30,000 is nothing out of the ordinary for a BTC bull market. Additionally, as the pseudonymous trader known as “Byzantine General” noted, the $30,000 area has become a major support level.30k is pretty significant support, I don't think it's going to give out just yet.$BTC pic.twitter.com/ddThmeXSAKThe Bitcoin futures market cooling down while solidifying $30,000 as a support area is highly optimistic for the medium-term prospect of BTC.Whale clusters also identify the $30,000 level as a whale cluster support, which means that this psychological level will certainly be defended by the bulls if the price turns south."
695,"Block reward halvings cut the rate at which new coins are generated on a given blockchain by 50%. Such events, known jokingly as “halvenings,” have long been anticipated by cryptocurrency traders as catalysts for pushing up the price of their cryptocurrency holdings.Past attempts to predict when Bitcoin’s (BTC) price would increase in relation to halvings have proved inconsistent at best. However, few would be willing to quickly discount the mechanisms described in the law of supply and demand. All things being equal, as the number of coins available on the market decreases, the demand for those coins — and thus, the price of each — increases.With that in mind, here are four cryptocurrency projects that are due to undergo block reward halvings in the coming year, when their issuance rate will be cut in half.Verge (XVG) is set to undergo a halving on Jan. 25 when its chain reaches a block height of 4,700,000. At this point, the current reward of 200 XVG which is issued to miners every 30 seconds will be cut to 100 XVG.With just over 11 days to go before the halving, it may be assumed that the opportunity to get ahead of the reduction in Verge’s supply has already passed. However, capitalizing on block reward halvings has never been an exact science, and often times a coin fails to react to the event until after the fact.The XVG price hit an all-time high of $0.30 back in December 2017, before suffering a near three-year slide down to the $0.001 mark by 2020. Since the winter surge that sent Bitcoin to a new all-time high, however, Verge’s fortunes have reversed. The coin recorded growth of 219% between November and the time of writing.Tomochain’s (TOMO) halving will occur on Feb. 7, when the number of TOMO coins issued yearly will be reduced from 2 million to 1 million.The Tomochain blockchain features block times of two seconds, and every 900 blocks make up an epoch. For each epoch, a total of 250 coins are issued to miners at the current time. This figure will be halved to 125 coins in February.Launched in 2017, Tomochain uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The upcoming halving will be only the second in the coin’s history, and also its last. From here on, the TOMO issuance rate will remain the same until the coin’s total supply of 100,000,000 has been reached.Vertcoin’s (VTC) block reward halving is scheduled for Dec. 8, at which point the number of VTC issued to miners will be reduced from 25 to 12.5 per block.Vertcoin was forked from Litecoin (LTC)  — itself a Bitcoin fork — in 2014 as a response to the application-specific integrated circuit, or ASIC, machines that were invented for Litecoin mining the same year. Vertcoin aims to remain ASIC-resistant and can be mined with a GPU.Once a feature of the top 100 coins by market capitalization, Vertcoin now finds itself ranked in the mid-500s after a 98% decline from its all-time high in December 2017.Although not technically scheduled to take place until January 2022, Ravencoin’s (RVN) first block reward halving is just 12 calendar months away and will see the issuance rate cut from 5,000 RVN to 2,500 RVN per block.Launched in 2018, Ravencoin is geared toward the registration and trade of real-world assets on the blockchain. In 2018, the then little-known project received a surprise investment of “millions of dollars” from online American retail giant Overstock.Ravencoin reached an all-time high in the $0.08 range in June 2019. Today, the coin trades at a price of $0.016 — a 48% increase since recent lows in November 2020."
696,"Canadian investment fund manager Arxnovum Investments has filed a prospectus for a new Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund, or ETF, in Canada.On Monday, the company filed a stack of preliminary documents for the Arxnovum Bitcoin ETF with Canada’s Ontario Securities Commission.According to a preliminary long-form prospectus, Arxnovum plans to list its new Bitcoin ETF on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The listing is subject to the approval of the TSX in accordance with its original listing requirements. “The TSX has not conditionally approved the listing application of the Bitcoin ETF and there is no assurance that the TSX will approve the listing application,” Arxnovum noted.The company said that units of the Arxnovum Bitcoin ETF will trade on TSX against the U.S. dollar. The ETF will include Bitcoin and/or Bitcoin futures contracts and/or other derivatives instruments. The new Bitcoin ETF may also hold cash, cash equivalents and/or other fixed-income securities, the company said.According to the prospectus, the Arxnovum Bitcoin ETF will be backed by cryptocurrency exchange and custody firm Gemini, which will act as a sub-custodian for assets held outside of Canada:Arxnovum’s CEO, Shaun Cumby, previously held a senior position at 3iq — the company that listed the first public Bitcoin fund in Canada in 2020. As Cointelegraph previously reported, Gemini was also providing its crypto custodian services for 3iq’s QBTC.U fund.A Bitcoin ETF has been one of the most anticipated events in the crypto community in recent years. Back in 2018, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission rejected the Winklevoss twins’ second application for a Bitcoin ETF. According to a January report from JPMorgan Chase, the launch of a Bitcoin ETF could hurt Bitcoin’s price. On Jan. 13, Cointelegraph reported that VanEck, the first company to ever file for a Bitcoin ETF, is now facing a lawsuit from its former partner SolidX ."
