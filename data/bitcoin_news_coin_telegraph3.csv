0,"The crypto bull season, and the accompanying hype, is undoubtedly upon us. Recalling some of the celebrities who got in on crypto during the historic winter 2017 market, actress Lindsey Lohan has now recorded a paid, promotional video for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).Lohan's video was commissioned by a crypto news outlet via a platform called Cameo, an online service that allows people or businesses to hire celebrities to record personalized video messages at an agreed price. According to the site, as of publication, a user can make a video request from Lohan for roughly $350. In the 12-second-long video, the actress — appearing in a selfie frame in front of a nondescript, bleached window view — told viewers:Cointelegraph readers will remember the likes of Steven Seagal, Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather getting wrapped up in the initial coin offering, or ICO, fever of 2017 — stories that ended in lawsuits and tears, or in the case of Hilton, at least some shrewd distance after her chosen ICO fell into disrepute.Unlike these earlier involvements, Lohan's video predictions are not tied to emerging, smaller altcoins and, as such, remain restricted to a vaguer endorsement of the industry's most veteran and largest market-cap coins. Her reference to ""Ethereum"" — as opposed to the accurate, strictly speaking, asset name ""Ether"" — suggests the actress has not immersed herself to any significant extent in crypto markets and online culture.  As of publication, Bitcoin is circling the $34,220 mark, down just over 2% on the day, but up 77% on the month. Ether is retaining its foothold above the $1,000 mark, at close to $1,060, and is similarly up close to 80% on the month."
1,"Bitcoin (BTC) has much further to go to suck away even 10% of gold’s market cap than old data claims, a popular indicator reveals.Highlighting numbers from Bitcoin’s realized cap on Jan. 12, Ki Young Ju, CEO of on-chain analytics resource CryptoQuant, said that the cryptocurrency had taken far less of gold’s market cap than previously claimed.As Bitcoin grew in price towards the end of 2020 and hit all-time highs of $42,000 last week, a narrative appeared that investors were swapping gold for BTC, and that Bitcoin had thus taken around 7% of the precious metal’s market cap of $10 trillion.Using realized cap, which calculates market cap in a different, more precise manner, the real “theft” from gold actually stands at 2%, says Ki.Unlike market cap, the metric measures the price at which each bitcoin last moved, and excludes coins on centralized custodial exchanges, thus excluding speculative movements. The total is also kept lower by long-lost BTC, which will have last moved at likely far lower prices than today’s.“People said $BTC took 7% of the Gold market cap. No, it's not. There are unclaimed, unreachable, and lost Bitcoins. Based on the realized cap, it's just 2%,” he tweeted alongside a realized cap chart.Bitcoin’s realized cap stood at $227 billion on Wednesday, while its standard market cap was $645 billion.Despite its arguably slower progress, Bitcoin is still faring extremely well against gold, which failed to recoup its losses in BTC terms even as BTC/USD dropped to near $30,000 on Monday.Bitcoin bought 18.6 ounces of the precious metal at publishing time, according to data from Buy Bitcoin Worldwide.Gold posts strong gain on Bitcoin collapse. pic.twitter.com/sqNiWBDJIFBitcoin’s correlation to gold was trending towards zero this week, down markedly from highs seen in October.Previously, commentators noted that Bitcoin has already transferred all of gold’s $10 trillion market cap in its 12-year history.As Cointelegraph reported, however, criticism from gold fans remains, with gold bug Peter Schiff casting doubt on both Bitcoin’s status as a safe haven and institutional investors’ interest in it.“Bitcoin traded near $42K on Friday and near $30K on Monday. An asset that drops 28% over a weekend is not a safe-haven, a store of value, or a viable hedge against #inflation,” he tweeted this week."
2,"Major global cryptocurrency exchange Huobi is introducing Russia’s national fiat currency on its trading platform.According to a Jan. 12 announcement, Huobi Global now supports deposits and withdrawals in the Russian ruble. The new feature enables users to purchase and sell major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT), and Litecoin (LTC) for rubles. Other supported coins include EOS, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Bitcoin SV (BSV), DASH, as well as two Huobi-backed tokens like Huobi Token (HT) and Huobi Pool Token (HPT).To add ruble support, Huobi partnered with AdvCash, a fiat and crypto payment processor. The exchange previously collaborated with AdvCash to introduce ruble-denominated crypto purchases on its over-the-counter desk. AdvCash also provides fiat onramp services to Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange.The maximum deposit and withdrawal amounts are capped at 100,000 rubles ($1,350) and 50,000 rubles ($670), respectively. In order to deposit or withdraw rubles on Huobi, users will have to proceed with Know Your Customer checks.Huobi has been actively expanding into the Russian market. In September 2020, Huobi Global rolled out a mobile app in Russia, allowing local users to buy major cryptos like Bitcoin through the app. The exchange said that Russian residents make up 10% of its total spot trading volume.At the beginning of the year, Russia's long-awaited crypto law “On Digital Financial Assets” finally came into effect. The law provides a legal basis for the crypto industry but prohibits Russians from using crypto as payment."
3,"Bitcoin (BTC) at $34,000 may have gained a new convert after billionaire investor Howard Marks admitted that he needed to change his ""skeptical view.""In his latest investor memo dated Jan. 11, Marks, who is co-chairman and co-founder of the $140 billion Oaktree Capital Group, noted that while he was critical of Bitcoin during its 2017 bull run, his son had ""thankfully"" bought in. ""Back in 2017, my memo 'There They Go Again... Again' included a section on cryptocurrencies in which I stated a high level of skepticism. This view has been a subject of much discussion for me and  Andrew, who is quite positive on Bitcoin and several others and thankfully owns a meaningful amount for our family,"" the memo reads.The past few months has become a notable for U-turns on Bitcoin's merits. As Cointelegraph reported, figures from investors to banks have challenged their bearish prognoses on the cryptocurrency, some even pledging to expose their portfolios to include it.Marks did not make a similar commitment, but accepted the need to at least examine cryptocurrency and assess its potential.""The nature of innovation generally is such that, in the beginning, only a few believe in something that seems absurd when compared to the deeply entrenched status quo,"" he wrote.Reactions to Marks were nonetheless more than favorable, given his previous reputation as a steadfast Bitcoin detractor.""Really awesome to see billionaire Howard Marks talking so favorably about #Bitcoin!"" Preston Pysh of The Investor's Podcast Network tweeted in response to the memo.Fellow investment guru Lyn Alden, herself a public proponent of Bitcoin, even suggested that Mark's change in stance would lead stalwart critic Warren Buffett to cryptocurrency.2021 thus leaves Bitcoin's remaining outspoken bears in an rapidly decreasing minority. Among them remains gold bug Peter Schiff, whose outright dismissal of Bitcoin continues to cause outrage on social media and beyond.""Very few institutional investors are buying #Bitcoin,"" he claimed on Monda.Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of exchange Gemini, subsequently called Schiff's words ""completely false."""
4,"The chairman of a British investment firm says Bitcoin (BTC) is a seemingly “non-sensical” asset — but one that still makes sense after the coin’s winter price movement proved profitable. His firm, Ruffer Investment company, converted a portion of its gold holdings into Bitcoin in November.Ruffer Investment Company Limited reallocated 2.5% of its Multi-Strategies Fund from gold to Bitcoin in November as a hedge against the “continued devaluation” of fiat. Since then, the value of gold appreciated by 4%, while the value of Bitcoin grew by 92% — a figure which briefly rose to 123% during BTC’s short stay above $40,000 on Jan. 10.Writing in an investment review for the final quarter of 2020, Ruffer chairman Jonathan Ruffer said that after much internal deliberation, his firm had added exposure to Bitcoin because it thought BTC could challenge gold’s status as the one “supra-currency”. He wrote:Ruffer said Bitcoin was a “unique beast” which was subject to a “longish” assessment before being introduced to the multi-strat fund:The Ruffer firm had 20.3 billion pounds ($27.5 billion) in assets under management as of Nov. 30. The company was founded in 1994 and employs 330 people, serving around 6,600 clients comprised of pension funds, families, charities and individuals worldwide.Jonathan Ruffer told readers on the company website that even though Bitcoin seemed like a “non-sensical” asset, it was one that aligned with the firm’s perspective on the world:Despite Bitcoin’s ascendance to new all-time highs over the winter period, Ruffer said he felt only “nervously satisfied” with the outcome, and that keeping clients safe was more important than short-term price pumps."
5,"Global investment management firm VanEck, is facing a lawsuit from blockchain firm and former-partner SolidX over a Bitcoin ETF that VanEck filed for SEC approval less than two weeks ago.In 2017, VanEck became the first company to file for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund registered under the Investment Company Act, while SolidX has been working to bring a Bitcoin ETF to market since 2015. The two firms joined forces in June 2018, with SolidX touting its deep experience with crypto as a compliment to VanEck’s extensive background in issuing financial products.However, after withdrawing their most recent joint application for a Bitcoin ETF in September 2019, the two firms parted ways in August 2020. SolidX’s complaint describes the split as a “bad faith termination” of their agreement.On Dec. 31, VanEck announced it had filed a new application for a Bitcoin ETF.According to the lawsuit, VanEck’s SEC filings suggest the firm was “surreptitiously working on its own Bitcoin product even while telling the world that it was 'married' to SolidX.” The blockchain firm asserts:The plaintiff also alleges that “VanEck began announcing products that directly compete” within weeks of their terminated agreement, and that VanEck “could not have begun to issue [said products] without working against SolidX's interests while still its business partner.”In November, VanEck launched a physically-backed Bitcoin exchange-traded note on Germany’s Deutsche Börse Xetra market.SolidX states that VanEck’s “marquee” brand and “credibility” as an ETF issuer informed its decision to team up with the firm, claiming that VanEck “had little, if any, expertise in Bitcoin” and hired SolidX for its expertise on crypto assets."
6,"A survey published by crypto index fund provider Bitwise Asset Management has found the number of financial advisors allocating capital toward crypto has increased by roughly 50% in one year.The survey, conducted in partnership with investment website ETF Trends, queried nearly U.S.-based 1,000 financial advisors in December. The findings indicate that 9.4% of client portfolios were exposed to crypto assets — up from 6.3% one year ago.Of the investment advisors who have not yet allocated to crypto, 15% stated they will “probably” invest in virtual currency during 2021, with 2% stating they will “definitely” invest in the asset class this year.Financial planners are much more keen to invest their personal wealth in cryptocurrency, with 24% saying they have already done so.The global economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic appears to be the primary motivation that is driving financial planners towards crypto assets, with 54% of respondents describing “uncorrelated returns” as the principal benefit of cryptocurrency exposure.One-quarter of survey participants described “inflation hedging” as crypto’s most-attractive utility, up from 9% the previous year. Demand from clients also appears significant, with 81% of advisers reporting that clients have queried them regarding crypto assets in 2020, up from 76% in 2019.Despite the growth in financial advisors making allocations to crypto, Bitwise’s CIO remarked that “the survey shows it’s still early days for crypto, with less than 10% of advisors allocating today,” adding:ETF Trends CEO Tom Lydon stated: ""Financial advisors are increasingly looking for exposure to alternative assets, and interest in crypto is rising.”The number of crypto-naysayers within the investments advisor community is also falling, with the number of respondents predicting BTC will plummet to zero dropping from 14% in 2019 to 8% last year, and then halving to just 4% this year.Conversely, the number of advisors predicting six-figure Bitcoin prices within five years has increased from 4% to 15% in a single year."
7,"On Jan. 12 Bitcoin (BTC) price rebounded slightly as the price attempted to re-enter the $37,000 range but at the time of writing increased selling is pushing the price back toward the $32,000 mark.While the bearish price action may have shaken out newer investors who are unfamiliar with Bitcoin’s whipsaw volatility, the recent 28% drop doesnt even maike it on the list of the top-5 worst BTC pullbacks in history. In fact, today’s 20% rebound marked one of Bitcoin’s largest one-day rebounds ever.Despite Bitcoin’s swift 20% bounce, many analysts have voiced caution, warning that the top cryptocurrency is not out of the woods yet due to a high funding rate in the futures market and the growing strength of the U.S. dollar index (DXY).Longer-term and institutional-level investors seem unmoved by the correction and likely believe that it is nothing more than a short-term pullback.Analysts at Goldman Sachs suggested that the recent developments are a sign that “the market is beginning to become more mature,” and that the sector has great potential for growth due to the fact that institutional involvement only comprises 1% of the current market.While Bitcoin and altcoins saw a healthy rebound, the traditional markets continued to face pressure due to the possibility of continued political unrest in the United States and concerns about the economic impact of new COVID-19 restrictions.Signs of a strengthening dollar are putting pressure on global financial markets worldwide and some analysts have even cautioned that a strong dollar is bad for Bitcoin price.The main indices were under pressure all day and ended mixed at the closing bell, with the S&P 500 and Dow slightly up 0.04% and 0.19% respectively while the NASDAQ closed down 0.08%Bitcoin now appears to be entering a new range where $30,000 is support and the $35,000 level may act as resistance. As this occurs, select altcoins have moved higher and traders capitalize on BTC’s stability by shifting to altcoins.Ether (ETH) price pushed back above $1,000 and at the time of writing the altcoin trades for $1,050. Stellar (XLM) also recovered well on Tuesday as the digital asset gained 22.16%.The DeFi sector also continued to show strength as Maker’s governance token (MKR) rallied more than 31%. Synthetix (SNX) and AAVE also gained 23% as both rallied toward new highs for the year.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $924.5 billion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 68.4%."
8,"The top 100 richest Bitcoin addresses are increasingly bullish, accumulating 16% more Bitcoin over the last 30 days. In total these addresses added 334,000 more Bitcoin to their bags, or around $11 billion worth.The majority barely reacted to Bitcoin’s recent price drop from $41,000 to below $33,000. Only seven addresses conducted a transfer out of the wallet since the most recent all-time-high on January 10.Of the addresses that have transacted in the last 30 days, only eight of them have more than ten transactions to their name since December 12.Perhaps surprisingly, many of the largest addresses are yet to see a bull run, with eight of the top ten having received their first transaction later than September 2018. The newest in the top 100 is only two months old.They’re not all individual whales however. The addresses include at least ten controlled by exchanges such as Huobi, Binance, Bittrex, and Kraken. The rest are believed to belong to a mix of institutional investors and wealthy hodlers, with it being almost impossible to differentiate between two. What is clear though, is that the big guys are not easily influenced by price or sentiment.In order to make it into the top echelon of Bitcoin addresses, one must hold more than $336 million in BTC. Around $2.2 billion is required to hit the top ten.Addresses within this prestigious list have often attracted attention for various reasons, including one that is believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto himself.The third wealthiest address, with an untouched 94,506 BTC, created headlines back in September 2019 after Glassnode reported that 73,000 of the BTC in the wallet had been transferred from Huobi. It was presumed to be the richest non-exchange address.According to BitInfoCharts, 64 of the top 100 have never seen a single satoshi transferred out.These addresses, which currently control more than 2.5 million BTC (13.5% of circulating supply) with a value of almost $85 billion dollars, include 15 dormant addresses. Eleven are more than nine years old. Although no one can prove that the 300,000 BTC held by these addresses have been lost, most assume so."
9,"Known for its volatility, Bitcoin (BTC) recently fell more than $11,000 over a four-day period after weeks of soaring price action. Amid a fresh bull cycle, Bitcoin has likely picked up its fair share of new buyers — some of whom may not be familiar with the asset’s wild price swings, according to comments from Cheds, a crypto trader and analyst on Twitter. Cheds holds a level I CMT certification — a benchmark showing technical analysis knowledge. “Given the recent surge in popularity of Bitcoin, we have many new investors and traders who have not been through any shock events, like that $8,500 daily range candle we just had,” Cheds told Cointelegraph.Bitcoin surpassed its 2017 all-time price high in December 2020. In the following weeks, the asset doubled its former high near $20,000, tapping just shy of $42,000 on Jan. 8, based on TradingView.com data. This is likely due in part to big players from traditional finance buying Bitcoin in the second half of 2020. Metrics from crypto data site The Tie suggest a recent flow of retail money may be a contributing factor as well.“The true believers and really anyone who understands the supply/demand imbalance loves these volatility events, because it allows them to re-enter or add on to previous positions,” Cheds explained.Other industry participants have noted that Bitcoin dips are common, and are pointing to the recent correction to help guide expectations.A visual of the 2016-2017 #bitcoin run up

Take away: Pullbacks are a part of any healthy bull market #HODL pic.twitter.com/W2F6T0zJxLAlthough Bitcoin has historically been synonymous with sizable price swings, its advancements past $20,000 have opened the door for higher dollar oscillations."
10,"This week’s $11,000 drop occurred in just 32 hours and this definitely an important milestone for Bitcoin (BTC) price. Many mainstream media outlets perceived the correction as the start of a new bear market but data simply does not support this line of thinking.Bitcoin price may have corrected 26.5% as if dropped to retest the $30,300 support but it has since shown significant strength amidst a record-high $160 billion in derivatives volume.Spot exchanges also outpaced their previous record high that was set just three days ago on Jan.9 as BTC soared to a new all-time high at $41,950. The incredible $27.7 billion in volume seen on Jan.11 was 60% higher than the previous peak.By itself, Binance exchange-traded $9 billion worth of BTC, which is more than double the entire industry average seen in December 2020.The infamous 50% intraday crash on March 12, 2020, resulted in $8 billion volume on spot exchanges. To put things in perspective, Ether (ETH) traded $16 billion volume on Jan. 11.Despite the recent bearish price action and this week’s $1.5 billion in long liquidations, Bitcoin has bounced back by over 13% from the $30,300 bottom.Even though the price failed to sustain the $36,000 level seen in the early hours of Jan. 12, investors seem relatively tranquil and trading volumes are not pointing toward further correction.Although this event might have spooked some buyers, looking under the hood, it is a very healthy sign. Another factor to consider is that Grayscale’s GBTC funds added 72,950 BTC in December but suspended new shares issuance on Dec. 24. Meanwhile, Bitcoin almost doubled from $23,200 to its $42,000 peak.The fund manager has now resumed its regular activity for most crypto trusts, raising the question of whether initiated institutional inflow can be attributed to BTC’s bullish price action. What is clear is that institutional investor interest and demand is still there. Even though Bitcoin price dropped by 26.5%, the GBTC premium stayed above 14%.Professional traders tend to dominate longer-term futures contracts with set expiry dates. Thus, by measuring how much more expensive futures are versus the regular spot market, a trader can determine how bullish the market is. The 3-month fixed-calendar futures should usually trade with a 1.5% or higher premium versus regular spot exchanges.Whenever this indicator fades or turns negative, this is an alarming red flag. Such a situation, also known as backwardation, indicates that the market is turning bearish.The above chart shows that the futures premium held levels above 3.5% throughout the storm.This is equal to an annualized 14.5% level and indicates that there is optimism from professional traders.Reviewing the put/call ratio will assist with determining whether the recent bearish price action polluted Bitcoin’s bullish standing among pro investors. The current skew level provides a real-time fear and greed indicator based on options pricing.Skew indicators will shift to negative when call (neutral/bullish) options are more costly than equivalent puts. A 10% level signals that call options are trading at a premium to the more bearish/neutral put options. On the other hand, a negative skew translates to a higher cost of downside protection, indicating bearishness.The chart above shows just how quickly the negative sentiment was overturned in the options market. After shifting sharply in both directions due to increased volatility, the indicator has now returned to 10, reflecting moderate bullishness in options pricing.Bitcoin firmly held the $30,000 support and bulls showed their confidence by adding positions during this dip. This shows that at the moment, there are no signs of market exhaustion or worrisome signals from derivatives indicators.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
11,"After more than a decade of extreme price volatility, Bitcoin (BTC) is finally starting to mature as an asset class, according to Jeffrey R. Currie, Goldman Sachs’ global head of commodities research. In an interview with CNBC, Currie said Bitcoin’s remarkable run has attracted greater institutional interest, but noted that smart-money investors are still a tiny fraction of the overall market. They will need to come in droves for Bitcoin to become a stable asset and avoid a flash crash like we saw earlier this week, he said.“I think the market is beginning to become more mature,” Currie said of Bitcoin, adding that “volatility and those risks that are associated with it” are common for nascent assets.He continued:Some of Wall Street’s biggest names have thrown their weight behind Bitcoin over the past year. Legendary investors Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller have already invested in the digital asset, and firms like MassMutual and Ruffer Investment Company have acquired sizable positions in BTC.Last month, Anthony Scaramucci’s hedge fund, SkyBridge Capital, submitted an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a new Bitcoin fund.That’s on top of the tens of billions invested by MicroStrategy, Grayscale, PayPal and Square combined.Goldman Sachs has even changed its tune on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally. The firm has not only beefed up its human resources to include digital currency experts, but it has also issued guidance on the peaceful coexistence of Bitcoin and gold as macro hedges.Coinbase, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, has also reportedly tapped Goldman for its forthcoming IPO."
12,"Since its drop below $4,000 in March 2020, Bitcoin (BTC) has ridden a bullish trend all the way past its 2017 all-time high, recently hitting almost $42,000. During that time, however, Bitcoin’s Twitter activity has underperformed in comparison to its price. Looking at information from crypto data outfit The TIE indicates that Bitcoin’s price is traveling above its Hype-To-Activity Ratio — a metric which shows tweet volume against asset trading volume — since 2019. “Hype-To-Activity Ratio measures the number of tweets a particular coin has per each $1M in reported trading volume of that coin,” The Tie’s CEO, Joshua Frank, told Cointelegraph, as previously reported. Based on a study from The Tie, posted in August 2019, 1.02 came in as the average Hype-To-Activity Ratio score across the industry.Bitcoin’s Twitter hype vastly overshadowed its price for most of 2018, coming down to intersect with the price for a brief period in May, 2019. Twitter hype continued falling, finding itself below price in the latter half of May, and has remained under price since then. Even at Bitcoin’s recent peak on Jan. 8, 2020, the digital asset only held a 1.24 Hype-To-Activity score — just a tad above average industry levels.Mainstream media coverage, however, skyrocketed after October 2020. When Bitcoin’s price rises dramatically, the asset gains more mainstream attention, as seen during its 2017 rise to nearly $20,000. Bitcoin has surged in price since October, logically flagging media attention.A number of big mainstream entities, such as MicroStrategy and Square, began announcing Bitcoin purchases in 2020, impacting the scene. “The Bitcoin rally was clearly led by institutional investors,” Frank told Cointelegraph on Monday, adding:Using tweets in line with market cap, NVTweet Ratio data from The Tie gives rationale for a big-player-led Bitcoin price trend narrative, according to Frank. Recent data, however, suggests increased retail participation — some of which has shown up in Twitter chatter about BTC. Record-level Bitcoin mentions on Twitter came in around the same time as Bitcoin’s recent price correction. Frank added:Bitcoin’s price recently fell approximately 28% from its high, but has recovered slightly since the drop at time of publication."
13,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) rose 20% on Jan. 12, from $30,500 to around $36,600, across major exchanges. But while the rebound after the correction has been strong, there are two warning signs.First, the funding rate in the futures market remains high. The funding rate is a mechanism that incentivizes the minority of the market.For example, if there are fewer short-sellers in the market, then buyers have to pay short-sellers a fee every eight hours. If the funding rate is high, it means buyers are paying sellers.Second, the U.S. dollar strength index (DXY) is beginning to recover, which could be a bearish sign for Bitcoin and gold.According to Julien Bittel, a multiasset fund manager at Pictet Asset Management, the U.S. dollar is “very oversold.”The dollar has continuously declined since the coronavirus pandemic began in early 2020, struggling to compete against other reserve currencies, like the Japanese yen.The uncertainty around the United States election and the stimulus further led to the underperformance of the DXY throughout 2020.Bittel said that the dollar is now looking oversold and the dollar’s momentum could strengthen in 2021. He wrote:The positive outlook of the dollar poses a risk to Bitcoin’s momentum because alternative stores of value are priced against the dollar.Hence, if the dollar begins to rally, both gold and Bitcoin could see a potential pullback, particularly after a strong quarter.Atop the rising dollar, the high funding rate of the Bitcoin futures market is an issue in the short term.A high futures funding rate is not necessarily bad in itself, but if the price of Bitcoin declines while the funding rate remains high, it could raise the probability of a correction.The combination of the dollar’s momentum and the overheated derivatives market make a pullback more likely in the near term.Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, said that a “second dumping” could occur, as was seen on Jan. 11. He stated that miners are selling with no stablecoin inflows, which is a problematic trend.Stablecoin inflows typically represent buyer demand from sidelined capital. If stablecoin deposits to exchanges increase, it indicates an overall bullish market sentiment. Ki wrote:In the foreseeable future, the ideal scenario for bullish traders would be to wait for the funding rate to neutralize and stablecoin inflows to increase."
14,"Major business magazine Forbes has featured Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss as the richest Bitcoin (BTC) billionaires.Compiled by Forbes crypto-focused reporter Michael del Castillo, the ranking provides a list of Bitcoin investors that won the most from Bitcoin’s massive surge up to $42,000 in early January. The ranking includes three Bitcoin investors with an estimated crypto net worth above $1 billion, including the Winklevoss brothers, major industry investor Tim Draper and Matthew Roszak, chairman and co-founder of blockchain firm Bloq. The twins topped the list with an estimated cryptocurrency net worth of around $1.4 billion apiece. Roszak and Draper follow, with net worths estimated at $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.The list also includes three additional crypto investors: MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, Galaxy Digital founder and CEO Mike Novogratz and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. According to Forbes data, Saylor’s crypto fortune amounts to $600 million, while Novogratz and Buterin’s crypto net worths stand at $478 million and $360 million, respectively.Castillo stressed that the newly released ranking is “by no means a complete ranking but captures just how much some fortunes have soared.” According to the expert, the Bitcoin bull run generated at least five billionaires, and “possibly quite a few more.” Castillo said that the rankings are based on publicly available digital wallet data. “Using everything from publicly available digital wallets to old-fashioned reporting, we set out to identify some of the biggest winners of this latest crypto boom,” he said.On Friday, Bitcoin price set a new all-time high of $42,000 following a massive rally after finally breaking $20,000 at the end of 2020. Shortly after hitting $42,000, Bitcoin saw a major correction below $31,000 on Monday.But according to its network fundamentals, Bitcoin price could be heading toward recovery, as Cointelegraph reported yesterday. Indeed, Bitcoin saw a notable 20% recovery on Tuesday from its recent bloodbath. At publishing time, Bitcoin is trading at $35,833, up about 9% over the past 24 hours, according to Cointelegraph’s Bitcoin price index. Over the past 30 days, Bitcoin is up more than 85%."
15,"Trading activity on Bitcoin (BTC) exchanges spiked massively even as its price was suffering a major correction. According to data from crypto research firm Messari, Bitcoin’s real 24-hour trading volume is about $22.3 billion.To put this figure in context, Cointelegraph previously reported that Bitcoin’s real seven-day trading volume set a new all-time high of $60 billion. In only one day, exchanges have processed over a third of that sum, likely pointing to a new all-time high by the end of the week if the current momentum is sustained.Despite suffering service disruptions amid the price decline, Coinbase recorded about $3.5 billion in trading volume, according to data from crypto analytics provider Skew. In total, Coinbase processed over $9.5 billion in crypto trades on Monday, an all-time high for the exchange.Indeed, Coinbase’s volume record on Monday exceeds the platform’s total trading activity for the whole of the first quarter of 2019. The figure also surpasses the exchanges January 2020 trading volume total.Given the swift bounce for Bitcoin from $31,000 to the $35,000 price mark, it is evident that a significant proportion of the trading activity was driven by the BTC-buying opportunity below the recent price high.Indeed, both Messari and Glassnode data show positive net Tether (USDT) exchange flows, indicating a continued appetite for BTC with the price still about $6,000 below its all-time high.Monday’s trading activity spike also extended to the derivatives market, with the Bitcoin options and futures arena seeing massive volumes. Data from Skew puts yesterday’s BTC futures trading volume at over $170 billion.CME alone nearly eclipsed the $5 billion trading mark, setting a new 24-hour volume record. Bitcoin options volume crossed the $2 billion mark on Monday, as well.Meanwhile, some analysts say Monday’s dip was a “healthy and necessary” correction. While still only in the early days in 2021, BTC is up about 23% year-to-date."
16,"The dollar value of Bitcoin (BTC) jumped 20% overnight leading into Tuesday as the world’s most-well-known cryptocurrency recovered swiftly from a 27% decline suffered just days before. The broader cryptocurrency market followed suit on Tuesday, as over $150 billion flooded back into the global market capitalization on the same day.The spot price of Bitcoin jumped from $30,468 to $36,633 in a little over 15 hours leading into Tuesday morning, representing overnight gains of 20.2%. This returned a majority of the losses incurred by the coin over the course of the previous weekend when BTC's price plunged from $41,880 down to $30,468.As reported by Reuters on Monday, major banking institutions in the United States will be hoping to put 2020 firmly behind them when fourth-quarter numbers are released on Friday. Financial analysts are expecting a sharp contrast between Bitcoin’s recent fortunes and those of the legacy banking sector, with some anticipating losses of over 40%.Citigroup is expected to show a 42% decline for the last three months of the previous year, while analysts predict Wells Fargo will suffer a similar drop of around 39%. Next week Bank of America will release its own quarterly report, which is expected to show a profit decline of 33%.Not every bank suffered equally toward the end of 2020, however, with JPMorgan Chase expected to post a less severe 5% drop. Two major banks are anticipated to post positive numbers for the final quarter: Morgan Stanley is expected to post 1% profits, and Goldman Sachs Group may be in for a 43% increase in quarterly profits off the back of a strong showing by its capital markets services.Despite the apparent fluctuations exhibited in the banking sector, Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg said most firms will be aiming to close the door on 2020 and remain optimistic about the coming year.“You can look at Q4 as somewhat of a transition quarter as you put some of the challenges from 2020 in the rear-view mirror and look ahead to an improved 2021,” said Goldberg.Some bank stocks have already recovered 35% since the U.S. presidential election results in November 2020. The announcement of a pending COVID-19 vaccine during the same time period is thought to have returned confidence to cautious investors."
17,"Bitcoin (BTC) may have dipped 28% in recent days but analysts have already put the scale of the losses firmly in context. As noted on Jan.12 by Nathaniel Whittemore, host of The Breakdown Podcast, the period between 2016 and 2017 alone saw a grand total of six corrections that were larger than this week's drawdown.2017 is famous among market participants as being a record-breaking year for price action. In addition to 1,000% annual gains, Bitcoin saw multiple hurdles as it climbed to then all-time highs of near $20,000. ""Fun fact: #bitcoin had 6 pullbacks bigger than our recent -28% in the record setting 1000%+ growth year of 2017,"" Whittemore commented, citing a chart with data from Travis Kling, CEO of crypto asset manager Ikigai.As BTC/USD fell from fresh record highs of $42,000 to just above $30,000, familiar criticism of Bitcoin's volatility from mainstream financial sources and other critics returned. A subsequent rebound to $36,700, itself record-breaking in speed, in turn attracted claims of market manipulation.For long-term investors, however, the events are nothing new, echoing as they do the surface-level behavior seen during other bull runs. ""During the previous cycles, the #Bitcoin drawdowns in the 20% to 40% range have taken anywhere from a day to a little over a month to find a bottom,"" on-chain analytics service Ecoinometrics summarized with comparative charts of its own on Monday.Ecoinometrics nonetheless noted that historically, only around 15% of Bitcoin's total price corrections have surpassed the fall from $42,000.Popular industry figures meanwhile reiterated that lower price levels amounted to little more than a buying opportunity for zealous investors.""It's hard to believe Bitcoin is up 10% year to date for 2021 this morning at $32,000. But that's how this works. If you can't handle the crazy volatility, then manage that concern with your position size. I'm treating this morning's move as a big buying opportunity,"" Preston Pysh, co-founder of The Investor’s Podcast Network commented."
18,"Bakkt, one of the biggest cryptocurrency companies in the United States, will not support XRP as part of its further product development, according to the CEO.On Jan. 11, Bakkt CEO Gavin Michael sat down with the Axios Re:Cap podcast to discuss the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets. Michael said that Bakkt is planning to roll out support for a number of altcoins on its platform in the future, but XRP is not one of them.Michael declined to comment on whether the company decided to stay away from XRP due to Ripple’s legal issues sparked by a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. “Just not on our platform,” Michael stated, adding:Michael’s remarks on XRP follow the official announcement of Bakkt's plans to go public. On Jan. 11, the Intercontinental Exchange, the operator of the New York Stock Exchange and the owner of Bakkt, announced a merger deal with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings to allow Bakkt to launch on stock markets. Meanwhile, Ripple is fighting the SEC’s $1.3 billion lawsuit brought against the firm in late December. On Jan. 8, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse strongly denied the “SEC’s unproven allegations” and claimed his firm is “on the right side of the facts and of history.”In the midst of Ripple’s legal problems, many crypto companies have decided to delist XRP. On Jan. 6, crypto wallet provider and trading platform Blockchain.com announced it was removing XRP, following in the steps of Coinbase, Binance.US, OKCoin and others. However, some companies like Uphold preferred to keep XRP on their platforms until the SEC lawsuit is resolved."
19,"Digital asset investment manager Grayscale has resumed accepting new investments into almost all of its cryptocurrency trusts. The investment manager had paused new inflows into six of its trusts in late December 2020, just as the six-month lock-up period for selling recently-purchased shares in its Bitcoin Trust, which trades under the ticker GBTC, was winding up.As of the time of writing, products such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund Trust are all available for new investors, although the Grayscale Ethereum Trust remains unavailable. The Grayscale XRP Trust is inactive, and will likely remain so. In early January, the fund manager had liquidated its holdings of the asset shortly after news broke of a major lawsuit filed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission against Ripple.Grayscale periodically halts and resumes new investor inflows into its funds; during these periods of closure, the funds remain open for private placement funds. As well as this, all investors in the Grayscale crypto trusts are subject to a six-month lock-up period for newly-purchased shares, after which they are free to sell the shares on the open market to non-accredited investors.Crypto investors keep a close eye on action from Grayscale, which has evolved into the world's largest cryptocurrency asset manager. As of Jan. 11, Grayscale has $24.5 billion assets under management across its various crypto funds. In early January, Cointelegraph reported that Grayscale's purchases of Bitcoin were outstripping the minting of new coins by a factor of three, capping a year of aggressive accumulation by the fund manager. Bitcoin is up close to 10% on the week, trading at $35,833 as of press time. With new investments now open, the six-month lock-up period begins afresh. Some analysts have alleged that when this period draws to a close, the Bitcoin spot market is driven higher as shares in Grayscale's GBTC hit the open market."
20,"Bitcoin (BTC) saw its most successful recovery in history on Jan. 12 after testing $30,000 support, but market participants are already suspicious.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView followed Bitcoin as it swiftly bounced off lows of $30,250 late on Monday to seal 20% gains in just over 12 hours.Coming even more quickly than its prior fall over the weekend, the comeback marks Bitcoin’s best daily performance ever, both in U.S. dollar and percentage terms. The numbers will be confirmed once the daily candle closes, with press-time levels nearing a local top of $36,600.No sooner was the recovery underway, however, did concerns appear over the authenticity of recent market movements.Popular market analyst and Cointelegraph contributor filbfilb argued that the strength of the rally belied what was tantamount to market manipulation — thanks specifically to exchange outages and unofficial advice from asset manager Guggenheim to sell at lower price levels.“Amazing whats possible when you can bid the market,” part of a series of tweets read.As Cointelegraph reported, Guggenheim’s CIO Scott Minerd advised investors that it was “time to take some money off the table.” The company is awaiting U.S. regulatory permission to enter Bitcoin through the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), and Minerd’s words swiftly garnered criticism over deliberately bidding down the price in the meantime.For major exchanges Coinbase and Kraken, meanwhile, the publicity headache continued. As Bitcoin’s drop accelerated from $38,000 towards the lows, both trading platforms saw now characteristic outages, causing traders to lose control of orders. The knock-on effect, statistician Willy Woo subsequently warned, impacted the entire market and even made the price dip worse.“Spot market sell off started around $38k, then Coinbase partially failed, not registering buys, causing its price to go $350 lower than others, this pulled down the index price that futures exchanges use to calculate leverage funding, wrecking bearish havoc on speculative markets,” he explained on Monday.Woo also queried why futures exchanges did not remove Coinbase from their listings in order to steady the fallout.Customers appeared little concerned. As noted by software developer and commentator Vijay Boyapati, Coinbase volumes were over 101,200 BTC ($3.6 billion) in the 24 hours to early Tuesday, something which he estimates led to profits of up to $175 million.“As much as I dislike Coinbase, their IPO is going to be a major catalyst for the entire market when it happens,” he said in accompanying comments."
21,"Global payments provider PayPal has doubled its previous crypto volume record, with $242 million worth of digital assets changing hands on the platform during Jan. 11.According to crypto market data aggregator Nomics, yesterday’s trading dwarfed PayPal’s previous volume record of $129 million recorded on Jan. 6. Since Jan. 1, daily volume has increased by 950% from $22.8.With the spike in PayPal’s volume coming amid Bitcoin’s rally into new all-time highs, the U.S.-based payments firm appears to be gathering popularity among retail traders. Nuggets News’ Alex Saunders asserted the spike in PayPal’s volume is a likely sign of increasing adoption among retail traders, tweeting: “retail has arrived.”Retail has arrived. @PayPal cleared $242M in crypto sales yesterday. That's nearly double the previous record. ✅ #Bitcoin #Ethereum #BullMarket pic.twitter.com/dnoPlADhlaDespite many within the crypto community praising PayPal’s entrance into crypto for driving new users toward digital assets, others have criticized PayPal for creating a “gated” crypto community that does not support withdrawal functionality — with Twitter user Toomas Zobel speculating that the surge in volume maybe have resulted from retail capitulation:The discussions regarding whether PayPal's volume milestone is bullish or bearish come shortly after Nexo CEO Antoni Trenchev speculated Bitcoin's recent crash from levels exceeding $40,000 was driven by retail investors rushing to realize profits.PayPal’s crypto services are accessed via Paxos’ ItBit exchange. PayPal selected ItBit handle its crypto transactions upon launching digital asset trading services during October 2020.PayPal is expected to offer cryptocurrency services to its 26 million merchants in the coming months, likely driving further demand for the company’s crypto services."
22,"Blockstream has added six more members to the federation that governs Liquid, the firm's Bitcoin sidechain for inter-exchange settlement network.The six new Liquid Federation members include Bitcoin web wallet Coinos, crypto custodian Komainu, network privacy firm Nym, blockchain development company Vulpem Ventures, broker Watchdog Capital, and Liquid Network settlement platform Sideswap.The #LiquidNetwork Federation grows to a total of 59 with six new members announced today. The six new members are @coinoswallet, Komainu, @nymproject, @side_swap, @vulpemventures, and @WatchdogCapital. https://t.co/QkluG8ivIh pic.twitter.com/CudS30XyjvLiquid was announced at the end of 2015 as a Bitcoin sidechain designed to speed up Bitcoin transactions settlement for crypto exchanges. Liquid supports LBTC tokens that are pegged to Bitcoin. According to official data, there are currently 2,756 circulating LBTC, with the sidechain processing roughly 540 transactions each day.The Liquid Federation now spans 59 members, including top cryptocurrency exchanges Bitfinex, OKEx, BitMEX, and Huobi, investment product provider CoinShares, and hardware wallet firm Ledger. Despite the federation's expanding membership, Liquid’s volume and TVL is dwarfed by tokenized Bitcoin on Ethereum — with the Q3 2020 DeFi boom driving significant demand for tokenized BTC.According to btconethereum.com, there's now more than 148,000 BTC tokenized on the Ethereum network, worth more than $5 billion combined. As such, the value of Bitcoin on Liquid is equal to just 1.86% of the all Bitcoin tokenized on Ethereum.With much of the supply of tokenized BTC on Ethereum being used by retail investors to access DeFi protocols, direct comparisons with LBTC may be problematic due to the small pool of users and applications for Liquid tokens.While Blockstream has touted its Lightning Network sidechain for fast peer-to-peer transactions, Lightning's adoption has also been overshadowed by Ethereum-powered BTC tokens in recent month.Only 1,060 BTC been locked on the Lightning Network according to bitcoinvisiuals.com — equating to less than one-hundredth of the Bitcoin locked on Ethereum.With Ethereum-powered BTC tokens representing 40 times the combined TVL of Blockstream's two flagship sidechains, it appears much of the crypto community is opting to use the Ethereum network over Blockstream's centralized sidechains to improve the speed and scalability of BTC.Three quarters of tokenized BTC on Ethereum is locked in the Wrapped Bitcoin protocol, followed by HBTC with 12% and renBTC with nearly 9%."
23,"The euphoria in the cryptocurrency market was quelled on Jan.11 as the majority of altcoins saw their prices decline by more than 20% as Bitcoin price sold off sharply. After falling below the $40,000 support level on Jan. 10, selling pressure for Bitcoin (BTC) increased overnight and pushed the price of the top cryptocurrency as low as $30,229 before a soft support level was reached.The rapid decline in price led to more than $2.7 billion worth of futures contracts being liquidated and the long candles on the Bitcoin price chart show that the cascade of liquidations occurred quickly as the price dropped from $41,000 to $32,229.Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban used the market downturn as no opportunity to point out that the cryptocurrency market is identical to the internet stock bubble from the 1990s.Cuban said that “Watching the cryptos trade, it’s exaclty like the internet stock bubble,” but he added that Bitcoin, Ether, and “a few others” will likely follow the path of Amazon and eBay and continue to see their valuations rise.Those with a little more skin in the game, such as Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky, view the recent drop as a healthy price correction and Mashinsky hinted that there is a possibility of BTC dropping as low as $16,000 before resuming its upward trek.The traditional financial sector also found itself under pressure on Monday as the political situation in the United States continues to generate tension and uncertainty about the future of the country and the economy.The S&P 500, Dow, and the NASDAQ all finished the day in the red, down 0.66%, 0.29%, and 1.55% respectively as big-tech and the FAANG stocks hit their lowest levels since Nov. 26.Nearly every time BTC price falls by thousands of dollars, bears, doomers and nocoiners emerge from the netherscape to issue calls for the death of Bitcoin.Considering that Bitcoin price rose from $17,586 on Dec. 11 to $41,950 in less than a month, David Lifchitz, CIO at ExoAlpha views this pullback as a “healthy correction by smart institutions who bought BTC from $20,000 on the way up to $30,000.”Lifchitz told Cointelegraph:Hints at the driving force behind recent price movements could also be found through analyzing patterns emerging on social media.According to Joshua Frank, CEO and founder of TheTie, an alternative data social analytics platform, the lack of Bitcoin Twitter mentions in December 2020 indicates that a small number of large investors were driving the price gains.In private comments to Cointelegraph Frank said:Ether (ETH) price was also hard hit by today’s downturn, dropping as low as $914 before finding support. At the time of writing, ETH is down 16.33% and trading at $1,033. Out of the top 50 cryptocurrency projects, the only token currently trading in the green on the day is Neo (NEO), up 1.5% and trading at $22.52.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $847 billion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 68.9%."
24,"Capital inflows into crypto funds and investment products plummeted during the first week of January after posting new all-time highs in late-December.According to crypto fund manager CoinShares’ Jan. 11 Digital Asset Fund Flows report, the first week of trading in the new year saw just $29 million flow into institutional crypto products. That's a greater than 97% decline from the $1.09 billion invested during the week before Christmas. Volumes are likely to have been dampened by traders taking holidays over the new year.However the firm also notes that December’s surging inflows have been followed by recent “evidence of potential profit taking,” with multiple crypto investment products recording weekly outflows in early January. As of Jan. 8, CoinShares estimated that $34.4 billion in capital was held in crypto investment products — of which $27.5 billion, or 80%, was in locked BTC funds, while $4.7 billion, or roughly 13.5%, was invested in ETH products.The report notes that Bitcoin funds have also produced stronger volumes recentl than during the December 2017 bull run, stating: “We have seen much greater investor participation this time round with net new assets at US$8.2bn compared to only US$534m in December 2017.""With sector-wide inflows consistently remaining positive since May 2019, the report asserts that crypto is seeing “increasing use as a store of value.” CoinShares’ CEO, Jean-Marie Mognetti, recently stated:"
25,"After Bitcoin (BTC) price flirted with a $42,000 all-time high on Jan. 8, it stabilized in a tightening range between $39,000 to $41,500 for two days and the pennant structure on the shorter-term timeframes hinted that a breakout to $45,000 was a possibility. This all changed quite suddenly Jan. 10 as the $39,000 support failed to hold and Bitcoin price entered a steep correction.A swirling and cruel 26.6% drop took BTC down to $30,100 over the next 30 hours and $1.5 billion in cascading liquidations at derivatives exchanges boosted the correction. Interestingly, this occurred just as the open interest on BTC futures reached a $12.7 billion all-time high.Today’s price action presents a story of doom, gloom and liquidations, but what it fails to mention is that the Bitcoin price crashed by 20.4% just one week ago as it tested sub $28,000 levels.During that similar price event, a total of $1.2 billion in long contracts were liquidated, so the price action of today isn’t so different from what the market experienced just a week ago on Jan. 11.As the chart above shows, BTC bounced back by 11% one hour after dropping below the $28,000 level. What might have surprised traders this time around is the 13% bounce from $32,200 to $36,400 which created a false bottom.To understand if that's the case, one should analyze crypto exchanges' top traders long-to-short ratio and hourly liquidations.Exchange-provided data highlights traders' long-to-short net positioning. By analyzing every client's position on the spot, perpetual and futures contracts, one can obtain a clearer view of whether professional traders are leaning bullish or bearish.With this said, there are occasional discrepancies in the methodologies between different exchanges, so viewers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.The top traders at Binance averaged a 23% position that favored longs over the past 30 days. This wasn't the case on Jan. 7, when they started adding long positions until reaching a 59% peak in the early hours of Jan. 10.This move took place as BTC broke the $37,000 resistance and paved its way to $41,500. Therefore, Binance top traders have been mostly reacting after each BTC price move instead of trying to anticipate it.On the other hand, top traders at Huobi averaged a 0.91 long-to-short ratio over the last 30 days, thus favoring net shorts by 9%. From Jan. 8 to the early hours of Jan. 10, these traders had been increasing their shorts, hence profit-taking as BTC failed to break the $42,000 level.This trend reverted as BTC lost the $39,000 support, and Huobi’s top traders reduced their 28% net short to 4% in an attempt to catch the bottom.Lastly, OKEx top traders have been adding long positions, driving the indicator from 1.00 (flat) in the early hours of Jan. 8 to a 1.79 ratio favoring longs in the early hours of Jan. 11.These traders bought the top and were the ones who were heavily liquidated as the BTC price crashed by 26%. Their long to short ratio hit 1.00 (flat) again just as BTC hit $34,000 on Jan. 11.Bitfinex gathers weekly data on top traders' profit and loss, although it is possible for users to 'opt-out' from this ranking. Over the past 24 hours, the bottom 10 lost a combined $153.3 million.Relevant losses during a surprise crash should not mean that Bitfinex traders got it all wrong. Some traders might have been ill-positioned, but overall they have been profit-taking during the rally. As of now, Bitfinex traders are back to a 'neutral' position according to its historical levels.Exchange-provided data shows that Bitfinex’s long-to-short ratio increased from 2 to 9, favoring longs between Nov. 25 and Dec. 21.To put things in perspective, its 6-month moving average stands at 6, leaning toward longs. Thus, considering its leverage data from margin products, these traders have been surprisingly profitable.It’s also important to consider that Bitcoin holds a 3.75% daily average volatility. Therefore, these large corrections should be expected.Bitcoin faced a 50% intraday decline on Mar. 12, 2020, yet for those patient enough to hold through those bearish periods, an 11x rally followed as the cryptocurrency hiked from $3,600 to almost $42,000.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
26,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped substantially since Jan. 8, totalling a decline of more than $10,000 at time of publication. Retail investors could be part of the rationale behind the drop, according to Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev. “The price correction we’re seeing was brought about by retail investors following the lead of institutions that created the Bitcoin high,” he told Cointelegraph on Jan. 11, adding:After blazing past its 2017 record high near $20,000, Bitcoin quickly doubled, hitting almost $42,000 per coin by Jan. 8. In the days following, the digital asset fell approximately 28%, down to almost $30,100.Price advances often come with pullbacks, although a retracement does not necessarily indicate the end of an overall macro bull market. So what would signal a macro Bitcoin top?“There are a few observable signs to watch for,"" Trenchev told Coitelegraph on Jan. 8. ""Regulation, for example, has a powerful influence on the market,” he noted. “Regulatory activity that appears to tighten rules on crypto can dissuade new buyers.”United States regulators have stepped up their engagement in the crypto space over the last few years — potentially the sign of a maturing industry. Several legal actions have recently come into the spotlight, including a proposal from the U.S. government aimed at tracking digital assets withdrawn from exchanges.“There is even potential for over-excitement on the upside to cause some level of crash, although I doubt it’d be too big a concern,” Trenchev said. “Every year since 2013 has seen a ‘crash’ of around 25% of a peak earlier in the same year, and yet here we are with BTC hitting heights it never has before,” he added. “Corrections like this are an inevitable aspect of market behaviour,” he said on Jan. 8, referring to a smaller correction that occurred on that day.“So much is made of institutional involvement when it comes to bitcoin price movement, and rightly so — however retail activity is something to watch closely for signs the market has topped,” Trenchev explained. “Many will panic, take their profit, and walk away — which can have a domino effect on the rest of the market.”The latter half of 2020 hosted a noteworthy amount of Bitcoin attention from mainstream giants, such as MicroStrategy and MassMutual, potentially making this bull run different from years prior. UPDATE Jan. 12, 15:19 UTC: This article has been updated, correcting Antoni Trenchev's title from CEO to co-founder. "
27,"After an incredible run-up to nearly $42,000, Bitcoin (BTC) price finally entered a significant correction, and at the time of writing the price is down by about 18%. While the swift drop to $30,402 may not induce sleepless nights from the HODLer crowd, large drops like the one seen over the past 24-hours can easily blow up a leveraged trader's portfolio. The sharp downside move also threatens to wipe out a large portion of the gains accrued over the past few weeks.Data from Bybt indicates that over $2.7 billion worth of futures contracts has been squared off in the past 24 hours.Once traders in long positions start getting liquidated due to margin calls, traders who have been waiting to buy withhold their purchases as they expect an even better opportunity to buy at a bargain. This lack of demand and excess supply trigger steep falls like the one seen today.Similar to how resistance levels fail to stall a rally backed by strong momentum, during panic selling, support levels fail to arrest the decline. Professional traders usually do not step in to catch a falling knife. They prefer to wait for the excess froth to clear and the selling to subside before jumping in to buy.Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to identify the levels that may act as strong support.Bitcoin dipped to an intraday low at $35,111.58 on Jan. 10 but the price recovered sharply and closed at $38,161.04. However, the bears were in no mood to relent as they again sold aggressively.The BTC/USD pair broke below the critical support at the 20-day exponential moving average ($32,093) but found support at $29,688.10 near the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level.If the rebound off $29,688.10 sustains, it will be considered as a normal correction after an extended bull run. The bulls will then again attempt to resume the uptrend.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below $29,688.10, the next support is at the 50% retracement level at $25,897.42, placed just above the 50-day simple moving average at $24,307.A deep fall to this level will suggest that the upside momentum has broken and the pair may chalk out a new trend.Ether (ETH) made a long-legged Doji candlestick on Jan. 10 and that was followed by a sharp fall today, which suggests aggressive profit booking by the traders. The bulls are currently trying to defend the 20-day EMA ($956).If they succeed, the ETH/USD pair may rise to $1,100 where the bears may again step in and sell the relief rally. If the price turns down from this resistance but the bulls do not allow the price to dip below the 20-day EMA, it could result in a consolidation for a few days.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the next stop is $840.93 and if this support also cracks, the decline may extend to the 50-day SMA at $712. The deeper the fall, the longer it will take for the bulls to stage a recovery.XRP could not rise above the overhead resistance at $0.384998, which suggests that traders lightened their positions on relief rallies. The altcoin broke below the 20-day EMA ($0.30) today after staying above it for the past three days.The XRP/USD pair could now drop to the support at $0.169 where the buyers are likely to step in. A strong rebound of this support will indicate that the pair may remain range-bound between $0.169 and $0.384998 for a few more days.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink and sustain the price below $0.169, the downtrend could resume with the next stop at $0.10.After struggling to break out and sustain above $180 for the past few days, Litecoin (LTC) succumbed to an aggressive bout of profit-booking today. The altcoin plunged below the 20-day EMA ($142) and is currently attempting to stay above the $120 support.If the LTC/USD pair rebounds off the current levels, the bulls may attempt to resume the uptrend but any rise is likely to face aggressive selling at the 20-day EMA. If the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may try to gradually move up to $160.If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will try to sink the price below the 50-day SMA ($108). If they succeed, the pair may drop to $100 and such a move will suggest a change in trend.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) soared above the $515.35 overhead resistance on Jan. 9 and followed that up with another strong rally on Jan. 10, which pushed the price to $631.71, just below the $640 target objective suggested in previous analysis.Aggressive profit-booking pulled the price back below the $515.35 level today, which is a negative sign as it shows the bulls could not flip $515.35 into support. The BCH/USD pair has completed a 100% retracement of the rally that started on Jan.9.The pair may now consolidate between $515.35 and $370. If the bears sink the price below the $370 to $353 support, the pair may decline to $250. For the bulls to regain strength, they will have to push and sustain the price above $515.35.Cardano (ADA) broke below the 20-day EMA ($0.236) today, which is just below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.2395088. However, the long tail on the day’s candlestick suggests that the bulls are attempting to defend this level.If the ADA/USD pair sustains the rebound, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend. The first level to watch on the upside is $0.28. If the bulls can drive the price above this resistance, the pair may rise to $0.34.Contrary to this assumption, if the current rebound fails to sustain or if the price turns down from $0.28, the bears will try to sink the pair below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, a drop to the 50-day SMA at $0.18 could be on the cards.Polkadot (DOT) bounced off the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $8.5515 on Jan. 10 but the bulls could not capitalize on the recovery, which indicates a lack of demand at higher levels.This could have attracted selling by short-term traders, which pulled the price down to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $7.2365 today. If the bulls flip the $6.8619 level to support, the DOT/USD pair may attempt to resume the uptrend.The relief rally could face selling at the 20-day EMA ($8.16) but if this resistance is surmounted, the pair may again move up to $10.68. A trend change is likely in order if the bears sink the price below $6.8619.Chainlink (LINK) failed to sustain above the $17.7777 overhead resistance on Jan. 10, which could have attracted profit-booking from short-term traders. The selling intensified today and that has pulled the price down to the 50-day SMA at $13.31.If the price sustains below the 50-day SMA, the LINK/USD pair could drop to the uptrend line. This is an important support to watch out for because if it cracks, the decline could extend to $8.Conversely, if the pair rebounds off the current levels or from the uptrend line, the bulls will try to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($14). If they succeed, the price may rise to $15 and then to $17.7777.The long tail on Dec. 10 candlestick suggests the bulls aggressively purchased the dip to 40 but they failed to build upon the recovery today. The bears resumed their selling and have dragged Binance Coin (BNB) below the 20-day EMA ($38.53).The bulls are currently attempting to defend the $35.69 support. If they succeed, the BNB/USD pair may attempt a rebound that is likely to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA.If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears may attempt to sink the price to the 50-day SMA ($33.40) and then to $32. Such a move will suggest that the pair may have topped out for the short-term.However, if the price rebounds off the current levels and rises above the 20-day EMA within the next few days, it will suggest strong demand at lower levels and the bulls may try to resume the uptrend.The bulls defended the $0.2864 level for the past four days but the failure to achieve a strong rebound showed a lack of demand at higher levels. Stellar Lumens (XLM) broke below $0.2864 and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.232928 today.The bulls are currently attempting to defend the 20-day EMA ($0.214). If they succeed, the XLM/USD pair may attempt to move up to $0.2864. This is likely to act as a stiff resistance but if the bulls can push the price above it, a move to $0.35 is likely.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest traders are not buying the dip, indicating the rally on Jan. 6 was a bull trap.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

28,"Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban says the cryptocurrency market is “exactly” like the dot-com bubble of the late-1990s and early 2000s. His statement seems to signal that digital-asset valuations may implode once investor exuberance runs out. “Watching the cryptos trade, it’s EXACTLY like the internet stock bubble. EXACTLY,” Cuban tweeted on Monday before offering a silver lining to crypto enthusiasts.Watching the cryptos trade, it’s EXACTLY like the internet stock bubble. EXACTLY. I think btc, eth , a few others will be analogous to those that were built during the dot-com era, survived the bubble bursting and thrived, like AMZN, EBay, and Priceline. Many won’tAlthough the internet bubble didn’t end well for the vast majority of dot-com stocks, several rose from the ashes to form legitimate companies, Cuban said. Amazon, eBay and Priceline immediately came to mind.In Cuban’s view, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and “a few others” will likely follow a similar trajectory as their value proposition and use cases continue to grow.Cuban’s seemingly positive outlook on the top two cryptocurrencies came even as he dispelled all the narratives surrounding monetary debasement and fiat currency. These are “just sales pitches,” he said, arguing that crypto valuations are based only on supply and demand.As during the dot-com bubble “the experts” try to justify whatever the pricing of the day is. Crypto , much like gold , is a supply and demand driven All the narratives about debasement, fiat, etc are just sales pitches. The biggest sales pitch is scarcity vs demand. That’s itCuban hasn’t quite gotten his story straight on Bitcoin. He once argued that bananas are a better medium of exchange than BTC and said the digital asset will act more like a collectible than a financial instrument.But just last month, he praised Bitcoin’s monetary policy by arguing that public companies should “commit to not issue new shares of stock” ever. He was, of course, referring to Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million units hardwired into the code.Crypto assets were in the spotlight again on Monday after the total market shed over $200 billion peak-to-trough. Zooming out, the total market capitalization has appreciated fourfold over the past year, with Bitcoin recently hitting all-time highs of around $42,000."
29,"Healthy price corrections are generally part of market bull runs. With one such drop currently underway, Celsius’ CEO Alex Mashinsky thinks $16,000 could be in the cards. “I have been predicting that Bitcoin and many altcoins will hit new all-time highs during 2021 and beyond,” Mashinsky told Cointelegraph. “Still, we will see several corrections, like what is going on today, that will allow savvy investors to accumulate these assets at a discount.”After Bitcoin broke its 2017 record high in December 2020, the asset continued upward in parabolic fashion, finding itself worth more than double its one-time high of $19,892 less than two months later.Bitcoin nearly reached $42,000 on Jan. 8 before beginning its recent descent, holding a value near $32,700 at time of publication. From its all-time high near $42,000, down to its recent low, Bitcoin has already corrected approximately 28% in price.Mashinsky said:Bitcoin’s price has soared with lightning-like velocity in recent weeks. Although bull markets often include price pullbacks, what are some signs that might occur when this price correction is over? “Regardless of this drop and many more to come, we will continue saying the same thing since 2017,” Mashinsky said, adding:Bitcoin’s bull run also comes in line with a number of other economic factors, including money printing and possible inflation."
30,"The crypto markets have been full of drama in recent years. In the space of a decade, Bitcoin came from nowhere to achieve a price of $20,000 in 2017 — only to suffer a painful year of sell-offs and uncertainty. But like every compelling blockbuster, the world’s biggest digital asset bounced back… and proved naysayers wrong by smashing new records and winning high-profile admirers as 2020 drew to a close.It’s a stunning story that was made for television. Now, a respected Korean writer is set to bring the world of cryptocurrencies to life in a gripping drama that will powerfully highlight the ups and downs of digital assets — and introduce the public to Bitcoin in a whole new way.Choi Wan-kyu’s big-budget series, known as Pumping Time, will feature characters who have lost money through ICO scams, Ponzi schemes and fraudulent trading. The drama will follow their journey as they team up to take revenge on the swindlers — and as you’d expect, romance will blossom along the way.A total of 10 seasons — each featuring 20 episodes of 30 minutes — are set to be produced, with the first series scheduled to begin in May. The drama is also set to be edited in different ways to ensure that it reaches as broad an audience as possible, and a specially adapted version is expected to be released in movie theaters.Pumping Time comes as the crypto industry begins 2021 with a renewed sense of optimism. China is in the final stages of rolling out a fully fledged digital yuan, while Coinbase — one of the world’s biggest exchanges — is gearing up for an initial public offering. Facebook is also pushing ahead with its plans to launch the Diem stablecoin.But one of the most interesting developments in digital assets comes from Korea itself, where the drama is going to be produced. By March 2021, a framework that regulates and legalizes cryptocurrencies and exchanges will have fully come into force — and as previously reported by Cointelegraph, these measures have contributed to a progressive attitude surrounding digital assets.The drama — which will feature first-class stars and a production team that has experience in cryptocurrencies — aims to be fun and educational. Choi Wan-kyu himself has studied digital assets and blockchain technology since 2017, and this will help ensure that the series avoids some of the amateurish cliches that other TV shows and films about crypto have propagated.As evidenced by the runaway success of the K-pop sensation BTS, Korean productions have attracted a global audience in recent years. It’s hoped that Pumping Time will draw in a diverse viewership from around the world, too.The production has been fully funded by Kplay Content, meaning no token sale is required for this ambitious project to commence. Influencers are going to be invited to help the project gain an even bigger profile — and the drama is set to highlight major coins and leading exchanges in its storylines. There’s even a possibility that high-profile crypto personalities could make cameo appearances as the drama unfolds.Some of Korea’s biggest stars are said to be competing for the chance to secure the leading role in Pumping Time, and the show’s leading actor is set to be unveiled in February 2021. Major cryptocurrency companies will also be invited to serve as sponsors — allowing them to gain greater visibility for the services they provide. To shut out unverified projects and scams, promotional opportunities will only be given to reputable companies.As part of the drama, a platform called CoinBring will teach beginners about cryptocurrency — and it will be regularly used by the show’s main characters. Viewers who watch the drama will also receive BRING tokens so they can experience digital assets for themselves.Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

31,"Bitcoin (BTC) hodlers got a serious test of their resolve on Jan. 11 as the largest cryptocurrency approached $30,000.Data from Cointelegraph Markets, Coin360 and TradingView showed BTC/USD continuing its bearish streak after Wall Street opened on Monday, taking 24-hour losses to 23%.The move extends a reset of the market that kicked in over the weekend after Bitcoin hit all-time highs of $42,000.A slow comedown accelerated through Sunday, with Monday continuing the selling pressure with little respite for traders attempting to “buy the dip.”While traders were hardly panicked by what remains standard behavior for Bitcoin, prognoses began to favor a break from the kind of parabolic action of recent days and weeks.For Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe, a useful reference for defining a mid-term floor lies in Bitcoin’s 21-week moving average (MA). Currently at $18,000, the indicator will be rising to match previous price growth while the price itself may continue to fall, with the two meeting in the middle of the resulting range to form a bottom.“If you'd ask me a scenario for #Bitcoin, I think we'll see something like this in which the 21-Week MA comes in to play as support too,” he tweeted on Monday.As Cointelegraph reported, the run above $40,000 may have incentivized miners to pause for profit-taking, with data showing that sales had reached their highest since July 2019. In addition, concerns revolved around the market being overleveraged after such rapid gains.“Long positions had gotten very large, and so prudent risk management dictated that long holders, including miners, take a little off the table,” Chad Steinglass, head of trading at exchange CrossTower told Cointelegraph in private comments.Steinglass added that the status quo may naturally shift in bulls’ favor as the trading week gets underway.“It remains to be seen whether the start of the work week in the US and the opening of traditional banking hours will bring with it enough support from inflows to balance or overcome the sell interest or not,” he concluded.Guy Hirsch, managing director for the U.S. at trading platform eToro, agreed.""Bitcoin is trading down largely as a result of profit taking. Since we are still so far above the all-time high set before this recent bullish run up, it remains to be seen how much further we can fall,"" he told Cointelegraph.In line with van de Poppe’s comments, altcoins were wary at publication time, with many of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization seeing 20% losses on the day. Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin, quickly lost the $1,000 support to trade at $950.Renewed strength in the U.S. dollar, meanwhile, could also keep Bitcoin in check, van de Poppe added in analysis on Monday."
32,"Bitcoin price has been accelerating massively in recent months, with Bitcoin (BTC) rallying from $10,000 to $41,500. This rally went vertical without any major corrections in between.However, every upward cycle has its standard 30% corrections, which can even be considered healthy for more upside.Bitcoin’s price started to fall south in the past days as it dropped 25% to $30,000. This dropdown was also influenced by the U.S. dollar’s sudden surge, which might be bottomed out in the short term.A trend reversal starts with lower time frames flipping bearish, and this chart is an example of such a trend reversal. The $38,900 support was lost after multiple tests.That’s not bad in itself. But when the support level flips bearish into a resistance, that’s likely to trigger continuation downward.A similar support/resistance flip occurred at the $36,300 area, after which the price accelerated downward to the support areas at $32,500 and $30,000. Traders and investors should remember that downward corrections almost always occur in a fast and painful move.However, support seems to be found at $30,000, which can induce some range-bound constructions for now. Such a range-bound construction is healthy for the markets, as strength can be built for the next impulse wave. This impulse wave will most likely occur at a later stage in 2021.The 3-day chart shows confluences on the levels of interest for Bitcoin investors. In general, the previous all-time high at $20,000 would be a tremendous gift to the entire market. However, above this last all-time high, other levels are found and will likely be formidable support.These levels are aligned with the Fibonacci indicator. The first significant level of support is found in the region between $29,500 and $30,500. This is the level where Bitcoin’s price is currently finding support.From here, a relief bounce toward $35,000 to $37,000 could occur before another final dip starts.That final dip could be toward the region around $25,000 to $26,000, as that’s the next Fibonacci level.One of the primary variables for this recent correction across the crypto and equity markets is the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The dollar strength index (DXY) landed on a significant support level and marked a temporary low with a daily bullish divergence.Since then, the dollar has been rallying upward, causing other inversely correlated markets to drop south.The first area of resistance is constructed around the 92-points level. This area of resistance would automatically mean that other markets could correct further.The ultimate level to watch for Bitcoin traders is the weekly time frame, which is the 21-week moving verage. In 2016 and 2017, Bitcoin’s price rested on this moving average as support through the entire bull cycle.It’s not unlikely to have a similar test happen in the coming months, and it would suit with the likelihood of some consolidation before continuation. However, investors shouldn’t be worried at all about the current value of the 21-week MA. It’s a lagging indicator, however, which means it’s going to crawl up in the coming weeks toward the $25,000 area.That region would mean a correction of around 40% for the crypto markets, which is also something that has happened more than once in previous bull cycles before new highs.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

33,"The Intercontinental Exchange, the owner the New York Stock Exchange and institutional cryptocurrency exchange Bakkt, announced a deal that would see its crypto arm listed on the stock markets.As reported by the Wall Street Journal, Bakkt is set to merge with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings, trading under the ticker VIH. VPC is a so-called ""special purpose acquisition company,"" or SPAC. It is a shell company whose only purpose is to buy or merge with another company and allow it to be listed on the stock markets without going through the lengthy and expensive process of an initial public offering.Bakkt is expected to be valued at $2.1 billion after completing the merger. The exchange will also raise an additional $532 million to support the development of Bakkt App, a retail-centric wallet and rewards app.A Bakkt spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the merger is set to be completed in the second quarter of 2021. The combined company will be renamed as Bakkt Holdings, Inc. and will be listed on NYSE. The representative also said that Bakkt is now focused on delivering the app in March.Rumors of the acquisition surfaced earlier in January, as reported by Cointelegraph.

34,"Shinhan Bank, the oldest banking institution in South Korea, continues its efforts to introduce digital-asset custody services with a new investment.According to a Thursday report by news agency Yonhap, Shinhan Bank has invested in Korea Digital Asset Trust, or KDAC, an industry consortium of businesses that provide digital-asset custody. The initiative was launched by Korbit in collaboration with blockchain startup Blocko and digital-asset research company Fair Square Lab.With the new investment, Shinhan Bank moves closer to offering its own cryptocurrency custody business. In August 2020, Shinhan Bank announced its plans to introduce crypto custody alongside another major South Korean bank, Woori. Shinhan Financial Group chairman and CEO Yong-Byung Cho said that digital-asset custody will benefit from the bank’s compliance capabilities and custody experience. “We will secure competitiveness in custody services and proactively respond to the rapidly changing digital asset market due to the implementation of the Special Financial Information Act,” the executive stated.Cointelegraph reached out to Shinhan Bank and Korbit with additional queries regarding the investment. This article will be updated pending new information.Shinhan Bank has previously invested in companies backing the KDAC initiative. In August 2019, Shinhan Bank participated a $7.5 million funding round for Blocko. The bank is also involved in blockchain-related developments like blockchain stock lending."
35,"Over $2.7 billion worth of futures contracts were liquidated in the last 24 hours, based on data from Bybt. This caused the price of Bitcoin (BTC) to see a large drop in a short time frame as it plunged from over $41,000 to under $32,600.In the futures market, liquidations of positions occur because traders are borrowing additional capital to trade with larger positions.For example, exchanges in the Bitcoin futures market typically offer up to 100-times leverage. This allows traders to borrow 100 times their initial capital to trade BTC.The downside of leverage is that when the price of Bitcoin sees a minor drop, it can cause a position to be liquidated, or be worthless.Liquidated long on XBTUSD: Sell 1,235,411 @ 34710.5 ~ Multi kill ~ If you can dodge a liquidation you can dodge anythingFor instance, let’s say a trader uses 10-times leverage and borrows 10 times their capital to buy Bitcoin at $40,000. If the price drops 10% to $36,000, the position would be liquidated.When a long position is liquidated, the position is then sold to the market. Hence, if the majority of the market is longing Bitcoin and long contracts begin to be liquidated, it creates massive selling pressure.On Jan. 11, the Bitcoin market saw a massive long squeeze triggered by large sell orders on Coinbase. As whales or high-net-worth investors sold, it caused many long contracts to be liquidated in a matter of hours.The consecutive liquidations led to a domino effect, resulting in a steep sell-off and a 16% correction.But one optimistic sign is that the correction came to an end at around $32,700, which Whalemap analysts described as a whale cluster support area.A whale cluster forms when whales buy Bitcoin at a certain level and do not move it. This level often turns into a support area because whales are likely to double down on their entries if a major dip occurs and the price of BTC drops back to that level.Although Bitcoin saw a large drop, the overall market sentiment around BTC remains generally optimistic.As Cointelegraph reported, Elias Simos, a protocol specialist at Bison Trails, pinpointed that the number of whales actually increased after Bitcoin saw a big price drop.The trend shows that whales were actually accumulating as the cascade of liquidations occurred, which is positive. Simos wrote:Analysts at Glassnode, an on-chain analytics firm, explained that the fundamentals of Bitcoin remain intact despite the drop. They emphasized that the Bitcoin network’s hash rate and mining difficulty are still at all-time highs. The analysts noted:While this current 15% to 25% drop is the biggest pullback for this bull cycle to date, it’s worth noting that numerous 30% corrections occurred during Bitcoin’s 2017 bull cycle.As Cointelegraph reported earlier, the current BTC price pullback coincides with a potential bottom formation of the dollar strength index."
36,"Bitcoin (BTC) is changing hands fast after its drop to $32,000, and only millionaires are winning, data shows.Statistics governing wallet balances from Glassnode on Jan. 11 reveal that the main investors “buying the dip” are those with a balance in excess of 1,000 BTC ($36 million).Compiled by Elias Simos, protocol specialist at blockchain infrastructure provider Bison Trails, the numbers suggest that the wealthy have been profiting from Bitcoin being sold by smaller investors throughout December and January.“Addresses with more than 1k $BTC continue growing at the expense of all others–even as this most recent downturn is taking effect,” Simos summarized.While the number of wallets with smaller balances decreased as BTC/USD climbed from $19,000 on Dec. 1 to recent highs of $42,000, the 1,000-plus BTC group became an outlier, growing in presence.The net effect is thus weak hands selling to strong hands — and the richer the entity, the stronger the hands.“Don't be part of the #BTC transfer to billionaires, corporations and hedge funds .... at least not yet,” entrepreneur Alistair Milne warned Twitter followers while responding to Simos’ findings.While institutional buy-ins have become the standard narrative of Bitcoin over the past few months, a rogue “weak hands” signal from one of them caught analysts’ attention this week.As Cointelegraph reported, Guggenheim Partners, which announced a sizable fund allocation to BTC in late November, is allegedly planning to sell some of its holdings already. The trigger came from chief investment officer Scott Minerd, who on Monday said that Bitcoin’s weekend drop provides the impetus to rethink its position.“Bitcoin's parabolic rise is unsustainable in the near term,"" he wrote. ""Vulnerable to a setback.”His suggestion appeared to confuse market participants, with responses questioning the rationale behind the decision, coming just weeks after Guggenheim’s initial entry.“CIO of huge firm day trading btc? It's a 5-10yr hold minimum,” macro investor Dan Tapeiro argued.Institutional uptake comes amid a more fundamental supply and demand squeeze for Bitcoin, with large buyers already outpacing what miners can produce each month. At the same time, miners have stepped up their sales in recent days in what one theory suggests is some well-earned profit-taking at or near all-time highs."
37,"Bitcoin (BTC) heads into a new week after another weekend of major volatility — but this time, the way was down, not up. As the asset loses $7,000, the most since the “vertical” price rises began, Cointelegraph presents five things that could keep it moving in the coming days.Top on the list of topics among Bitcoiners will be the cryptocurrency’s sudden fall over Saturday and Sunday.From highs of near $42,000, BTC/USD faced a sell-off out of hours, with bears driving down the pair to current local lows of $32,300.The drop is the largest this year and most significant since the coronavirus pandemic caused a cross-asset crash in March 2020, but it was widely predicted by analysts, who argued that Bitcoin had become overextended.“#Bitcoin crashes >10%: The worst Bitcoin plunge since March is reminiscent of the last halving cycle in 2016/2017. The rally was followed by a slump of more than 50% in 2017,” financial commentator Holger Zschaepitz summarized in cautious words on Twitter.In fact, a 23% drop is nothing new for long-term Bitcoin hodlers, and the lack of more significant losses suggests that even above $30,000, buyer support remains strong.“These and upcoming dips are the opportunities you where looking for during the #FOMO feelings you had at $40,000. Use them,” Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe meanwhile continued.As of publication, Bitcoin was already rebounding, with $35,000 swiftly following the lows. This was not enough for institutional Bitcoin-buyer Guggenheim, however, with chief investment office Scott Minerd suddenly signalling that the fund would sell some of its BTC position.“Bitcoin's parabolic rise is unsustainable in the near term. Vulnerable to a setback,” he claimed on Monday.Others noted the potential bargain for large-volume buyers.“Institutions are really shaking out all the weak hands to acquire more #Bitcoin,” David Gokhshtein, founder of Gokhshtein Media, summarized about the current status quo.In the United States, a potential bull sign for Bitcoin in the form of a massive $3 trillion stimulus program from the incoming Biden administration is being masked by a recent rebound in the strength of the dollar.A classic inverse correlation for Bitcoin, the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) continued its gains over recent days, heading back above the 90 mark after hitting its lowest levels since March 2018.Last year often saw dollar-weakening give Bitcoin a boost, at a time when other price relationships were steadily breaking down.“The dollar is so extremely oversold, over-hated, and over-shorted that it all but has to rally for a while at some point soon,” Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co, told Bloomberg.Looking to the long term, however, it was clear for many this week that the U.S. was simply kicking its real economic hardship further down the road. Incoming President Joe Biden intends to give Americans stimulus checks worth $2,000 as part of a giant money-printing exercise, which could be worth $3 trillion.Should it pass, liquidity from the central bank will expand the most in a single instant since the coronavirus pandemic began, and it will take U.S. federal debt above $30 trillion for the first time in history.“Time for Plan B,” Danny Scott, CEO of United Kingdom exchange CoinCorner, responded to the plans.Equities traders are beginning to raise their hopes of incoming profits this week, thanks to the shock of recent events in the United States adding to markets’ existing gains.On Monday, it was India’s turn in the spotlight, with stocks racing toward new all-time highs. As Cointelegraph reported, other markets are already at or near records of their own. Elsewhere in Asia and beyond, Hong Kong and South Korea made gains while Australia saw losses.With U.S. futures down prior to Wall Street opening, a broadly mixed picture greeted market participants, with gold also struggling but oil advancing.The extent of Bitcoin’s reliance on stock market movements is again in doubt as the weekend’s volatility looks nothing like the current macro environment. Since outperforming every major equity play except Tesla as markets rebounded from their crash in March 2020, Bitcoin has increasingly forged its own path, unhindered by the macro.“I am expecting Bitcoin and tech stocks to double again in the next 6-9 months,” Immad Akhund, CEO of startup-focused bank Mercury, predicted over the weekend.Akhund, like various others, added that his timeline coincided with the rollout of mass vaccinations against the coronavirus, news of which has further fuelled stocks' all-round rise in recent weeks.One explanation for the Bitcoin price drop lies firmly within the Bitcoin network itself. A classic setup, miners appear to be selling holdings at significant rates once again.According to data from on-chain monitoring resource CryptoQuant, those sales have now reached their highest since July 2019, even surpassing those that followed the latest block subsidy halving in May 202.CryptoQuant used its Miner Position Index (MPI) to determine miners’ decreasing stocks of BTC, with CEO Ki Young Ju describing the current situation as a “short-term bearish market.”“Since December last year, they had been selling $BTC, but the correction was tiny due to institutional buying power,” he added in comments.Cointelegraph in-house analyst Joseph Young had further thoughts. For him, Bitcoin at its all-time highs of $42,000 came at the end of a period during which the market had simply overexerted itself. A period of taking stock — perhaps literally — was more than necessary.“$2.7 billion was liquidated today,” he noted on Monday.Bitcoin’s lower levels may end up being a gift to altcoin hodlers, who have eagerly awaited a lessening of the bull run’s intensity to allow other tokens breathing space.As Coitelegraph's van de Poppe often notes, altcoins do not do well during parabolic episodes in Bitcoin, with their main performance occurring after Bitcoin has cooled down.“The #altcoin market capitalization still looks great,” he commented on Monday.On Monday, however, it was clear that that pattern had yet to play out, with altcoins following Bitcoin downward and even outpacing its losses.Of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, many lost between 17% and 20% on the day, with market leader Ether (ETH) nearing the $1,000 support. Despite the drawdowns, many still retained solid gains on longer time frames. In the case of the top 10, it was Cardano's ADA in the lead overall, still up 27% versus a week ago."
38,"The United Kingdom's financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has posted a warning about cryptocurrency investment amid a major crash in crypto markets.In a Monday statement, the FCA said that crypto investment and lending are associated with a high level of risk, stressing that investors should be ready to lose all their money while investing in crypto.Citing a number of risks including price volatility, product complexity, and charges and fees, the FCA said that investors are taking charge of crypto-associated risks:The regulator also stated that crypto investors are unlikely to have access to major consumer protection institutions like the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme if something goes wrong.The FCA noted that companies offering crypto-related services should make sure that they comply with all relevant regulatory requirements and are authorized by the FCA. As of Sunday, all U.K.-based crypto-asset firms must be registered with the FCA under regulations to tackle money laundering, the agency wrote. “Operating without a registration is a criminal offence,” the FCA added.The FCA’s crypto warning comes amid a major drop in crypto markets after Bitcoin (BTC) recorded its new all-time high of nearly $42,000 on Friday. On Jan. 11, BTC saw a massive selloff, briefly diving below the $33,000 threshold. As of publishing time, BTC is trading around $35,000, down about 14% over the past 24 hours, according to data from Cointelegraph’s Bitcoin price index.The latest crypto market crash is not exclusive to Bitcoin, as all top 10 cryptos by market cap have posted major losses, with altcoins like Ether (ETH) dropping nearly 19%. "
39,"2021 got off to a quick start and the current crypto bull market has seen assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) shoot to new all-time highs on an almost daily basis. While new price highs are positive for investors, they do present a range of challenges relating to fees, transaction speeds and the centralization of what is meant to be a decentralized ecosystem. Since mid-2020 institutional investors have been steadily flooding into cryptocurrency and this is exacerbating the issue of scalability, high transaction costs and lengthy confirmation times on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain.Eth2 is steadily rolling out, but it could still be some time before users will benefit from its host of new features. This leaves the door open for other viable candidates to fill the void and a handful of layer 2 projects are gaining traction in the decentralized finance space.One such project that has been making waves in the past 6 months is Solana (SOL). Founded by Anatoly Yakovenko and designed a team of former engineers from globally recognized companies including Intel, Dropbox, and Qualcomm, Solana claims to be a censorship-resistant blockchain that provides the open infrastructure required for global adoption.Some experts view the project as a possible Ethereum competitor and FTX exchange co-founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried threw his support behind the project when he chose it to host his DeFi project called Serum.According to Bankman-Fried, Ethereum is incapable of handling the rapid growth seen in the decentralized finance sector and the only way around the scalability and transaction fee challenges is to build on other networks like Solana.Bankman-Fried claims to have thoroughly tested more than 30 of the top blockchain projects, including Ethereum, before settling on Solana and in the past he referenced the network’s ability to process 50,000 transactions per second.When asked about scaling improvements with Eth2, Bankman-Fried suggested that it is still insufficient, saying the crypto sector needs something that is “not just 100 times faster than Ethereum, we need, like, a million times faster than Ethereum.”Initially after listing at exchanges, SOL token traded between the $0.50 to $0.91 range in April and July of 2020. This was before any major project developments were announced but on July 27, Bankman-Fried tweeted:Shortly after the announcement, SOL saw a noticeable uptick in buy pressure as and over the next two months its volume and price surged as the average daily volume increased from $1 million to $41 million and the token price spiked to $4.89.As the DeFi bull run ended and traders took profits, SOL was not spared from the carnage and its price fell as low as $1.21 before reclaiming the $3.00 range in the past month.Aside from existing as a efficient alternative to the Etheruem network, the Solana blockchain has followed the footsteps of other networks that realize how integral stablecoins are to the growth of the crypto sector.In response to the recent announcement from the OCC that banks ""may use new technologies, including INVNs and related stablecoins, to perform bank-permissible functions, such as payment activities,” the Solana team tweeted that the approval would also benefit SOL and the network.

This suggests that a broad spectrum of institutions are accumulating Bitcoin (BTC).As this trend gathers speed, investment banks have also decided that they do not want to be left behind. A recent filing from Morgan Stanley shows a purchase of a 10.9% stake in business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, a move that was likely made in order to gain exposure in Bitcoin. With 70,470 Bitcoin in their possession, MicroStrategy has become a proxy play on Bitcoin.Several analysts suspect that the current demand could also be coming from investors who have been closing their gold positions and buying Bitcoin. On a query about the recent underperformance of gold, CNBC Mad Money show host Jim Cramer speculated that institutional money may be flowing into cryptocurrency.While there have been positive reports about institutional purchases, traders should also keep track of the people who have been selling because at some point the rally will lose momentum and investors will look to book profits.Analysts at Material Indicators suggest that mega whales may have booked profits on Jan. 7 when Bitcoin hit $40,000 and further selling from whales could also be the reason for the price drop seen today. However, aggressive buying at lower levels resulted in a strong rebound.But that has not deterred the whales from selling. Bitcoin whales in South Korea have been dumping their positions over the past few days, as seen from the multiple $100 million deposits to exchanges. While the selling has not caused a massive rush to the exit, traders should be careful with their positions because even if a couple of large investors in the U.S. rush to the exit, it could result in a sharp fall.If Bitcoin corrects sharply, most altcoins are also likely to follow suit, but if Bitcoin remains strong, these top-5 cryptocurrencies could outperform in the short term.Let’s analyze their charts to spot the critical levels to watch.Bitcoin has been in a strong uptrend for the past few weeks, but the rally has pushed the relative strength index (RSI) into overbought territory. While markets can remain overbought for a long time, with every rise, the risk of a sharp correction increases.The first support on the downside is the intraday low made on Jan. 8 at $36,518.73. If the price rebounds off this level, it will suggest that traders are not booking profits in a hurry and are buying on minor dips.If the bulls propel the price above $41,959.63, the uptrend could resume with the next target objective at $45,000 and then $50,000.However, if the bears sink the price below $36,518.73, the BTC/USD pair could drop to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the most recent leg of the up-move at $32,816.03.This is a crucial support to monitor because if it cracks, several traders may start to panic and dump their positions, which may result in a deeper correction to the 61.8% retracement level at $27,167.10.The 4-hour chart shows that the price is currently stuck inside a $38,000 to $41,959.63 range. If the bulls can push the price above the range, the uptrend may resume.On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below the support of the range, it will suggest profit-booking by traders.The next support on the downside is the 50-simple moving average, which has not been breached decisively during previous corrections in this leg of the uptrend. Thus, if this support cracks, it will signal a possible trend change.Cardano (ADA) is currently consolidating in an uptrend. The altcoin has been stuck between $0.2632811 and $0.3542857 for the past few days, which has pulled down the RSI from deeply overbought levels.The bulls are currently facing stiff resistance near the $0.34 level but one positive sign is that there are no signs of panic selling yet. If the bulls can drive the price above the overhead resistance, the next leg of the uptrend could resume.The ADA/USD pair has a target objective at $0.449 but the bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance near $0.40. However, if the bulls can push the price above the resistance levels, the pair could rally to the psychological level at $0.50.This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($0.234). Such a move will suggest that the uptrend may have topped out.The 4-hour chart shows the formation of a symmetrical triangle, which usually acts as a continuation pattern. The bulls are currently attempting to defend the 20-EMA. If the price rebounds off the current levels, the bulls will try to push the pair above the triangle.If they succeed, the pair may rally to $0.525. However, if the pair drops below the triangle, the next support is at the 50-SMA, but if this support also cracks, the decline could extend to $0.20.EOS has been trading inside a large range between $2.20 and $3.949. The altcoin turned down sharply from the overhead resistance today, which shows aggressive selling by the bears.However, if the bulls defend the moving averages, the EOS/USD pair may again attempt to rise to the overhead resistance near $3.949. A breakout of this level will suggest the start of a new uptrend that may reach $5.698.This view will be invalidated if the bears sink and sustain the price below the moving averages. Such a move could result in a fall to the support of the range at $2.20 and that may keep the pair range-bound for a few more days.The 4-hour chart shows that the price turned down sharply from the overhead resistance and broke below both moving averages. This suggests aggressive selling by the bears.However, if the price rebounds off the current level and rises above the 20-EMA, it will suggest that the selling may be over. The bulls may then again try to carry the price to the overhead resistance.Conversely, if the bears sustain the price below $3, the pair may drop to $2.50 and then to $2.20.THETA is currently consolidating in an uptrend for the past few days. The price has been making lower highs, which suggests that every attempt to rally is being met with selling from the bears.However, a minor positive is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the $1.7611 support. The 20-day EMA ($1.74) is just below this level and the bulls are likely to defend it aggressively.If the bulls can push the price above $2.20, the THETA/USD pair may rise to $2.51. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest bulls are in control.If the bears continue their selling and sink the pair below the 20-day EMA, it may open the gates for a drop to the 50-day SMA ($1.12).The 4-hour chart shows a descending triangle formation. The flat moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.If the bears can sink and sustain the price below $1.7611, the descending triangle pattern will complete and that could drag the price down to $1.01.On the other hand, if the bulls can push the price above the triangle, it will invalidate the bearish pattern. This could push the price to $2.51 and if the bulls can thrust the price above this resistance, the up-move could reach $2.95.AAVE is currently in an uptrend as it continues to make higher highs and higher lows formation. However, the long wick on today’s candlestick shows that bears are aggressively selling at higher levels.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near overbought territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the AAVE/USD pair corrects further, a rebound off the 20-day EMA ($99.93) will confirm that traders are continuing to buy on dips.If the buyers can push the price above $135.99, the uptrend could resume with the next likely target at $150.However, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($85). A break below this support could result in a fall to $70 and then to $60.The 4-hour chart shows that the pair is trading inside an ascending channel. The bulls are currently attempting to defend the 20-EMA. A strong bounce could carry the price to the resistance line of the channel.A break above the channel could result in a sharp up-move but if the price turns down from the resistance line of the channel, the pair may trade inside the channel for a few days.If the price breaks below the 20-EMA, a drop to the support line of the channel is possible. A strong rebound off this support will keep the uptrend intact but a break below it could signal a trend change.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

41,"According to data from CryptoQuant, miners appear to be selling large amounts of Bitcoin (BTC). Historically, heightened selling pressure from miners marked a local top and led to sharp, prolonged corrections.In May 2020, on-chain analyst Willy Woo said that there would be two sources of unmatched selling pressure in the market after the block reward halving.Woo pinpointed Bitcoin miners and cryptocurrency exchanges selling the fees they gain in the form of crypto assets as the sources of selling pressure. He said:Hence, in the short to medium term, miners could continue to serve as a major source of selling pressure on Bitcoin.Based on data from CryptoQuant, the Miner Position Index (MPI) has surged significantly in the past few days.On Jan. 10, the MPI reached a level that is on par with July 2019, when BTC price quickly fell below $14,000. Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, said:Ki later noted that he closed the scalp short, emphasizing that the correction was short-lived.It is possible that the buyer demand coming from the U.S. is overwhelming the selling pressure from miners. This theory is supported by the recent trend of Bitcoin price trading at a higher premium at Coinbase than other major exchanges like Binance.Some traders expect Bitcoin to see a larger pullback in the near term. Edward Morra, a cryptocurrency trader, said that a possible scenario is a slow correction to around $36,000.Morra noted that the scenario of Bitcoin falling all the way down to $36,000 is unlikely, but it would be a “typical bull market thing.” He wrote:Philip Swift, the creator of LookIntoBitcoin, said that while Bitcoin is unlikely to see a 30% pullback, the rate of appreciation could decline. This could lead to slower momentum for BTC, especially as it retests the $42,000 resistance level in the foreseeable future. He explained:"
42,"Bitcoin (BTC) price has once again dropped below the $40,000 level on Jan. 10 after crisscrossing it for the past three days as the spotlight shifted to altcoins, namely Dash (DASH) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). The BTC price drop comes after another failure to break through resistance at $41,500 in weekend trading.One reason for the drop is likely an uptick in selling by miners. As reported yesterday, the Miner's Position Index (MPI) that calculates the ratio of BTC leaving all miner wallets to its 1-year moving average has reached levels where miners are selling. Miner Position Index looks enough to make a local top,"" commented CryptoQuant CEO, Ki Young Ju, right before the price dropped.Other reasons are largely technical as BTC gives altcoins some time to catch up and due to sentiment. The Crypto Fear and Greed index, for example, has remained at dangerously high levels suggesting that a pullback is likely. In fact, the metric has remained above 90 or ""extreme greed"" for two months, the longest period in its history. Meanwhile, altseason continues with the bullishness apparently shifting from BTC to Bitcoin Cash in Sunday trading. The latter soared from $420 to as high as $630 in the past 24 hours. The move marks a technical breakout from a multi-year bear market with BCH/USD now at the highest levels since November 2018.However, the biggest gainer over the past 24 hours is Dash with its price rising roughly 40%. During the short parabolic rally, DASH surged by over 100% from $95 to as high as $194, only to pull back to the $140 level. The move also marks a technical breakout from a multi-year slump as major altcoins are now following in Ethereum's footsteps from last weekend, which several analysts pointed out as the possible start of ""altseason."" "
43,"The bullish momentum seen throughout the week has spilled over into the weekend as the majority of the top-100 tokens listed on CoinMarketCap are posting double-digit gains. Bitcoin (BTC) entering a brief consolidation period and the possibility of a third round of stimulus checks for American citizens are two possible reasons for today’s bullish price action.While there are concerns about the recent large Bitcoin inflows into South Korean exchanges by BTC whales, fundamentals factors like miner sentiment and decreasing supply are keeping investors feeling relatively optimistic about Bitcoin’s future price prospects.A growing number of experts have voiced their opinion that Bitcoin’s recent bullish surge is due to outflow from gold as the top cryptocurrency is quickly becoming the preferred inflation hedge for the millennial generation.Following the new all-time high price in Bitcoin (BTC) of $41,940 on Jan 8, the top cryptocurrency has entered what looks to be a brief consolidation phase as bulls attempt to push the price higher after confirming the $40,000 level as support.At the time of writing, BTC is up 1.53% on the day and trading at $40,690 as the 24-hour trading volume has seen a 26% decrease from the record high’s set on Jan 8.Predicting what comes next is a difficult task at these price levels due to the absence of a price ceiling. In regards to price volatility, Chad Steinglass, the head of trading at CrossTower suggested that increased volatility could be the norm until the market moves “into a more stable environment of balanced flows and more stable prices.”In private comments to Cointelegraph, Steinglass said:As has been the case in previous bull markets, a rise in the price of Bitcoin is often followed by a consolidation phase. During this time, traders tend to shift their attention toward altcoins and Bitcoin profits shift into smaller cap cryptocurrencies.According to Jean Baptiste Pavageau, a partner at ExoAlpha, the current bullish momentum seen from Bitcoin will eventually slow down and at this juncture investors are likely to pile into altcoins. Pavaageau told Cointelegraph:Ether (ETH) price continues to surge to new yearly highs as the price rallied 4.2% to $1,267. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV) are up 23.6% and 61% respectively.Coming off a week filled with positive developments for stablecoin projects, MakerDAO and its MKR token, which govern the development of the DAI stablecoin, has seen an increase of 45% over the past 24-hours and currently trades for $1,530.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.1 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 69%."
44,"According to multiple experts, one possible reason for Bitcoin’s remarkable recent price rise are massive investor outflows from another popular inflation hedge: gold. Spot gold swooned over the past week, falling 4.62% to $1,857. The asset previously had been surging in unison with Bitcoin, which is up over 40% from $28,000 lows last week.In a Tweet on Friday, Charlie Morris, founder and CIO at ByteTree Asset Management, said that the pullback in gold might be attributable to investors moving to Bitcoin:With bond yields up and inflation expectations down today, #gold has taken a hit. This justifies a $50 sell off, but price is down $120. I'd attribute the excess to flows moving towards #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/qsWBb8NaXALikewise, earlier in the week, CNBC’s Mad Money host Jim Cramer said that the outflows from gold ETFs are “all going to crypto.” Tracking inflows and outflows from Grayscale’s Bitcoin investment trust and gold ETFs back this assertion, as Grayscale has eclipsed gold: #Bitcoin's competition w/gold has already started as evidenced by >$3bn of inflows into Grayscale Bitcoin Trust & >$7bn of outflows from Gold ETFs since Oct, JPM says: Competition w/gold as alternative currency will continue given millennials will become over time more important. pic.twitter.com/lkXmDIN9e4The moves could be a sign of Bitcoin’s rising status as a legitimate asset class. Gold and Bitcoin have long been linked as both are seen as a way to protect wealth against inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty, but if the price movements over the last week are any indication, however, Bitcoin may be winning the narrative race. In an interview with Bloomberg, Coinshares chief revenue officer Frank Spiteri said that the narrative surrounding Bitcoin as an inflation hedge is gaining legs “in the face of a highly unconventional monetary policy environment.”“It seems like we’re in the middle of a simultaneous awakening among institutions to Bitcoin as an uncorrelated store of value assets,” he said.The observations from experts come after a unique flippening earlier this week: as of Friday, a single Bitcoin is worth more than a 20-ounce gold bar.Still, for all the bearish price action and Bitcoin’s ascendancy, certain high-profile gold bugs refuse to budge on their positions. In a Tweet yesterday longtime Bitcoin skeptic and gold investor Peter Schiff claimed that once investors “understand” the inflation risk, they’ll return to bullion:Today’s weak economic data on jobs is causing investors to buy risk assets and sell safe-havens like #gold. The weaker the economy gets the more money the Fed prints to prop it up. So, the real risk is #inflation, and once investors understand this, they will seek safety in gold."
45,"Bitcoin (BTC) whales in South Korea have been selling heavily across major exchanges throughout the past week. Data shows that multiple $100 million deposits to Bithumb have been spotted in the last three days alone.By volume, South Korea has a much smaller cryptocurrency exchange market compared to the United States. Yet, South Korea’s cryptocurrency exchanges have seen massive inflows that are comparable with other major markets.Large inflows into exchanges typically indicate selling pressure from whales because high-net-worth investors do not keep their holdings on exchanges. Hence, when capital flows into a trading platform, it shows an intent to sell.After two $100 million deposits to Bithumb were spotted, Korbit saw a $90 million deposit on Jan. 9.According to CryptoQuant Alerts, 2,098 BTC, worth $84 million, were deposited into Korbit at 11:42 am KST.Due to the discrepancy between the daily volume of South korean exchanges and major U.S.-based or international exchanges, inflows that exceed $50 million are often considered unusually large deposits.Data from CoinMarketCap shows that Korbit ranks 21st in the global market by daily volume, processing $44 million worth of trades daily.Hence, a $84 million deposit on a single day is an abnormally big deposit given that the exchange trades around $44 million a day, per CoinMarketCap.The most likely reason behind the continuous inflows into South Korean exchanges is arbitrage.In December 2017, when Bitcoin first surpassed $20,000 in South Korea, the dominant cryptocurrency was trading about 20% higher at times, what became known as the ""kimchi premium.""In recent weeks, Bitcoin has been trading around 5% higher on South Korean exchanges. This might have encouraged whales to arbitrage the premium, driving massive inflows.However, arbitraging the premium in South Korea is not easy. South Korea has strict restrictions on capital leaving outside the country. Foreigners are also not allowed to trade on local cryptocurrency exchanges, which makes it all the more challenging.For the arbitrage to work efficiently, whales outside of South Korea would have to supply BTC to local traders, and work as a team to pull it off.On Jan. 8, Cointelegraph reported that “mega whales” sold large amounts of BTC when the Bitcoin price first surged past $40,000.Even as Bitcoin dipped $40,000 to around $36,000, many major whales continued to sell aggressively, pushing the price down.In the near term, the pattern of whales taking profit and new buyers from the U.S. accumulating Bitcoin should continue. But the biggest variable that could alter the market dynamic is the strength of the U.S. dollar, or namely, the USD strength index (DXY).Analysts at Decentrader, a platform for cryptocurrency traders, said that the HODLing activity of Bitcoin is increasing, which could offset the thread of the rising dollar in the medium term. He said:Bitcoin 1 Year Hodl Wave.

Shows the % coins held for 1 year+

Currently sat at 58% following a 2x in price.

Last cycle at 2x ATH it was the same value; investors are behaving the same.

About 5% of 1 Year Hodl's coins have been dumped.https://t.co/DfZqavFkmr pic.twitter.com/6av7rmX2WqPhilip Swift, Bitcoin trader and creator of Lookintobitcoin, meanwhile cautions that the market is reaching overheated levels.Although the sign of a market top above $40,000 is not necessarily here yet, it is nearing the peak. Swift said:Swift also explained further in comments to Cointelegraph that while the rally may be getting overheated, a large pullback is becoming unlikely. ""I think a 30% pullback from here is pretty unlikely,"" he said. ""I do think the rate we have gone up is getting to the point where btc may need to slow down soon though. Once bitcoin starts ranging then I think alts rip."""
46,"The incoming Biden administration’s plan to flood the U.S. economy with trillions of dollars could ignite the next leg of the Bitcoin (BTC) bull market, as more investors seek refuge from a crumbling United States dollar. Axios, an Arlington-based news outlet, reported Thursday that Joe Biden has asked Congress to provide Americans with $2,000 in stimulus payments to help offset the economic devastation of Covid-19. The incoming president has also proposed a $3 trillion tax and infrastructure package as part of his “Build Back Better” program.Biden doubled down on his call for more direct relief to Americans following Friday’s disappointing jobs report showing a loss of 140,000 positions in December.He said:If 2020 is anything to go by, the new tidal wave of stimulus could be another catalyst for Bitcoin as more money floods the market and makes its way into asset prices.Even Donald Trump, a Republican, was no stranger to vast government outlays. Under his leadership, the United States passed a historic $2 trillion stimulus bill in March. Trump also signed a $900 billion relief package last month that would pave the way for $600 stimulus checks.The federal government’s inflation-boosting policies have coincided with record intervention from the Federal Reserve, which deployed trillions of dollars in 2020 to combat a liquidity crisis and keep overnight rates under control.Although these policies provided a strong backstop for risk-on assets – a category that has included Bitcoin in the past – the emerging narrative surrounding BTC is that it’s a hedge against inflation.This is not only corroborated by Bitcoin’s historic outperformance over the past 11 years but also by the fresh wave of institutional money entering the market. Institutions are buying Bitcoin with a clear purpose, and may one day become the industry’s “mega HODLers.”Bitcoin’s digital gold narrative has been one of the biggest catalysts behind the institutional shift towards BTC. This narrative helped fuel Bitcoin's 300% rally in 2020 and its more than doubling in price over the past three weeks. This trend could intensify in 2021 as the dollar's purchasing power continues to erode. Even JPMorgan Chase has acknowledged that Bitcoin is taking market share from gold, the traditional haven asset. On Friday, one Bitcoin was worth more than 22 ounces of gold, which represents a new all-time high."
47,"Satoshi Nakamoto, the unknown Bitcoin creator, released the first client network on this day 12 years ago, officially kickstarting what is perhaps the greatest monetary revolution of the 21st century. Six days prior, on Jan. 3, 2009, Satoshi mined the Genesis block, known as #0, coding it into the software. Unlike the subsequent blocks in the chain, the coin base reward from the Genesis block cannot be spent, as only publicly mined “coins” can be transferred. So, the first block, or #1, was mined on Jan. 9, putting a true start to the network as it is known today.At the time, Satoshi announced the news to the cryptography mailing list with a download link to Bitcoin 0.1.0 on the open-source software database platform Sourceforge.Bitcoin 0.1.0 was only compatible with the Windows operating system. The first client version with Linux support did not come until December 2009 with the release of Bitcoin 0.2.0.Less than a week before releasing the first client software, Satoshi mined the Genesis block, beginning the network. Hal Finney received the first-ever BTC transaction on Jan. 12, 2009.At the time, early adopters were already alive to the possibility of creating monetary value from computing power. According to Finney: “The possibility of generating coins today with a few cents of compute time may be quite a good bet.”The programmer and cryptographer enthusiast famously predicted that Bitcoin could attain world reserve currency status and reach $10 million per coin. Satoshi agreed with Finney’s optimistic expectations, adding: “It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on.”However, it was not until October 2009 that Bitcoin (BTC) would receive its first official valuation. At the time, the New Liberty Standard, an early BTC exchange, created a benchmark price for Bitcoin set at 1,309 BTC to $1.Early miners became flush with Bitcoin, as the network is still in its infancy. Some even create Bitcoin faucets that help to promote broader BTC penetration.In May 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz cemented his place forever in Bitcoin folklore, paying 10,000 BTC for pizza in what is widely considered to be the first “real-world” Bitcoin transaction.WikiLeaks, cut off from funding sources, turned to Bitcoin and some early adopters encouraged Julian Assange to consider BTC adoption. Satoshi admonished Assange against the course of action, arguing that an association with WikiLeaks could bring unnecessary heat on the fledgling project.Indeed, Satoshi’s plea to Assange was one of the last pieces of digital correspondence from the Bitcoin creator before exiting the scene completely.By 2011, Bitcoin appeared to be evolving from being a strictly cypherpunk affair to the realm of anarchists and proponents of a free market. Silk Road, the defunct darknet marketplace, made an appearance with BTC as a popular payment method for illegal drug trafficking and other banned substances.On the market side, Bitcoin claims the $1 price milestone as attention begins to spread to the wider tech community. By the middle of 2011, Bitcoin was at $30, but a 25,000-BTC theft from a user’s slushpool account caused a great price crash.Bitcoin mining was also evolving, with personal computers no longer able to provide enough hash power to secure the expanded network. Graphics processing units and field-programmable gate arrays now provide more efficient Bitcoin mining capabilities.Back in 2010, Stellar founder Jed McCaleb established the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange. Fast forward to 2013, and the platform handled over 70% of the global BTC trade. Mt. Gox seemed too big to fail, but it did, indeed, fail when hackers stole about 850,000 BTC between 2011 and 2014. The news of the thefts caused another major Bitcoin price crash.Meanwhile, tech adoption was on the rise, leading to the emergence of such products as BTC storage devices by the likes of Elliptic. U.S. crypto exchange giant Coinbase also came on the scene, raising $25 million in funding.On the regulatory front, the period between 2013 and 2014 marked the beginning of several governments taking notice of Bitcoin. China’s central bank prohibited banks from facilitating BTC transactions, while the U.S. government auctioned off about 29,000 BTC seized from Silk Road operators.By 2015, major altcoins projects such as Ethereum had begun to emerge, as founders looked to create digital currencies with features designed to fix perceived flaws in the Bitcoin protocol. Mining also went one step further with the introduction of application-specific integrated circuits and the rise of industrial Bitcoin mining.Failure to reach a consensus on the block size limit saw a chain split occur in August 2017, leading to the creation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). However, true prominence came when Bitcoin’s price grew almost 20-fold from January 2017 to mid-December, almost eclipsing the $20,000 mark.Bitcoin’s rise to the $20,000 price level in 2017 was followed immediately by a substantial and prolonged crash that bottomed out at $3,800 in early 2018. The bear market would last for the rest of the year, with several proponents arguing for institutional adoption as the next step in the Bitcoin evolution.Despite Bitcoin being in the throes of a bear market, its fundamentals continued to improve. By mid-2019, the network hash rate had topped 70 exahashes per second — more than 10 times the number of grains of sand on the planet. Bitcoin derivatives also took off, introducing markets such as futures and options contracts, and mainstream firms such as Fidelity announced plans for Bitcoin custody solutions.In 2020, Bitcoin appeared to have become the darling of institutional investors, with hedge funds and corporations pursuing direct exposure to BTC. Some publicly listed companies have even added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, holding the top-ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization as a treasury reserve asset amid recurrent currency debasement policies in major economies.Bitcoin shot past the $20,000 mark in late 2020 but did not stop there. Successive reports of major firms buying BTC saw the price enter another parabolic advance despite dropping 50% in Q1 2020 during the initial COVID-19 asset sell-off.It is only early days in 2021, but Bitcoin has already reached above $42,000, two times more than the magic number back in 2017. In the 12 years since Satoshi released the first Bitcoin client, the network and the ecosystem itself have evolved from just being used in the cypherpunks arena to gaining attention from Wall Street.Related: Brace for impact? After hitting $42K, Bitcoin price volatility may riseIn that time, gamblers, darknet narcotics vendors, citizens of failed states, “techpreneurs,” hedge funds, LLCs and everyday investors have flocked to the most popular cryptocurrency in the world. Perhaps, government adoption is next on the agenda, and Bitcoin could become a reserve currency of a major world power. Would Satoshi be pleased with such an outcome?"
48,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) achieved a new all-time high above $42,000 on Jan. 8, surging by 9% in merely three hours. At the time, there was a high premium on Coinbase, which meant U.S. buyers drove up the market by aggressively accumulating BTC. But, there is continuous selling pressure coming from Asia, particularly from South Korea.Bitcoin corrected sharply after rising to $42,000, declining by over 7% in about eight hours. The sell-off coincided with significant whale activity across major exchanges. Trading activity in the altcoin futures market also demonstrated a similar trend. For instance, on Jan. 9, a whale unloaded a big portion of Ether (ETH) longs on Bitfinex, taking profit for the first time since March 12.Whales have been selling en masse since the start of 2021. As an example, when Bitcoin first surpassed $40,000, large whales began to sell BTC even as the price fell below $40,000. Within three hours, on Jan. 7, so-called “mega whales” on Binance sold off a total of four times, driving extreme volatility.Currently, the Bitcoin market is essentially seeing a battle between whales taking profit on their positions and new buyers in the U.S. market accumulating BTC. As such, there has been consistent extreme volatility ever since Bitcoin surpassed $30,000. Due to the high inflow of capital into Bitcoin through Coinbase, the upside momentum of BTC would likely be sustained in the foreseeable future.The key metrics to observe are Bitcoin outflows from Coinbase and stablecoin inflows into major exchanges. When high-net-worth investors purchase Bitcoin, they prefer to move the BTC out of centralized exchanges for security purposes. Hence, high Coinbase outflows would mean a heavy accumulation of BTC in the United States.When stablecoin inflows are high, it suggests that sidelined capital is moving back into the Bitcoin market. Rather than cashing out to fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, traders within the cryptocurrency exchange market, particularly derivatives traders, park their funds in stablecoins. Therefore, if capital stored in stablecoins begins to move back into cryptocurrencies, it typically suggests a bullish market structure.Generally, the market sentiment around Bitcoin remains positive despite an upsurge throughout the past three months. Eric Wall, chief investment officer of Arcane Research, said in a tweet that Bitcoin has the potential to see a “very extreme peak” this time around. This would mean that even if Bitcoin could be overheated based on technical indicators in the near term, BTC could still have room for additional growth.At the current price of around $40,000, the market capitalization of Bitcoin is valued at over $740 billion. Given gold’s valuation of $9 trillion, this would put BTC’s market cap at around 8.2% of gold. Bullish projections of Bitcoin, like the thesis of the Winklevoss twins, anticipate Bitcoin to overtake gold over the long term. Based on this assessment, some analysts say that Bitcoin reaching 10%–20% of gold’s market cap is realistic.Wall noted that Bitcoin would likely peak when there is ostensibly a lot of “froth” in the market. If there is an unnaturally high level of retail excitement around Bitcoin, the probability of a temporary Bitcoin top would increase. However, Wall said that given the unprecedented level of institutional interest in Bitcoin, the next top could be much higher than many imagine:According to researchers at Whalemap, a data analytics platform that tracks Bitcoin whales or high-net-worth investors, there are two key technical levels for Bitcoin in the near term. As long as BTC remains above $38,719 and $38,700, which are two major whale cluster areas, the researchers said that the bull trend of BTC remains intact.Whale clusters form when whales accumulate Bitcoin at a certain price point and do not move their holdings afterward. Clusters are theoretically ideal support areas because whales would look to accumulate more at levels they previously bought BTC at if the price of Bitcoin dips. The researchers noted: “Support at $39,719, invalidation below $38,700. Gap in supports between $39,719 and $32,180 so consolidating in the bear zone could bring us down to $32k.”On Jan. 9, Bitcoin’s price fell to as low as $38,700, recovering strongly at the support level. This indicates that some whales are accumulating at this level, protecting it as a short-term support area to keep the BTC rally moving.However, Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision Group, warned of the “New Year Head Fake.” Pal said that hedge funds begin to talk about various risk-on assets at the beginning of the year. Then, when many investors buy in, the market tends to correct by the end of the first quarter. If this head fake phenomenon coincides with a rising U.S. dollar, Pal said that he would be tempted to place S&P 500 puts. In the options market, puts are short contracts that allow investors to bet against an asset or an index.Considering that Bitcoin and gold tend to move together, and a rising dollar could negatively affect both assets, a New Year head fake could cause corrections in both the Bitcoin and the gold markets. Whether this correction would be as brutal as the March crash remains uncertain, but given that BTC is overbought on higher time frames, like the weekly and monthly charts, the possibility of a deep correction exists nonetheless."
49,"Bitcoin (BTC) mining difficulty is increasing by roughly 11% on Jan. 9, according to data from BTC.com. This marks the biggest increase in nearly four months that will put the metric over 20 trillion for the first time ever. ""Hashrate is on a tear!"" commented popular pseudonymous Bitcoin trader hodlonaut three days ago. ""When difficulty readjusts in 3 days, it will crush through 20T for the first time in Bitcoin history.""The network difficulty is a relative measure of how hard it is to mine a new block for the Bitcoin blockchain.With the hash rate currently at record levels of around 148 EH/s, the difficulty adjustment, which occurs every 2016 blocks, makes sure that the time between blocks mined remains 10 minutes on average. Meanwhile, simultaneous rising hash rate and mining difficulty suggest that miners are continuing to allocate a record number of resources to secure and invest in the network.Since the halving in May, the total outflows of BTC from miners have been gradually decreasing on average — the opposite of BTC/USD. Hence, miners are still showing no signs of major selling despite the price of Bitcoin skyrocketing to over $41,000 in the past week. What's more, the Miners Position Index (MPI), which calculates the ratio of BTC leaving all miners wallets to its 1-year moving average, is currently at 4.5. Values above 2 indicate most miners should be selling.This suggests that miners aren't eager to part with their freshly-minted BTC at the moment, particularly as exchange BTC reserves plummet and the price is in a strong, accelerating uptrend. Thus, it may make sense for some miners to hold their inventory and benefit from the accelerating bull market that may last into December 2021, according to some predictions.Meanwhile, concerns of a ""mining death spiral"" continue to be disproven with every new network record as Bitcoin network fundamentals appear stronger than ever. Overall, Bitcoin miners seem to be in a financially secure position from a rising BTC price, remaining financially secure even though it has never been harder to mine BTC. Currently, each BTC block mined is worth roughly $253,600 with around 9.44% coming from network transaction fees, according to the latest data from Clarkmoody. "
50,"Bitcoin price has re-established the $40,000 level as support but as bull push toward a new all-time high the possibility of another sharp sell-off looms.According to analysts at Material Indicators, a crypto analytics company, mega-whales sold off steeply when Bitcoin hit $40,000 on Jan. 7. This led to a quick 10% drop to the $36,000 area over the next few hours.The dip was quickly bought up, eventually pushing the price above $41,000 in the next 12 hours. However, BTC saw another large drop after setting another all-time high at $42,000, and at the time of writing the top-ranked digital asset is trading at $40,800. According to Material Indicators:In the most recent pullback from $42,000 to $40,000, analysts from Material Indicators explained that smaller whales, who hold $100,000 to $1 million, began to take profit. They noted:Considering that at times during the last week Bitcoin price has traded higher on Coinbase, it is clear that there is large buyer demand coming from the U.S.This suggests that there is a battle between normal whales taking profit and new buyers in the U.S. market. The sharp rejections from each new all-time high also signals that whales may be aggressively taking profit as soon as Bitcoin hits a new record highAs such, it is important that the demand for Bitcoin from the U.S. is sustained in the near term. Otherwise, the high level of selling pressure from whales could cause BTC to see a correction in the foreseeable future.Bitcoin currently has extremely strong technical momentum that continues to drive the price higher. For this reason, traders are reluctant to short it, but some have started to take profits.In the short term, one concern for Bitcoin is the potential recovery of the U.S. dollar. A pseudonymous trader known as “Cantering Clark” pinpointed the rebound of the U.S. dollar and the decline of precious metals. He said:The U.S. dollar index (DXY) is hovering at a support level on the monthly chart. Alternative stores of value, like Bitcoin and gold, are priced against the dollar. Hence, if the dollar begins to move upward, the risk of a BTC correction could intensify."
51,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has risen dramatically over the past days and weeks, recently wheeling past $40,000. An asset largely untied to governmental authority, Bitcoin is a hedge against global uncertainty, according to venture capitalist and billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya.Citing a possible five or 10-year time horizon, Palihapitiya said he thinks Bitcoin will likely reach $200,000 at some point. “The reason is because, everytime you see all of this stuff happening, it just reminds you that wow our leaders are not as trustworthy and reliable as they used to be,” he told CNBC in an interview on Thursday. He added:Since the pandemic gripped the world in 2020, governments around the world have taken various measures to combat its economic impact. The United States in particular has printed and spent massive sums of dollars.Borderless and run by the people, Bitcoin allows holders to control their funds by themselves — no centralized authority required. Additionally, in October 2020, Fidelity released a report showing Bitcoin’s lack of price correlation to other markets, such as gold and stocks.“It’s going to eventually transition to something much more important, but for right now, you’re just getting all these data points that prove this thing,” Palihapitiya said of Bitcoin, adding:Crypto has seen a noteworthy amount of adoption since the beginning of 2020, including large players gaining interest in BTC. Some influential financial figures, however, such as Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary, still remain skeptical on Bitcoin, citing regulation as a potential issue.The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has previously classified Bitcoin as a commodity, although recent action shows increased regulatory overwatch on the crypto space, partly evident in a government proposal limiting self-custody digital asset wallets."
52,"Altcoin’s recent gains have come under pressure as Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped to retest lower support levels after reaching a new all-time high at $41,940. Following Bitcoin’s Jan. 7 push above $40,000, the top cryptocurrency faced selling pressure that saw the price dip as low as $36,600. As has been the case throughout the current rally, investors quickly purchased the dip and BTC price rallied to a new all time high at $41,940 on Jan.8.Market sentiment continues to improve as institutional investor inflow to cryptocurrencies continues to rise. As reported by Cointelegraph, Grayscale Invesetments CEO Michael Sonnenshein says that pension funds have begun to utilize the Grayscale family of funds to invest in Bitcoin.CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer pointed out that the rise of cryptocurrencies comes as the price of gold continues to face pressure, indicating that the mainstream narrative regarding Bitcoin and digital assets is beginning to shift.While its difficult to ascertain how long Bitcoin price can maintain its current bullish momentum, it is clear that with each dip, institutional and retail investors are vigorously purchasing and pushing the price to new highs.After setting new all-time highs on Jan. 7, the S&P 500, NASDAQ and Dow showed less strength today as it became clear that the stimulus bill many were expecting from U.S. lawmakers still faces significant roadblocks.The major indices all fell under early selling pressure but each was able to mount a recovery to close the day in the black. The S&P 500 closed with a 0.55% gain, while the NASDAQ and DOW ended the day up 1.28% and 0.18% respectively.While Bitcoin has traded in a range between $36,660 and $42,000 over the past 24-hours, altcoins are facing increasing sell pressure.As the weekend approaches, the selling pressure has begun increasing across the board, indicating the possibility of further pullbacks as the market looks to establish a new trading range.If Bitcoin price finds support or enters a consolidation phase, altcoins tend to move higher, so intra-day traders will likey keep a close eye on BTC’s price action.Ether price (ETH) is currently down 2.3% and trading at $1,194, while Polkadot (DOT) and Stellar Lumens (XLM) both dropped more than 6% and are trading at $9.15 and $0.289 respectively.The overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $1.05 trillion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 70.5%."
53,"Bitcoin's (BTC) price momentum recently pushed the asset to almost $42,000 per coin. It has more than doubled in price over the past two months, breaking the previous record highs that it set back in 2017. Podcaster Nathaniel Whittemore recently gave his opinion on methods of spotting a macro bull market top for the digital currency.“There isn’t really a macro top, in the sense that the conditions align so well with the narrative,” Whittemore, host of a podcast called The Breakdown, told Cointelegraph. He added:Following a price bottom in March, Bitcoin rebounded faster than the United States stock market, which suffered similar decline. After completing its third-ever halving event in May, the asset trended sideways at times throughout the summer, but its overall macro trend carried an upward lean. BTC’s price momentum increased in 2020’s latter months, in line with a number of large companies allocating capital to the digital asset.The U.S. economic scene also plays into the equation. The government has worked on a number of stimulus packages, and has printed a significant amount of dollars.Previous macro Bitcoin bull markets have come with price corrections amid a grander bullish outlook. Local tops refer to shorter-term price summits occurring prior to corrections within such a macro landscape. “A more local top could come if people get nervous that it’s just too frothy and overheated with new retail investors coming in,” Whittemore said. “That hasn’t happened yet but seems starting (ie see Coinbase jumping to #25 on Apple free apps).”Just eight days into the new year, Bitcoin has already risen more than 40%, based on TradingView.com data. “The speed of the ascent is pretty dizzying - no denying that,” Whittemore explained, adding:Bitcoin has a capped maximum supply of 21 million coins, giving it a built-in scarcity aspect. Be that as it may, the asset is still less than 15 years old, with its value worth what people will pay for it, similar to gold, as Mark Cuban has previously posited. Some experts, such as financial commentator Peter Schiff, still remain skeptical of the asset, calling it a bubble."
54,"Bitcoin (BTC) again rose to a new all-time high on Friday as bulls continued to buy on every minor dip. As the price reached a new high, Bitcoin’s market capitalization soared above $775 billion, taking it past Facebook’s market cap, according to the website Companies Market Cap. This means, there are only six companies in the world that currently have a greater market cap than Bitcoin. The pace of the rally seems to have caught several traders off guard. Popular analyst flibflib told Cointelegraph that the sustained rise points to “accumulation algorithms and that accumulation algorithms seldom care about the price when their goal is to invest X$ in Y time period.”The bull market has attracted huge trading activity that has smashed all previous volume records. Along with the spot markets, Bitcoin futures trading volume has also surged, hitting over $97 billion in a 24-hour period, according to data from Skew.Traders must keep in mind that when the market reverses course, there will be a lot of selling to deal with and that could result in a sharp correction. On the way to new all-time highs, the market did not stop at resistance levels and during the fall, these same support levels may prove useless. Therefore, traders must follow their money management principles and not be blinded by greed.Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot any topping patterns or levels where the markets may reverse direction.The long tail on today’s candlestick suggests that bears tried to start a pullback but the bulls thwarted their attempt and purchased the intraday dip. The trend has been so strong that there hasn’t been a consecutive three-day correction since Dec. 12.The vertical rally of the past few days has pushed the relative strength index (RSI) deep into the overbought territory but that has not lowered the demand from the bulls.The BTC/USD pair could next rally to $45,000 and if that resistance is scaled, the uptrend could extend to $50,000. This psychological level could offer stiff resistance and that may result in a correction.On the downside, the first support is the 20-day exponential moving average ($30,539). A strong rebound off this support will keep the uptrend intact.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the decline could deepen with the next support at the 50-day simple moving average near $23,218.Ether (ETH) made a long-legged Doji candlestick on Jan. 7, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears about the next directional move. That uncertainty resolved to the downside today and the bears pulled the price down to $1,063.322.However, the bulls aggressively purchased the dip resulting in the formation of the long tail on the day’s candlestick.If the bulls can push the price above $1,288.668, the ETH/USD pair could rally to $1,420. The bears may try to pose a stiff challenge at this level but if crossed, the momentum could pick up and the pair could rise to $2,000.Conversely, if the price turns down from the current levels and plummets below $1,063.322, the pair may drop to the 20-day EMA ($886).XRP is the only major cryptocurrency that has not participated in the ongoing bull run. Traders sensed an opportunity and pushed the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.30) on Jan. 7, but selling near the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level is preventing the price from pushing above $0.358202.The bears are currently trying to sink the price below the 20-day EMA. This suggests that the sentiment on the XRP/USD pair remains negative, and traders are selling on rallies. The pair could now remain range-bound between $0.169 and $0.385.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push the price above $0.385, it will suggest that the downtrend is over. That may result in a rally to the 50-day SMA ($0.45).Litecoin (LTC) formed a Doji candlestick pattern on Jan. 7, suggesting profit-booking by traders near the stiff overhead resistance at $180. The bears sensed an opportunity to stall the uptrend and attempted to trigger a correction today.However, the bulls are in no mood to relent and they aggressively purchased the dip today, as seen from the long tail on the candlestick. If the LTC/USD pair climbs above the stiff overhead resistance at $180, the LTC/USD pair could rally to $200.The RSI remains in the overbought territory, suggesting that the bears may again try to raise a roadblock at $180. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($138).A strong rebound off the 20-day EMA will suggest that the trend remains bullish, but a break below it will increase the possibility of a deeper correction.The bulls attempted to extend the uptrend on Jan. 7, but the bears aggressively sold above $0.340. Cardano (ADA) corrected to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.2614241 today, where buying emerged.The long tail on today’s candlestick shows that traders are using the dips to accumulate as the sentiment remains bullish. If the bulls can thrust the price above the overhead resistance, the ADA/USD may resume the uptrend and rally to $0.40 and then to $0.50.However, if the bears again successfully defend the overhead zone, the pair may remain range-bound between $0.26 and $0.35 for a few days. A break below $0.26 could start a deeper correction to the 20-day EMA ($0.21).Polkadot (DOT) attempted to resume the uptrend on Jan. 7, but traders booked profits at higher levels. The bears tried to start a correction, but the altcoin bounced off $8.7788 today, from just above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $8.5515.The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest an advantage to the bulls. The DOT/USD pair may again rise to $10.68. If the bulls can thrust the price above this resistance, the uptrend may resume with the next target objective at $12.39 and then $15.However, if the pair turns down from the overhead resistance, that could result in a few days of consolidation. A break below $8.5515 and the 20-day EMA ($7.92) may indicate the start of a deeper correction.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) formed a long-legged Doji candlestick pattern on Jan. 7, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears about the next directional move. The bears pulled the price down today, but they could not sustain the lower levels, as seen from the long tail on the day’s candlestick.If the price again turns down from the $497 to $515.35 overhead resistance zone, it will suggest traders are booking profits at higher levels. That could keep the BCH/USD pair range-bound between $370 and $500 for a few more days.However, the upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest bulls are in command. If they can push the price above the resistance zone, the pair may start a new uptrend with the first target at $640.The long wick on the Jan. 6 and 7 candlestick shows that traders booked profits at higher levels. However, the bulls continue to buy at lower levels, as seen from Stellar Lumens’ (XLM) bounce off the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.266547 today.After the large range days of the past few days, the XLM/USD pair may enter a few days of consolidation as traders digest the recent gains and decide on the next course of action.If the bulls can push the price above $0.409, the pair could resume the uptrend that may reach $0.50.On the contrary, if the price slips and sustains below $0.266547, the pair may drop to the 61.8% retracement level at $0.232828 and then to the 20-day EMA ($0.19).Chainlink (LINK) turned down from the $17.7777 overhead resistance on Jan. 7, and that attracted profit-booking by short-term traders who dragged the price down to the 20-day EMA ($13.54) today.The upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive zone suggest bulls have the upper hand. Thus, traders used the dip to aggressively buy at lower levels, resulting in a long tail on today’s candlestick.If the bulls can propel the price above $17.7777, the LINK/USD pair could rally to $20.1111. If this level is also scaled, then LINK price could extend toward $25.However, if the bears successfully defend the overhead resistance once again, then the pair may consolidate between $14 and $17.7777 for a few days. A break below the moving averages will signal that bears are back in the game.The candlesticks of the past few days show long tails, which indicate traders have been booking profits at regular intervals. Although dip buyers have continued to push Binance Coin (BNB) higher, the up-move lacks conviction.If the momentum does not pick up within the next few days, the BNB/USD pair will be at risk of a correction or consolidation. A break below the 20-day EMA ($37.93) will be the first sign of a possible deeper correction.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can drive the price above $45, the pair could rally to $50, where the bears may try to stall the uptrend.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

55,"Grayscale’s newly appointed CEO, Michael Sonnenshein, told Bloomberg Thursday that pension funds and endowments are investing actively into the Grayscale family of funds.He explained:Grayscale has been at the center of the Bitcoin (BTC) buying spree and now holds roughly 3% of the BTC in circulation. The fund manager continues to accumulate large positions in the digital asset as more institutional investors seek exposure to Bitcoin. Its total assets under management, or AUM, have eclipsed $27 billion across 10 different products. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust remains by far its most popular product, with over $23 billion in AUM. Grayscale’s Ethereum trust is currently valued at around $3.6 billion, while its Digital Large Cap Fund holds nearly $339 million.01/07/21 UPDATE: Net Assets Under Management, Holdings per Share, and Market Price per Share for our Investment Products.

Total AUM: $27.4 billion$BTC $BCH $ETH $ETC $ZEN $LTC $XLM $XRP $ZEC pic.twitter.com/Z3Q1EZXGegPension funds are following a hoard of institutional buyers that began entering the Bitcoin market in 2020. A survey conducted by Fidelity Investments last year found that 36% of financial institutions across the United States and Europe said they own cryptocurrencies or derivatives. Over one-quarter of the respondents reported holding Bitcoin, while 11% said they own Ether (ETH).The institutional influx into cryptocurrency and Bitcoin is intensifying, according to Grayscale Investments, with pension funds and endowments among the most recent entrants into the space. Grayscale's aggressive BTC buying is likely contributing to the digital currency's rapid price appreciation. With more Bitcoin taken out of circulation, the already scarce asset is becoming even more difficult to come by. Sonnenshein explained:"
56,"Famous for its volatility, Bitcoin’s price constantly waffles both north and south. While it recovered quickly from its pandemic-induced drop in March 2020, going on to break record highs, that doesn't mean the asset is bulletproof against a similar event in the future. The director of business development for smart chain platform Komodo, Jason Brown, recently weighed in on what could possibly cause another COVID-19-style price decline for Bitcoin (BTC).“I think such a scenario is unlikely given the current uptrend in institutional adoption,” Brown told Cointelegraph. “On the other hand, we couldn’t have predicted that COVID would have caused such an abrupt crash and short-term bear market followed by the subsequent bull run that started in the summer of 2020.”March 2020 saw Bitcoin plummet 50% inside 48 hours alongside similar slides in other traditional markets. Since then, a number of mainstream giants, such as MicroStrategy and MassMutual, have unveiled massive U.S. dollar allocations to Bitcoin. MicroStrategy, in particular, under its CEO Michael Saylor, has become a big proponent of Bitcoin, in part as an act against inflation. “Institutions clearly have a long-term HODL mindset and aren’t speculating,” Brown said.Plans can change, however, when people or companies need to spend capital to stay afloat. “The potential challenge is what happens if the institutions themselves go under, even if it’s related to factors outside of the current crypto market,” Brown explained.Given Bitcoin’s recent advancement past $41,000, buying now means buying into all-time high prices. Big players loading up on crypto are doing so at higher than average price levels, Brown explained. “This means we could see a scenario in which an institution is in a financial crunch if crypto prices are declining or stagnant, and thus they decide to sell below market averages,” Brown said, adding:Bitcoin’s 2018 bear market saw prices fall from $17,000 down to below $4,000."
57,"As the price of gold plunged on Friday, CNBC’s Jim Cramer said the rise of crypto may partly explain the sudden disinterest in the precious metal — a potential sign that the mainstream has flipped the script on Bitcoin (BTC) and digital assets. When asked why gold isn’t rallying amid the political chaos on Capitol Hill this week, Cramer said the market is either not as chaotic as it seems or that all of the money is going into cryptocurrency:either it is not as chaotic out there so gold doesn't jump or it's all going to crypto! But remember there has been no flight to quality (treasurys) https://t.co/nExv3O7dRmThe price of gold sold off more than $60 on Friday, hitting a low of $1,852.50 per troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Bitcoin, meanwhile, surged to new all-time highs above $41,000.Cramer is a recent convert to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, having bought the mid-December 2020 dip when BTC was under $18,000. He said of his purchase at the time:If Cramer held onto his BTC, his position has more than doubled by now.The flagship cryptocurrency continues to outperform gold and every other major asset thanks in part to an influx of new institutional buyers. Measured in bullion, 1 Bitcoin is now worth more than 20 ounces of gold. A week earlier, the Bitcoin-gold rate was around 15 ounces.The idea that Bitcoin is taking market share from gold is nothing new. A recent analysis from JPMorgan Chase concluded that Bitcoin’s digital gold narrative is pulling investors away from precious metals. The analysts said this trend could intensify as more institutional money pours into the crypto space."
58,"On Dec. 8, exactly one month ago, Bitcoin was hovering around the $18,700 range, with many analysts debating as to whether the flagship asset would be able to sustain its bullish momentum and cross its all-time high value close to $20,000. Well, how quickly things have changed since then because within a period of just 30 days, Bitcoin (BTC) has repeatedly scaled up to new ATHs, even surpassing the $41,000 barrier.Over the course of the last seven days, BTC has exhibited a substantial growth of around 41%, with the digital asset seemingly breaking new ground with each passing day. However, this has led to investors becoming increasingly nervous since there are many who immediately are given flashbacks of the 2018 crash that resulted in most cryptocurrencies crashing hard within a matter of days.In this regard, Cointelegraph Markets contributor Michaël van de Poppe believes that while 2020 was an amazing year for crypto, everyone should brace for a “healthy correction” in the near future. That being said, for many, that can serve as an opportunity like no other because there is an increasing population of budding crypto enthusiasts who now want a piece of the action, and not just Bitcoin. On the matter, van de Poppe opined: “The higher Bitcoin goes, the more money comes into the market and more money can flow towards altcoins.”The reasons for Bitcoin’s momentum are manifold, starting with the fact that the industry as a whole had been in a prolonged bear market all through 2018 and 2019, but despite the slumps, accumulation had never really stopped.Another often overlooked narrative is related to the recent BTC halving, as time and again, historical data has indicated that approximately four to six months after every cycle, the value of the premier digital currency takes a sharp upward turn — something that has happened this time around as well.Not only that, but the digital asset seems to be right on track with the stock-to-flow model, which was created by Dutch institutional investor PlanB. According to the S2F model, scarcity is used as the defining metric to quantify the value of Bitcoin. And while most people use the setup to assess BTCs future valuation, PlanB claims that the S2F model can also be used in relation to gold and silver, as well as other assets.#Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow model on track .. like clockwork pic.twitter.com/x7o8mwbzj7Ben Zhou, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bybit, confirmed that it’s the “institutional inflow fueling Bitcoin,” adding that there is now a level of consensus, or at the very least, peer pressure among certain corners of the institutional world to have Bitcoin in their portfolio: “Certainly, those that have a younger clientele feel the need to increase their exposure to BTC.”Omar Chen, CEO of the ZB.com exchange, believes that institutional buying has simply served as a catalyst for Bitcoin and has not been the primary driver for its bullish momentum. He told Cointelegraph that investors, both from the traditional and the crypto sectors, are in fact on the lookout for alternative safe havens, pointing toward gold and its rally during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic:“As people and institutions learn more about its attributes and benefits, Bitcoin has become another haven of choice for money. Combined with the recent spate of negative news about COVID-19 vaccines, investors are increasingly losing faith in traditional finance and the global economic recovery, making the bullish case for Bitcoin even louder.”As Bitcoin marches on, even crossing the $41,000 threshold, there is no denying that the surge has also seen a number of prominent altcoins soar to new heights. In this regard, over the course of the past week, Ether (ETH), Stellar (XLM) and Cardano (ADA) have showcased prominent gains of 70%, 128% and 70%, respectively.But will the financial destiny of the market’s top-10 altcoins always be linked to Bitcoin? So far, the value of ETH and Litecoin (LTC) have continued to showcase heavy correlation with BTC whenever the latter witnesses any major market movement. However, Ether may be coming into its own as an independent asset, even though it has yet to break past its 2018 ATH of $1,448.Thor Chan, CEO of digital asset exchange AAX, opined that even though the term “alt season” is often used whenever Ether or some other altcoins start to surge, its meaning has changed over time. He pointed to the 2017 market when everything had to do with an explosion in innovation around initial coin offerings and about people “getting rich as quickly as possible.” Since then, he believes the market has evolved greatly: “Now, the growth in altcoins is more about portfolio diversification, risk management and rebalancing as traders realize their Bitcoin profits.”It is worth recognizing that most altcoins, barring a few such as ETH, still largely fall outside the radar of institutional interest. However, with Bitcoin being promoted the way it has been, many mid- to large-scale investors might be looking at ETH and other prominent alts as potential candidates for the next wave of adoption. In this regard, Jay Hao, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange OKEx, highlighted to Cointelegraph:“It is natural that there will be some spillover into other cryptocurrencies with Ethereum being the first in line as a well-established and long-term project in the industry. While BTC most certainly has the strongest brand recognition, Ethereum has not gone unnoticed, being used by the largest FSIs like JPMorgan and Santander.”He further noted that Ether has very strong fundamentals and, as a result, has piqued the interest of serious institutional investors, such as TD Ameritrade and Arca Labs. Not only that, but Ethereum is the platform of choice for many cryptocurrency projects and has been behind the huge DeFi momentum that took off in earnest last year.Hao believes that while Bitcoin has effectively been given the green light, as has Ether to a certain degree, from institutional investors, the same cannot be said for all other cryptocurrencies: “I don’t believe that we can say with confidence that the alt season will be as large or as long as the previous, as the majority of the institutional dollars are still flowing into BTC.”While the narrative of “Bitcoin being a bubble” is yet to play out, there are still those from the traditional finance sphere who continue to reiterate the statement as a mantra, hoping that their anti-crypto sentiments do come true at some point.For example, just last month, renowned economist David Rosenberg told Bloomberg that he believes Bitcoin is in a bubble and investors don’t understand how its supply works, adding: “Everybody seems to believe that we’re going to get to that 21 million cap on the supply constraint, but there’s really nothing in the protocol to suggest that the supply of Bitcoin can’t go up once we hit that limit.”Related: New Bitcoin price highs revive old misconceptions about BTC and cryptoAs a wise man once said, “Facts don’t care about your feelings,” as is highlighted by the fact that the crypto industry is seeing unprecedented institutional demand for Bitcoin, especially with the entrance of many key players, such as MicroStrategy, Guggenheim, SkyBridge Capital, Square and PayPal into the space. Additionally, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has recently given U.S. banks the authorization to treat public blockchains as another form of settlement infrastructure and also allowed for banks to offer custody services of digital assets.When it comes to altcoins, the world’s largest financial derivatives exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange group, has finally announced its plans to launch a new ETH futures product in early 2021. As a result of this development, come February, traders will have the opportunity to speculate on Ether’s future monetary valuation using a fully regulated setup.The offering, referred to as the CME CF Ether Reference Rate, will help expose crypto to a wide array of investors, traders and investors, allowing for better price discovery and, eventually, increased adoption within institutional circles."
59,"Coinbase is under the microscope with Bitcoin's (BTC) price surges past $41,000 following a minor retrace after topping $40,000 on Thursday.The United States-based crypto exchange is known for experiencing serious connectivity issues during periods of peak trading activity. Indeed, these disruptions have reportedly prevented traders from taking advantage of price gains and dips, robbing them of profit-taking and reentry opportunities.As Cointelegraph recently reported, Coinbase has acquired Routefire, a platform for enhanced trade execution, as part of an effort to better handle periods of peak crypto trading activity.As of press time, Coinbase has yet to report any connectivity issues across its exchange platforms. According to its status page, the company identified and fixed the root cause of the service disruption experienced on Thursday.Coinbase is not the only major exchange to suffer issues during Bitcoin price rallies. Binance also routinely goes offline when BTC prints major price gains. Commenting on the problem back in December 2020, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao remarked that 5% Bitcoin price gains are often accompanied by a 30-times increase in trading volumes, which can cause significant latency issues on the platform.Bitcoin's surge above the $41,000 price mark puts BTC among the top 10 global assets, with a market capitalization exceeding tech conglomerates like Facebook and Tencent. Above Tesla, Bitcoin will need to exceed the $1 trillion market capitalization milestone to overtake the likes of Google and Amazon.At the current market price, Bitcoin is up more than 40% year-to-date and has increased almost fourfold since this same time in 2020."
60,"Bitcoin (BTC) returned to $40,000 on Jan. 8 as another price consolidation period ended characteristically briefly.Data from Cointelegraph Markets, Coin360 and TradingView showed BTC/USD quickly rise to recapture the psychologically significant price level during trading on Friday.After a 9% fall following runs to all-time highs the day before, Bitcoin managed to stay lower only for a matter of hours before bullish momentum returned. Thereafter, the largest cryptocurrency not only matched its all-time highs but delivered a new one: $40,087.""Seems we only dump to shake out the weak hands these days,"" a popular social media trader summarized on the day.Bitcoin also beat the market cap of Chinese giant Tencent and briefly passed ""darling"" tech firm Tesla as it rose to $41,000 per coin.Data from CoinMarketCap and Companies Market Cap confirmed that on Jan. 7, Bitcoin almost entered the top five companies by market cap. As BTC/USD crossed the $40,000 mark, Bitcoin's market cap grew to unprecedented levels, topping out at $745 billion. A day later, following a correction, the figure retreated to $737 billion before regaining its earlier record.At the same time, Tesla delivered a swift 7.3% daily gain, allowing it to outpace Bitcoin once again after losing its market cap prowess to the cryptocurrency for a short period. On Friday, the company was at $773 billion as Bitcoin once again sailed through $40,000.A more decisive victory came over Chinese tech giant Tencent, however, which at $716 billion firmly bowed to Bitcoin's momentum. Previously, Tencent was also worth more than Tesla.As Cointelegraph reported, Tesla had likewise outperformed against stocks and cryptocurrency in 2020, beating even Bitcoin's performance versus its March lows. A look at Tencent's stock growth meanwhile underscores the slow pace of gains that characterized other stocks compared with cryptocurrency.""There are still companies in the world that are worth more than #Bitcoin. Crazy,"" Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini exchange, commented on the phenomenon."
61,"Bitcoin (BTC) is not far from a blow-off top price implosion but investors are ""aggressively"" buying the dip.Speaking to Cointelegraph on Jan. 8, popular analyst Filbfilb revealed that Bitcoin was due a corrective phase given the pace of recent gains.On Thursday, BTC/USD exceeded $40,000 before a spectacular reversal saw a $2,200 drawdown in under five minutes. Thereafter, fresh attempts to flip $40,000 to support were met with rejection, and publication-time levels circled $38,400.With market participants keen to know what will come next, Filbfilb told Cointelegraph that a new style of buying was fuelling repeated all-time highs. As with any market, however, vertical gains cannot last forever.""Bitcoin has continued to make increasingly smaller consolidations after failed sell off attempts. This points to a climatic conclusion at an increased probability in terms of time. I don't think we are far from a blow off top, but how high that could go is anyone's guess,"" he said.This automated trading style itself points to a new class of investor needing to enter the market with larger amounts, rather than the casual manual exposure which characterized the 2017 rush to $20,000.""It was more that there are still obvious signs of accumulation algorithms and that accumulation algorithms seldom care about the price when their goal is to invest X$ in Y time period,"" Filbfilb added.At $40,000, meanwhile, a single Bitcoin passed the value of the United States median annual salary for the first time.The largest cryptocurrency's 2021 gains alone were in excess of 42% at Thursday's peak of $40,400, with the pullback that followed amounting to around 9% losses. While analysts retained the possibility of further corrections, the mood on Friday was firmly bullish.""The entire bull cycle we're experiencing now will be way larger than anyone is expecting it to end too,"" Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe told Twitter followers.Statistician Willy Woo also noted the lack of references left on the Bitcoin spot chart to calculate resistance, given the latest all-time highs. Only Fibonacci sequences remained.""When there's no historic resistance levels, magic numbers in nature is all we have for support and resistance bands. Bitcoin is in unrestrained price discovery in uncharted territory, literally,"" he wrote."
62,"Bitcoin’s meteoric rally to $40,000 has seen it smash its previous all-time high for ""real"" volume by roughly 100%.On Thursday, Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan shared a chart showing that weekly spot volume has surged to double its previous high, according to Messari’s “real volume” metric, with more than $60 billion worth of BTC changing hands over the past seven days.Messari’s “real” volume metric was launched to aggregate and adjust the volumes of the top exchanges it believes report legitimate activity: Binance, Bitfinex, Bitflyer, Bitstamp, Bittrex, Coinbase Pro, Gemini, itBit, Kraken and Poloniex.The metric was updated in May 2020 to include an adjusted score for top Asian exchanges including Huobi, OKEx, Gate.io, Bithumb, UpBit, CoinOne and Liquid using an adjusted score based on information provided by 10 third-party crypto data aggregators. It also includes a 50% adjustment to the reported volume from Korean and Chinese platforms.At the time of writing, more than $67 billion in BTC had changed hands this week, according to the metric.The previous real volume record was posted during mid-2019, when weekly volume exceeded $32 billion as the price briefly reclaimed the five-figure price-range after sinking below $4,000 at the start of that year.Other crypto data providers are also reporting record volumes for BTC, with CoinMarketCap estimating that more than $85 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) changed hands in the last 24 hours alone, while CoinGecko reported $77 billion in daily trade.According to Skew, Bitcoin futures contracts have produced more than $97 billion in 24-hour trade.Greenspan said markets were seeing ""monster volumes."""
63,"Bitcoin’s meteoric price rise is showing no signs of slowing down, and its latest all-time high has priced the asset higher than a 20-ounce gold bar.Over the past six hours, Bitcoin (BTC) prices topped $40,000 briefly, according to Tradingview.com. The move has added a further 5% over the past 24 hours, and the rally is showing no signs of cooling down yet.Industry observers often call Bitcoin ""digital gold,"" as it is a store of value asset, and this latest price peak pushed prices higher than those for the standard 20-ounce gold bar.At the time of writing, gold is currently trading at $1,912 per oz, according to GoldPrice.org, so a 20-ounce bar would set you back $38,240. Bitcoin’s price, taken at the same time, is a little over $39,000.It now takes more than an entire, 20 ounce, gold bar to buy a single #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/B8YsAgyRJLThe secretary and vice chairman of the DigiByte Foundation, Rudy Bouwman, while touting his own cryptocurrency said:This rally is slightly different from the one in 2017, as it is being primarily driven by institutions, which unlike retail traders tend to hold the asset for long-term investment rather than flip it for a short-term profit. This notion enforces the store-of-value properties of Bitcoin, making it more comparable to gold than ever before.In terms of performance, Bitcoin has made a whopping 378% gain over the past 12 months, whereas gold has only managed to gain 21.6% in the same period.Additionally, Bitcoin is still making new all-time highs, but gold prices have retreated 7.6% from theirs, which was $2,070/oz on Aug. 6, 2020.Gold bug and perpetual Bitcoin basher Peter Schiff finally admitted that Bitcoin was actually taking demand away from gold, as evidenced by those figures.With the price of a single Bitcoin now higher than a bar of gold, the question remains: How much further can it climb?"
64,"Reddit’s r/Bitcoin community continues to pull on our heartstrings. On Thursday, a user by the name of “u/Bigtony96” claimed to have sold their entire Bitcoin (BTC) stash to pay off their parents’ mortgage. The Redditor supposedly unloaded a total of 6 BTC accumulated over the past three years to close out the remaining balance on their parents’ home. They said there was enough money left over to cover taxes and, possibly, buy a new car.“Today is the day I've dreamt of for the past several years, and it feels so surreal,” the user said.In the post, u/Bigtony96 explained their motivation for wanting to help their parents, whose restaurant business was ravaged by government lockdown orders:While u/Bigtony96 didn’t specify exactly when the BTC was sold, the sale likely occurred on Thursday, as evidenced by the title of the post: “Just sold to pay off my parents’ mortgage.”Bitcoin’s price surged above $40,000 on Thursday in a remarkable show of force. As Cointelegraph reported, it took BTC less than three weeks to double in price from $20,000.This isn’t the first time Cointelegraph has picked up on intriguing stories from Reddit’s Bitcoin and crypto communities. Earlier this week, Cointelegraph reported that a user sold their free Reddit Moon tokens to make rent after burning through all their savings. Another managed to covert their Moon tokens, which are earned through community engagement, into Bitcoin for huge profits."
65,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high above $40,000 on Jan. 7 after the price increased by more than $5,000 in less than 24-hours.The $40,000 barrier marks a significant milestone for the top-ranked cryptocurrency. According to Matt Blom, head of global sales trading at EQUOS:Blom added that instead of trying to ""pick the top,"" investors should just ""enjoy the ride.""Shortly after Bitcoin surpassed $40,400, it ran into significant selling pressure that saw its price dip back as low as $36,600 before buyers came back in to take advantage of the quick dip in price.Bitcoin’s 24-hour volume has reached a new all-time high of $82.4 billion, and a number of top cryptocurrency exchanges experienced outages and connectivity issues.Traditional markets also saw positive trading as the results of the United States presidential election now appear to be finalized with Democrats controlling the presidency and both houses of Congress.The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and NASDAQ 100 are all higher on the day, up 1.42%, 0.71% and 2.37%, respectively. The 10-year government bond has also firmly risen back above the 1% mark, trading at $1.076 at the time of writing.Bitcoin’s surge above $40,000 increased its dominance rate to 69.1%, but this did not negatively impact altcoin prices. Notable movers of the day included XRP, which has rallied 38.59% to $0.35 over the past 24 hours.Ether (ETH) price also continued to soar higher, setting a new 2020 high at $1,282 as the largest altcoin pursues its $1,400 all-time high.Other notable performers over the past 24-hours include Nano and Yearn.finance's YFI, which have seen increases of 77.33% and 20.93%, respectively.While many analysts continue to call for new daily all-time highs from Bitcoin, crypto trader Scott Melker advised caution, and in private comments to Cointelegraph Melker said:"
66,"During the market downturn in March 2020, Bitcoin (BTC) fell over 50% in value across a two-day period. Traditional financial markets also dropped vastly in March. Although Bitcoin posted a standout recovery, going on to smash all-time price highs, one might wonder what, if any, condition could instigate a similar future drop for crypto’s largest asset. Dermot O'Riordan, partner at venture capital outfit Eden Block, recently gave his thoughts on the matter. “In the short-term Bitcoin’s value prop as a non-sovereign censorship resistant hedge to the dollar is growing stronger by the day,” O'Riordan told Cointelegraph. “Saying that, Bitcoin’s volatility isn’t going away anytime soon, and I expect to see a lot of volatility for years to come from those in the money taking money from the table,” he said, adding:Bitcoin has won over a number of mainstream financial giants, including MicroStrategy, MassMutual, Paul Tudor Jones and others. Such players sank significant cash into the digital store of value in 2020, with the buying trend heating up in the latter portion of the year.Although BTC’s price continues to rise, recently breaching $40,000, the asset still has its liabilities. O'Riordan noted Bitcoin’s top two longer-term risks. The first: “How its rough consensus governance mechanism handles questions around the security budget of the protocol if fees don’t rise sufficiently to supplement ever reducing Bitcoin issuance,” he explained. The second he labeled as “the risk of the institutionalisation of Bitcoin hindering the trustless base layer.”Bitcoin has overcome substantial adversity over the past 12 years, however, each time eventually recovering and resulting in greater adoption."
67,"The year gone by had many ups and even more downs, mainly due to the global outbreak of a devastating virus that has crippled nations and killed millions. But for those in the crypto and blockchain community, 2020 finally showcased the true potential of the technology. There were, arguably, more developments last year that will have long-lasting positive effects on the industry than during the entire history of distributed ledger technology and Bitcoin (BTC). So, here are the top five developments of last year in the decentralized tech sector that will leave a lasting memory and a strong legacy for years to come.Bitcoin price did a lot more than just break the $20,000 price mark that was originally set during the 2017–2018 bull run. First, the $20,000 mark fell. Soon after, so did $30,000. And now, even the $35,000 mark has been taken over.Those seemingly wild predictions of a $45,000 Bitcoin price by the end of 2021 may not be so distant after all. What’s more is that the infamous stock-to-flow model developed by crypto trader PlanB, which predicts a $100,000 price for Bitcoin, is playing out as suggested.So, yes, prices go up, but they can also go down. This has happened before and may happen again, right? In theory, however, many things have changed, not least the general perception of Bitcoin. This has been evidenced by the shift in demand from retail investors to institutional ones.Bitcoin welcomed numerous high-profile companies that joined the industry for their own various needs, from firms choosing to hold BTC as a reserve, like Microstrategy, to the rise of crypto investment funds like Bitwise and Grayscale — and who knows which individuals are investing through those. All that is known is that they are willing to put billions into crypto. And then in late October, the real big news arrived...PayPal, a company that was originally founded with similar fundamental beliefs to Bitcoin itself, not only announced its foray into but actually entered the crypto space in 2020, at least in the United States. Additionally, it has been reported that PayPal is now one of the biggest buyers of Bitcoin as the company builds up reserves to satisfy customer demand.The single word that sums up this development is “adoption.” Some 28 million merchants and over 361 million users all around the world will now be exposed to the “baby” version of owning and using crypto. According to the company, it is the custodian and is essentially just selling shares in its BTC holding. In doing so, it’s not following the traditional way of how people own crypto, and that’s fine.To the average user, crypto is way too difficult to comprehend — all the cold and hot wallets, the passcodes, the 12-word recovery phrases, etc. PayPal is offering an easy-to-use way to get into the ecosystem, and once that happens, some may actually go the full way to discover more about how this technology should be utilized.The Bitcoin halving was touted to be the big make-or-break moment for the crypto industry. It took place, yet not much actually happened. Various commentators expected BTC’s price to pump then crash, while others foresaw a drop-off in the network hash rate. Although those things did happen to a certain extent, it was nowhere near as dramatic as expected, and that was a very good thing.The Bitcoin mining reward halving is an event that happens roughly every four years and cuts in half the amount of BTC that miners earn for discovering a block. This is a hard rule coded into the blockchain that limits the supply to just 21 million BTC and, in doing so, mimics gold’s finite supply.Ultimately, the fact that Bitcoin’s price and fundamentals remained almost unaffected has led some to believe that the industry has reached a certain level of maturity. Perhaps this resilience was what ultimately led some of the biggest corporations, economists and investors to reconsider their stance on cryptocurrencies in general. The fact that the supply of Bitcoin is running out became even more apparent as the year went on.It’s now in fashion for companies to go public, so it’s great to see that some crypto-native companies such as Coinbase are also joining in on the fun. It was half expected that such a move would come soon due to the overall regulation-open approach employed by the company, which was clearly set to appease U.S. regulators when the time was right.What the move means, in essence, is that traditional investors will be able to sink millions into Coinbase equity — as much as $28 billion, in fact, according to Messari. The draft of the listing was also carefully timed with the jump in the price of top cryptocurrencies, and this will hopefully play into the exchange’s hands as it will no doubt face intense scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission.Ultimately, Coinbase can shine light into a dark alleyway leading up to mass adoption by investors and users alike. Other so-called “unicorns” may follow its example in 2021, so in a way, Coinbase is sticking its neck out. But it may pay off if they are granted the initial public offering and become the first truly major crypto company to do so.Bitcoin has investors, and Ethereum has its users, and the latter certainly stepped up in 2020 to make the decentralized finance boom a reality, finding use cases for all those decentralized applications that had been touted to change the game for some time.All was calm before the month of July when it was announced that a highly anticipated project by the name of Compound launched its own token, COMP. It proved to be an instant hit, securing numerous listings on high-profile exchanges and establishing a new trend in DeFi.The basic methodology behind Compound is simple: The platform acts as a decentralized lending protocol that pays interest to users that add their crypto to the pool. However, once funds are added to the pool, the platform issues an equivalent amount of cTokens that can be used as collateral on a loan, meaning that one token of any kind can be used twice.As COMP’s price started to pump, it wasn’t long before other projects caught on to this new trend and began to unveil competing protocols or projects that supported the ecosystem. Just over one month later, Yearn.finance was launched and took the yield farming phenomenon to a whole new level.Then came the decentralized exchange Uniswap, which also joined in on the action by opening up its own pools, and with its open listing policy, countless DeFi projects flocked in to list their tokens on the exchange. However, it also made an impact through its use of automated market makers, an idea developed in 2017 by Bancor. 2020 was really the year that AMAs took off through driving users to make transactions in tokens that are built upon the Ethereum blockchain. This ultimately brought thousands of active users onto the Ethereum network.What’s more is that the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade was finally initiated after several lengthy delays. The combination of Eth2, the recently renewed interest in altcoins and the DeFi boom has certainly brought back interest in Ethereum and the Ether (ETH) token itself, propelling it to well over $1,200, a level not seen in almost two years, and close to its all-time high of around $1,450. Now, just seven days into the new year, some are certain that $2,000 will be coming fairly soon."
68,"Equos, a Singapore-based digital currency exchange operated by Diginex, has announced the launch of a new Bitcoin (BTC) futures product without any settlement dates, marking a substantial leap in the BTC derivatives market.The firm introduced the BTC Perpetual Futures Contract on Thursday, a product it says is “well suited to the current trading environment.” The perpetual contract is geared toward professional traders with various risk profiles, with prices and liquidity provided by independent market makers.The exchange claims that its new BTC contract is backstopped by its liquidity reserves, which are partially funded through fees and trading revenue.Unlike traditional futures products, a perpetual futures contract doesn’t have a fixed expiry or settlement date, which means the user can hold the position for as long as they wish. Perpetual contracts on Bitcoin are currently offered by BitMEX, one of the largest crypto derivatives platforms.Richard Byworth, CEO of Diginex, said the new futures contract is intended to bring wider functionality to the crypto derivatives market, a move he said will “facilitate wider institutional and professional trader adoption of cryptoassets.”He continued:The Bitcoin futures market has exploded over the past few quarters, highlighting the growing institutional uptake of the digital asset. Equos has claimed that crypto derivatives grew at over four times the pace of the spot market in the third quarter, reaching a daily volume peak of $67 billion at the end of November."
69,"Bitcoin (BTC) hit $40,000 on Jan. 7 in the latest psychologically significant milestone for cryptocurrency bulls.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView confirmed BTC/USD officially hitting dizzying new highs during trading on Thursday, bringing weekly gains to more than 40%.In just one of various achievements for Bitcoin this year, the largest cryptocurrency conquered bearish prognoses of a retraction after rising rapidly throughout the past 24 hours.As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin’s NVT ratio led signals suggesting that the bull run was far from over, and likely only beginning.According to Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe:""Less than a month after Bitcoin broke through $20k its price has doubled to $40k.  It's now hard for anyone to deny we are seeing the maturation of a whole new asset class, This could be the 'broadband moment' for cryptocurrency - where every company and individual needs to think seriously about how they engage and interact with cryptocurrency,"" added Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, which is the FCA-regulated indices provider used by CME.Barry Silbert, who until today was CEO of asset manager Grayscale, summarized:News of Bitcoin's successes meanwhile radiated beyond cryptocurrency circles, making it onto the radar of finance figures including Holger Zschaepitz, a popular financial commentator and regular contributor to German news publication Die Welt.Mati Greenspan of Quantum Economics suggested that:On the other hand, David Lifchitz, CIO of asset management firm ExoAlpha, added a note of caution. Bitcoin, he argued, was rising too quickly, invoking memories of the dot-com boom.""What is concerning is not the fact that BTC is going higher, it's its velocity (the speed at which it goes...) that is worrisome... definitely in bubble territory, but history has shown that 'markets can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent,"" he told Cointelegraph in private comments.Year-to-date, BTC/USD has delivered returns beaten only by certain altcoins. Currently, Ether (ETH) is up 62% for the year and Stellar (XLM) has rallied 150%. As a result, Bitcoin's dominance index has slid below 70%.In Ether’s case, all-time highs remain right around the corner and some analysts estimate that the top altcoin could rally as high as $2,600 in the short term."
70,"Bitcoin (BTC) continued its habit on Jan. 7 of hitting all-time highs almost every day as bulls took the largest cryptocurrency above $38,000.Data from Cointelegraph Markets, Coin360 and TradingView followed BTC/USD as it took out another hurdle on the way to the psychologically significant $40,000 milestone.On Thursday, gains accelerated, with Bitcoin investors seeing 24-hour returns of 11.5%. Just a week ago at the start of the year, Bitcoin traded at $28,000.As Cointelegraph reported, the largest cryptocurrency, together with Ether (ETH) and a handful of other altcoins, has become the best investment play of 2021, leaving even Tesla stock far behind.TSLA was the winning punt of 2020 since the coronavirus crash in March, with Bitcoin also being beaten by Ether.“The next correction is absolutely going to be painful for all the #FOMO buyers,” Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe warned Twitter followers as Bitcoin reached another new record high of $38,510.In altcoins, meanwhile, a curious renaissance occurred for embattled number-four cryptocurrency XRP.Having previously lost a substantial amount of its value due to legal issues at major stakeholder Ripple, XRP saw a sudden rebirth this week, rising from $0.23 to $0.35 in a single day.For Van de Poppe, $0.35 now represents the make-or-break level for bulls to hold in order to continue their gains, which come despite no real movement in the legal proceedings.“XRP needs to crack this significant resistance zone to be able to continue the upward push. If that doesn't occur, more consolidation is required,” he commented."
71,"Zap, a Lightning Network payments startup backed by Visa through its Fintech Fast Track program, announced on Wednesday the rollout of Strike Global, a payments and remittances app using the Bitcoin layer-two technology.An announcement by CEO Jack Mallers goes in-depth into the differences between standard fiat transfer mechanisms and the Lightning-powered mechanism in Strike Global. Mallers focused on remittances, a multibillion-dollar business that is still largely passed through expensive middlemen.Strike Global is not too unlike traditional fintech apps, but it uses the Lightning Network for settlement. This means that payments can be essentially instantaneous and at a fraction of the cost of traditional payment rails.Strike Global has two types of transfers, depending on the recipient’s location. For countries with a developed banking system, Strike allows users to send payments without going through Bitcoin (BTC) themselves. Strike will automatically withdraw money from the user’s bank account, exchange it into BTC, and then exchange it back into the recipient’s fiat currency and banking system.The system largely piggybacks off the existing Bitcoin exchange infrastructure, which already allows for much cheaper, simpler remittances if users are willing to go through them manually. Since national exchanges are usually integrated with the local banking system, using Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies allows much cheaper conversion rates compared with cross-border banking.For countries without developed banking systems, Strike allows users to hold their money either in Bitcoin or Tether (USDT). The cryptocurrency can then be exchanged into local cash or fiat through ad-hoc solutions like Bitcoin ATMs, LocalBitcoins and others. Strike simplifies many of the exchange processes in the back end to make the experience similar to other fintech apps.The startup partnered with Bittrex to onboard the exchange’s users on Strike and the Lightning Network. In the first quarter of 2021, it expects to complete private and public beta tests, as well as issue Strike Visa cards in the United States. In the second quarter, it expects to launch cards in the European Union and the United Kingdom.The rollout comes as businesses begin increasing the adoption of newer Bitcoin technologies. Kraken has promised to introduce a Lightning integration in 2021, while Binance recently added SegWit address support for Bitcoin."
72,"Amid a long battle over whether or not United States citizens will get their $2,000 stimulus checks to help them to weather the economic repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mike Novogratz has weighed in on what the news could mean for the stock and crypto markets.The CEO of Galaxy Digital spoke to CNBC's Squawk Box amid the surreal image of a Wall Street apparently unfazed by the commotion in the Capitol yesterday. As a Fox News caption had it in real-time yesterday, ""Markets rally as protestors disrupt electoral college vote.""  A further round of stimulus checks at $2,000 each, recently approved by the House of Representatives, could, from Novogratz's perspective, be further good news for the markets. With the Senate now flipped after the runoff election in Georgia, he noted that:""The market's sensing all that,"" Novogratz added. While many working Americans continue to struggle through the economic turbulence and job precarity exacerbated during the 2020 crisis, he pointed to the bullish sentiment among traders of all stripes: This disconnect is likely to, however, spell trouble at some point — even for those cashing in on the crisis. ""You've got to watch for the cracks. One day we'll wake up, and markets will be reversing, and then they'll reverse hard. I just don't know when that is,"" he said.Earlier this week, Novogratz attributed Bitcoin's unprecedented price highs to institutions moving in, pointing to PayPal's servicing of Bitcoin as well as action from big U.S. insurers.  As of press time, the coin is trading at close to $38,000, up almost 8.6% on the day."
73,"The young artist, Keyshawn Butler, confirmed on his Instagram page that his YouTube page had been hacked on 7 January, although he seemed unaware what the channel was being used for. HiiiKey’s channel has around 249,000 subscribers on YouTube.American rapper HiiiKey’s YouTube channel has reportedly been hacked and used to promote a fake Bitcoin and Ethereum giveaway that has stolen over $70,000 from unwitting users. The stream has been active for over 7 hours and is still live as of press time.After gaining control of his channel, the hackers then completely changed the layout of the YouTube page and renamed it to [Ethereum FUND] before removing all other videos on the page. The perpetrators failed to change the details of the ABOUT tab of the channel, which still has HiiiKey’s information and links to social media accounts.The hackers then used the page to upload a livestream on January 7 that was promoting an elaborate Ethereum and Bitcoin giveaway. Given the large amount of subscribers to the channel, there are apparently over 56,000 viewers watching the stream live.The livestream used an old video of Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin talking about the launch of the Beacon Chain and the transition to Ethereum 2.0 before December 2020. The video was overlaid with text promoting a giveaway of 40,000 ETH and 3,000 BTC through a fake website.Users were then offered varying returns through the giveaway, which required ETH or BTC to be sent to specific addresses. Entrants were promised to receive double the amount of cryptocurrency that they sent to the addresses.A quick search of the ETH address given on the website reveals that the hackers have received a total of 39.1 ETH worth around $47,260 at press time. The BTC address has received just over 0.6 BTC which is currently around $22,000.There had been no mention of any giveaways on the official Ethereum Twitter account, or that of Vitalik Buterin. Cointelegraph has also reached out to HiiiKey for comment and has not received a reply at the time of publication.This is not the first time that a high-profile YouTuber’s account has been compromised and used to promote fake cryptocurrency giveaways. In August 2020, hackers gained control of technology reviewer Jon Prosser’s channel and rebranded the page to NASA news.The attackers used a video of Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder Elon Musk to promote a BTC giveaway scam. Fake SpaceX channels netted scammers over $150,000 worth of BTC in 2020.YouTube’s legal team has previously indicated that the platform cannot be held liable for cryptocurrency scams carried out on channels. This was in response to a lawsuit instituted by Ripple in April 2020 over the amount of scam pages impersonating the company and the XRP token."
74,"Bitcoin (BTC) may have hit new all-time highs of $37,600, but one indicator suggests that yet another bull run is incoming.Released in the latest weekly report from Stack Funds, data from Bitcoin's network value to transaction (NVT) ratio still remains firmly bullish.According to analysts at Stack, despite Bitcoin gaining 30% in 2021 already, the gains are far from over. Far from warning that the top is imminent or already here, NVT is reminiscent of the start of a bull run, not the end.""Currently, NVT is trading at the 70 handle, and lies roughly in the middle of the range. This suggests that Bitcoin not in the overvalued territory despite the recent price rally the past few weeks,"" the report summarizes.An accompanying chart highlights a divergence in NVT versus price similar to those which preceded gains in 2017 and 2019. Stack further noted the curious contrast between raging crypto and unimpressive stock markets, which despite lingering at or near all-time highs have failed to produce decisive moves so far this year. As Bitcoin and altcoins gain, however, public consciousness is responding in kind. A glance at Google Trends data shows that interest in the term ""Bitcoin"" worldwide is now at its highest since February 2018.With the trend forecast to hit nearly 70% of the 2017 peak this week, the added interest could in itself perpetuate the bull market thanks to curiosity turning into buy-ins via mainstream on-ramps such as Square's Cash App and Coinbase.Away from retail, meanwhile, statistician Willy Woo noted that high net worth individuals are ""likely"" fuelling much of the demand thanks to Bitcoin getting the seal of approval from institutions.""It's whale spawning season,"" he tweeted on Thursday.A further tweet explained the impetus behind the sudden price gains, amounting to a price war for the dwindling BTC supply.""When you have many buyers competing against each other for the coins, you don't just sit around and wait and let the market come to your low bids. Price premium runs up,"" Woo wrote."
75,"Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to fresh all-time highs on Jan. 7, coming within striking distance of $40,000.Data from Cointelegraph Markets, Coin360 and TradingView showed Bitcoin getting yet another boost overnight on Wednesday as protestors stormed the Capitol in Washington D.C.After showing signs of continuing strength during trading the day before, BTC/USD abruptly headed north, reaching a new peak of $37,800.By press time on Thursday, a subsequent retracement had sent the pair focus on the $37,000 mark, with Bitcoin still within 10% of hitting $40,000.According to the latest updates for order books, significant resistance lay in wait at $38,000, with more selling pressure beginning at $39,500. Support was less decisive above $31,000.“It’s amazing, an amazing year,” Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe summarized in his latest YouTube update.He added that while the current price action was something to be celebrated, a “healthy correction” was now getting more likely.“Would that be bad? No, as the higher Bitcoin goes, the more money is into the markets and the more money can flow towards the altcoins from this perspective,” he continued.As Cointelegraph reported, the end of December was characterized by more funds entering long-term storage, with the remaining available supply subject to what Van de Poppe and others term “FOMOing in” from less experienced buyers.These felt that they should seize the opportunity and buy Bitcoin at higher levels, having had no interest in doing so while Bitcoin traded at $10,000, he noted.Across major altcoins, Ether (ETH) was up 2.3% on the day, hitting $1,180, while embattled XRP put in a surprise move to add 27%.Stellar (XLM) meanwhile continued its march upwards, hitting $0.34 on the back of weekly returns that topped 170%.Bitcoin’s market cap dominance stood at 68.5% on Thursday, down from 69.7% at the start of the week."
76,"Jimmy Donaldson, aka “MrBeast,” a prominent YouTuber boasting 50.2 million subscribers and 8.5 billion total views, now owns a verified Brave browser account — potentially exposing some of his enormous audience to virtual currency.Donaldson is not new to crypto and is believed to have made a considerable amount of money via cryptocurrency investments. The star previously hosted videos discussing crypto before his channel exploded in popularity and he reportedly purchased a $100,000 car using his crypto profits. However, his account was later purged of all content relating to virtual currency.MrBeast also spoke on Keemstar’s podcast about how he almost lost his BTC due to a house break-in, but managed to move the funds to a new wallet. With Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies surging in price, the famous YouTuber appears to be making a return to crypto, by becoming a verified Brave browser publisher. This will allow viewers to tip his channel with BAT tokens — the native Brave browser crypto.Brave, founded by JavaScript creator Brendan Eich, rose in popularity over the last two years — attracting almost 1 million publishers and more than 24 million active monthly users. The browser currently has 528,756 YouTube, 126,740 Twitter, and 69,000 website and Twitch publishers.The addition of MrBeast to Brave’s growing list of publishers has some in the community predicting large price increases for the BAT token. According to Coingecko, BAT tokens are currently trading for $0.254 each, up 9.5% over the past 24 hours.MrBeast is far from the first prominent YouTuber to embrace crypto. In 2019, PewDiePie, who once held the most subscribed channel with more than 100 million subscribers, began hosting his streams on the blockchain video platform Dlive. However, on May 4, 2020, YouTube signed an exclusive deal with him, preventing him from continuing to use Dlive."
77,"The total cryptocurrency market capitalization — a major bellwether for the overall health of the digital asset class — broke $1 trillion for the first time ever at 19:00 ET on Tuesday January 6th. Bitcoin briefly topped $37,000 around the same time, marking a new record high.Measured by market cap, the crypto asset class has virtually doubled over the past month as Bitcoin (BTC) broke out to new all-time highs and Ether (ETH) cleared $1,100 for the first time in three years. Combined, both assets account for roughly two-thirds of the overall market.BTC and Ether’s gravitational pull on the market has seen dozens, if not hundreds, of cryptocurrencies, report double-digit percentage returns this past week.The trillion-dollar capitalization was reached mere days after the market exceeded the highs from the 2017-18 bull market. During the last cycle top in early 2018, the combined market cap hit roughly $830 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.At the time, altcoins peaked near $547 billion after Bitcoin retreated from its Dec 2017 high. The altcoin market is currently worth less than half of that total, underscoring Bitcoin’s sheer dominance so far in the current cycle.Typically, Bitcoin’s bull cycles pave the way for a subsequent altcoin rally, which is often larger than the initial BTC mark-up. Dubbed ‘altseason’ by the crypto community, the parabolic rise in altcoins can happen quickly, leaving investors with little time to prepare. Many crypto observers are forecasting a bullish 2021 for Bitcoin and altcoins. They cite growing institutional demand for BTC, the ubiquity of crypto on-ramps and the natural ebb and flow of four-year market cycles for their optimism. "
78,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) parabolic rally intensified on Wednesday as the price broke above $36,000 for the first time, sending a strong signal that the bull market still has further room to grow.The flagship cryptocurrency peaked at $36,574.47 on Bitstamp, easily surpassing its previous all-time high. The price has gained 8% on the day and more than 25% over the past week.At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $36,367.At the current value, Bitcoin’s market capitalization has grown to $669.2 billion, accounting for roughly 68.3% of the overall cryptocurrency market.Bitcoin’s latest breakout defies warnings that the market could be facing overbought resistance in the near future. An overheated futures market and large liquidations from some of Asia’s largest holders raised the possibility of a short-term pullback.So far, Bitcoin’s digital-gold narrative appears to have squashed any semblance of a major pullback as institutions and retail traders buy the dips. As Cointelegraph recently reported, Bitcoin is experiencing a supply shortage as major buyers like Grayscale and PayPal continue to scoop up all of the newly mined BTC.Bitcoin continues to exert a strong gravitational pull on the broader market, with major altcoins also printing new local highs. Ether (ETH) briefly surpassed $1,200 on Wednesday. Litecoin (LTC), XRP, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and others also saw significant gains. "
79,"Aggressive buying by institutional investors is one of the main reasons for the current Bitcoin (BTC) bull run. Some investors expressed their intent to hold their positions for a few years, but it is also prudent to note that many of these investors have recently developed a love for Bitcoin and their conviction to HODL may not resemble that of the early Bitcoin whales.The current bull market could also differ from the last as institutional investors simply cannot hold on to their positions if Bitcoin unexpectedly enters a sharp correction. These fund managers will have to face angry clients if Bitcoin's performance wanes, thus it's important to keep a level head when considering the lofty price estimates being thrown out by analysts. Bitpay’s chief commercial officer Sonny Singh said in an interview with Bloomberg that if Bitcoin’s rally continues, the institutional investors may be tempted to lock in their gains and are unlikely to HODL for the long term.If that happens, the markets may have to deal with a huge amount of selling, which could result in a sharp fall unless new institutional investors or long-term Bitcoin whales step in and buy.A few metrics such as rising futures open interest and a high funding rate suggest that traders are taking aggressive bullish bets on Bitcoin’s rally continuing. As has occurred in the past, a sharp downturn in Bitcoin price could result in leveraged players facing a massive long liquidation.Therefore, it only makes sense that at this juncture, traders exercise caution and use proper money management principles to protect their paper profits.While Bitcoin’s rally toward $36,000 may have slowed down, several altcoins are skyrocketing. Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the possible target levels on the upside.The long tails on the Jan. 4 and 5 candlesticks suggest that the bears tried to start a correction but the bulls aggressively purchased the dips. Bitcoin has resumed the uptrend today by pushing the price above the previous all-time high at $34,786.04.The next target objective on the upside is $37,000 and if that level is scaled, the BTC/USD pair could rise to $45,000.However, the relative strength index (RSI) remains in overbought territory indicating the risk of a correction. The first support on the downside is the 20-day exponential moving average ($28,213).If the pair rebounds off this support, it will suggest that traders continue to buy the dips and that could keep the uptrend intact.Conversely, if the price breaks below the 20-day EMA, it could result in panic selling that could sink the pair to the 50-day simple moving average ($22,285).Ether (ETH) has resumed the uptrend today as the bulls have pushed the price above the Jan. 4 intraday high at $1,156.456. However, the RSI above 88 suggests that the biggest altcoin is overbought in the short term.If the price does not sustain above $1,156.456, the ETH/USD pair could consolidate in a tight range for a few days before attempting the next trending move.Conversely, if the pair sustains above $1,156.456, it will suggest that the melt-up is likely to continue. In such a case, the pair may rally to $1,260 and then to $1,420.The pair will signal a possible change in trend if the price turns down and plummets below the $840.93 support.While most major altcoins have been surging, XRP has been languishing near its recent lows, suggesting that traders are not aggressively buying at the current levels.The consolidation also suggests that the bears are taking it easy. This lack of interest from the bulls and the bears could extend the range-bound action for a few more days.The next leg of the down move could start if the bears sink the price below the $0.169 support. Such a move could trigger panic selling that may result in a decline to $0.10.On the contrary, a break above the 20-day EMA ($0.30) will be the first sign of strength and the recovery could pick up steam above $0.385.After the large range day on Jan. 4, Litecoin (LTC) formed an inside day candlestick pattern on Jan. 5, which showed indecision among the bulls and the bears. The uncertainty has resolved to the upside and the bulls are currently attempting to resume the uptrend.If the bulls can propel the price above $173.3312, the LTC/USD pair could rally to $180 and then to $200.However, if the price turns down from $173.3312, then the pair could drop to $140 and remain range-bound between these two levels for a few days.A breakdown below the $140 support and the 20-day EMA ($130) may shift the advantage in favor of the bears.Cardano (ADA) is currently in a strong uptrend that has a target objective of $0.40. If this level is scaled, the altcoin could even rally to $0.50. However, the sharp rally since Jan. 3 has pushed the RSI deep into the overbought territory.History suggests that whenever the RSI rises above 80, the ADA/USD pair has witnessed a minor correction or consolidation. Therefore, traders may prepare for a minor pullback in the next few days.If the bulls do not give up much ground and the pair rebounds off the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.2757469, it will suggest that traders are not booking profits in a hurry. The bulls could then attempt to resume the uptrend.Conversely, if the bears pull the price below the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.2552813, it will suggest aggressive profit booking at higher levels and such a move could deepen the correction or keep the pair range-bound for a few days.Polkadot (DOT) recovered from $8.70 on Jan. 4, just above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $8.4507. This shallow correction suggests traders are aggressively buying on every minor dip.If the bulls can thrust the price above $10.5169, the DOT/USD pair could pick up momentum and rally to $12.39 and then to $15.However, if the price turns down from $10.5169, the pair may drop to $8.70 and remain range-bound between these two levels for a few days. A consolidation near the overhead resistance is a positive sign and increases the possibility of the resumption of the uptrend.This positive view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below $8.70. Such a move could pull the price down to the 20-day EMA ($7.59).The bulls did not allow Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to plummet back below the $370 breakout level on Jan. 4 and 5. This shows accumulation by traders at lower levels. The bulls are currently attempting to resume the uptrend.If the bulls can push the price above $467.67, the BCH/USD pair may rally to the stiff overhead resistance at $515.35.The previous two rallies had reversed direction from the $497 to $515.35 resistance zone. Thus this zone is likely to attract aggressive selling by the bears.However, if the bulls can absorb the selling and drive the price above $515.35, it may signal the start of a new bull run.On the contrary, if the price turns down from $467.67, the pair may consolidate between $370 and $467.67 for a few days.Stellar Lumens (XLM) has picked up momentum in the past three days. The altcoin broke above the descending channel on Jan. 05 and soared today, pushing the price above the $0.35 overhead resistance.However, the long wick on the day’s candlestick suggests profit booking above $0.35. The bears will now try to pull the price back below $0.2864. If they succeed, the XLM/USD pair may enter a minor correction.Conversely, if the bulls flip $0.2864 to support, the pair may resume its uptrend. If the price breaks above $0.391, the rally could extend to $0.50.Chainlink (LINK) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($13) on Jan. 4 and the 50-day SMA ($13.07) on Jan. 5, which shows strong buying on dips. The moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover, suggesting buyers are in control.If the bulls can sustain the LINK/USD pair above $16.39, the rally could extend to $20.1111. The bears are likely to defend this resistance aggressively.However, if the bulls do not give up much ground, the possibility of a break above $20.1111 increases and the next target objective on the upside is $25.This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and breaks below the $13.28 support. Such a move will suggest a lack of demand at higher levels.Binance Coin (BNB) made a long-legged Doji candlestick pattern on Jan. 4 and followed it up with an inside day candlestick pattern on Jan. 5 that had a long tail. This suggests that the bears tried to pull the price down but the bulls purchased at lower levels.If buyers can drive the price above $43.2039, the BNB/USD pair may resume the uptrend and rally to $50. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought territory suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside.On the other hand, if the pair again turns down from the overhead resistance level and breaks below $38, it will suggest that the bears have overpowered the bulls. That could result in a correction to $32.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

80,"Newsweek, one of the largest American weekly news magazines, has taken a positive spin on Bitcoin (BTC) in a recent article that explores whether the digital asset can become the new gold standard. The article, which appeared on Wednesday, dissects the digital gold narrative using JPMorgan Chase’s latest model showing a potential BTC price of $146,000. Although the article presents little new information for crypto enthusiasts who have been charting Bitcoin’s meteoric rise, it provides more validation that the mainstream narrative surrounding cryptocurrency has changed.“All that glitters is not gold—but it might be Bitcoin,” wrote Scott Reeves. “And in the long run, it might be more valuable.”That’s the message that appeared before Newsweek’s readership, which is pegged in the tens of millions, many of whom have never been exposed to Bitcoin.Earlier this week, Bitcoin graced the front page of the Financial Times — on the 12th anniversary of genesis block, no less — offering further evidence that the mainstream can no longer ignore BTC.In the meantime, more investors are flooding the market, as evidenced by the sharp rise in active addresses and growing interest from corporations and major institutions.New adopters are entering Bitcoin for the long run, possibly for the next three to five years at least, according to podcaster Peter McCormack. Sonny Singh, BitPay’s chief commercial officer, shares that sentiment, but recently argued that another surge in BTC price could lead to institutional profit-taking.Google search trends suggest that retail FOMO, or fear of missing out, is ramping up in the new year — a potential precursor to higher prices in the short term.Searches for the word “Bitcoin” were tame during last year’s uptrend when compared with the bull market of 2017. Once again, this suggests that Bitcoin’s least resistant path could be higher.It remains to be seen whether retail’s understanding of Bitcoin is improving or whether people are paying attention merely because of price appreciation. In either case, Bitcoin’s value proposition is no longer relegated to obscure and esoteric corners of the internet. "
81,"Bitcoin (BTC) just recently broke through $35,000 as part of a tremendous price rally, in part the result of Bitcoin’s limited supply, according to Diginex CEO Richard Byworth. “Bitcoin is in the process of starting its post halving bull cycle,” Byworth told Cointelegraph, adding:After the COVID-19 pandemic took over headlines in March 2020, the United States government jumped into action, printing mounds of money and releasing various stimulus packages. In the latter half of the year, large mainstream entities began unveiling their Bitcoin purchases, often allocating tens and hundreds of millions to the digital asset.Bitcoin has largely led the show in terms of crypto-asset price action, although Ether (ETH) and others have recently begun to post significant gains as well. “Altcoins will perform extremely well as retail players who feel they have ‘missed bitcoin’ will attempt to find the ‘next bitcoin’ and next 1000x,” the Diginex CEO said, adding:The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, has stepped up its overwatch, filing action against Ripple, calling its XRP asset an unregistered security. Subsequent fears arose in the crypto space, with some wondering if the SEC will go after other assets and projects as well. On a positive note, however, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency recently cleared certain stablecoin activities among banks.What will 2021 hold for Bitcoin and crypto? “As I said, we are at the beginning of the bull cycle, 2021 is going to deliver returns that will likely be shocking for some people,” Byworth said. “Bitcoin will be north of $100k at some point during the year and alts will most likely follow.”With Byworth at the helm, digital-asset infrastructure outfit Diginex went public in October 2020.UPDATE Jan. 7, 20:41 UTC: This article has been updated, clarifying Diginex as a digital-asset infrastructure outfit instead of a blockchain focused one."
82,"Bitcoin (BTC) recently reclaimed $35,000, but top traders at Huobi, OKEx and Binance are not buying the breakout. Unlike the savvy institutional investors who may be desperate for protection against the debasement of fiat, the more crypto-focused investors seem to be waiting for dips.Institutional investors might also be celebrating the Jan. 4 announcement that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will allow banks to include stablecoins in bank-permissible functions. This further validates the crypto sector and may result in a rise in institutional participation in the space.Typically, after a new all-time high is achieved, Bitcoin price pulls back as some traders take profits and bears consider opening short positions near the new ""top.""Crypto-focused traders are well aware of Bitcoin's volatility, and the recent dip to $27,000 serves as a perfect example.To effectively measure how crypto-focused traders have been positioning themselves, investors should monitor the top traders' long-to-short ratio at leading crypto exchanges.Notice how Huobi top traders have been reducing their long positions over the past two days. Meanwhile, Binance top traders have been sitting mostly sideways this entire period.It is worth noting that exchanges gather data on top traders differently, as there are multiple ways to measure clients' net exposure. Therefore, any comparison between different providers should be made on percentage changes instead of absolute numbers.OKEx has been the only exception, as its top-traders metric showed that investors entered short positions as BTC momentarily dumped on Jan. 4, but this trend reverted as the $31,000 support was reestablished. This data indicates that those traders are chasing the market instead of placing bets ahead of the move.Generally speaking, it is safe to conclude that ""top"" traders have not been responsible for the current bull run.Perpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate that is usually charged every eight hours. When buyers (longs) are the ones demanding more leverage, the funding rate turns positive. Therefore, the buyers will be the ones paying up the fees. This issue holds especially true during bull runs, when there is usually more demand for longs.As shown above, the funding rate climbed to an unusually high 5% weekly level on exchange FTX on Jan. 4. Regardless of this oddity, the average 1% weekly funding rate seems exceptionally modest considering Bitcoin's 18% rally over the past six days.At the moment, it’s clear that top traders at major exchanges are not the ones leading the recent buying activity. These short-term traders seem to be waiting for lower entry points, according to their long-to-short position data and the funding rate on derivatives exchanges.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
83,"Famous investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffet called Bitcoin ""probably rat poison squared"" back in 2018. In his 2020 fourth-quarter market letter, financial analyst Bill Miller agreed with Buffett’s description of the asset — but not without his own addendum.“Warren Buffett famously called bitcoin ‘rat poison,’” Miller said in his Saturday letter, adding:Miller started his letter by explaining how each new year often paves the way for various financial predictions. Financial expectations and projections can be worthless, however, as proven by the unexpected COVID-19 pandemic and its ripple effects, according to Miller. Still, projections can be beneficial if the rationale for such predictions is taken into account.That said, Miller went on to analyze the current scene in the United States regarding markets, inflation, interest rates and other points, pointing out the value of comprehending the present landscape as opposed to predictions.He concluded his letter with a paragraph about Bitcoin (BTC), giving a shout out to the coin’s standout results last year. “Its market capitalization is greater than JP Morgan and greater than Berkshire Hathaway and yet it is still very early in its adoption cycle,” Miller said.“The Fed is pursuing a policy whose objective is to have investments in cash lose money in real terms for the foreseeable future,” Miller added, subsequently noting the trend of large mainstream players buying the asset. In 2020, MicroStrategy, MassMutual and several others bought large stacks of Bitcoin. MicroStrategy, in particular, bought Bitcoin in part to escape inflation-induced cash value loss.“Paypal and Square alone are estimated to be buying on behalf of their customers all of the 900 new bitcoins mined each day,” Miller said, adding:Bitcoin has recently soared in price, cracking the $35,000 mark as it continues gaining mainstream adoption."
84,"Bitcoin (BTC) investors are quickly storing most of the available coins away, and they are not for sale, new data at the start of 2021 reveals.Statistics from on-chain analytics resource Glassnode originally released on Dec. 29, 2020 confirm that almost 80% of the Bitcoin supply is illiquid.The changes in the composition of the Bitcoin market have become well known. As new all-time highs above $35,000 emerge, so too has a narrative that weak hands are selling their holdings to strong hands and institutions are buying from whales.This reshaping of the Bitcoin investor profile implies more long-term hodling and less speculative activity, which itself boosts Bitcoin’s image as a worthwhile investment and perpetuates the cycle of hodling and price increases resulting from a liquidity squeeze.For Glassnode, this process has now been quantified. Number-crunching from Rafael Schultze-Kraft, the firm’s chief technology officer, estimates that of the extant Bitcoin supply of 18.6 million BTC, 78% is unavailable.“Only 4.2 million BTC (22%) are currently in constant circulation and available for buying and selling,” he concluded.Glassnode is not the first to voice the belief that investors are fighting over Bitcoin’s fixed supply. Other commentators have previously concluded that a Bitcoin arms race is providing the fuel for one all-time high after another.“Latest buying has been driven by participants who are long term holders. This is bullish, this rally is far from done,” one of them, statistician Willy Woo, commented on Glassnode’s findings.The economics of Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decreasing emission is extensively covered in The Bitcoin Standard, a popular book by Saifedean Ammous. Crucially, as miners receive less and less “new” Bitcoin per block after each block subsidy halving event, Bitcoin’s inflation rate drops — it is currently at 1.8%.Any proposal to change the dynamics of this status quo and thus increase inflation would need full network consensus, and as this would ultimately make every participant poorer, no one has an incentive to agree.Since the Glassnode data was published, meanwhile, BTC/USD has already gained 35%."
85,"Bitcoin price reached a new all-time high at $35,776 on Binance on Jan. 6. Following the explosive overnight uptrend of Bitcoin (BTC), on-chain analysts are generally optimistic about the short-term trajectory. While many agree that the rally is beginning to show signs of overheating, it is not overbought just yet.The major catalyst behind Bitcoin’s strong rally has been the continuous increase in buyer demand on Coinbase. Throughout the past week, Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, saw premiums of around $100. This means that compared with Binance and other major exchanges, Bitcoin has been trading at a higher price on Coinbase. It could indicate a growing demand for Bitcoin from high-net-worth investors and, potentially, institutions.Bitcoin strongly rallied overnight, recording a 10% gain within merely 10 hours. After the latest rally, on-chain analysts have said that BTC likely still has some room to rally further, considering that various on-chain indicators show the market could become more overheated if it follows previous bull cycles.Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst and the creator of Woobull, said the ongoing Bitcoin rally is “warm” but is not overheated just yet. Woo showcased the Bitcoin Network Value to Transactions Ratio, or NVT, price chart with premium, highlighting that the current rally has firepower for another leg up, based on previous peaks in 2013 and 2017.Bitcoin NVT is measured by dividing the market capitalization of Bitcoin by the daily volume of transactions processed on the blockchain in U.S. dollars. The indicator is typically used to determine whether Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued at the given time. Woo said that the higher speculative premium in the spot market, which occurs due to real buyer demand, is another indicator that the rally is not overheated just yet:Analysts at Glassnode found that the MVRV Z-Score indicator is signaling the same levels seen in the 2017 Bitcoin bull market. The MVRV indicator is typically utilized to evaluate whether Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued compared with its “fair value.” If the market cap of Bitcoin is significantly higher than its realized value, which is the valuation of BTC calculated based on where investors buy it, it has historically marked a peak of a rally.Currently, the Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score indicator is still far from indicating a market top in comparison with 2017. Glassnode analysts explained that the MVRV Z-Score indicator reached five and is now at “the levels of the main bull market of 2017.” But the analysts also explained that “In 2017, $BTC made another 10x over the course of 6 months.” Hence, both the MVRV Z-Score indicator and Bitcoin NVT show that BTC has room for a broader rally in the foreseeable future.Alex Saunders, a cryptocurrency analyst, also noted that the volume of Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) on PayPal hit a fresh high at $110 million. Although Google Trends data suggests that retail demand is not at the levels of 2017, it remains high on PayPal:This scenario ultimately comes down to two simple factors: cascading liquidations and slowing institutional accumulation. The Bitcoin futures market has reached a new all-time high in open interest, at over $11 billion. This means that there are more traders betting on the price of Bitcoin than ever before.When futures market open interest is high, the probability of a long or short squeeze rises. A long squeeze is when long contracts or buyers are forced to market sell their positions if the price of Bitcoin drops sharply. They are under pressure because they borrow capital to trade BTC. Hence, when Bitcoin’s price drops to a certain threshold, their positions are liquidated, which turns into selling pressure.The problem occurs when these liquidations happen one after another, causing a cascade. For example, $33,000 is a liquidation threshold for long contracts using 10-times leverage. If the price of Bitcoin drops to that level, it could liquidate another set of long contracts that entered at $34,000, and so on. If this trend continues, then the cascading liquidations could lead to a major correction. Bitcoin is not at risk of cascading liquidations for now, but with open interest at a record-high and the funding rate of the futures market at historic highs, the possibility of it happening is there.Another factor that could cause Bitcoin’s price to correct in the short term is if the institutional accumulation of BTC slows down. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, previously said that he believes Bitcoin will reach a local top once the buyer demand on Grayscale stagnates.An important gauge of institutional sentiment around Bitcoin is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which is often the first point of entry for most institutions in the United States. As such, if inflows into GBTC slow down, it would indicate a declining institutional appetite.In December 2020, Ju said that BTC needs more institutional investors for it to continue rallying without a big correction. Considering this, he emphasized that a pullback could occur when Grayscale BTC holdings do not expand, which would mean fewer institutions are buying BTC, adding: “BTC needs to bring more institutional investors.”Due to the sheer momentum of Bitcoin, both criteria would have to be met in order for Bitcoin to see a sharp correction; institutional inflows into BTC would have to decrease, and cascading liquidations would have to occur in tandem. Whether this will happen anytime in the near term remains uncertain.The biggest chance of this trend forming would be when Coinbase sees lower buyer demand, as its premium declines. So far, the premium on Coinbase is consistently hovering between $100 and $200, which is a positive sign.Atop this, the hash rate of the Bitcoin blockchain network has risen to new record highs. At a point where the fundamentals of Bitcoin are strengthening and the technical momentum is not slowing down, the probability of a deep correction in the short term remains low. Still, cascading liquidations could happen at any given moment, as one big sell order or a sell-the-news event could trigger the liquidation of over-leveraged long contracts."
86,"Bitcoin (BTC) is continuing to rise to new heights above $35,000 on Wednesday as U.S. buyers on Coinbase further drive up the price. But the BTC futures market’s funding rate is also surging alongside futures open interest.The combination of a high funding rate, whales in Asia selling and a record-high futures market open interest raises the chances of a short-term correction.Currently, as Mechanism Capital’s Andrew Kang noted, the aggregated open interest of the Bitcoin futures market is at a new record high. He said:The problem is that the market is overleveraged and overwhelmingly longing Bitcoin. The term longing means buying BTC with borrowed capital in the derivatives market.The funding rate of Bitcoin in the futures market has exceeded 0.15%. On average, the BTC funding rate hovers at around 0.01%, so it is about 15 times higher than the normal rate.Funding is a mechanism that futures exchanges use to find balance in the market. Every eight hours, long or short contract holders have to pay a fee to one another. Longs pay shorts if the market is majority long, and vice versa.If the funding fee is above 0.15%, it means that the market is extremely overheated and the vast majority of the market is longing Bitcoin.This trend raises the probability of a long squeeze, wherein long contract holders are forced to adjust their positions if the price of Bitcoin declines.If the open interest of the market is at an all-time high, the chances of a larger long squeeze further increase.Whales in the Asian market have also been selling large amounts of Bitcoin in the past week. Data from CryptoQuant shows massive inflows of BTC into Bithumb, South Korea’s biggest exchange.Nevertheless, many positive bullish factors remain, including the hash rate. The Bitcoin hash rate is rising toward new all-time highs, according to analysts at IntoTheBlock. They said:In the near term, outflows from Coinbase are the most important metric to watch to gauge the short-term sentiment around Bitcoin.Coinbase outflows often signal institutional buy orders, as institutions and high-net-worth investors prefer to store their assets away from centralized platforms. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, said:If the Coinbase outflows and premium remain high, the probability of a large correction should decrease in the foreseeable future."
87,"The Bitcoin (BTC) price is not the only metric seeing record numbers as the network hash rate has set a new all-time high.According to data from Blockchain.com, the estimated seven-day average Bitcoin hash rate is now at about 148 exahashes per second, or EH/s. This figure represents the amount of computing power expended by miners to secure the network every second.Tweeting on Jan. 1, on-chain analytics data provider Glassnode revealed that Bitcoin recorded its largest average monthly hash rate of 136 EH/s in Dec. 2020.ATH: December's hash rate (136 exahash / s) was the highest in #Bitcoin's history so far

Chart: https://t.co/M6ZrAkKGRh pic.twitter.com/QOn5CRtWARThe current hash rate growth is in keeping with the trend observed since the start of Nov. 2020 which coincides with the beginning of the current bullish advance in the BTC spot price.At the time, the network was recovering from a major hash rate slump occasioned by the seasonal migration of Chinese miners at the end of the Sichuan rainy season. Before the decline, the Bitcoin hash rate was at its previous seven-day average ATH of about 146 EH/s according to figures from Blockchain.com.If the current upward hash rate trajectory persists then the network will be due for an upward difficulty adjustment above 10% at the next retargeting epoch which should happen on Saturday.The hash rate spike is only one example of the continuous improvements in Bitcoin fundamentals. Other metrics like network usage and activity are also on the rise. According to Coin Metrics, the number of active Bitcoin addresses is approaching its all-time high of about 1.19 million achieved back in the Dec. 2017 bull run.BTC is also continuing its steep price climb since breaching the $10,000 price mark in early October. The largest crypto by market capitalization briefly set a new ATH above $35,000 before seeing a slight pullback."
88,"Bitcoin (BTC) hodlers can now all own a Tesla electric car — as long as they have at least 1 BTC in their wallet.As BTC/USD crossed $34,000 at the weekend and went on to hit $35,600 on Jan. 6, the brainchild of Elon Musk became more affordable than ever.As per pricing on Tesla's official website, the company's entry-level offering, the Model 3, retails at $33,960 in the United States if no environmental fuel rewards are applied.Musk, who has long taunted Bitcoiners with tweets and comments which leave it unclear whether he supports it, continues to face pressure to accept the cryptocurrency for Tesla purchases.""A #bitcoin now buys you a Tesla. So, when will you accept it, @elonmusk ?"" popular Twitter account Documenting Bitcoin wrote at the weekend.Samson Mow, CEO of Blockstream, also noted the brand new price parity as Bitcoin hit new all-time highs.""Would be a shame to buy model 3 now, when you can buy a roadster for 1BTC later this year,"" added Juri Bulovic, director of Bitcoin mining at Fidelity.  As Cointelegraph reported, Tesla stock has become a thorn in the side of the most committed Bitcoin proponents as the only stock to outpace its gains in 2020. From just under $90 on Jan. 1 last year, by the end of last week, $TSLA traded at $729, marking annual returns in excess of 700%.At press time on Wednesday, Tesla was higher still, closing out the previous day's trading at $735 while so far failing to match Bitcoin's 2021 performance.Musk himself meanwhile shows little sign of engaging with the idea, instead focusing his Twitter energies on Dogecoin (DOGE). After some characteristic tongue-in-cheek publicity for the meme-based altcoin, DOGE/USD shot up by over 125% in a week.Merry Christmas & happy holidays! pic.twitter.com/uk6NSPwR9RA Shiba Inu theme even graced Musk's 2020 Christmas greeting to Twitter followers, while an additional helping hand from adult actress Angela White only added to the uptick in Dogecoin's fortunes."
89,"Senator Kelly Loeffler, formerly the CEO of Bitcoin (BTC) futures exchange Bakkt, will not be returning to Washington, at least not as a legislator. According to AP News on Jan. 6, Democratic candidate Raphael Warnock has won one of the tightly contested runoff elections for the United States Senate in the Southern state of Georgia. The runoff elections have been closely watched in the United States, as they will determine which party controls a majority in the Senate, which will set the timbre for President-elect Biden's legislative approach when he assumes office on Jan. 20. The race is still too close to call between Republican David Perdue and Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff. The runoff elections were necessary after no candidate received the required 50% majority vote to win the regularly scheduled elections in November. While AP and The Guardian have called the race for Warnock, Loeffler seems to be modeling President Donald Trump's approach to losing an election.No concession tonight from Loeffler, speaking just now from GA GOP party: ""We have a path to victory... We're going to win this election.""Loeffler entered the crypto industry in 2018 when she became the CEO of Bakkt, the digital assets platform launched by Intercontinental Exchange. In December 2019, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp appointed the Bakkt CEO to a seat in the U.S. Senate to replace Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson.While her term in the Senate was short-lived, Loeffler made headlines after she and two other Senators sold off hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock on information allegedly obtained in closed-door meetings about the coronavirus. Loeffler and her husband were accused of dumping stock in retail companies and subsequently buying shares in teleworking software firm Citrix Systems ahead of the coronavirus-driven lockdowns.The senator denied allegations of insider trading and a subsequent investigation by the U.S. Justice Department did not find any wrongdoing.At the time, a Loeffler spokesperson said, “Today’s clear exoneration by the Department of Justice affirms what Senator Loeffler has said all along—she did nothing wrong.” Loeffler even announced that she and her husband would liquidate their holdings, in order to better focus on tackling the coronavirus crisis. Despite the investigation's result, the trading debacle became a subject of campaign ads from both sides during the recent election. "
90,"Bitcoin is continuing to set new price records, breaking above $35,000 for the first time ever on Jan. 5.After setting its past record of roughly $34,800 on Jan. 3, BTC posted a fast retracement down to $28,000 the following day.However, the crash was short-lived, with BTC quickly recovering, and pressing into new all-time highs above $35,800 around 4.30am (UTC).Bitcoin has now gained roughly 80% since breaking into new highs on Dec. 16, and is up 22% in seven days.The new record was posted one day after the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency published guidance greenlighting federally chartered banks to use stablecoins and public blockchains for settlementEthereum has also pushed back above $1,100 alongside BTC’s latest push, and has gained 44% over the past week."
91,"An increasing number of mainstream giants have put their money into Bitcoin in recent months. While some speculate that these firms intend to hold their Bitcoin investments for years, Bitpay’s chief commercial officer isn't so sure. He thinks that these companies may sell their holdings sooner than originally planned, if the price continues to move upward.“A lot of the institutional buyers bought in around $20,000, so that would be my floor for how far Bitcoin could go down,” Sonny Singh said in an interview with Bloomberg on Monday, following a bout of downward Bitcoin price action.“All those buyers that bought in, they said ‘Oh were into Bitcoin now for a three to five year time horizon,’ which is great, but I think if Bitcoin hits $45,000 next month or so, they’re going to say, ‘wow we just made 2x, you know, we don’t need that three year horizon anymore, let’s start selling some.’”Big player interest in Bitcoin began to heat up in the latter half of 2020 as companies such as MicroStrategy, Square and MassMutual placed significant capital into Bitcoin.“I was chatting to somebody who works at Skybridge,” podcaster Peter McCormack said during a recent interview. “He said the thing you need to understand about MassMutual — they’ve put in $100 million dollars but that’s not a lot of money for them,” McCormack said. “They’re not looking to sell next year, or in two years, or five years.”Singh’s comment makes a contrary argument, however. Institutional profit-taking could spur a fresh wave of BTC sales. “Then you start seeing selling pressure of $200 million sell orders come in, which the industry has never seen before,” Singh explained. “That could cause a catapulting event to cause things to start going down pretty quickly and could see it go down from 45 to 40 to 35 down to 30 or things like that, but I think the floor would be $20,000.”Noting a lack of BTC sell pressure at present, Singh said he sees little standing in the way of BTC hitting between $40,000 and $45,000 “in the next month or so.”"
92,"Bitcoin price may have taken a temporary breather but the sharp correction below $30,000 did little to dismay the bullish sentiment of crypto market participants.The CME Bitcoin futures market reached an all-time high volume at $2.7 billion on Jan. 4 and the same day, LMAX Digital also achieved a record-high at $2.62 billion in traded volume. This huge surge in trading activity suggests institutional investors are continuing to invest in Bitcoin (BTC). Due to institutional adoption, analysts believe that Bitcoin could rally as high as $100,000 in 2021. However, JPMorgan Chase analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou have a slightly different view as they believe Bitcoin’s volatility must converge with that of gold to result in a “crowding out of gold.” Until then, the analysts do not expect Bitcoin to rise above $146,000 this year.Even as Bitcoin takes a breather from its recent uptrend, there are a few tokens that have continued their up-move unabated. Let’s inspect the possible fundamental reasons behind their rally and ascertain the technical levels to watch out for.Ether’s price has surged in the past few days and so has the activity on the Ethereum network. This has boosted gas fees on the network by a huge margin. While the higher fees may not trouble the wealthy, the smaller traders are likely to find it difficult to do lower-valued transactions.To save on the skyrocketing gas fees, traders seem to have onboarded Loorpring (LRC), which saw boosted trading volume on its decentralized exchange, and data from Dune Analytics shows the figure rose to $5.49 million.It is only recently that Loopring Exchange v2 was launched based on Loopring Protocol 3.6, and considering. the current market-wide rally and surge in ETH gas fees,  it could not have come at a better time.The team also plans to launch AMM liquidity mining and a few other programs on Jan. 7 to boost adoption of zkRollup layer-2 scalability and increase liquidity, According to Loopring’s estimation, the annualized returns of the initial three AMM pools could be as high as 40%.If trading activity remains high, the Ethereum network’s congestion may not ease quickly and that could work in Loopring’s favor. Let’s see how its token has responded to this positive fundamental development.LRC price skyrocketed from $0.175 on Jan. 3 to an intraday high at $0.585 today, a 234% rally within three days. This surge has pushed the RSI deep into the overbought territory, which suggests an increased risk of a minor pullback or consolidation.The LRC/USD pair is currently facing a minor resistance close to the 200% Fibonacci extension level at $0.58952.However, if the bulls continue their buying and push the price above $0.509, the rally could extend to the 261.8% extension level at $0.73617 and then the 300% extension level at $0.82681.In a strong uptrend, the corrections are sharp and short-lived. The first support on the downside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the most recent leg of the up-move at $0.42838.A strong rebound off this level will suggest that traders are aggressively buying on dips without waiting for a deeper correction and that may enhance the prospects of resumption of the uptrend.This bullish momentum may weaken if the pair breaks below the 50% retracement level at $0.38.In a trending market, traders smell an opportunity to make oversized returns by using leverage. While futures can be an attractive proposition, it is also risky because an increase in volatility or a sharp reversal could result in large losses if timely steps are not taken to square up or adjust the position.During such times, when the market is on a tear, traders prefer to use options as they have limited risk but large profit potential due to leverage.Other than this, several experienced traders also use options to hedge their futures positions or their spot purchases if they are in large quantities. This seems to have benefited the Hegic (HEGIC) options trading protocol, which traded record options volumes on Jan. 3.Token owners who do not want to trade options may benefit by providing liquidity to one of the pools on Hegic and earn rewards.HEGIC has rallied from an intraday low at $0.0751 to an intraday high at $0.25 today, a 232% rally in just over a week. The sharp recovery from the recent lows suggests aggressive buying by the bulls.If the bulls can sustain the price above $0.24, it will complete a V bottom that has a pattern target of $0.4049.However, if the bulls fail to sustain the HEGIC/USD pair above $0.24, a drop to $0.18 is possible. If the price turns up from this level, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend. If they succeed, the pair could form an inverted head and shoulders pattern, which will be a positive sign.This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down and breaks below $0.16. Such a move could keep the pair range-bound for a few days.It is not only the crypto markets that have been on a strong bull run, even the U.S. equity markets have risen sharply in 2020. Thus, an exchange that offers varied trading products to its customers is likely to be a beneficiary.Currently, FTX exchange offers thematic products such as derivative contracts on the U.S. Presidential election, pre-IPO contracts for Airbnb and Coinbase, tokenized stocks of cannabis-focused companies, and the recent addition has been the spot and futures products offered by Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Grayscale Ethereum Trust, and Bitwise Index. Such a wide array of trading products across several asset classes may have attracted several traders.Additionally, a recent partnership between FTX and Capitalise.ai that offers clients the opportunity to automate their trading using freestyle text is likely to be a positive as many traders like to use mechanical trading systems to remove the sentiment quotient from trading. Backed by these positives, let’s see how FTX Token (FTT) has performed.FTT has rallied from an intraday low at $4.552 on Dec. 23 to an intraday high at $8.112 today, a 78% gain within a short time. The long tails on the candlesticks of Jan. 4 and today show that bears tried to reverse the rally but the bulls aggressively purchased the dips.However, due to the sharp up-move of the past few days, the RSI has risen deep into the overbought territory. This suggests that the FTT/USD pair could be ripe for a consolidation or a minor correction.On the downside, the bulls may attempt to defend $7 and then the 20-day exponential moving average ($5.83). If the pair rebounds off either support, it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and that the bulls are buying on dips.On the upside, the bulls are likely to face a stiff hurdle at the psychological resistance near $10 but if the level is crossed, the next stop could be $12.This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest aggressive profit booking by the traders and a lack of buying support at lower levels.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

93,"Two weeks ago, few investors would have expected Bitcoin (BTC) price to rally any higher than $20,000. In fact, most had forecast a $30,000 BTC price by mid-2022 or late 2023 at best. This means that many holders were likely caught by surprise as BTC price surged to $34,800 just 17 days after crossing the $20,000 mark.Generally, analysts expect a sharp correction to follow Bitcoin’s 150% gain since November, but currently, there are no fundamental indicators that support this point of view.Despite the recent bullish euphoria surrouning Bitcoin’s price action, the digital asset faced a significant drop as the price fell by $5,600 in 3 hours. Over $1.2 billion in liquidations followed that red candle, and typically this sort of move would raise alarm and lead analysts to forecast a potential trend reversal.Each time Bitcoin makes a new high, investors expect some form of correction. Despite failing to break through the $34,500 resistance, the price quickly bounced from its sub- $28,000 dip on Jan. 4. This event might have monetarily spooked some buyers, but looking under the hood, it is a very bullish sign.During the past week, Bitcoin’s dominance rallied to its highest level since March 2017, reaching 73%. Significant purchasing activity from institutional investors has been tied to the movement, including Grayscale’s addition of 72,950 BTC in December.Moreover, investments from MicroStrategy, Ruffer Investment, MassMutual, and SkyBridge Capital are further indisputable evidence of the institutional inflow. Thus, BTC is becoming their preferred and almost exclusive investment option among cryptocurrencies.Regardless of the moves of professional traders, retail traders have an enormous impact on altcoins. Therefore, the Bitcoin rally created an opportunity for an alt season and DeFi-related tokens appear to be benifitting most.In the past week, Bitcoin outperformed the top-15 altcoins, which climbed 9% on average. More importantly, the overall volume has skyrocketed, eliminating any doubts about weekends or holiday pumps with low market participation.The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) premium peaked at 41% on Dec. 21 but has since adjusted to its 90-day average at 19%. It is worth noting that only qualified institutional clients are allowed to acquire shares directly from Grayscale. The remainder of the traders need to buy it on the secondary market and this is the reason for some of the distortions.This extraordinary level can be partially explained by the temporary suspension of new shares being issued. By halting the offer to institutional clients, any additional demand needs to be met by secondary sales, thus creating pressure for a larger premium.Professional traders tend to dominate longer-term futures contracts with set expiry dates. Thus, by measuring how much more expensive futures are versus the regular spot market, a trader can gauge their bullishness level. The 3-month fixed-calendar futures should usually trade with a 1.5% or higher premium versus regular spot exchanges.Whenever this indicator fades or turns negative, this is an alarming red flag. Such a situation, also known as backwardation, indicates that the market is turning bearish.The above chart shows that the indicator briefly held levels above 5%, flirting with overbought levels. Nevertheless, it has been holding above 3% despite the recent sub $28,000 dip on Jan. 4.Therefore, the indicator has held above the minimum 1.5% threshold, indicating optimism from professional traders. This data is a slightly positive reading, as the recent unexpected swing has not shaken buyers.On the other hand, if cascading liquidations had caused longs to deleverage this would have been worrisome.Data from TheTie also shows that a recent BTC price increase occurred while tweets related to 'Bitcoin' reached the highest level seen since Dec. 2017.While a significant bump in Twitter activity does not necessarily equal vigorous retail buying, it certainly helps gather more attention as the cryptocurrency continues its uptrend.The best way to gauge overall market sentiment is to measure whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options. Generally speaking, call options are used for bullish strategies, whereas put options are for bearish ones.A 0.70 put-to-call ratio indicates that put options open interest lag the more bullish calls by 30% and is therefore bullish.In contrast, a 1.20 indicator favors put options by 20%, which can be deemed bearish. One thing to note is that the metric aggregates the entire BTC options market, including all calendar months.Over the past week, investors have been leaning to downside protection strategies. As a result, the put-to-call ratio increased to 0.68, from 0.56 on Dec. 27. Therefore, the indicator has returned to its 3-month average, favoring the more bullish call options by 32%.This data shows that investors optimism remains relatively steady after the 17% BTC price increase over the last week.Overall, each of the five indicators discussed has sustained a neutral-to-bullish range. Professional traders have kept their bullish stance despite the Jan. 4 price swing and this is an encouraging outcome for bulls.As BTC quickly recovered the $31,000 support, bulls showed theri confidence by adding positions after every dip. To conclude, there are no signs of exhaustion or excessive leverage from buyers.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

94,"The cryptocurrency and blockchain industry grew by leaps and bounds in 2020. The top two assets, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), gained 303% and 469%, respectively, which can be considered extraordinary in comparison with the 25% return of gold. While the precious metal is often considered a safe-haven asset, the two digital assets outperformed gold during the uncertain market scenarios that persisted due to the pandemic.Joshua Frank, co-founder and CEO of The Tie — a firm providing crypto insights based on social media analytics — told Cointelegraph: “Across the largest 100 assets by market cap, the average cryptocurrency experienced an 87% increase in average tweet volume — with Bitcoin surging by 95%.”Frank added that even though this current rally is driven by institutional interest, retail interest seems to be rising as well. All this will ultimately lead to a rise in interest in altcoins: “It is worth monitoring which mid-cap assets continue to see surging social activity as this is often a good leading indicator of price movement.”With the attention around crypto spiking against the backdrop of prices growing at such a rapid pace, there are lots of companies, projects and cryptocurrencies that gained momentum in 2020.Bitcoin was, unsurprisingly, the most mentioned crypto asset in 2020, with a 95% year-on-year increase in Twitter mentions. The price for 1 BTC rose from around the $7,000 mark to hit an astonishing all-time high of near $35,000 at the start of the year.BTC received a lot of attention from the mainstream media in 2020. Grayscale, MicroStrategy, Square and MassMutual heavily invested in BTC, and even corporate giants such as PayPal and JPMorgan Chase began to invest to harnessing the opportunities that Bitcoin offers. John Todaro, director of research at TradeBlock — a provider of institutional trading tools for digital currencies — told Cointelegraph:Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, recently even took to Twitter to advise billionaire CEO Elon Musk to convert Tesla’s balance sheet from the U.S. dollar to BTC — all this among the third bull run Bitcoin saw in 2020. The bull run has continued into the new year and is expected to keep going for some time. Considering that this is the beginning of mainstream and institutional interest in Bitcoin, 2021 promises to be an even bigger year for the asset and blockchain technology as a whole.Despite JPMorgan stating that Bitcoin is overbought, it will still continue to pull out capital from investors in gold; although, according to Goldman Sachs, both assets can coexist. Todaro added: “You will likely also see more companies follow MicroStrategy’s lead and put small allocations of their treasury reserve into the asset. This all bodes well for bitcoin to encroach on Gold’s market share.”Ethereum is a blockchain network that runs smart contracts and supports the biggest altcoin, Ether. The main use case of the network is to enable the exchange of value with no intervention from third parties. The network was conceived by developer Vitalik Buterin in 2013 to expand the use case of Bitcoin’s technology, and it became officially active in 2015. In contrast to BTC, there is no hard cap on Ether, with the potential for an endless supply.Ether showed promising improvements throughout the course of 2020. The spike in price that is being seen in early 2021 is happening around the same time as BTC continues hitting new all-time highs, indicating the positive impact of the enthusiasm of the crypto community. Apart from being a digital currency, Ether also acts as fuel for decentralized applications that operate on the Ethereum network.The two landmark moments for Ethereum in 2020 were the rise of decentralized finance and the launch of the Beacon Chain for Ethereum 2.0. DeFi markets saw enormous growth in 2020, with the total value locked rising from $687 million at the start of the year to over $14 billion by the end — further skyrocketing to over $18 billion as of Jan. 4. This growth is generally attributed to the hype around liquidity mining and yield farming, along with the anticipation around Ethereum 2.0 and rise of DeFi oracles.As seen with the continual rise in total value locked in DeFi projects in the second half of 2020, the TVL should continue to rise through 2021, and more use cases for DeFi should be generated through various DApps. Todaro further commented on the importance of Ether to DeFi markets:One of the top players in the DeFi domain in 2020 by total value locked was Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, or DEX. A DEX is a way to exchange cryptocurrencies without a centralized governing agency enabling the transaction. Uniswap’s token exchange uses liquidity pools guided by oracles instead of order books.The exchange even airdropped its own token, UNI, to its users as a controversial response to SushiSwap’s vampire mining attack. Uniswap’s token saw the highest increase in tweet volume, reaching approximately 1,500 tweets per day.The rivalry between Uniswap and SushiSwap seems to have benefited both communities, as the total value locked in both protocols combined is just over $4 billion of the $18.63 billion locked as a whole, according to DeFi Pulse. With regulations likely to tighten for centralized exchanges, DEX’s are bound to see a further increase in new users as market participants look to maintain their ability to trade on noncustodial exchanges.In 2020, Chainlink became the most widely used oracle network for universally connected smart contracts, allowing blockchains to access real-world data in a timely manner. The Chainlink community is an open-source community of data providers, node operators, smart contract developers, researchers and security auditors.The community has its own token, LINK, which is the cryptocurrency used by the network to pay for various operations involving data. LINK saw a 260% year-on-year increase in Twitter mentions in 2020, according to Frank.Chainlink announced partnerships with enormous entities like Google and the Chinese state-backed Blockchain-based Service Network. It was also tapped by Ethereum’s blockchain rival Tezos to provide real-time data for its community projects. Due to the unique proposition that oracles provide for smart contracts to interact with real-time data, the oracles domain should expand further in 2021, seeing Chainlink and its competitors like Band Protocol and Compound fighting for market dominance.Circle is the company that runs the second-largest dollar-pegged stablecoin by market capitalization, USD Coin (USDC) — which was the fastest-growing stablecoin of 2020. Its market capitalization grew multifold from around $500 million at the start of the year to $4 billion by the start of 2021. Circle even collaborated with the United States government on a “global foreign policy objective” in Venezuela where USDC was used to distribute relief funds to medical workers and Venezuelan locals.In light of recent attention from U.S. federal regulators, stablecoins might just be the crypto community’s first real point of conflict with regulators. They could soon be regulated by what’s now dubbed the “STABLE Act,” which intends to “protect consumers from the risks posed by emerging digital payment instruments, such as Facebook’s Libra [Diem] and other Stablecoins.”The President’s Working Group on Financial Markets even released a statement regarding the key regulatory and supervisory issues relevant to “certain stablecoins.” Todaro commented on what the implications of this increased regulatory attention could mean for stablecoins: “Stablecoins will likely see increased regulation in 2021. It is difficult to see how this shakes out, but USDC will likely become more centralized than it currently is and will likely become closer related to a bank than a decentralized consortium.”Although 2020 was a phenomenal year for crypto, 2021 holds an even larger potential for the growth of the industry. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange will launch its Ether futures in February, which is bound to push the markets further.Frank further opined that the Twitter metrics indicate an even larger interest toward cryptocurrencies in 2021: “The surge in Twitter conversations has continued into and been even more pronounced in the first week of 2021.” He went on to add: “Today Ethereum’s Tweet volume hit an all-time high (doubling the previous record set in 2018) and two days ago both Bitcoin and the overall crypto market saw Tweet volume all-time highs, besting marks set in 2017.”"
95,"Responding to a tweet from billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya, Mark Cuban said he would run as a United States presidential candidate — under a specific set of circumstances. “I'll run if BTC gets to $1m AND we can get commitments to donate 350 BTC to the Treasury each of the 4 yrs so that we can give 1 satoshi to every citizen each yr, that they must hold for 10 years,” the Shark Tank star tweeted on Tuesday.Cuban’s response came after Palihapitiya said the present political framework needs fixing, forecasting “a viable third political party in the US by 2030.” Cuban subsequently questioned the whole concept of political parties. In turn, Palihapitiya said the U.S. would likely not need such parties if Cuban runs for office.Cuban has spoken about Bitcoin several times over the past two years. Some of his most recent comments include a stance on the asset as “a store of value like gold that is more religion than solution to any problem"" and that “No matter how much BTC fans want to pretend that it’s a hedge against doomsday scenarios, it is not.”At the core, Cuban’s overall view of Bitcoin is not too far off from the industry’s outlook on the coin. Both Cuban and crypto industry gurus see the digital asset as a store of value similar to gold. Cuban has, however, previously called for greater user simplicity for the asset, as well as touching on several other points over the years. In contrast, crypto pundits see Bitcoin as solving a plethora of issues, instead of simply acting as another store of value."
96,"Canaan, one of the earliest manufacturers of Bitcoin (BTC) ASIC miners, has released the Avalon Immersion Cooling Miner A1066I, a device designed to be liquid-cooled.Unlike traditional air-cooled devices and common types of liquid cooling for enthusiast PCs, the A1066I’s electrical components are submerged in a special dielectric fluid that carries heat away directly from the boards.Dielectric fluids are specially engineered to insulate the components and avoid the corrosion damage and short-circuiting that would occur with standard water or other types of fluids. This is also different from liquid cooling based on water blocks, where a special heat exchanger isolates the water from the components.The A1066I is a large container device that can hold up to 90 immersion-cooled units. Canaan claims that each unit produces 50 terahashes per second for a power consumption of 3,400 watts, while each tank reaches up to 7,200 TH/s and 306 kilowatts of energy usage when fully stacked.While Canaan claims the A1066I has better performance than its air-cooled top-of-the-line A1246, the latter packs 90 TH/s of hash rate for the same energy consumption, making it more efficient on paper. Cointelegraph asked for clarification on the figures but did not immediately receive a response.Nonetheless, the native liquid cooling feature can make the device more attractive to certain categories of miners, especially those in warmer regions. The more effective cooling method also allows for more aggressive overclocking, potentially allowing for higher hashing performance — though electricity consumption remains an important constraint when trying to boost the hash rate. The cooling method also benefits from protection against dust and overheating.Canaan is one of the original ASIC manufacturers and the first to launch a successful initial public offering on NASDAQ. Its performance has been lackluster since then as lawsuits and claims that the company misled investors surfaced. Quarterly operating losses weighed heavily on the stock price too.Canaan’s chief competitors are Bitmain, which is having its share of troubles as well, and MicroBT, an up-and-coming manufacturer that has steadily gained market share in the past months."
97,"A number of mainstream companies have picked up massive piles of Bitcoin (BTC) since summer 2020. Meanwhile, the asset surged past its 2017 record high near $20,000, recently cracking $34,000 before pulling back toward $27,700. The dip, however, has created some serious buying pressure, according to OKCoin’s chief operating officer, Jason Lau.""Over the weekend, as Bitcoin prices hit fresh all time highs near $34k, markets touched new levels of resistance,” Lau told Cointelegraph. “Both total crypto market cap and bitcoin dominance reached 2017 highs, at around $800B and 73% respectively,” he noted, adding:Last year kicked off a trend of large mainstream players — including MicroStrategy, MassMutual and Paul Tudor Jones — allocating massive sums of capital toward Bitcoin. The public can thank this institutional uptake for Bitcoin’s recent rally, according to comments from crypto bull and Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz.“In addition, we saw rotation out of BTC during this period, as traders rotated assets from BTC into alts to gain higher returns,” Lau explained of Bitcoin’s recent price action. “This is evident as Ethereum gained 13% over bitcoin in the last 24hrs, while bitcoin dominance fell to 69%.”Ether (ETH) recently flew up past $1,000 as part of a sizable move that outpaced Bitcoin in the short term."
98,"Americans who received their second coronavirus stimulus checks on Dec. 29 have already gained 12% — if they invested it in Bitcoin (BTC).As the United States government rolls out another round of “free” money to eligible residents, attention is fixed on how many will choose to invest their $600 in cryptocurrencies.The handouts began last week and are expected to be completed by Jan. 15. According to a dedicated monitoring resource, those who received the money on the first day and who immediately swapped their U.S. dollars for BTC are already up around $75.Bitcoin and Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin by market capitalization, have outstripped practically all competition in the first week of 2021 when it comes to returns on investment.As mainstream media overflows with tales of how stimulus recipients plan to invest in stocks and consumer goods, notionally with the goal of “stimulating the economy,” those who bought Bitcoin with the previous cash gift in April 2020 are now sitting on $5,600.At the time, the stimulus check was worth $1,200 — twice the amount of the second round — meaning Bitcoin has supplied gains of 370% if you ""hodled"" until now. The figures underscore the curious way in which the average taxpayer can benefit from the bizarre financial environment that characterizes 2020 and 2021. By simply buying and holding Bitcoin, anyone can outpace even the most seasoned equities trader.“Maybe we should be sending out the stimulus money in Bitcoin. The $600 will turn to $2,000 in a week anyways,” fund manager Austin Rief summarized in a tongue-in-cheek tweet over the weekend.While 233% gains in a week have yet to come true, many are already confident of Bitcoin’s prospects to match or even beat last year’s performance in 2021.The year after a block subsidy halving has historically been the cryptocurrency’s best, and under that logic, a correction will only be due in 2022.Added to this is data showing longer-term behavior following a price top in each four-year halving cycle. With $20,000 as the previous top, history suggests that BTC/USD will not dip below that level again.What’s more, between 2017 and 2020, the difference between Bitcoin’s two tops was 1,600%. Between the 2013 and 2017 tops, it gained 3,500%. Since May 2020, Bitcoin is up by a comparatively modest 75%."
99,"Bitcoin (BTC) had a tremendous 2020 as BTC price rallied by 311%. In the shadows of Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) also saw a fantastic year as Ether’s price rallied by an even bigger 475%.  While only five days into the new year, ETH is continuing this trend. Bitcoin breaking new all-time highs above $30,000 has sparked a massive rally fire that is now spilling over to altcoins. However, the question now is whether the bull run will continue vertically, as it did in the past few months, or whether a short-term correction should be expected.Such a correction would open the gates for most cryptocurrencies to follow Bitcoin toward their own respective all-time highs.There are not many indicators to watch for the continuation of this bull market as only a few give you strong enough arguments for bull/bear cases.But one useful indicator is the 21-week moving average (MA). This MA served as support throughout the previous bull run, which indicated the continuation toward a peak high at $20,000.As long as Bitcoin rests on this MA, further continuation is likely for the BTC/USD pair. At this moment, the 21-eek MA is holding support at the $16,000 level.However, corrections are common with consolidations that could span the next few weeks. During those weeks, the 21-week MA is going to crawl upward. Therefore, combining the future perspective of the 21-week MA with the previous all-time high gives an ultimate bottom for a correction at the $20,000 region.Whether Bitcoin has topped out for now is up for debate, as many bullish signals are still flashing. This bullish price action is combined with a constant outflow from exchanges, a bullish signal for the market. This Bitcoin i likely to be held for the longer term, which makes this bull cycle very different from the bull run of 2017.Using the Fibonacci extension tools, the continuation of the current rally puts the next levels of interest at the 1.618 and 2.618 Fibonacci levels, where the next big corrections could happen. Those levels are currently lying at $50,000 and $76,000.However, it won’t be a surprise if Bitcoin runs toward $76,000 this year, given its recent strength.The total market capitalization is also making new all-time highs, as Bitcoin and Ether have been doing tremendously in recent weeks. The altcoin market cap has been lagging heavily, as Bitcoin often pulls out ahead. But once Bitcoin stabilizes, many other cryptocurrencies tend to follow suit with sharp rallies.This happens because of how money flows through the markets. First, Bitcoin being in the spotlight attracts capital flows. Then as investors seek even higher risk/higher reward opportunities, the money flows toward the large caps, mid-caps and so forth.However, in case of a consolidation, the levels to watch for the total market cap are shown in the chart: It’s the previous all-time high around $700 billion (which might have seen a test already) and the area around $550 billion.The hourly chart for Bitcoin shows a slight downturn since the recent peak high at $34,800. The $32,400–$32,800 zone flipped resistance, which is often a bearish signal.However, the $30,000 barrier has served as support three times already. Therefore, this is the crucial area to hold to warrant further upward momentum. If this level breaks down as support, a drop toward $27,000 to $27,500 then becomes likely.If it holds, continuation toward the critical breaker on the upside is likely. In that way, a breakthrough of $32,300 to $32,800 would warrant a new test of the all-time high region and possible continuation toward $38,000 and even $42,000.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

100,"The daily volume of the CME Bitcoin futures market and LMAX achieved a new all-time high on Monday. The data shows that institutional demand for Bitcoin (BTC) is rapidly surging as major public funds continue to accumulate.According to analysts at Arcane Research, the daily volume of LMAX Digital reached a record-high at $2.62 billion.LMAX is a trading platform that tailors to institutional and accredited investors, unlike retail-focused platforms such as Coinbase and Binance. Arcane Research’s head of research, Bendik Norheim Schei, wrote:During the same period, the CME Bitcoin futures market also achieved an all-time high volume at $2.7 billion in dollar terms.On CME, traders use Bitcoin-backed contracts, and as such, when the price of Bitcoin increases, so does the value of contracts.The massive increase in the trading volume of institutional platforms comes as funds are aggressively investing in Bitcoin.On Monday, Anthony Scaramucci, former White House director of communications, said his hedge fund, SkyBridge, entered a $300 million Bitcoin position from November 2020 to December 2020. He said:With SkyBridge’s investment in Bitcoin, nine funds now hold $23 billion worth of Bitcoin, according to technology researcher Kevin Rooke.9 funds now hold over $23 billion of Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/sfffwYK4oAGrayscale still holds the most Bitcoin at $19 billion through its flagship product, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.GBTC is an alternative to an exchange-traded fund in the United States in that institutions and accredited investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin through a strictly regulated vehicle.Despite the massive inflow of institutional capital into the Bitcoin market, the price of BTC sharply corrected on Tuesday.Bitcoin's price dropped by over 15% on a single day after more than $2 billion worth of futures contracts were liquidated.Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, said that derivatives traders are now uncertain and fearful, based on the declining leverage across major exchanges. He said:Estimated Leverage Ratio across exchanges is decreasing.

Chart https://t.co/5cT9wVNv16 pic.twitter.com/m2emoxL1fKIn the near term, this could result in a consolidation period where Bitcoin sees lower volatility following a massive uptrend.In the last 48 hours, Bitcoin has still been able to remain above the $30,000 support level, which is an optimistic sign of positive momentum.Whale clusters suggest that the next major support area is $29,300, which would be a crucial technical level to defend for the ongoing rally to see renewed momentum."
101,"Drawing parallels between Bitcoin (BTC) and gold's role as a hedge for investors has been popular for years. Until now, the stark discrepancy in the total market capitalizations of the two assets has limited these analogies to a significant extent. Gold, even after a major Bitcoin price rise in Dec. 2020, continues to command roughly 4.6 times Bitcoin's current $585 billion market capitalization.Yet strategists at the American multinational megabank JPMorgan Chase are forecasting a possible scenario in which Bitcoin can seriously take on its predecessor. On Jan. 5, a Bloomberg report cited a note from the bank's strategists, led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, in which they sketched out a path to the total private sector investment in Bitcoin coming to equal the value that is currently invested in gold via either exchange-traded funds or bars and coins. Yet such a path crucially depends on Bitcoin's volatility converging with that of the precious metal, they stressed, and that is likely to take some time:As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, Bitcoin has weathered a couple of days of choppy and highly volatile price action, with a brief dive down to $27,700 on Jan. 4 followed by a bounce to almost $30,000. As of press time, the coin is trading closer to $315,000. Yesterday's plummet was the starkest since the coin recovered the $20,000 price point in December 2020.Amid this backdrop of persistent volatility, the JPMorgan strategists nonetheless identified strong positive signs for the cryptocurrency — pointing to an accumulation of speculative long positions — yet warned that reading the investment landscape in the medium-term remains difficult:On Jan. 1, Bitcoin reached an all-time-high against gold, surpassing its previous peak back during the winter 2017 bull market. In December of last year, the same team of strategists led by Panigirtzoglou was already suggesting that Bitcoin could eat into gold's market share in the future, envisioning a major shift in institutional allocation towards the cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, an eventful trading climate has caused volumes on major cryptocurrency exchanges to hit record highs. On Jan. 4, Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trade volume, reported an all-time-high of $80 billion in 24-hour trade activity. ""To put this in perspective, from Nov 15, 2017 to Dec 15, 2017, the month leading up to the ATH [all-time-high] in 2017, Binance did $20 billion in trading volume in 1 month,"" the exchange's CEO wrote on Twitter.Equally unprecedented, however, was futures traders' loss of a total of $190 million on Binance alone in just one hour, the largest value of a mass liquidation to date on the platform. "
102,"Changpeng Zhao, the chief executive of Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trade volume, reported a record of $80 billion in 24-hour trade activity on Jan. 4.On Twitter, CZ compared the recent activity to the volume posted during the last record-breaking bull cycle, noting that the past day of trade equates to four-time the volume processed on the exchange from Nov. 15, 2017 to Dec. 15, 2017.To put this in perspective, from Nov 15, 2017 to Dec 15, 2017, the month leading up to the ATH in 2017, @Binance did $20 billion in trading volume in 1 month. And we were the largest with those volumes back then.In the 24 hours preceding CZ’s tweet, Binance’s spot volume exceeded $23.6 billion, while its derivatives represented nearly $57 billion in trade.Despite the milestone, CZ acknowledged the platform had experienced disruptions amid the record volume, stating:However, in addition to the unprecedented trade activity, Jan. 4 also saw Binance process a record $190 million in liquidations over 10 minutes as BTC quickly crashed below $30,000.On the same day, Sam Bankman-Fried, the CEO and founder of crypto derivatives exchange FTX, reported that his exchange had processed more than $10 billion of the $180 billion in volume produced by the sector’s five-largest exchanges that day.10b pic.twitter.com/44acp7fZ0lBinance’s record volume comes as Bitcoin consolidates above $30,000 after gaining more than 50% over its previous all-time high, and Ethereum has reclaimed four-figure prices for the first time since January 2018.The spoils of the rally appear to be flowing into the DeFi sector, with the USD total value locked, or TVL, on decentralized finance protocols smashing records, from $12.5 billion at the start of December to currently sit at nearly $18 billion.However the number of BTC locked in DeFi has fallen from an all-time high of 65,000 as of late October to less than 25,000 today, while locked ETH has fallen from almost nine million as of mid-November to 6.8 million today."
103,"Bitcoin (BTC) price plunged by about $3,400 in an hour, warning traders that corrections during a parabolic move are likely to be sharp. Data from Glassnode shows that the fall resulted in the liquidation of Bitcoin futures long positions worth about $190 million on Binance within an hour, the largest to date.In a strong uptrend, corrections are swift but short-lived because investors who expect the rally to continue use the dips to buy.Binance US CEO Catherine Coley believes the Bitcoin could climb to “$75,000 to $100,000” by the end of this year. Meanwhile, investor Raoul Paul is even more positive as he anticipates Bitcoin to hit anywhere between “$400,000 to $1.2 million” in 2021 if the bull trend continues.The huge bullish projection in BTC price is largely due to the institutional adoption of Bitcoin. In a recent interview with BBC, Galaxy Digital founder and CEO Mike Novogratz said: “As the institutions move in, there just is not a lot of supply [...] There are a lot more than 21 million millionaires out there.”While the retail traders may have missed out on Bitcoin’s rally, they are coming back with a vengeance by buying altcoins that have surged to multiyear highs in the past few days. This has pulled Bitcoin’s dominance to below 69%.However, will the rally in Bitcoin and the altcoins continue or is it time for a few days of consolidation or correction? Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin's most recent leg of the uptrend had pushed the relative strength index (RSI) deep into the overbought territory, suggesting frenzied buying by the traders. Usually, such a phase is followed by a shakeout and that is what happened today.The BTC/USD pair plummeted to an intraday low at $27,762.34, just below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $28,382.75. This sharp fall was aggressively purchased by the bulls as seen from the long tail on the day’s candlestick.If the bulls manage to sustain the price above the 20-day exponential moving average ($26,737), it will suggest that the sentiment remains positive and the bulls are buying on dips.However, after the large range day today, the pair may enter a period of consolidation for a few days before starting the next trending move. The pair may remain range-bound between $34,786.04 and $26,000.Contrary to this assumption, if the price breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that traders are rushing to the exit and that could pull the pair to the 50-day simple moving average at $21,578.Ether (ETH) easily surmounted the $800 to $840.93 overhead resistance on Jan. 3, which shows aggressive buying by the bulls. The momentum continued today and the biggest altcoin reached an intraday high at $1,156.456.If the bulls can sustain the price above $1,000, it will increase the prospects for a rally to $1,260 and then to the all-time high at $1,420.However, the long upper and lower shadows on today’s candlestick suggest profit booking at higher levels and accumulation at lower levels. After the large range today, the ETH/USD pair may consolidate in a tight range for a few days before starting the next trending move.If the price does not dip below $840.93, it will suggest that traders are not closing their positions. In such a case, the bulls may attempt to resume the uptrend. This positive view will invalidate if the pair breaks below the 20-day EMA ($731).XRP is currently consolidating in a downtrend. After a sharp fall, if the price fails to rebound, it suggests a lack of urgency among traders to buy. A consolidation near the support increases the risk of a breakdown.The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.322) and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest that the path of least resistance is to the downside.If bears sink the price below the $0.169 support, the XRP/USD pair could resume the downtrend towards the next target at $0.10.Contrary to this assumption, if the consolidation resolves to the upside and the pair rises above the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the selling has exhausted and a relief rally may be underway.Litecoin (LTC) bounced off the $124.1278 support on Jan. 2 and resumed the uptrend. The altcoin surged above the first target objective at $160 and hit an intraday high at $173.3312 today where it witnessed profit booking.However, the positive thing is that the bulls aggressively purchased the dip to $140, which suggests that the sentiment remains positive. The rising moving averages and the RSI close to the overbought territory suggest bulls are in control.After the large range day today, volatility may contract and the LTC/USD pair may consolidate in a tight range for the next few days.If bulls can push the price above $173.3312, the pair could rally to $184.7940. The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA ($122.96).Polkadot (DOT) resumed the uptrend when it broke above the $9.50 to $9.89 overhead resistance on Jan. 3, but the rally hit a roadblock above $10.50 from where the price reversed direction today.If traders buy the dip to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $8.4507, it will indicate strength. The bulls will then try to resume the uptrend. If they can push the price above $9.50, a retest of $10.5169 will be on the cards.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below the $8.4507 support, the correction could extend to the 50% retracement level at $7.8125. A break below this support will suggest that the momentum has weakened.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($340.94) on Jan. 2 and soared above the $370 overhead resistance on Jan. 3. That opened the gates for a rally to the $497 to $515.35 resistance zone.However, traders aggressively booked profits at higher levels today, which has dragged the price back towards the breakout level at $370.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls have the upper hand. If the BCH/USD pair rebounds off this support, the bulls may again attempt to push the price to $515.35.This positive view will be invalidated if the bears sink and sustain the price below $353. Such a move will suggest that the markets have rejected the higher levels and that could lead to a range-bound action.Cardano (ADA) rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($0.173) on Jan. 2 and resumed the uptrend on Jan.3 when it broke above $0.1966315. Today, the altcoin surged to an intraday high at $0.2399022, but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels.The Doji candlestick pattern today suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. While the bears are selling at higher levels, the bulls continue to buy on dips.After the large range day today, the volatility could subside in the next few days as the bulls and the bears battle it out for supremacy.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI close to the overbought zone suggest advantage to the bulls. The ADA/USD pair may resume its up-move if the bulls can sustain the price above $0.21.A break below the 20-day EMA will be the first sign of weakness and the correction could deepen if the 50-day SMA ($0.155) support cracks.Binance Coin (BNB) turned down sharply from the $43.2029 levels today, which suggests profit booking at higher levels. However, the upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that the trend remains up.If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA ($35), it will suggest that traders continue to accumulate on dips. The bulls will then try to resume the uptrend and propel the price to the target objective at $50.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the momentum has weakened and traders are not buying on dips. That could pull the price down to $32 and result in a few days of range-bound action.Chainlink (LINK) broke above the descending channel and the $13.28 overhead resistance on Jan. 3. This opened the doors for a rally to $16.39 and the altcoin hit an intraday high at $15.644 today.However, the long wick on today’s candlestick shows that traders aggressively booked profits at higher levels but the positive sign is that the LINK/USD pair found buying support near the 20-day EMA ($12.36).If the price sustains above $13.28, the bulls will again try to push the price to $16.39 and then to $20.1111. Conversely, if the price slides below the moving averages, the pair may drop to $11.29 and then to $10.The long wick on today’s candlestick suggests that the bulls failed to sustain Bitcoin SV (BSV) above the $181 overhead resistance as the bears defended this level aggressively.The price has currently dropped below the moving averages. If the bears sink the price below $160, the BSV/USD pair may drop to the support of the range at $146.Conversely, if the price rebounds off the current levels and rises above $175, the bulls will make one more attempt to propel the pair above $181. If they succeed, a rally to $215 is possible.However, the flat moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint are not signaling an advantage either to the bulls or the bears.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

104,"It would be fair to admit that after 2020 and all it has put us through, making any predictions for the upcoming year is most likely to be a game of blindfold. Meanwhile, I am certain that humanity has much to learn from its past transgressions, and will move forward by correcting our mistakes and weaknesses. That’s what we always do. Undoubtedly, the major driver of our development this year was the COVID-19 outbreak. The effects of the ongoing global pandemic on every aspect of our lives will form our future, and there are some tendencies we started last year that will most likely continue in 2021.COVID-19 has revealed the dire need for solutions in economic efficiency and transparency, and most urgently within the healthcare sector. Further deployments of blockchain solutions will strengthen healthcare systems, if not revolutionize them, by helping both medical practitioners and patients globally. Despite promises to preserve citizens’ private data during the global pandemic in the name of public health, the blockchain-based solutions storing COVID-19 data have raised serious concerns, as they don’t seem to be private at all. While the potential of such emerging technologies is promising, to balance privacy with the appropriate solutions should be a priority for those engaged in this industry.Related: How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the crypto space? Experts answerBy driving our technological development into the future, the pandemic has also had a significant and ambitious impact on the financial sector. On one hand, governments all over the world have made great strides in the development of central bank digital currencies this year. With CBDC implementations coming closer, serious privacy concerns have been rightfully raised within the crypto community, as the technology represents another step toward a more centralized financial system.Related: Did CBDCs affect the crypto space in 2020, and what’s next in 2021? Experts answerOn the other hand, people have been seeking alternative — and decentralized — solutions, which led to the unprecedented rise of the decentralized finance sector witnessed this year. Both trends will certainly remain central to the upcoming year.Related: Was 2020 a ‘DeFi year,’ and what is expected from the sector in 2021? Experts answerAmid the novel coronavirus pandemic, global governments began printing money, generating new concerns about the health of the financial sector and turning people toward alternative assets — cryptocurrencies. As a result, Bitcoin (BTC) proved itself as a hedge against inflation while its position as a store of value was strengthened, unlike in 2017.Related: Did Bitcoin prove itself to be a reliable store of value in 2020? Experts answerSerious institutional investors, hedge funds and other sophisticated financial players — such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, MicroStrategy, Square and PayPal, among others — entered the crypto space, and this tendency will most likely remain in the upcoming year. With more mainstream investors and service providers joining the industry, the real utility of digital assets will further drive cryptocurrency’s mass adoption worldwide, which in turn will drive crypto charity and philanthropy.Related: Will PayPal’s crypto integration bring crypto to the masses? Experts answerWith cheap and scalable, trustless systems, blockchain tech is improving supply chain efficiencies across many industries from blood donations to food enterprises, and there will most certainly be more DLT-backed use cases implemented across the globe. Some even argue that enterprise blockchain is the next step in economic architecture evolution, and that not taking this step alongside everyone else will be a grave mistake for large companies in 2021.Related: Unforgettable: How blockchain will fundamentally change the human experienceLast but not least is blockchain’s potential in our efforts to combat climate change and global warming. Blockchain technology stewarding the environment will be crucial for the future, from sustainable digital finance and carbon emissions to eco-friendly crypto mining and transparent fuel use. As we enter the third decade of the 21st century, achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals without blockchain seems an impossible undertaking.Blockchain and crypto are not a panacea and won’t solve all our problems, but their potential to improve the world would be unwise to ignore. Cointelegraph reached out to industry leaders and asked for their personal expectations for 2021 to gain some insight on the upcoming year in crypto and blockchain.“I have no magic 8-ball when it comes to predictions in the cryptocurrency space, though I suspect volatility will continue to be its defining feature. The use of blockchain, distributed ledger and smart contract tools will continue to grow as they have in 2020.Tighter economic times that are likely to continue in 2021 mean little room for proof-of-concept projects, but those conditions also often drive small and large enterprises towards greater cooperation rather than zero-sum marketshare battles — meaning more consortia efforts, more realistic expectations on returns from such efforts, and less hype and noise. We’ve already seen some networks, like Food Trust, reliably achieve increasing value through network effects.If your industry doesn’t yet have a DLT transaction network at the heart of its core business processes, it will by the end of 2021. And where there’s competition, those blockchain consortia whose governance is most open and networks easiest to join will have the advantage.”“Cryptocurrency is to banking what the internet was to libraries. Just as the internet existed for a decade before 1995, its rapid adoption became possible only after it became accessible to everyone, not just programmers.In 2021, I expect to see the beginning of that same transition for cryptocurrency. I think we are approaching critical mass for much more ubiquitous acceptance of cryptocurrency as a tool for everyone to use, not just Silicon-Valley types. That acceptance is, of course, not guaranteed. Crypto developers, exchange operators and others need to stay focused on addressing concerns about Anti-Money Laundering compliance, fraud detection and prevention, and a host of other things that must be put to rest if the industry is to operate at scale.”“Blockchain is at a critical juncture. In order to fulfill the lofty promises of the technology and achieve widespread adoption, the industry needs to learn to work together. This isn’t a new concept — in mainstream technology businesses rarely work in silos. We wouldn’t, for example, expect a Samsung phone to only work with Samsung wireless routers, and we shouldn’t expect this in crypto. If we keep taking the attitude that one platform needs to ‘win,’ then we risk shooting ourselves in the foot.2021 will be a crucial test of this. If companies can prioritise finding ways to interoperate, recognising that the industry will benefit from a rich ecosystem of partners, all working seamlessly together for the end user, then there is nothing stopping us from having our ‘bluetooth moment’ and replacing the global operating systems with solutions that are better and fairer for all participants.We could see blockchain adoption at an unprecedented scale in the developing world in 2021. For developing countries, the pace at which they can grow is often held back by a lack of foundational infrastructure. However, this could start to work in their favour. The agile capabilities of blockchain mean that it could scale to cater for entire populations, without the need for existing infrastructure. After a bumper year for blockchain development, the technology is finally mature enough to get them there.This could not only allow developing nations to grow at a much faster pace, but also means that they aren’t encumbered with the challenges that developed countries face with overhauling existing legacy systems.”“Moving forward, I believe 2021 could be the year that blockchain truly goes mainstream. Bitcoin already proved its value to mainstream investors in 2020 while DeFi projects affirmed blockchain’s transformational power. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic revealed the various cracks in today’s global system and the pressing need for more blockchain-powered solutions to overcome current limitations.Going into 2021, I do not see any of these aforementioned trends slowing down — if anything, they will only continue to accelerate as mainstream institutions increasingly embrace blockchain technology.”“While 2020 was far from the year most of us expected, I think it was an important year for blockchain and digital currencies. It demonstrated the positive impact blockchain can have to deliver payments faster and more efficiently. It set a strong foundation for the year ahead.In 2021, I believe we’ll see more adoption of blockchain technology as we work to create consumer-friendly and connected products. For us at the Stellar Development Foundation, we’re doing that by working to expand our base of anchors — organizations that issue fiat tokens and provide financial on-and-off ramps — to make it so that blockchain technology is seen as useful, versatile and scalable. These anchors will better support the most common use cases we see for next year, B2B cross-border payments and C2C cross-border remittances, and encourage additional applications to come to the market.”“I think the well-funded players will continue to execute and keep up crypto business. Bitcoin will continue to be newsworthy. I think we’ll see more corporate and less independent things, due to the way funding is being distributed right now.I believe that 2021 will be an extension of 2020 in many ways, as opposed to a year where we see a dramatic change. 2021 will see a lot of optimism, as people get the vaccine and life starts to feel more ‘normal.’I’m seeing increasing distrust in governments and lack of trust in how countries are handling financial policies and basic functions. Did you know that the recent cyberattack (using SolarWinds, Microsoft, etc.) included a breach into the U.S. Treasury? Would you invest in the U.S. dollar? That’s what you are doing when you keep dollars in your savings account. All of this makes me bullish on crypto.”“In 2021, DeFi will become a cross-chain ecosystem, with users finding and pursuing yield opportunities with the same assets across multiple chains via bridges. We’ll also see many use cases launching for the first time, as developers explore networks capable of sub-second finality and much more economical fees than what they currently work with.Meaningful decentralization — as measured by the number of full nodes participating in consensus — and on-chain governance will move closer to the forefront, as users and newer entrants into crypto become more aware of how centralized many blockchains are, and the risk that introduces.Finally, we’re going to see institutions and enterprises begin to move beyond just buying cryptocurrencies as an investment, to also building real applications and infrastructure on platforms that can meet their performance requirements and be customized to their data and compliance mandates.”“Digitization of markets is a macro trend. Of course, digital assets are part of that. Digital assets and their underlying technology are pushing conventional boundaries. I am going to make a relatively safe prediction, which is that this is going to continue to be a vibrant and active space.Digital assets, and in particular the underlying blockchain technology, have great promise for our economy and for global markets overall.Innovation in this space must continue to thrive. The financial services industry from my parents’ generation — or even from when I was growing up — is not what it is today. And I do not expect today’s to be the same as for my grandkids. Markets must continue to evolve. We have seen firsthand how these markets — and especially these technologies — do not have geographic borders. It is important for regulators to develop coordinated principle-based approaches to this ever-changing industry.”“The current bull run is different from 2017. Unlike previous years, we’re shifting from retail speculation to mainstream market integration. We’ve already seen increased interest from financial institutions and regulators alike, and this will only continue in 2021.Planned mining deployments delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to resume, particularly in the U.S. As such, next year, we will likely see greater diversity in Bitcoin mining as U.S. miners expand their operations. We have enhanced the efficiency of our Malaysia factory to cater to more of our overseas customers and have improved cooperation with our clients to further assist with the continuous expansion of their mining operations.We are confident of moving towards 2021. We are improving our services to our clients. Recently, we extended the warranty of our Antminer 19 Series from six to 12 months and have begun cooperating with more local partners from different regions to offer better support globally.”“During 2020, Bitcoin exhibited similar patterns to the ones seen in 2013 and 2017. The price movements and trade volumes also demonstrate that trading, especially Bitcoin trading, has a type of kinetic energy. If this trend were to continue, it is possible that we will see Bitcoin following a parabolic move in 2021.We will likely see a continued increase in the number of institutional investors and corporates adding Bitcoin and digital asset investment vehicles to their portfolios. This will result in some Bitcoin investment vehicles, like CoinShares’ ETP and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust, continuing to acquire more Bitcoin than can be mined on a daily basis — a pace that is likely to accelerate in the new year. I believe we are about to see a repeat of 2017 or 2013’s trends in 2021, albeit in a much more structured, less emotional way, unless a six sigma event occurs that interrupts the market’s kinetic momentum.”“Huge bull market and a lot more institutional investors. I don't think anything from the blockchain space will have any impact whatsoever, much like the past six years. Crypto will be largely for new investors who will learn that anything other than Bitcoin is really a scam.”“I think that DeFi will become more relevant to normal people and the tech used to interact with it will be even more user friendly.I’m also still predicting the parts of the Web 3.0 — decentralized storage, bandwidth and value — to be further integrated with each other. We spent a year collaborating on a bridge between Filecoin and Ethereum through Codefi DeFi Bridge, and Infura’s IPFS service transferred more than 300 TB of data this year alone. Web 3.0 is showing potential to provide more open content creation, the ability to publish, participate, create, run e-commerce, communication, video, etc.We’ll also closely be participating in the scaling of Ethereum, both with our research contributions to Eth2, our client team Teku, Codefi Staking, and Infura’s Beacon Chain API. Merging Eth1 and Eth2 may happen in 2021, and we look forward to a more flexible and scalable settlement layer for the planet.In the early 1990s, you couldn’t buy anything legally on the internet — we are now seeing the same democratization in the financial industry. We’ve replaced bank books and calls to stockbrokers with online interfaces. The distribution of financial services that are accessible to anyone itself is a major achievement, and we think this will continue to take off in 2021. I feel that the 21st century is just about to start in 2021.”“In 2021, the intersection of three trends — tokenization, DeFi and business logic moving to layer two — will pave the way for enterprise adoption of public DLT networks. These trends, combined with tough lessons learned from attempted private network deployments, have caused enterprises to be amenable to public DLT networks in ways they were not previously.Today, digital tokens are being designed for economic activity within supply chains, not just as a way for startups to raise capital. The combination of tokenization, fiat-backed stablecoins, and DeFi — the underlying technology, not the short-term hype — will make traditional financing operations faster and less costly, fundamentally changing the existing processes for purchase order financing, obtaining loans for working capital, purchasing insurance, securing inventory financing and invoice factoring.And enterprises are realizing that they can have their applications execute business logic in layer-two networks and simply use layer one for consensus and arbitration. This approach combines the benefits of public networks (distributed trust) with the benefits of private networks (low cost, scalability, privacy and regulatory compliance).The intersection of these trends will provide the foundation for enterprises to use DLT in routine business transactions, driving significant acceleration in enterprise adoption in 2021.”“2021 is going to be a year of hybrid DLTs, interoperability and real-world integrations. We’re going to see it as a big transition year for the DLT space. Moving forward from the faulty mindset of “DLT is the cure” to the realistic understanding that DLT is a tool, just like artificial intelligence and cloud services.We should see a growing understanding that some DLTs are good for some things, while others are good for other things, and they can be combined in interesting ways for interesting solutions. Other big themes to watch out for include: interoperability between permissioned and permissionless DLTs for business applications, connection of IoT focused DLTs to cloud-hosted DLT environments, verification of key insights using DLT for consumer-facing solutions, and testing of more secure architectures in real-world environments predominantly in healthcare, energy, mobility and supply chain solutions where the ecosystems are highly fragmented or highly regulated.There are a lot of pragmatic and exciting things that are going to permeate through technology, affecting traditional tech companies with them showing strong commitments in the DLT space, and pushing their technologies in new and interesting ways.”“We believe 2021 will be the year institutional investors accept and agree with the Bitcoin thesis: that scarcity of the asset is paramount to long-term value. As such, we expect 2021 to be a very strong year for BitGo and the industry as a whole. A combination of factors brought on by the global COVID-19 pandemic, the influx of institutional investment and the bull run of Bitcoin will continue to accelerate growth and attract new investors on both the retail and institutional side in the new year.Longer term, we also see tremendous potential as the future of money depends on a transparent, cost-efficient way to conduct business across borders, as well as help people around the globe have greater access and freedom to build financial security. We feel strongly that we will continue to accelerate growth in 2021 and attract new investors on both the retail and institutional side.”“Adoption of the Ethereum mainnet by enterprise customers and early-stage adoption of privacy-enabled DeFi by enterprise users. Rapid maturing of DeFi security and audit tools. Early adoption of decentralized business applications beyond finance. A shift from DApps to ZApps — zero-knowledge applications that do the same work, but support user privacy. First regulatory frameworks that specifically cover fiat-currency-linked stablecoins and their use in consumer and business applications.”“Nearly every year has been better than the year before. I don’t think this is going to change for 2021.”“In 2021 we’re going to see Bitcoin make incredible gains as more and more institutional players jump in. However, we’re also going to see a tidal wave of shitcoinery wash over the retail market as scammers try to ride on Bitcoin’s aura to enrich themselves.”“We think a lot of these existing trends around institutionalization will continue and expect to see a lot of growth, particularly within decentralized credit and decentralized derivative offerings over the next 12–18 months.We think that investors will start looking at crypto a bit differently, as people view Bitcoin more as a store of value and start looking at the utility value of other coins. This could lead to a reduced correlation between traditional crypto assets and greater investment opportunities.”“This year was a warm-up for next year. In 2021, we’ll see decentralized storage, decentralized finance and non-political currencies take off.My picks for top performers are Bitcoin, Ether and Filecoin. However, Ethereum scaling issues need to be resolved next year if we expect to see continued success in 2022.”These quotes have been edited and condensed.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors’ alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

105,"Bitcoin (BTC) received a fitting yet accidental birthday present on Jan. 4 as the Financial Times made it front-page news on the 12 anniversary of its genesis block.Released on Monday, the FT's upcoming headline had already made the rounds on crypto social media prior to publication. The left-hand column of the front page was dedicated to Bitcoin's price surge, while the accompanying price chart made it as the paper's lead image.The timing could not have been any more conspicuous, coming just one day after Bitcoin celebrated its 12th birthday. On Jan. 3, 2009, another mainstream newspaper, United Kingdom-based The Times, led with the now-infamous headline ""Chancellor on Brink of Second Bailout for Banks,"" which was added to Bitcoin's first block of transactions, also known as the genesis block.Keeping Bitcoin company in 2021 was a headline, which some may argue is just as fitting, relating to coronavirus lockdowns — something that has wrought huge economic damage and sparked money printing on an unprecedented scale.Unsurprisingly, proponents of Bitcoin as sound money and an escape from fiat inflation were in a celebratory mood as the FT headline went public.""On the 1st business day of 2021, #Bitcoin takes its rightful place atop the Financial Times,"" Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, summarized to Twitter followers, adding a quote by French author Victor Hugo.Just published: front page of the Financial Times international edition Monday January 4 https://t.co/0ANz1YQw27 pic.twitter.com/lN2t2CBKVUAs Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin has already set itself apart as a macro investment in 2021, having beaten traditional assets outright in just four days. Much the same was true for 2020 and most years before, with only other cryptocurrencies and later Tesla stock providing meaningful competition.""Bitcoin and Ether $ETH are already the biggest hits of 2021,"" Gemini exchange co-founder Tyler Winklevoss tweeted as the week began.Jan. 3 also saw a marked decline in exchange balances, reminiscent of a publicity effort by Bitcoin OG Trace Mayer over the past three years.Dubbed ""Proof of Keys,"" Mayer appealed to investors to remove their coins from exchanges en masse on the same day in January as a means of taking control of one's finances and abiding by the Bitcoin ethos of ""being your own bank.""On Monday, however, the trend had already reversed, with sudden volatility in Bitcoin seeing funds return to exchange order books."
106,"Bitcoin (BTC) crashing to $27,700 and rebounding seconds later was a shock for some and financial ruin for others, data shows.According to on-chain analytics resource Glassnode, futures traders with long positions lost a total of $190 million on Binance alone in a single hour — the most in history.The figures underscore the current face of Bitcoin as it circles new all-time highs and together with Ether (ETH) becomes the hottest ticket of 2021.Longs had seen almost unbridled success throughout much of December 2020 and into the new year, with upside seeing little in the way of resistance. Despite warnings from various analysts that the bull run could not last uninterrupted forever, plenty of traders took on substantial risk, betting heavily on new highs continuing. In the event, $34,800 marked a definitive top, with BTC/USD subsequently shedding $7,000 in 24 hours, including $4,000 in under 60 minutes on Monday.The result for those who were overleveraged was plain to see.""$190,000,000 (in long positions) were liquidated on #Binance within 10 minutes. Largest value to date,"" Glassnode commented alongside a chart showing Binance liquidations.As Cointelegraph reported, last week, it was short positions that came in for mass liquidation as Bitcoin tore through $30,000 for the first time. That episode lost short traders a combined $100 million across exchanges.""Get used to 5k dips as we go to $100k. Comes with the territory,"" Samson Mow, chief strategy officer of Bitcoin technology firm Blockstream, summarized on Twitter as the volatility continued.Derivatives trading attached to Bitcoin and Ether, meanwhile, shows no sign of fading in popularity. CME Group, one of the pioneers in Bitcoin futures, is set to launch Ether futures in the first quarter of this year."
107,"Bitcoin (BTC) lost $30,000 support on Jan. 4 as all-time highs gave way to a rapid retracement totaling thousands of dollars.Data from Cointelegraph Markets, Coin360 and TradingView showed BTC/USD shedding more than 12% in just one hour on Monday.The pullback gathered pace after choppy trading behavior overnight on Sunday, with altcoins rising to take an ever-larger slice of Bitcoin's market capitalization dominance.At press time, amid heavy volatility, lows focused on $27,700 amid a bounce to nearer $30,000.Exchange activity was picking up, data showed, with inflows rising dramatically on the day after traders removed funds last week.""Just woke up to the biggest $BTC dip we've had since breaking 20k,"" Venture Coinist podcast host Luke Martin summarized. Those brought Bitcoin in line with short-term predictions from Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe, who identified the lower bound for Bitcoin in his latest YouTube video update.""If we want to see some support zones on Bitcoin and expecting where we're going to move from, the first area is around $29,600, second area is around $27,600,"" he said just before the major losses took hold.As Cointelegraph reported, statistician Willy Woo was unfazed on Sunday about a significant pullback, arguing that only a freak occurrence could take BTC/USD to $24,000 — the site of a ""gap"" in Bitcoin futures markets left from December.$27,700, meanwhile, fills the gap created on CME Bitcoin futures markets over the weekend, a classic move that had been absent from previous weeks."
108,"Bitcoin (BTC) is almost unrecognizable as it starts the first working week of 2021, retaining the $30,000 support and hitting astronomical new highs.Hard to believe for hodlers, price action continues to wow as Monday gets underway, and attention is turning to what might be next.Cointelegraph takes a look at five factors that investors might wish to monitor in the coming days in what is one of the most volatile Bitcoin trading markets in history.It’s another curious week for stocks as last week’s all-time highs on several indexes look set to continue.As the first few days of the new year drew to a close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 hit record highs — this despite the encroaching coronavirus sparking ever tighter lockdowns across the world.For Bitcoiners, the Dow took on a different type of significance last week, with BTC/USD “flipping” its 30,600 points for the first time as it continued on to $34,000 and higher.This week, analysts predict stocks to go higher still, part of a long-anticipated rebound which, much like last year, appears at odds with the situation on the ground.“A strong vaccine-led recovery in global growth will provide a large boost to cyclical assets, including commodities, cyclical equity sectors and emerging markets,” Goldman Sachs told Bloomberg as part of its 2021 outlook survey.Not everyone was so bullish. Fidelity, the asset manager well known for its pioneering pro-Bitcoin stance, countered:After clinching $34,800 over the weekend, Bitcoin is looking decidedly in need of a consolidatory period as the week gets underway.The highs, which still seem unreal to many investors, have plenty of hurdles to overcome in order to defend themselves and not allow Bitcoin to cave to the bears.One of the most pressing issues for traders is the Bitcoin futures “gap” produced by the weekend’s volatility. Lying between $29,695 and $32,400, the gap joins the one left last week as one of the largest ever seen on the Bitcoin futures chart.As Cointelegraph has previously explained, “gaps” in futures are the differences in price between the end of futures trading on a Friday and the start on the following Monday. When heavy volatility hits in between, the resulting void often forms a short-term price target.In this case, Bitcoin thus has an impetus to retest levels at just below $30,000. Should it wish to fill lower gaps that remain untested, the market may dip further still. The pit of last weekend’s gap lies at $23,800.While previous months saw many a gap get filled, however, the idea of a $24,000 Bitcoin is now a remote possibility, according to popular statistician Willy Woo.“We'll never see $20k BTC again,” he forecast on Sunday.$20,000 itself forms a zone of interest for those studying gaps, with two large vacuums in futures markets still open below that significant level.It’s all change for the better among Bitcoin’s core fundamentals, meanwhile. After a month of small decreases, network difficulty is once again set to push upward to hit new record highs.At the next automated readjustment later this week, difficulty is currently expected to increase by just over 5%.The past two readjustments saw drops of 2.5% and 0.4%, respectively, an interesting contrast to the rapid increases in spot price seen at the same time.Difficulty is arguably Bitcoin’s most important technical aspect when it comes to its status as “hard” money, allowing the network essentially to govern itself and stay secure regardless of miner participation or price action.In tandem with difficulty, hash rate is likewise challenging all-time highs. As of Monday, seven-day average values for the metric stand at 145 exahashes per second (EH/s), just 1 EH/s off record highs seen October 2020.Hash rate refers to the computing power dedicated to participating in the Bitcoin network, and current data suggests that participation and desire to keep the network secure is stronger than ever.Perhaps the most telling sign when it comes to price trajectory is coming from within cryptocurrency itself.While Bitcoin alone is impressive, this weekend ended with an even more conspicuous surge in altcoins, specifically Ether (ETH). The largest altcoin is up over 30% in the past 24 hours alone, bringing its weekly gains above 50%.As Cointelegraph reported, Sunday saw it clinch a key level against BTC, and in dollar terms, the largest altcoin is back in four figures for the first time in three years.In the words of Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe, such a move suggests that a return of “alt season” — a period of rapid rises across altcoin markets while Bitcoin consolidates — has de facto arrived.“Another week that Ethereum will close above the crucial threshold on the BTC pair,” he commented late Sunday.The token’s success was long in forming. Ether spent much of 2020 as the butt of jokes among Bitcoiners, as even the release of its long-awaited Ethereum 2.0 protocol transformation failed to have a noticeable impact on price.Nonetheless, the altcoin was in fact the best investment of the year, outperforming Bitcoin versus its March lows when it traded at just $113 — one-tenth of current levels.If Ether is dictating the reemergence of altcoins, such as THETA, for example, it is already evident if one examines the state of Bitcoin’s market dominance.As ETH/USD surged overnight on Sunday, the share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization owned by Bitcoin began to fall dramatically. Against 73.5% earlier on Sunday, press-time levels are more like 68.3%, data shows.That kind of behavior is a classic indicator of alt season and will remind longtime hodlers of the events of January 2018. At the time, Bitcoin was coming down from highs of near $20,000, but altcoins exploded, with ETH/USD hitting current all-time highs of $1,500.Given that Bitcoin has managed to crush its own record from 2017, it is that pattern of behavior that is fuelling speculation that Ether and other altcoins will go much higher in the short term.“Bitcoin and ether ETH are already the biggest hits of 2021,” Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of exchange Gemini, summarized to Twitter followers.It’s not just Ether. Litecoin (LTC), the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has added 15% since Sunday, once more coming within a hair of flipping XRP to take the number three spot.XRP, beset by problems thanks to legal action against Ripple, has still managed to put in some form of progress, rising by almost 10% overnight to reclaim $0.24."
109,"There are many investors feeling validated in the cryptocurrency market now that Bitcoin’s price has established a new all-time high of $34,778. The last time Bitcoin (BTC) traded anywhere near this level was during the bull run of 2017, when it reached a peak of about $19,783. Even the mainstream media took notice, including the New York Times, which observed that the current rally had “a very different feel to it than the last time around.”Many in the cryptocurrency community would agree. Therefore, it’s essential to take a deeper look at the factors that are driving the current rally.Bitcoin hits a new all-time high with a very different feeling to it than the last time around. https://t.co/N5M4EzblOWIn 2017, Bitcoin’s bull run was largely believed to have been fuelled by retail investors who were placing speculative bets on a nascent BTC market and other smaller-cap cryptocurrencies from the initial coin offering craze.At that time, there were reportedly millions of retail investors in South Korea, Japan and China that became a force in the market. Back then, it was the “average Joe” powering Bitcoin’s more-than-1,300% gain that year, as pointed out in the Wall Street Journal by IG Group chief market strategist Chris Weston.Fast forward to 2020, and the investor landscape has changed dramatically. Institutional investors, who largely remained on the side-lines in the first bull run, have been the face of the rally this time around.These investors are largely expected to take long-term holding positions with no intentions of selling anytime soon. They are also flocking to the Bitcoin futures markets, where open interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange recently surpassed $1 billion, and they are strengthening their balance sheets with BTC rather than letting it sit in cash.While it is not unusual for institutional investors to be ahead of the curve, it’s worth repeating that they were not the first ones out of the gate in crypto. In fact, many of the leaders in corporate America who are now entering Bitcoin for the first time are now the very people who dismissed Bitcoin back then.For example, in October, PayPal announced that it would support cryptocurrency transactions across the 26 million merchants on its platform. Users can also buy, hold or sell cryptocurrencies on the PayPal platform, including Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).The irony is that Bill Harris, the former CEO of PayPal, warned in 2018 that Bitcoin had no value and was headed toward zero — he even labeled it as a scam. PayPal is rivaled only by Jack Dorsey’s Square for the pace at which large companies are buying up Bitcoin.Wall Street firms previously shied away from Bitcoin because of its volatility, chalking it up as a risky asset at best and “rat poison squared” at worst, according to Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett. While Buffett has yet to come around on crypto, other big investors are diving in.Billionaire traders from Paul Tudor Jones to Stanley Druckenmiller have turned bullish on Bitcoin, both of whom have been touting the leading cryptocurrency over physical gold.In 2017, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon threatened to fire employees who traded Bitcoin, but now the firm is publishing bullish analyst reports on the digital asset. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock — the world’s largest asset manager — also seems to be warming up to Bitcoin, suggesting that it is not outside the realm of possibility that Bitcoin would “evolve into a global market.” He stated:Meanwhile, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor was a first mover in corporate America into the Bitcoin space, but he wasn’t always a fan. Back in 2013, Saylor said that Bitcoin’s days were numbered and that the market was destined to suffer a similar fate as online gambling.Then, in an unexpected turn of events, Saylor decided to make Bitcoin the company’s primary treasury reserve asset, scooping up $425 million worth of BTC for the balance sheet. That investment is worth $1.56 billion at last check. On Dec. 4, Saylor upped the ante by purchasing even more BTC.MicroStrategy has purchased approximately 2,574 bitcoins for $50.0 million in cash in accordance with its Treasury Reserve Policy, at an average price of approximately $19,427 per bitcoin. We now hold approximately 40,824 bitcoins.https://t.co/nwZcM9zAXZAnother key difference is that Bitcoin’s price started off the year in 2017, trading at about $1,000. In 2020, BTC’s price began trading at $7,200. So, it’s much more expensive today, and not all retail investors may realize that they don’t have to buy an entire Bitcoin to gain exposure to the asset.The fly in the ointment in 2020, however, was COVID-19. For individual investors, the economic slowdown might have thrown a wrench into any investment plans. U.S. unemployment, for instance, is hovering at 6.7%, which means that the economy still has a steep hill to climb if mom-and-pop investors are going to dig themselves out of the hole from the pandemic.High unemployment translates to low disposable income, and Uncle Sam hasn’t been too helpful. While BTC might be designed to be a great democratizing force, that control can’t be harnessed by people who are struggling with the economic realities of 2020.Additionally, unlike 2017, East Asian investors have reportedly been unloading their Bitcoin this year at an unprecedented pace.While #Bitcoin has hit ATH this week, a trend has been playing out that could change face of crypto market: a massive flow of coin to US from East Asia. Shift in center of gravity being driven by an increasing appetite for bitcoin among bigger US investors https://t.co/8Zo3CBbjBW pic.twitter.com/8hoCiTfT0iWhile the cryptocurrency market may remain in its early innings, it is more mature than it was in 2017. Much of the froth has been weeded out, and it is no longer considered to be the Wild West in many ways.Despite any retail investor hesitation, channels to entry are growing rapidly, with new exchanges increasingly coming online, including those that are decentralized in nature. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ATMs, which are becoming a competitive and convenient gateway for retail investors, are expanding their footprint across the globe.Unlike institutional investors, such as Jack Dorsey, whose approach to buying Bitcoin is so complex that he published an investment white paper about it, retail investors can turn to something familiar with Bitcoin ATMs, or BTMs.As the BTM market begins to mature and the list of genuine operators expands, crypto retail investors may finally have an easy gateway to entry. For example, CoinFlip, one of the largest BTM operators, rolled out thousands of BTMs across the U.S., focusing on locations where people are without bank accounts or internet access.This cash-to-Bitcoin approach offers retail investors a simple and convenient method to enter the Bitcoin market and, according to Ben Weiss, chief operating officer of CoinFlip, is designed to empower those locked out of the traditional banking system.Not all Bitcoin ATMs are equal, however, and there are some shady operators out there that are charging fees in the 20% range — a practice that runs against the democratizing principles on which Bitcoin was founded. Fortunately, a growing number of companies are trending toward slashing fees, with CoinFlip and CoinSource taking 6.99% and 11%, respectively.More important than Square investing $50mm in #Bitcoin is sharing how we did it (so others can do the same): https://t.co/35ABYHuz4fAs the moderate companies lower their fees and the predatory Bitcoin ATM operators fade, retail investors can once again enjoy easy access to a digital asset whose popularity is only growing stronger.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

110,"Bitcoin (BTC) has consistently been hitting new all-time highs over the weekend, but the latest surge has also created a new high against gold, according to MarketWatch data. This suggests that Bitcoin has been gaining acceptance as the new store of value and that may attract more customers away from gold into Bitcoin. Analysts suggest that the latest rally above $30,000 could have been triggered by aggressive buying from institutional investors on Coinbase, as suggested by the large premium of about $350 compared to the price in Binance.With the latest rally, Bitcoin hit a market capitalization of over $640 billion today, just shy of Alibaba, the ninth-largest company in terms of market cap, at $649.31 billion. Meanwhile, breaking $30,000 could be creating FOMO among institutional investors who have missed buying Bitcoin at lower levels.However, this buying will need to sustain to keep the uptrend intact because if the rally stalls, some institutional investors and momentum traders who have purchased at lower levels may be tempted to book profits.If that happens, it could pull the price down quickly and turn the recent purchases by investors into a loss, resulting in a rush to the exit. Therefore, traders must be cautious and employ proper risk management strategies to protect their paper profits.Meanwhile, let’s look at the charts of top-five cryptocurrencies that could extend their up-move if the sentiment remains bullishBitcoin broke above the $30,000 overhead resistance on Jan. 2 and picked up momentum, which could have been due to a short squeeze and continued buying from the momentum traders.While a parabolic rally provides outsized returns within a short time, it also increases the possibility of a sharp reversal that may catch many traders off guard because after such a strong up-move, the price could retrace anywhere between 62% to 79% of the entire rally.If that happens, the BTC/USD pair could drop to the $20,000 mark, or a drop of over 30%, which at the moment looks unimaginable.In a melt-up, it is difficult to predict the level where the rally may end because traders continue to chase prices higher due to FOMO. The next technical level which may act as a resistance is $37,000.Shorting a rally because it is overbought on all time frames could be a losing proposition because, during a blowoff top, the price could continue to remain overbought for much longer than most traders expect.But traders who own long positions should use proper risk management principles to protect their paper profits and not get carried away by greed.The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls are buying on dips to the 20-exponential moving average. The bears have not been able to break the 50-simple moving average support since the price broke above $20,000.Thus, the first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-EMA. Such a move will suggest that traders may be booking profits after the sharp rally. A deeper correction below the 50-SMA may signal a possible change in trend.There is a major resistance at $37,000 but if that is crossed, the rally could reach $40,000, which could again act as a stiff resistance.Ether (ETH) resumed its uptrend after a two-day minor correction on Jan. 2 and has followed it up with another strong up-move today. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought territory suggest that the bulls are in command.The bulls easily propelled the price above the $840.93 to $900 resistance today. The next resistance on the upside is $1,000. If the price turns down from this level, the bulls will try to defend the $840.93 breakout level.If that happens and the ETH/USD pair rebounds off this support, the bulls will once again try to resume the up-move. On the other hand, if the bears sink the price back below $840.93, a drop to the 20-day EMA ($700) is possible.A break below this level may be an indication that the pair may have topped out in the short-term.The 4-hour chart shows that the momentum picked up after the bulls pushed the price above the $840.93 resistance. The latest leg of the rally has pushed the RSI deep into the overbought zone, suggesting that a minor correction or consolidation could be around the corner.The wick on the latest candlestick suggests profit-booking by traders near $975, but if the bulls do not give up much ground and the pair rebounds off $900, it will increase the possibility of a break above $1,000.This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down and breaks below the $840.93 support and the 50-SMA.Polkadot (DOT) is currently consolidating in a strong uptrend. The bears are attempting to defend the $9.50 overhead resistance while the bulls are buying on dips to the $7.89 support.The DOT/USD pair closed in the red on Jan. 1 but the bulls made a strong comeback on Jan. 2. This shows that the traders are not waiting for a deeper correction to buy as they expect the prices to rally further.If the bulls can propel the price above the $9.50 to $9.89 overhead resistance zone, the uptrend could resume with the next likely target at $12.29.However, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the pair could remain range-bound for a few more days. The pair may lose its bullish momentum if the price slides and sustains below the $7.89 support.The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls are buying on dips to the 20-EMA. This suggests that the sentiment remains positive. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that bulls have the upper hand.If the bulls can push and sustain the price above $9.50 for four hours, the next leg of the uptrend could begin.However, if the price again turns down from the overhead resistance, the bears will try to sink the price below the 20-EMA. If they succeed, the momentum may weaken and the pair may remain range-bound between $7.89 to $9.50 for a few days.Binance Coin (BNB) resumed its uptrend today when the bulls pushed the price to a new all-time high at $41.5372. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest that bulls are in control.The next target on the upside is $46 and then $50. This zone is likely to act as a stiff resistance.However, the current breakout is facing profit booking above $40. If the bulls fail to sustain the price above $40, the BNB/USD pair may remain range-bound between $36 and $40 for a few more days.A break below the 20-day EMA ($34.99) will suggest that the bullish sentiment has weakened and traders have started booking profits.The 4-hour chart shows that the bears are selling aggressively above the $41 levels, as seen from the long wicks on the latest two candlesticks.If the price dips back below $40, it could find support at the 20-day EMA. A strong rebound off this level will suggest demand at lower levels and the bulls may again try to resume the uptrend.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the moving averages, it will suggest a possible change in the short-term trend.Uniswap (UNI) broke out of the $2.90 to $4 tight consolidation on Dec. 30 and surged to $5.29 on Dec. 31. The bears are currently attempting to stall the up-move at the $5.60 resistance but the positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground.The upsloping 20-day EMA ($4.06) and the RSI above 67 suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the bulls can drive the price above $5.60, the UNI/USD pair could extend the uptrend and rally to $7.50 and then to $8.60.Contrary to this assumption, if the price again turns down from $5.60, the pair may remain range-bound between $4.50 and $5.60 for a few days. The positive view will be refuted if the bears sink the price below the $4 support.The 4-hour chart shows that the price has broken out of the symmetrical triangle. If the bulls can sustain the breakout, the pair could start its journey to the pattern target at $6.On the contrary, if the price slips back into the triangle, it could drop to the 20-EMA. A strong rebound off this support will indicate accumulation at lower levels and the bulls will once again try to resume the up-move.This positive view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the triangle.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

111,"Twitter analytics data indicates that as Bitcoin continues to post all-time highs well into the $30,000s, social media interest in the digital currency is likewise setting new records across numerous key metrics. In a tweet Saturday night, the official handle for The TIE, a cryptocurrency data firm, showed that the number of unique Twitter handles tweeting about Bitcoin has hit a new all-time high, eclipsing a 64,000 mark last seen during the peak of the 2017 bull run:The number of unique Twitter accounts tweeting about #Bitcoin has just hit an all-time high of 66,832, surpassing the previous high of 64,652 set on 12/27/2017. pic.twitter.com/wW8t4fqeITJoshua Frank, CEO of The TIE, provided Cointelegraph with additional information indicating that the interest is only continuing to grow, and that it’s not limited to Bitcoin. According to Frank, since The TIE’s tweet the number of unique handles posting about Bitcoin has risen above 70,000 for the first time ever, the total tweet volume has eclipsed the December 2017 high of 135,000 to reach 140,000, and the overall number of crypto tweets has also hit a new high of nearly a quarter million in a 24-hour period.The increased volume isn’t limited to Twitter, however. As Cointelegraph has previously reported, search volume for “Bitcoin” is climbing in stride with the cryptocurrency’s price. Likewise, “how to buy bitcoin” is soaring as well.Curiously, however, searches for “how to buy Ethereum” remain low, despite a 20% 24-hour surge to as high as $950 at press time:Many have speculated that the rise is due to ""FOMO"" from institutions, which in turn is now seizing retail investors likewise caught in speculative mania. "
112,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed $34,700 to achieve a new all-time high after a strong overnight rally. Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, also surpassed $800 for the first time since May 2018.Bitcoin’s sudden rally comes as a surprise because it corrected sharply to around $30,300 on Jan. 2. Within 24 hours, BTC rose from $30,300 to as high as $34,778, a 14% rebound.When the price of Bitcoin surpassed $33,000 on Jan. 2, some whales and high-net-worth investors warned that a 150 BTC sell order could retrace the market.A pseudonymous Bitcoin trader known as “i.am.nomad” wrote:Within hours he pinpointed the risk of a Bitcoin correction due to thin order books, BTC sharply pulled back.However, Bitcoin recovered quickly after the initial drop, rallying to a new record-high within 24 hours.The main catalysts behind Bitcoin’s rally have been the institutional accumulation of BTC on Coinbase and the short squeeze on Binance Futures.Throughout the past three days, Bitcoin has been trading much higher on Coinbase than on other major exchanges, as Cointelegraph reported.This means that aggressive buyers on Coinbase were continuously accumulating BTC despite the premium.In the meantime, many traders on Binance Futures were shorting BTC, possibly expecting Bitcoin to top out at around $30,000. When Coinbase buyers continued to push BTC upwards, a short squeeze occurred. Analysts at Santiment explained:Ether price rallied off of Bitcoin’s strong technical momentum. ETH/USD rose past $800 for the first time since early May 2018, demonstrating renewed momentum after stagnating throughout December.A pseudonymous cryptocurrency trader known as “Mayne” said on Jan. 2 before the Ether rally that ETH is likely heading to $800. He said:Ethereum has another major catalyst on the horizon as the CME futures exchange plans to launch ETH futures in February.Considering the high level of institutional demand for Bitcoin since the first quarter of 2020, the demand could also boost Ether upon the listing.Meanwhile, Bitcoin remains on an upward trajectory of price discovery, hitting new record highs on a daily basis. With a purported supply shortage and an institutional buying frenzy now spilling over into retail, the rally may still have a lot more room to run with $35,000 likely being the next psychological level to break. As Cointelegraph reported, six-figure predictions have become increasingly common in recent months, particularly as the rally has broken new all-time highs. "
113,"Another year has come and gone. The rollercoaster that was 2020 requires little (if any) preamble. It must be said, however, that the blockchain segment experienced something of a return to form during these otherwise painful latter days. Indeed, we closed the year with prices on the up, legal ambiguities increasingly dehazed, and the adoption of distributed technology at a historic apex. With these expository factors lighting our way, let us take a moment to gaze into the future, as speculatively foreseen by the staff at Cointelegraph.We asked our teammates where they saw our industry heading in 2021. The following represents a narrative amalgamation of their responses.Bulls, bubbles, BitcoinWe have witnessed parabolic prices shortly after halvings, followed by multi-year long periods of bearish exhaustion, twice in the past decade. Signs seem to point to a continuation of this trend as we enter 2021. How high will everyone’s favorite gold analogue inflate before glissading back down to earth? It’s anyone’s guess.Unlike past markets, which were guided largely by consumer adoption, the present bull run appears motivated by different forces. At long last and with deafening resound, traditional institutions and mega investors have taken notice of our once-niche collective. Others are likely to follow the road paved by Grayscale, MicroStrategy, Square and Paul Tudor Jones once they have weighed their risks against the reward. If this trend continues on its current trajectory, the resulting market scarcity could propel numerous cryptocurrencies upward to prices that some may find offensive to reason.We are likely to observe a continued shift in the narrative for Bitcoin (BTC) and other blue-chip crypto assets, as blockchain tech sheds its scandalous affectations for the luster of respectability. Talks of Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset may emanate through the coming year, especially with the unrelenting presence of COVID-19 and the ostensible, inflation-driven collapse of cornerstone fiat currencies.Payments services may scramble to include native crypto features and integrate enterprise use cases for blockchain tech, following transaction giant PayPal’s entry into the space. The prospect of a finally-approved Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or ETF, may also encourage greater frenzy, asset appreciation and narrative maturation.While an abundance of price euphoria is (with any luck) close at hand, it is important to note that no bull run lasts forever. And as the saying goes, the bigger they are...DeFi risingDecentralized finance was undoubtedly the talk of 2020. This experimental and tenderfooted form of nouveau commerce shifts important financial pillars, such as currency exchange, collateral loans, reserve asset distribution, credit scoring and savings accounts, into the decentralized hands of consumers. A foundation of smart contracts, or code-based commitments that self-execute when a series of predefined parameters are met, governs these burgeoning systems. Like Bitcoin before them, many DeFi platforms reclaim their user’s sovereignty from the too-big-to-fail institutions that so many have come to distrust.While the majority of parties surveyed for this article agreed that DeFi innovation was sure to proliferate throughout 2021 and beyond, not all aspects of this rising star were expected to prevail. In fact, the number one trend that our writers and editors felt had run its course was the controversial asset distribution paradigm known as yield farming.Yield farming is yet another way of rewarding a platform’s users for their engagement. Parties providing liquidity to a decentralized exchange, for instance, may be compensated with an allocation of the platform’s proprietary token. Such tokens generate any number of benefits, including governance capabilities and the nebulous inevitability of price speculation. While financial motivation — i.e., greed — often drives users to participate in a given platform’s offering, the community as a whole has grown ever wearied by an excess of scams, hacks, rug pulls, contract malfunctions and platform collapses.Millions of dollars in value were lost in 2020 to the colorable scourge that is yield farming. An air of insatiable avarice tempted users to lock their assets into often unaudited smart contracts, developed more often than not by anonymous actors, and leading at times to disastrous results. Who could resist the lure of 70,000% APY, ultimately?Like most blockchain advancements, these protocols are merely a tool, however. It is the opinion of your humble author that in just hands, such rewards systems may yet provide the cornerstone of a brighter tomorrow.Big brother is still watchingThere are few certainties we might allow ourselves when it comes to the future of blockchain, save one: Increased regulatory scrutiny is sure to march ever forward.There are a lot of unknowns as-yet uncovered when it comes to governing decentralized technology. Long overdue resolutions, such as those that might offer greater tax clarity to users, may soon be on the horizon for our nascent industry. In some situations, salient regulation may help (rather than hinder) the space. The tea leaves seem to indicate, for instance, that private stablecoin issuance will not be aggressively regulated for the time being. The ability to shelter in stable assets could further ease the friction and unease felt by new users as they face their first maelstrom of crypto volatility.Other questions linger unanswered. Is Ripple a security, and if it isn’t, why not? Will Facebook ever be allowed to launch its cryptocurrency? How many more SEC settlements can we expect from dinosaur-aged initial coin offerings? What kind of pressure will governments place on the innovations of DeFi? “Ask again later,” says Cointelegraph’s magic 8 ball.Increased regulation is not the only political action we might expect in 2021. Many countries are gearing up to launch their own central bank digital currencies — a sea change that will further cement blockchain technology’s place in the annals of history. Likewise, governments are eyeing the technology for a variety of internal and citizen-facing use cases. We are likely to find everything from increased structural efficiencies to voting transparency on the docket for governmental consideration in nations throughout the world in 2021.NFTs and the tokenization of brand equityNonfungible tokens are a little-understood chimera of decentralized utility. These tokens allow creators to manufacture assets that are provably unique, thereby crafting the ultimate launchpad for promotable digital ownership. There are few limits to what NFTs are capable of representing. Games with tokenized items and characters incite resource-based economies that stretch far beyond the experiences they inhabit. Digital artists find fresh renown and compensation through the distribution of conclusively one-of-a-kind masterpieces that, at times, allow their creators to profit, long after a work’s initial sale. They let interested parties divine the ownership of tangible products via transparent, on-chain means. Their use cases are vast, and their advocates increasingly bountiful.We saw everyone from international sports teams to legendary sci-fi actors launching creator and fan tokens in 2020. There is no reason why this trend should not continue, and even expand into fresh industries, over the course of 2021. When properly orchestrated, NFTs help to form closer relationships with a brand’s consumers. We can no doubt anticipate this asset class expanding into the influencer world, and soon to major brands, teams, charities and affinity groups. NFTs will open the backdoor to crypto for non-tech-savvy consumers, and eventually instigate the full tokenization of brand equity.Ethereum’s ascendancyWith the launch of Ethereum 2.0, we can likely expect a continuing heyday for the world’s most actively used blockchain. At the same time, the narratives around once-heralded “Ethereum killers,” such as Cardano and Polkadot, could shift further toward talks of “coinciding alongside ETH.” Many of these projects will likely thrive through a bravura of cross-chain enhancements.The creation of new oracles (and their relevant partnerships) should persevere into the imminent future, expanding the usefulness of the multifarious decentralized ecosystem. As useful on-chain data grows, it is probable that companies and governments will want to launch smart contracts of their own that utilize the environment’s ubiquity.Public content will only get us so far, however. 2021 may engender the propagation of private smart contracts which, though secured by public blockchains, ensure the confidentiality of their architects. Though the content and actions of these contracts may be obscured, their results should still remain verifiable to outside parties.Governance renaissanceThe globally scaled ability for sovereign individuals to self-govern without the need for electoral representation is a privilege denied to all who have come before us — but our world is changing. We have entered a new era, in which self-sufficient communities can thrive without extraneous funding or resources; a world in which platforms answer to their customers because their customers are also their authors, contributors and benefactors.A resurgence of past artifacts of distributed innovation such as decentralized autonomous organizations may spring forth in new and surprising ways, leading to a rethinking of what it means to be a “corporation.” Employees may begin to take control of their own destinies, revolutionizing the concept of work-life balance and pay equity. Companies that once committed atrocities in the name of their bottom line may be reigned in under the new management of direct democracy.Initial exchange offerings may soon fill the void left by 2017’s unregulated coin offerings. These should allow consumers to put their weight behind the ideas that inspire them without fearing the dearth of accountability, which was ever so present during the last bull run.Social networks and digital commonwealths may too be an untapped vein for crypto pioneers — an exemplar for the ever-teased promise of cryptographically-secure digital identities. The pinnacle of which will accommodate anonymity without sacrificing accountability.The dark recesses of humanityScams, digital ransoms, pump-and-dumps, pseudo-celebrity grifts and fork collapses. So they have been, and so they shall be. Let it be stated without dispute that the dark underbelly of humankind existed long before the creation of distributed technology, and it will persevere long after apocalyptic solar flares send our species back to a pre-industrial stone age. We have seen all manner of unscrupulous activity from the faceless filth that inhabits much of our digital society. Like a hydra, when one is toppled, two more rise.This trend will undoubtedly continue ever onward, though hopefully with the growing understanding that it is the people — not the technology — that are at fault.Let us, too, endeavor to counter this would-be lawlessness through the patient education of our family, friends, peers and digital strangers. Grandma doesn’t know that government officials do not demand questionable Bitcoin payments on threat of asset forfeiture. You need to tell her.In conclusionSo, there you have it. That’s it. That’s the tweet — All nigh-2,000 words of it. Get your 2021 bingo cards ready folks because it is up to you to hold these predictions to account.On behalf of the Cointelegraph team — Happy New Year, and many happy returns!The following members of our editorial team contributed their thoughts and predictions for this story: News reporters: Sam Bourgi, Lucas Caram, Cassio Gusson, Benjamin Pirus, Rachel Wolfson, Turner Wright; markets reporter: Marcel Pechman; U.S. editor: Jeffrey Albus; copy editor: Jonathan DeYoung; head of video: Jackson Dumont; policy editor: Kollen Post; technology editor: Andrey Shevchenko; weekend editor: Andrew Thurman; opinion editor: Max Yakubowski; managing editors of Cointelegraph Turkey — Erhan Kahraman, Cointelegraph Brasil — Rafaela Romano and Cointelegraph China — Amey Wang; editor-in-chief: Jon Rice; managing editor: Kristina Lucrezia Cornèr."
114,"Coinbase has seen a large spike in buyer activity overnight as the price of Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed $32,500 on Jan. 2. Analysts say the trend was reminiscent of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation, possibly fueled by institutional buy orders. As a result, BTC surpassed $31,000, reaching a new all-time high.In the last 48 hours, Coinbase has continuously seen a high premium compared to Binance. At one point, Bitcoin on the exchange was $100 more expensive than on Binance.When the price of Bitcoin surpassed $30,000, the premium reached as high as $350. For instance, when Bitcoin was trading at $30,000 on Binance, BTC was priced at $30,350 on Coinbase.Prior to the rally, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said that low Coinbase outflows posed a risk to Bitcoin’s rally. He said that outflows would have to increase for BTC to find new momentum, which it did. He said before the rally:As Bitcoin neared $29,500, Coinbase outflows began to spike. Ki said that they are possible over-the-counter (OTC) deals, which are typically bullish for BTC and exemplifies a wider trend of dwindling BTC reserves on exchanges.As we pump, another 34K btc got casually taken off exchange in the last few blocks pic.twitter.com/8r20JnOGajHigh-net-worth buyers use the OTC market to buy or sell large amounts of Bitcoin. Hence, when the signs of OTC deals emerged, Ki said this was positive for BTC. Merely two days after the outflows spiked, BTC surged past $30,000, reaching $31,400. Ki noted before BTC broke $30,000:According to Ashwath Balakrishnan, an analyst at Delphi Digital, Bitcoin became more compelling when it surpassed its all-time high.When the price of Bitcoin was hovering at around $4,000, the risk of a significant downside was high, combined with high uncertainty around the medium-term prospect of BTC.Hence, when Bitcoin surged past $20,000, the dominant cryptocurrency became more compelling for investors. He said:In the near term, a popular narrative that could buoy the Bitcoin price higher is the prediction that institutions might not have bought BTC in December due to potential accounting issues.As such, some analysts say that more institutions could jump into Bitcoin in the first quarter of 2021. If this happens, which would be evident through Grayscale’s assets under management and the CME Bitcoin futures market’s open interest, it would likely cause a broader BTC rally."
115,"Bitcoin (BTC) passing $30,000 and hitting highs of near $31,000 has caused huge pain for traders betting on a bearish pullback.Data from Cointelegraph Markets, Cryptometer and TradingView confirmed that as BTC/USD peaked at $30,960 on Jan. 2, it liquidated $100 million of shorts.Amid highly volatile conditions, Bitcoin attempted to crack $30,000 several times on New Year's Day and overnight before finally clinching the psychologically significant level on Saturday.The move was accompanied by a bullish charge which soon took the largest cryptocurrency even higher, with press-time levels attempting to crack $31,000.While many celebrated, however, some were left far worse off than just minutes previously. Liquidated short on XBTUSD: Buy 10,000,000 @ 30864 ~ I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!""I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!"" a telling tweet from a bot tracking liquidated trades on derivatives giant BitMEX summarized.Figures suggest that shorters on BitMEX alone lost $10 million, a grim reminder of the dangers involved in second guessing Bitcoin at crucial levels.Elsewhere, altcoin markets began to see changes of their own. Dogecoin (DOGE), a curious amover, gained 42% on the day, while leader Ether (ETH) surged back above $750.Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe, who believes that this month will herald the start of a broader ""alt season,"" was characteristically bullish.""The higher this impulse wave goes for #Bitcoin , the higher the next one will be as well. 2021 is going to be fire,"" he tweeted as $30,000 hit.Others in the top ten cryptocurrencies showed less volatile behavior, while nothing could lift XRP, still floundering amid legal problems at major investor Ripple Labs."
116,"Bitcoin (BTC) hit a fresh psychological landmark on Jan. 2 as the new year kicked off to a flying start for hodlers.Data from Cointelegraph Markets, Coin360 and TradingView showed BTC/USD clinch $30,000 during trading on Friday.After hitting new all-time highs of $29,700 overnight, the pair showed no signs of weakness, retesting the level several times before a final breakout occurred.The area immediately below $30,000 had proven a source of intense selling pressure throughout the past few days, a setup similar to that which Bitcoin disrupted at $20,000 just weeks ago.""If you're looking for an entry to HODL Bitcoin long term, don't nickel and dime an entry. You're not going to sweat a few thousand dollars of non-perfect entry when it's $100k,$200k,$300k in a year,"" popular statistician Willy Woo summarized on Friday.Among major altcoins, performance on the day was mixed, with Ether (ETH) staying flat below $740 despite Bitcoin's latest advances.Others also saw teething problems, among them Polkadot (DOT), which dropped 6.3% to dent its still strong weekly performance of 60% gains.A curious mover was XRP, which despite the pressure of legal proceedings against Ripple held steady at $0.23 after a 7% improvement on Friday."
117,"Celebrities have long been used to promote brands, products and services to varying degrees of success, and the cryptocurrency space has been no exception to this practice. In years gone by, the biggest names in the world of entertainment have made waves in the crypto space for endorsing or investing in projects, tokens and companies. Some have stayed, others have gone and a few have ended up in hot water for their forays into the crypto cauldron.2020 has also seen a number of celebrities from different walks of life enter the fray, and as per usual, the cryptocurrency community has been abuzz about the newcomers and their involvement. So, let’s take a look at the most notable celebrities who have joined, those who have left, and those who showed increased interest in the cryptocurrency ecosystem in 2020.Senegalese-American music star Akon is adored around the world not only for his chart-topping hits but also for his philanthropic and entrepreneurial work over the years. His Lighting Africa initiative has helped provide solar power energy solutions to 28 countries on the continent, and he’s also become a proponent for the use of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.In 2018, Akon revealed plans to launch a cryptocurrency called Akoin that will become the native currency of a futuristic city that he envisions building in his home country of Senegal. Fast forward a couple of years, and these plans were finally fleshed out and released to the public.Akon City is set to be a $6 billion cryptocurrency-powered city built on 2,000 acres of land that was reportedly given to him as a gift by Senegal’s president, Macky Sall. The city will be located near the Senegalese capital of Dakar.The first phase of construction of Akon City is expected to begin in the next few months and is touted to be completed by the end of 2023, with a construction contract having already been awarded to an American engineering firm.Primary infrastructure including roads, waste services and a solar power plant will be built in the first phase alongside a hospital campus, a mall, residential accommodations, hotels and a police station. In addition, parks, a sports stadium, an industrial complex and a university have been earmarked for construction in phase one as well. The city will also be largely dependent on renewable solar energy.As the project’s white paper details, the second phase of development is expected to take place over five years, from 2024 to 2029, and will culminate in the completion of Akon City and its running solely on an economy powered by the Akoin cryptocurrency and ecosystem.While Akon City may only become a living, breathing, crypto-powered city in 2030, Akon’s vision and ability to launch the plan into action in 2020 has certainly earned him a place on this list.The final season of Game of Thrones may have left many fans feeling underwhelmed, but its characters and their real-life actors have become beloved by many around the world. Maisie Williams, who plays the diminutive but deadly Arya Stark in the TV series, is another celebrity who joined the crypto community in 2020.In November, Williams took to Twitter to ask her 2.7 million followers if she should “go long on bitcoin” in a poll that garnered over 900,000 votes, 3,400 retweets, 3,700 comments and 16,000 likes.should i go long on bitcoin ?While the tally of the votes as of the end of December resulted in 53% of voters saying “no,” a swathe of influential figures from the world of cryptocurrency, blockchain and beyond added their two cents to the post.Renowned crypto podcast host Peter McCormack gave Williams a very maximalist response in his comment saying “Bitcoin and nothing else,” while Barry Silbert made reference to the deadly affliction known as “greyscale” in Game of Thrones when he suggested Williams explore investing through Grayscale’s digital-asset trusts.At the end of the day, Williams made up her own mind and “bought some anyway.” Arya Stark always did her own thing.Paris Hilton is an American celebrity, actress, model, reality TV star, DJ and singer who has also become a renowned entrepreneur through various retail ventures.In 2017, Hilton made a small foray into the cryptocurrency space during the height of the initial coin offering frenzy. In a now-deleted series of Twitter posts, Hilton expressed her interest in the ICO of LydianCoin, which later became embroiled in serious legal battles.Hilton later distanced herself from the project after its founder was convicted of domestic violence and battery, and she seemingly walked away from the world of crypto — until 2020, that is.In August, Hilton made headlines after announcing that she had sold a digital art piece of her cat, Munchkin, for a total of 40 Ether (ETH), which was worth around $17,000 at the time. Hilton’s digital painting was sold on an Ethereum-based auction platform called Cryptograph.Today I am auctioning off my @Cryptograph of #Munchkin to benefit 3 amazing charities: @LAFoodBank @MealsOnWheels @BB4Homeless. The auction is live now for the next 72 hours at https://t.co/rCroea8vCg pic.twitter.com/XP18LGtHsiHilton pledged the proceeds of the auction to three United States-based charities: the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, Meals On Wheels and Backpack Bed for Homeless.Following in the footsteps of Williams, American rapper Logic was also bitten by the Bitcoin bug recently. In a short video posted to his Instagram story on Nov. 20, Logic said that he’d bought $6 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) in October, before saying YOLO — you only live once.While it’s hard to tell if the 30-year-old rapper, who recently signed an exclusive deal with streaming platform Twitch, was being serious, his big-money move would have appreciated dramatically in the month since he bought Bitcoin.Logic’s Bitcoin acquisition would have snapped up 433 BTC at a price of around $13,850. Fast forward one month to Dec. 20, and his Bitcoin holdings would be worth in excess of $9 million if he kept on hodling.While a few notable celebrities have either entered the cryptocurrency space or made some meaningful contributions, a couple have exited the environment in unceremonious circumstances.American actor Steven Seagal aligned himself with a questionable cryptocurrency project in 2018 called Bitcoiin2Gen, which at the time claimed to be a “superior” version of Bitcoin. Seagal came on board as a brand ambassador for the project’s ICO, a move that would eventually land him in serious trouble with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Seagal’s deal saw him promote the Bitcoiin2Gen ICO on his social media channels for a number of months, in exchange for $250,000 in cash and $750,000 in B2G tokens. The project caught the attention of state-level regulators and received cease-and-desist orders, while Seagal ended up being a major target of legal proceedings by the SEC.In February, Seagal was ordered to pay back the compensation he’d received from Bitcoiin2Gen. According to documents filed with the SEC, Seagal maintained that he only received $157,000 from his promotional deal. The actor eventually agreed to settle the charges with the SEC, paying $330,000 to the commission.The SEC once again warned celebrities that they were bound by law to disclose any compensation received for using their social media platforms to promote securities.2020 also saw a couple of additional big-name celebrities exploring the world of cryptocurrencies through the use of their social media platforms, although they may well have been trolling the ever-zealous crypto-faithful.J. K. Rowling, world-renowned author of the Harry Potter series, took to Twitter in May to ask what she probably assumed was a simple question about Bitcoin in a thread with cryptocurrency journalist Leigh Cuen.I don’t understand bitcoin. Please explain it to me.Much like Williams’ situation, Rowling’s question caught the attention of the entire cryptosphere, with the likes of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, crypto author Saifedean Ammous, podcaster Laura Shin and even Elon Musk getting in on the discussion.The debate went on for days, while Rowling continually said that she still had not grasped how the cryptocurrency worked. The author was so inundated with responses that she eventually tweeted a day later that she might not ever be able to log back onto the social media platform without being derided for not owning Bitcoin. The hilarious incident and subsequent response from the cryptocurrency community is a reminder of the influence that celebrities can have on the space.Rowling was not the only major celebrity to get Crypto Twitter riled up in 2020. Enter Musk, CEO of Tesla and founder of SpaceX. He’s been known to jump onto Twitter from time to time and stir the pot with cryptic Tweets about the crypto space.Twice this year, Musk caused the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) to surge in value by simply mentioning its name in tweets. The latest incident happened in December as Musk “trolled” Bitcoin, describing it as “almost as bs [bullshit] as fiat money” before posting a short tweet reading: “One word: Doge.”The tweet saw the price of Dogecoin appreciate by 25% as the cryptocurrency began to trend on the platform. The thread of tweets also drew the attention of influential figures in the world of crypto.Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor, joined the conversation and offered to share his own Bitcoin acquisition strategy with Musk. MicroStrategy has bought more than $1 billion worth of BTC in 2020, having adopted the cryptocurrency as its primary treasury reserve asset. He stated:Musk replied asking if “such large transactions” were even possible, before Saylor offered to share his “playbook” offline with Musk “from one rocket scientist to another.” The MicroStrategy CEO holds dual degrees from MIT in aeronautics and astronautics, and in science, technology and society. So, let’s just hope that these two bright minds did actually slide into each other’s DMs to compare notes on all things crypto."
118,"2020 was the most important year for the crypto derivatives market so far. Both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) derivatives steadily grew throughout the year, with their futures and options products available across exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, OKEx, Deribit and Binance. On Dec. 31, Bitcoin options open interest reached an all-time high of $6.8 billion, which is three times the OI seen 100 days before that, signifying the speed at which the crypto derivatives market is growing amid this bull run.The bull run has led to a lot of new investors entering the market amid the uncertainty that plagues traditional financial markets due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These investors are looking to hedge their bets against the market through derivatives of underlying assets like Bitcoin and Ether.While there are multiple factors driving the growth of crypto derivatives, it’s safe to say that it has primarily been driven by interest from institutional investors, considering that derivatives are complex products that are difficult for the average retail investor to understand.In 2020, a variety of corporate entities such as MassMutual and MicroStrategy showed considerable interest by purchasing Bitcoin either for their reserves or as treasury investments. Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer of crypto derivatives exchange Deribit, told Cointelegraph:Strijers confirmed that as a platform, Deribit sees institutional investors entering the crypto space using trade instruments they are familiar with, like spot and options, which led to the tremendous growth in open interest throughout 2020.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is also a prominent marketplace for trading options and futures, especially for institutional investors, as the CME is the world’s largest derivatives trading exchange across asset classes, making it a familiar marketplace for institutions. It recently even overtook OKEx as the largest Bitcoin futures market. A CME spokesperson told Cointelegraph: “November was the best month of Bitcoin futures average daily volume (ADV) in 2020, and the second-best month since launch.”Another indicator of institutional investment is the growth in the number of large open interest holders, or LOIHs, of CME’s Bitcoin futures contracts. A LOIH is an investor that is holding at least 25 Bitcoin futures contracts, with each contract consisting of 5 BTC, making the LOIH threshold equivalent to 125 BTC — over $3.5 million. The CME spokesperson further elaborated:The fact that the crypto derivatives market is now in demand is a sign of maturity for assets like Bitcoin and Ether. Similar to their role in the traditional financial markets, derivatives offer investors a highly liquid, efficient way of hedging their positions and mitigating the risks associated with the volatility of crypto assets.There are several macroeconomic factors that are also causing the boost in demand for the crypto derivatives market. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, several large economies including the United States, the United Kingdom and India have been stressed due to limited working conditions and growing unemployment.This has caused several governments to roll out stimulus packages and engage in quantitative easing to reduce the impact on the base economy. Jay Hao, CEO of OKEx — a crypto and derivatives exchange — told Cointelegraph:There is a growing interest from the mining community and other companies generating income in Bitcoin looking to hedge their future earnings so as to be able to pay their operating expenses in fiat currencies.Besides institutional demand, there is a significant increase seen in retail activity as well, Strijers confirmed: “The unique accounts active on a monthly basis in our options segment keep rising. Reasons are overall (social) media attention to the potential of options.” The CME spokesperson also stated:Apart from Bitcoin futures and options, Ether derivatives have also grown tremendously in 2020. In fact, the CME even announced that it will be launching Ether futures in February 2021, which in itself is a sign of the maturity that Ether has reached in its life cycle.Previously, the crypto derivatives market was monopolized by products using Bitcoin as the underlying asset, but in 2020, Ether derivatives grew to take a significant share of the pie. Strijers further elaborated:The reason that Bitcoin derivatives make up a larger portion of the crypto derivatives market is that BTC is now well understood by the market and has received validation by large institutions, governing bodies and several prominent traditional investors. However, in 2020, there were several factors that influenced the demand for Ether derivatives as well. Hao believes that “The huge growth in DeFi in 2020 and the launch of ETH 2.0’s Beacon chain has definitely spurned more interest in Ether and, therefore, Ether derivatives.”However, even though Ether is continuing its bull run alongside Bitcoin and will likely see a further increase in demand for derivatives, it’s highly unlikely that BTC will be overtaken any time soon. Hao further elaborated: “We will see rising demand for both of these products, however, BTC as the number-one cryptocurrency will likely see the steepest growth as more institutional dollars flood the space.”Starting with the launch of CME’s Ether futures product in February, this year is set to be an even bigger year for crypto derivatives if the bull run continues. The market also recently witnessed the biggest options expiry yet, with nearly $2.3 billion worth of BTC derivatives expiring on Christmas.With traditional markets, the derivatives market is several times larger than the spot market, but it’s still the opposite with crypto markets. So, it seems the crypto derivatives market is still in its nascent stage and is set to grow exponentially as the industry expands in size. As volumes increase, markets tend to become more efficient and offer better price discovery for the underlying asset, as Strijers added:Apart from Bitcoin and Ether derivatives, there are altcoin derivatives products that are offered on various exchanges, most popularly perpetual swaps but also even options and futures. Hao elaborated further on these products and their demand prospects:Even though institutional investors are not flocking to the derivatives products of these altcoins just yet, that is set to change with the further growth of decentralized finance markets and the use cases that they can offer. Ultimately, this can translate into a rise in demand for more crypto derivatives in the near future."
119,"Bitcoin price claimed another all-time high on Friday, this time against gold, offering further confirmation that demand for digital assets is on the rise. As Bitcoin (BTC) zipped past $29,000 on Friday, the digital currency reached a high of 15.40 gold ounces, surpassing the previous peak from December 2017, according to MarketWatch data.According to U.Today, the Bitcoin-gold rate peaked at 15.62 ounces during the early morning.2020 was a watershed year for Bitcoin as institutional adoption helped catalyze a bull market unlike any we’ve seen thus far in its 11-year history. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin saw a massive increase of around 300% in 2020.Gold also posted impressive gains for the year, though they paled in comparison to Bitcoin’s meteoric rise. The yellow metal’s spot price ended the year on a 25% gain.Bitcoin’s biggest proponents believe the digital currency is eating away at gold’s market cap as investors opt for the efficiency, portability and proven scarcity of the asset. Astonishingly, that view is also shared by JPMorgan Chase analysts, who believe Bitcoin’s digital gold narrative is drawing capital away from precious metals.Some believe that Bitcoin’s supply squeeze could send prices higher over the course of 2021. As Cointelegraph recently reported, digital asset manager Grayscale bought up nearly three times the BTC mined in December. Demand from PayPal, Cash App and others has also contributed to an apparent supply shortage of BTC."
120,"Bitcoin (BTC) rallied from an intraday low at $17,573.29 on Dec. 11 to an intraday high at $29,310.19 on Dec. 31, a 66.78% rally in a short span. This shows strong demand from traders at every higher level.Institutional crypto investment giant Grayscale bought 72,950 Bitcoin in December, which was 159.49% more than the 28,112 Bitcoin mined during that period, according to data from Coin98 Analytics.It is not only the institutions buying — a strong bull run also attracts speculators and momentum traders who try to piggyback on the up-move. This can be seen from the surge in Bitcoin’s transaction volume in December 2020, according to on-chain analytics resource Digital Assets Data.However, at some level, buyers will stop chasing prices higher, and that could cause the rally to turn down. When it does, the speculators and momentum traders may rush to the exit, and the buyers are likely to wait for lower levels to purchase again. This scenario could result in a sharp pullback. Hence, traders should employ suitable risk management strategies.In a strong bull run, traders may watch the resistance levels for signs of a possible turnaround, but when the levels are scaled with ease, it shows that the trend remains strong. Let’s study the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to identify the critical resistance levels on the upside.Bitcoin (BTC) is in a strong uptrend, and traders are buying every intraday dip without waiting for a deeper correction. The long-legged Doji candlestick pattern on Dec. 31 suggests that bears tried to start a correction but the bulls bought the dip aggressively.However, the strong up-move of the past few days has pushed the relative strength index (RSI) deep into the overbought territory. This suggests the BTC/USD pair could enter a minor consolidation or correction near the $30,000 mark.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls drive the price above $30,000, the pair could continue its rally and rise to $37,000. But with every leg up, the risk to the downside increases.If the price turns down from $30,000, the pair could drop to the 20-day exponential moving average ($24,842). A strong rebound off this level will suggest that the uptrend remains intact, but a break below it could pull the pair down to the 50-day simple moving average ($20,614).Ether (ETH) has been facing resistance near the $750 level for the past few days, but the positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground. This suggests that traders are not booking profits aggressively, as they expect the uptrend to resume.If the bulls can push and sustain the price above $750, the ETH/USD pair may rally to $800 where the bears may again try to stall the uptrend. The rising moving averages and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest that bulls have the upper hand.However, if the pair dips below $717, the correction could deepen to the 20-day EMA ($663). If the price rebounds off this support, it will suggest that the sentiment remains bullish and traders are buying on dips.On the contrary, a break below the 20-day EMA will suggest that traders are not buying the dips and are booking profits aggressively. That could signal the start of a deeper correction.XRP formed an inside day candlestick pattern on Dec. 30 and 31, which shows indecision among the bulls and bears. The uncertainty resolved to the upside today, and the bulls have started a relief rally.In a strong downtrend, traders use rallies to establish short positions or close their long positions. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest that bears are in command.Therefore, the current attempt to move up may face strong resistance at the 20-day EMA ($0.357). If the price turns down from this level, the bears will try to resume the downtrend. If they can sink the price below $0.172536, the XRP/USD pair could fall to $0.10.This negative view will be invalidated if the bears push the price above the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that selling has exhausted, and a few days of range-bound action could follow.Litecoin (LTC) has held above $124.1278 for the past few days, which suggests that the bulls are attempting to flip this level to support. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that the bulls are in control.If the bulls can propel the price above the $140 resistance, the LTC/USD pair may resume its uptrend. The bears may again try to stall the rally at the psychological resistance at $150, but if this level is scaled, the up-move could reach $160.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink and sustain the price below $124.1278, the pair may drop to the 20-day EMA ($113.79).If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend. However, a break below the 20-day EMA will open up the possibilities for a deeper correction to the 50-day SMA ($91.96).Polkadot (DOT) resumed its up-move after a one-day minor correction on Dec. 30. The 28.145% rally on Dec. 31 shows that the altcoin is backed by strong momentum.However, the uptrend has pushed the RSI into the overbought territory, and the bears are currently trying to stall the up-move in the $9.51 to $10 overhead resistance zone.If the DOT/USD pair again witnesses a minor correction and turns up from the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $7.7614, it will suggest that traders are not closing their positions in a hurry and are buying on every minor dip. This may push the pair to $11.Conversely, if the bears pull the price below $7.7614, a retest of the breakout level at $6.8619 is possible.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) turned down from the $370 overhead resistance on Dec. 28 and slipped below the $353 support on Dec. 31. The bulls are currently attempting to sustain the price above the 20-day EMA ($323).If the price turns up from the current levels, the bulls will make one more attempt to drive the price above $370. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that bulls have the upper hand.A breakout and close above $370 could resume the up-move, and the BCH/USD pair could reach $430 and then $500. This positive view will be invalidated and the pair may remain stuck in the range if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA.Cardano's ADA has been holding above the $0.175 support for the past two days, which suggests that the bulls have been purchasing the dips to this level. However, the failure to resume the up-move indicates that demand dries up at higher levels.The range has contracted for the past two days, and soon, this will be followed by a range expansion. If the range resolves to the upside and the bulls push the price above $0.1966315, the ADA/USD pair could rally to $0.22 and then to $0.235.The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside. This positive view will be invalidated if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.165). If that happens, it will suggest that the recent breakout was a bull trap.Binance Coin (BNB) did not even correct to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the latest leg of the rally, and it turned up from $36.5157 on Dec. 31. This suggests that traders aggressively bought the dip.If the bulls can push the price above the $40 resistance, the BNB/USD pair could resume its rally and reach $45 and then $50. The rising moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory indicate bulls are in control.Contrary to this assumption, if the price again turns down from $40, the pair may remain range-bound between $35.69 and $40 for a few days. The trend could change if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($34).Chainlink's LINK is trading inside a descending channel. The failure of the bears to sink and sustain the price below the $11.29 support has attracted buyers today who are attempting to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($12.13).If they succeed, the LINK/USD pair could rise to the resistance line of the channel. A break above the channel and the $13.28 resistance could start a new uptrend that could reach $16.39.However, if the price turns down from the current levels or the resistance line of the channel, then the bears will again try to break the $11.29 support. If they manage to do that, the pair could drop to $10 and then to the support line of the channel near $9.60.The bulls are struggling to push Bitcoin SV (BSV) above the 20-day EMA ($167), and the bears are not able to sustain the price below $160. This suggests a balance between supply and demand, but this tight range action may not continue for long.If the bulls push the price above the moving averages, the BSV/USD pair could rally to $181 where the bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance. If the price turns down from this level, the range-bound action is likely to extend for a few more days.On the other hand, if the pair dips below $160, the pair could drop to $146 where the buyers may step in. A strong bounce could keep the price inside the angle for some more time. The indicators are not showing a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

121,"As Bitcoin’s (BTC) price continues to climb ever higher, more and more people are beginning to educate themselves on how they can enter the cryptocurrency market. However, the realities of cryptocurrency ownership (long complicated addresses, passphrases and security risks) all remain barriers to adoption for new users. Programmers and technologists generally assume a level of understanding and ability with tech innovations that the average person on the street simply is not equipped with. A survey carried out by our team saw 75% of respondents say they found cryptocurrency transactions stressful and unnecessarily complicated. A majority (55%) said they had had trouble in the past sending cryptocurrency transactions, 18% had lost funds, and 6% had suffered a man-in-the-middle attack. These complexities have real and damaging consequences even among technologically savvy elites; one programmer I know lost tens of thousands of dollars because a QR-code had been corrupted and his savings were lost forever. Highly qualified engineers and developers have lost millions due to misplacing files, losing passphrases or simply miscopying a 34-character address.For any financial system to fully function, users need to have faith in its foundations. It is no coincidence that the word “credit” derives from the Latin “credere” which means “to believe.” The architects of any financial ecosystem, whether they be central bankers in Frankfurt or software developers in Silicon Valley, need to ensure that people trust where they are placing their money. Only by creating a secure environment and collective confidence of a broader user base will blockchain technology be able to deliver on its founding promises.For example, crypto addresses could become self-sovereign nonfungible tokens that work with every token and every blockchain. Requests, which are decentralized payment requests, are privately encrypted between the two parties involved and include contextual metadata about the transaction, such as a memo or a link to an order or invoice.People often forget that university professors have been using the internet to send emails to each other since the 1970s, but the systems and protocols were too complicated back then for the average person to use. The World Wide Web as we know it today wasn’t accessible until the creation of HTTP. Blockchain technology is today at the same exciting place as the internet was before HTTP made it usable for the average person to build on. The blockchain ecosystem today needs to design easy-to-use protocols that can deliver what HTTP delivered for the internet in the 1990s: a user experience through browsers and the World Wide Web leading to mass adoption.Developers should aim to make the experience of sending cryptocurrencies as simple as sending fiat with PayPal. It’s not hard to see why the average person on the street struggles with cryptocurrency, as the current systems are very confusing, but it’s only by bringing in more users that blockchain technology will gain more credibility.The potential for blockchain to transform the way people and businesses interact is clear, but the infrastructure and systems in place have a long way to go. The last 25 years have shown how information and value can be shared and transferred in ways that were inconceivable just a few decades ago; however, the dynamic flow of information and data can only fulfil its potential when any person can use it.Current naming systems built on blockchains are simply too complex for the average person to use. Few people know or care how Amazon and Netflix are integrated onto the internet, but they do know that it works — that’s the direction this industry needs to head toward.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
122,"Propelled by Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally, the crypto industry is seeing off 2020 with flying colors. Amid all the tumult of this unprecedented moment in history, the digital asset space seems to have proven its resilience, making a solid case for becoming a safe haven in an increasingly uncertain world. Among other advancements, the outgoing year saw the continued expansion of institutional and mass adoption. So, is this trend expected to continue in 2021, and what factors will shape the dynamics of crypto adoption across various sectors of the industry in the coming year?It has become somewhat commonplace to attribute at least a portion of Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent momentum to the effects of investment banks and hedge funds moving into the space en masse, yet, this trend doesn’t show any signs of dying down.From the big-picture narratives dominating the circles where big money runs to fateful shifts in the political climate, there’s plenty of evidence suggesting that in 2021 big guns of traditional finance will be increasingly bullish on Bitcoin. Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer of digital asset investment firm CoinShares, told Cointelegraph:“The narrative shift around Bitcoin is so profound! Larry Fink in conference call with Mark Carney talking about Bitcoin as digital gold and saying he believes Bitcoin is the future; Guggenheim [Partners’ chief investment officer Scott Minerd] naming a price target of $400k. It used to be people in the industry making these bold calls, now it’s the establishment and titans of capital markets who allocate trillions of dollars in assets.”Demirors further predicted that the incoming Democratic administration will facilitate the generation of even more money than has been created throughout 2020. With “$5 trillion of dry powder sitting on the sidelines waiting to be deployed,” all this money will need somewhere to go, providing fuel to cryptocurrency markets.Dave Hodgson, chief investment officer of NEM Group, also considers the present U.S. monetary policy as a major driver behind institutional money flowing into Bitcoin: “If the U.S. continues to expand “quantitative easing,” or inflation, unabated, it seems like a sensible, even conservative, fiscal choice to diversify and BTC would be one of those natural homes for liquidity seeking shelter.”The narrative that Bitcoin is gradually replacing gold as a hedge against inflation remains strong as well. Eric Richmond, chief operating officer of the cryptocurrency trading platform Coinsquare, observed to Cointelegraph: “Bitcoin will continue to emerge as the smart money alternative to gold with pension funds, family offices, hedge funds, macro investors and corporations allocating a portion of their portfolio to Bitcoin in 2021.”In 2020, cryptocurrency has become more accessible to retail investors than ever before, in part thanks to popular payment services like PayPal and Square making digitals assets available to their massive user base. Diversification of access points and increasingly intuitive interfaces will contribute to larger swaths of everyday users joining the ranks of crypto holders, traders and investors in the coming year.Miles Paschini, founder and director of crypto investment app B21, shared with Cointelegraph his belief that 2021 will likely be the year during which mass adoption will begin, adding: “Tools for investors and payment system users will become more user-friendly and banks who previously shunned cryptocurrencies will begin to adapt and offer integrated services.""In addition to existing tools and platforms, new offerings introducing the mass audience to crypto assets will continue to emerge. Facebook's Diem is poised to become one of them, as Simon Peters, crypto market analyst with trading platform eToro, told Cointelegraph:“Facebook has 2.7bn users across its suite of apps. Facebook's Diem is due to launch in January 2021 and could provide a significant on-ramp for crypto. If Diem is listed on crypto exchanges, where it can be exchanged for bitcoin and other alt coins, this could encourage a whole new demographic to explore crypto.”Peters added that, if it proves to be cheaper and easier to purchase crypto with Diem than with fiat, Facebook’s payment service could become yet another factor boosting mass adoption in 2021.DeFi applications exploded in 2020 like no other sector of the crypto industry, and many experts foresee continued growth and growing public awareness of this space in the coming year. Erick Pinos, the Americas ecosystem lead at blockchain platform Ontology, told Cointelegraph that crypto enables its users to make money: “With decentralized exchanges, lending, insurance, derivatives, mutual funds, and more, the opportunities to make money in DeFi are endless.” Overall, Pinos expects that significant transaction volume and product development efforts over the next year will continue to be centered around DeFi.At the same time, one major constraint on the growth of the DeFi sector is the regulatory pressure that will inevitably arise in the process of bridging the realms of traditional and decentralized finance. At first, this could introduce considerable tensions into the emerging field, but ultimately the payoff from compliance will be tremendous.Lowering the barrier of access to DeFi protocols by making them user-friendly will also contribute to expanding the ranks of those who use these investment tools. Will Liu, head of decentralized protocol SAGA, predicted: “DeFi will be a more standardized and easy-to-use form in 2021 and I believe it will be a nice option for individual investors for a long time.”Related: Artist, gamer or property mogul? Follow the NFT road to find earningsLiu also thinks that other hot trends of 2020, most notably various use cases for non-fungible tokens, will keep gaining traction in the following year. For example, NFTs of digital and physical artworks will capture the attention of some of the big auctions, while NFTs for personal data protection will be benefiting from the ongoing evolution of data law.DeFi activity has been enabled by the underlying Ethereum infrastructure, as a result, the 2020 DeFi explosion boosted the overall usage of the protocol. Meanwhile, the Ethereum community has been going through some notable milestones on its quest for perfecting its network this year, and the process was not always smooth.Hodgson opined that the issues around network upgrades have led to some users experiencing a degree of “project fatigue,” resulting from uncertainty on Eth2 dates and scaling timescales. However, Hodgson argued that once these issues are sorted out, Ethereum will see an increased adoption outside of DeFi-related spikes. Richmond went on to add:“Ethereum transacted over $1 trillion of value in 2020 and, as many new projects go live, this amount will grow in 2021. Ethereum supports all of the major crypto products such as stablecoins, de-fi, crypto lending and NFT applications. Since it is critical to the development of these products, investors will surely continue to adopt this asset to access these products.”According to some industry participants, the upcoming year will also yield critical gains in crypto adoption in contexts not directly related to monetary transactions. Healthcare tech could be one of the most obvious beneficiaries, as the pandemic-induced crisis has underscored the need for innovation in this space.Chrissa McFarlane, CEO and founder of healthcare technology startup Patientory Inc., commented to Cointelegraph: “One of the solutions that more mainstream audiences have taken an interest in throughout 2020 is tokens that incentivize users to be healthy while providing them with access to their medical records.”These accounts paint a picture of an industry that is poised to keep reaching more people and organizations in 2021 than ever before."
123,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high above $29,400 across major exchanges on Friday. In other words, BTC is just 2% away from reaching the psychological resistance level at $30,000.Breaking $30,000 could fuel renewed confidence in the market, with the last remaining technical roadblock right below this level. Hence, in the near term, sellers will look to defend the $30,000 resistance level with stacked sell orders. Exchange order books show large sell orders in the $29,800–$30,000 range.Exchange order books on both Binance and Bitfinex show relatively large sell orders from $29,800 to $30,000. This means that sellers could attempt to lead a Bitcoin pullback before it reaches $29,800.A pseudonymous cryptocurrency trader known as “Loma” similarly said that if Bitcoin was to reject at $30,000, it would likely drop from $29,800. He said:Traders in the Bitcoin futures market have been trying the suppress the price of BTC and have shorted aggressively in the past 24 hours.The futures funding rate on Coinbase and other major exchanges have remained at around 0.01%, despite the recent rally. At times, it fell below 0.01%, indicating that the majority of the market was shortin or selling BTC.That funding rate is a New Year gift I be leave $BTC #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/GSPCDnZuKuHowever, retail investors in the Bitcoin spot market, which refers to exchanges without derivatives and leverage, have been accumulating BTC.On Dec. 31, shortly before the new year, the price of Bitcoin rallied to a new all-time high. Analysts at Santiment said that they spotted an increase in on-chain movements, which might indicate retail accumulation.Since Coinbase saw a large premium over other major exchanges, like Binance, retail investors on Coinbase likely bought Bitcoin entering into the new year. The analysts said:In the near term, Bitcoin will likely see a battle between futures short-sellers and retail investors in the spot market as the price reaches closer to $30,000.In the near term, the key is to see Bitcoin’s behavior at $29,800. There is a strong possibility that it pulls back without surging to that level, which could lead to a decent-sized correction.If BTC surges past $29,800 without much difficulty, then a broader rally above $30,000 becomes probable in the foreseeable future.As Cointelegraph reported earlier this week, Bitcoin will look to extend its gains in the first quarter of 2021, several metrics suggest."
124,"Institutional crypto investment giant Grayscale now has $20 billion under its control as its Bitcoin (BTC) buys outstrip production by almost three to one.As noted by data analysis resource Coin98 Analytics on Friday, Grayscale bought almost three times more BTC than the amount added to the market in December 2020.Last month, the company added a total of 72,950 BTC ($2.132 billion) to its assets under management (AUM). During the same period, miners generated just 28,112 BTC ($821.7 million) — 38.5% of Grayscale's buy-in.The figures underscore what many have described as an ongoing liquidity squeeze in Bitcoin, where large buyers suck up any available supply and remove it from circulation, sending it to cold storage for long-term hodling.As Cointelegraph reported, the phenomenon was already visible in November 2020, but December 2020 saw a clear increase in demand from Grayscale and other institutional entities.As the clock chimed midnight on New Year's Eve, meanwhile, Grayscale CEO Barry Silbert celebrated bringing the company's total AUM across its various crypto funds to over $20 billion. Just one year ago, the figure stood at a mere $2 billion.The company remains the largest institutional player on the Bitcoin scene, with its $17.475 billion in BTC far outstripping any other market participant. Newcomer MicroStrategy, while not an investment business, now controls 70,470 BTC ($2.06 billion).Going forward, analysts predict that more demand for the fixed supply of ""new"" Bitcoin from miners will only serve to create a bidding war and push up the price. Sellers already faced stiff resolve from buyers in December 2020, when new all-time highs failed to produce significant long-lasting pullbacks.At press time on Friday, BTC/USD continued to trade above $29,000, having hit a new record high of $29,500 overnight."
125,"Pundits and crypto analysts love to issue Bitcoin (BTC) price predictions regardless of how volatile the asset class is. In 2017, there were calls for BTC’s price to hit $35,000–$50,000, and of course, a few brave souls predicted that the price would top $1 million before correcting.No one will forget how John McAfee infamously promised to chomp off his genitals if BTC’s price didn’t hit $1 million by 2020.While some of these lofty estimates are based on fundamentals, others are entirely baseless. Regardless of the analyst’s rationale, a handful of them are so far removed from reality that they have become memes.Let’s review the most outrageous Bitcoin price predictions of 2020.Guessing the future price of cryptocurrencies is so embedded in the community that many analysts don’t even consider evaluating their effectiveness. Keeping up with the endless flow of predictions issued on blogs, podcasts, Twitter and YouTube is almost impossible. Imagine the difficulty and energy it would take for a person to follow up with all these random guesses.To further complicate matters, some of these predictions come from well-known Bitcoin bashers, such as renowned gold bug Peter Schiff, and New York University Stern School of Business professor Nouriel Roubini. Thus, in some cases, personal credentials sometimes matter less than working analytical models.A month before the March 12 crash, which saw Bitcoin’s price plummet 50% to $3,750, PlanB, the creator of the stock-to-flow model stated that Bitcoin would not return below $8,200. At the time, no one expected the Dow Jones equities index to face its most significant drop since 1987, neither the WTI oil future contract dropping to negative $40.Despite the outlandish claim, PlanB won’t be nominated to 2020’s worse predictions because hardly anyone expected the coronavirus pandemic to impact the markets in a way that would cause absolute havoc. Furthermore, famous chartist Peter Brandt also made the same error when he said that BTC would never revisit the sub-$6,000 level in January.On June 2, 2020, Twitter analyst CryptoWhale revealed a new “quantum” model that would predict Bitcoin’s price. According to CryptoWhale, the model had “effectively predicted every major move since 2018.”Things could not have gotten worse as the model predicted both a $2,000 bottom in 2020 and a “proper bull run to $24,000” only in mid-2022. Somehow, the quantum particles, molecules and atoms that were supposed to make it more accurate were, in fact, pure blasphemy.Two lessons that can be taken away from the “quantum model” are: (1) Having a ton of social network followers doesn’t necessarily translate to better price estimates, and (2) complex models are prone to the same errors as humans. Evaluating a new asset class during a period of desperate central bank monetary easing is far from easy.In April, Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the now-defunct Silk Road darknet market, wrote that Bitcoin’s volatility — particularly the March 12 bloodbath — would most likely lead to a bear market, which could last for three to nine months. At that time, Bitcoin had been hovering around $7,000 and was clearly still affected by the recent 50% intraday correction.Precisely 17 days after that blog post, BTC soared over 30% to $9,000, thus completely invalidating Ulbricht’s analysis. To further show how far off that analysis was, Ulbricht added that a $14,000 bull run was “very unlikely.”During Ulbricht’s so-called bear market period, Bitcoin’s price rallied more than 300% from December 2018 to June 2019. Furthermore, calling for such a lengthy correction doesn’t align with Bitcoin’s historical data because even during the darkest period of December 2019, Bitcoin’s price remained more than 100% above the previous year’s lows.During a July 27 interview with Forbes, Panxora CEO Gavin Smith said that he expected a $7,000 Bitcoin price by the end of the year. Gavin further added that “a short term washout this year before the true rally takes hold.”Panxora’s CEO explained that despite the appreciating tendency caused by inflation hedge, the broader impact of demand shock on the economy would potentially drive BTC lower.This estimate happened after 80 days of Bitcoin’s price consolidating around $9,500. At the time, despite rising 100% from mid-March lows, there was still some doubt about BTC’s ability to break the $10,000 resistance.On Jan. 3, 2020, Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev stated that BTC could easily reach $50,000 in 2020.Besides an overly optimistic estimate, the rationale behind it doesn’t seem to fit. According to Trenchev, Bitcoin had become “the new gold,” and he pointed to the lack of correlation to traditional markets as a potential catalyst.As shown above, gold traded in tandem with traditional markets for the larger part of 2020, but it should be noted that these asset classes have different volatility. Thus, oscillations in equities tend to be much stronger. Nevertheless, the overall direction of both markets until November has been very much alike.This price movement creates the impossible task where BTC is expected to act as “the new gold” while simultaneously presenting a lack of correlation. This estimate went doubly wrong for missing its year-end target by a wide margin and also failing to correctly estimate gold’s correlation to traditional markets.Now that Bitcoin’s price is a mere 7.4% away from $30,000, it will be even more interesting to see what type of extravagant bullish and bearish price estimates are issued for 2021.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

126,"Transparency is one of the most intriguing aspects of cryptocurrency and it was this openness that drew many early supporters to Bitcoin (BTC). Blockchain technology makes all information associated with the network’s operation accessible for anyone interested in taking a look. Every known address, transaction, fee paid and other details relating to multisignature and SegWit usage is out in the open.The top 15 wealthiest Bitcoin addresses have always been the centerpiece of attention for several reasons. Some crypto researchers habitually sort through the top addresses searching for the footsteps of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Others study data to track the maneuvers of crypto whales and predict market manipulation that results in volatile price swings in the Bitcoin price.The top addresses have even caught the eye of government agencies like the United States Internal Revenue Service as well as the Treasury Department.In fact, entire companies specializing in obtaining additional information on cryptocurrency addresses and their potential associations have been formed. It’s no secret that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service hired Chainalysis and Integra FEC, two crypto analytics firms, to track transactions.More recently, under Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Department is considering whether or not a rule on self-hosted cryptocurrency wallets is required. If approved, these changes emphasize the importance of privacy for market participants.As shown above, the top 15 addresses hold 1.07 million BTC, or 5.7% of the outstanding Bitcoin supply. At the current $26,500 price level, this equals $28.3 billion. While this is a large amount of Bitcoin, it’s also worth noting that BTC’s aggregated volume on spot exchanges surpasses $5 billion per day.It’s important to note that an address’s initial deposit date does not mean that the entity owning the address first acquired coins on that day. The coins could have been sent from another address belonging to the same entity. Therefore, the dates showing first funds being sent to 11 addresses since only 2018 do not prove that the address holders are new to the sector.It is also worth noting that none of the top 15 addresses are rumored to be Satoshi’s holdings. Researcher Sergio Lerner has shown that the blocks Nakamoto mined contain unique patterns known as Patoshi patterns. Although that mined BTC has yet to be moved, it was not allocated to a single address.The top 100 addresses concentrate 15.7% of the total supply, which is rather impressive compared to the level of distribution seen in traditional markets. For example, the top 20 funds owning PayPal shares hold a combined 19.7% of the total share supply.Five of the 15 most significant addresses are known addresses from exchanges, indicating that the apparent concentration does not exist in a way that can be attributed to crypto whales.In addition to exchanges holding large sums of Bitcoin in wallets, some custodians also accumulate BTC for numerous clients in wallets spread over multiple addresses with large sums.An impressive eight out of the top 15 addresses have never withdrawn a single satoshi. Excluding the five exchange-related addresses, only 20% have ever moved their coins. This indicates a strong prevalence of hardcore holders.Moreover, 11 of the 15 addresses were first used less than three years ago. Multiple reasons could be behind this oddity, including improved security measures, a change of custodian, or different ownership structures.Only two out of the top 15 (and three in the top 200) addresses are Bech32 SegWit-compatible, which can significantly reduce transaction fees. This indicates that users are resistant to change despite the clear benefits of cheaper transactions. Even more interesting is that the Bitfinex cold wallet ranked second on the list is the only one that has ever had an outgoing transaction.The third wealthiest address is something of a mystery, as it contains an untouched 94,506 BTC. The address made headlines back in September 2019 after Glassnode reported that 73,000 of the BTC in the wallet had originated from Huobi.Many analysts suggested that these coins were connected to the Plustoken Ponzi scheme, but these rumors were proven wrong after the Chinese police seized 194,775 BTC on Nov. 19 from the fraudulent exchange.Aside from the fourth-largest wallet containing 79,957 BTC since March 2011, 20 of the top 300 addresses are over nine years old. Although no one can prove that these funds have been lost, most assume so.Those untouched coins amount to 313,013 BTC, and only one address has ever transacted out since origination. Thus, apart from F2Pool’s 9,000 BTC held at address 1J1F3U7gHrCjsEsRimDJ3oYBiV24wA8FuV, there is a very good chance that the funds from the other addresses are effectively lost.The fifth-ranked address shown above was created in February of 2019 and, at origination, was listed as the 81st-largest address. Since then, it has been accumulating regularly, adding from as low as 1 BTC in December 2019 to 4,100 in a single transaction in June 2019. Despite being a large accumulator, it has made seven transactions out, ranging from 786 BTC to 3,000 BTC. Maybe even whales have bills to be paid.There are precisely 100 addresses first used between Nov. 30, 2018 and Dec. 18, 2018 containing around either 8,000 BTC or 12,000 BTC each. These addresses are commonly attributed to Coinbase Custody. Amounting to 881,471 BTC, the addresses’ funds equal to 96% of the exchange’s cold wallet, according to chain.info.Every investor has a gut feeling that the arrival of new Bitcoin whales is crucial for a sustained rally, even though there has never been hard evidence of this effect until now.There is a constant flow of new addresses entering the top 300. For example, 16 of them received their first-ever deposits within the past 30 days. Once again, this is not necessarily a new entity but an address receiving its first-ever BTC.Although it is uncommon, sometimes gaps of 50 or more days occur without newcomers joining the top 300. Coincidentally, these periods mark the end of rally periods, and a healthy correction usually follows.Precisely zero of the top 300 addresses were initially used between Nov. 28, 2019 and Feb. 09, 2020, when BTC went up by 35%. Oddly enough, the market plunged 52% over the next 32 days.A similar effect happened between Oct. 18, 2017 and Dec. 11, 2017. During this period BTC rallied 193% while none of the top 300 addresses were newcomers. A 34% price drop occurred over the following 36 days.Before that, none of the top 300 addresses were initiated between April 20, 2017 and July 07, 2017. Meanwhile, BTC soared 111%, while a 24% crash has also followed this period over the course of nine days.So far, history has been proving that the new whale theory makes sense: The market rallies during prolonged periods of fewer new addresses making it to the top 300 holders list, as it indicates accumulation by entities that already had position. On the other hand, new whales could be driven by fear of missing out, which usually indicates local tops.Therefore, it makes sense to monitor the top addresses and on-chain data to gauge potential corrections.Every time large deposits enter exchanges, this indicates a potential sell order and is deemed bearish by traders. These movements are then compared to BTC price tops and bottoms in an attempt to find some correlation between whale transfers.Whenever the market is rallying and miners, in turn, reduce selling, analysts expect a price correction once they start moving coins again. To put things in perspective, this is 6,300 Bitcoin per week that needs to be absorbed by the market to avoid price impact.Now that institutional investors have “arrived,” investors will be itching to see whether their inflow in 2021 will continue to absorb newly minted BTC.While 2021 is looking pretty bullish for the crypto market, there is always an unexpected price crash that often results from the government threatening regulation.This means it will still be important for savvy investors to follow the top 15 Bitcoin addresses and the movements of crypto whales in 2021.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

127,"Without any doubt, the year 2020 was unlike any other year in the 21st century: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, global governments unstoppably printing money, “lockdowns” and “social distancing” becoming the new normal, protests against racial discrimination and police brutality, and so on and so forth. It even made some claim it to be “the worst year ever.” But as they say: In every storm, each cloud has a silver lining. The most important thing is to learn from what we’ve been through and to improve our world and our future, as there are some problems that we have to solve ourselves.It’s also true that 2020 was a significant, dramatic year not only for people all over the world but for Bitcoin (BTC) as well: the third halving, increased attention from institutional investors and global regulators, its white paper’s 12th anniversary, etc. Some even called it the “New Testament” of finance, and others suggested using it for the utopian idea of universal basic income. Bitcoin received global attention because of the Twitter hack in mid-July, which required the crypto community to defend Bitcoin’s integrity after the event placed the words “Bitcoin” and “scam” within one headline again. In October, PayPal announced it would offer crypto payments, and later in November, Bitcoin was on the homepage of the Wall Street Journal for its 80% price rally.Related: Will PayPal’s crypto integration bring crypto to the masses? Experts answerWhen 2020 started, it was hard to imagine how the world would change and how fast those changes would be. Despite all the negative impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, there have been some positive developments, at least within the crypto space. For instance, Bitcoin’s volatility has decreased since its peak in mid-March, and the pandemic has highlighted Bitcoin’s most important value: its decentralized nature. Some even argued that the pandemic has underlined the benefits of cryptocurrencies for the world. And while Europe experienced the shift to a cashless world, the United States remained more conservative and didn’t want to give up its paper money.Related: How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the crypto space? Experts answerOne thing became certain due to the effects of COVID-19: There are some serious problems with the currently existing financial system that might be solved by Bitcoin and by the technology behind it. And the similarities between the two recent financial crises — the first back in 2008 and now in 2020 due to the pandemic — revealed the systemic problems of centralized financial systems. While the first crisis gave birth to Bitcoin, the current one has made people turn to decentralized tech and Bitcoin on a massive scale amid the global economic recession. Some even argue that during the next decade, Bitcoin will play a crucial role in the global economy’s transformation, called “The Great Reset,” and that crypto mass adoption will be led by the millennial generation.Central banks printed an estimated $15 trillion in stimulus by May alone as anti-pandemic measures to save global economies, throwing the U.S. dollar under the bus, as some said. And these measures turned people toward alternative financial tools, making Bitcoin a hedge against inflation and even an alternative to traditional finance entirely. Some even suggested governments make a monetary transition to Bitcoin to solve the national debt problems.Another important 2020 milestone was the rise of institutional investors’ interest in Bitcoin. Although this trend seemed to be “built on nothing more than hope” earlier this year, 2020 surprised everyone here as well. Forced by the possibility of rising inflation, the hedging abilities of Bitcoin couldn’t go unnoticed by high-profile investors who saw crypto as an important part of a diversified corporate treasury holding, becoming major holders of digital assets this year.Unsurprisingly, the crypto space has started to consider the rise of Bitcoin mining institutions inevitable. Also, China’s dominance over the world’s Bitcoin mining operations seemed to be challenged. And most importantly, the future of crypto mining will become more sustainable.With the 2020 shift in public discourse around Bitcoin, it’s becoming more and more important to create a regulatory framework for the crypto space, without which it will have no future. The regulation, some argue, has to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary, and most importantly, it requires dialogue and close collaboration between regulators and crypto businesses.All in all, it is hard to predict the crypto’s future in the post-COVID-19 world, as the pandemic has not yet come to an end. Meanwhile, it is impossible to neglect the impact it has had on the crypto space this year. The new Bitcoin era, after everything that happened this year, is forming the new financial order. And if fiat money might lose up to 90% in 100 years, Bitcoin’s future seems to be much brighter than it is now, considering that Bitcoin just reached $27,000 for the first time in history and is now targeting $100,000 within the next 12 months and $500,000 within the decade. And with 2020 coming to its end, Cointelegraph reached out to experts in the blockchain and crypto space for their opinions on Bitcoin’s path this year.“We hope that our July 2020 letter regarding crypto custody will make Bitcoin safer for institutional and retail holders. Bitcoin was the innovation that opened the door to decentralizing financial services, and the growth of it and other tokens in 2020 shows the beginning of a transformation of cryptocurrencies from an exotic concept to a more familiar and comfortable means of engaging in financial services.”“Since its inception, Bitcoin has witnessed and survived various ups and downs, and it now appears that investors, on the whole, are increasingly more confident in its value. More significantly, I believe that this signals how quickly we are moving toward mainstream adoption.Throughout 2020, the blockchain space experienced an explosion in terms of interest and creativity, and we’re seeing the results now: More and more people are recognizing that blockchain is here, and it is here to say.Moving forward, I believe we’re on the cusp of mainstream adoption, and I’m very excited for what 2021 will bring.”“I think that the institutional focus on Bitcoin has created positive momentum for the entire blockchain space. Personally, I think it is a reliable store of value. As is much debated throughout crypto circles and beyond, engagement with the network in the long term may present challenges and affect Bitcoin’s ability to translate to certain business applications and use cases, but I believe that storing value and holding value are irrefutably its strengths.”“We’ve seen over time how narratives around cryptocurrencies can shift and evolve to fit market demand or a network’s capabilities. The Bitcoin narrative around store of value and hedge against currency inflation has hardened this year, and I believe it’s now the dominant positioning for BTC, as its most vocal supporters and institutional adopters have rallied around it.That’s a perfectly fine position for Bitcoin to occupy.Personally, I’m most excited about currencies that have both a scarce, hard-capped supply like Bitcoin but also push for more sophisticated utility with functionalities like smart contracts, DeFi applications and asset issuance.”“We have definitely seen an increase in digital assets overall. Bitcoin is among that market, but let us not forget about Ether, which I declared a commodity last year. The two of these together represent a large portion of the crypto market. And it has been an interesting year in this market — not just with the halving but also the move to Ethereum 2.0 and both Bitcoin and Ether forking.Despite this, however, we must still recognize that this market is small compared with other assets we regulate. I think over time, this market will be comparable. Until then, however, there will need to be more regulatory clarity around these digital assets for these markets to grow.”“Bitcoin remains a volatile asset. Many expect a store of value to have much lower volatility, but as gold was developing into an investment store of value in the 1970s, it too had extremely high volatility. As it has matured as a store of value, so too has its volatility declined. We expect the same to happen to Bitcoin, and early evidence alludes to this.2020 has been crucial for Bitcoin. We see it as the year of legitimization for the broader public and investors, fortuitously aided/accelerated by the COVID-19 crisis and the consequent rapid escalation of quantitative easing and fall in use of cash. Our conversations with institutional clients have changed considerably over the course of 2020. What was typically a desire to speculatively invest has now become one of being fearful of extreme loose monetary policy and negative interest rates, with clients looking for an anchor for their investments. As their understanding of Bitcoin improves, clients have grasped that Bitcoin has a limited supply and fulfills this role as an anchor for their assets while fiat is being debased.This year, we have seen cumulative flows (stripping out the price effect) into investment products rise from $1.35 billion at the start of the year to $6.1 billion today, with only 24 days of outflows for a total of 241 trading days this year. Investors are buying and holding — a good indicator that it is slowly developing into a store of value.”“It’s not that Bitcoin has matured, it’s that we have. The mainstream investors are starting to take notice of Bitcoin’s 12-year history and starting to recognize how valuable it really is in a world of near-infinite quantitative easing. Bitcoin gives us true scarcity, and that’s why it’s useful as a store of value. Literally, nothing like this has existed in human history.”“Despite this very difficult year, I think that the broader decentralized protocol ecosystem demonstrated poignantly that we, like our Web 3.0 technology, are anti-fragile and that this technology will prove a worthy evolutionary successor to Web 2.0 systems. We continue to demonstrate that this technology will serve as a new trust foundation for next-generation, increasingly decentralized, financial, economic, social and political systems.”“Store of value is an interesting concept. It doesn’t mean nonvolatile; after all, both gold and real estate have had their cycles, booms and busts, but to date, they have returned to a reliable mean so that there are very few instances where a 20-year investment in either did not perform as a reliable way of keeping ahead of inflation with very low risk of losing one’s principal.To skeptics, Bitcoin was seen as the equivalent of investing in a single high-risk stock that could easily crash to zero — and in its early days, this certainly was possible. But no asset in history has ever gone from under one cent, as it was during the first P2P transactions, to this month’s high-water mark of $28,300. As each year has passed, the fluctuations have gotten more manageable — there will be no more 100-times gains in one year, as happened in 2013. This plus the clear signals from the United States, the European Union, China and Japan that they’re happy to cope with both the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and economic depression through massive money printing means that these currencies will vastly underperform hard assets in the next two to three years as the money supply in these nations expands at annual rates of above 20% instead of the historic 4% to 5%, which is near the true rate of inflation.Barry Silbert primed the pump with Grayscale, allowing accredited investors an easy way to invest in Bitcoin that then makes its way into a publicly traded vehicle. Paul Tudor Jones, who made a fortune calling the gold boom in the 1980s, awoke the multitrillion-dollar institutional fund world by having his funds invest in Bitcoin, calling it ‘the fastest horse' in the race.Michael Saylor, CEO and founder of multibillion-dollar public firm MicroStrategy, then lit the fuse on corporate fear and greed by using 80% of its $500 million in cash earlier this year to invest in Bitcoin, which has now more than doubled. More recently, he went even further and issued debt to buy even more Bitcoin.Bitcoin has never been great at microtransactions — dozens of low-fee, faster-settling cryptos are far better at this — but it needed to go through this use case in its infancy. Its true value now is in sending large transactions instantly and safely, and as a store of value for the next century and beyond.”“The 2020 bull run of Bitcoin is very different from anything we’ve seen before. Unlike the previous rapid rise of 2017, this year saw the influx of new large institutional players. New entrants like PayPal, Square, JPMorgan and others are bringing a new level of credibility, liquidity and stability to the crypto markets.Institutions and retail investors are recognizing the importance of the principle of scarcity, which is the basic economic principle of Bitcoin. With governments overprinting money across the globe, Bitcoin is the most reliable store of value at this time and a hedge against inflation. Those who understand this will be in a stronger economic position than those who don’t.I agree with Paul Tudor Jones’ recommendation that individuals who have investable assets put a small amount, perhaps 2%, into Bitcoin. And I’d go a step further and say that institutions should invest 5% of their corporate treasuries in order to stay competitive. Investing small amounts can produce tremendous upside with minimal downside risk.”“Bitcoin has reached that mature, stable store-of-value stage, but I fear it will never be without some controversy. While the Ethereum ecosystem is becoming a vibrant economic entity — with DeFi, smart contracts and infrastructure services being built atop the system — Bitcoin remains very focused on taking a role as a store of value. This will make it hard for some people to grasp, in the same way that many people still don’t quite realize that there is no gold or other asset that backs any other modern currency either. ”“Clearly not. Anything that can fluctuate from $4,000 to $20,000 in a single year is anything but a store of value. It is still just a speculative investment at this point.”“Bitcoin was always a reliable store of value. The only people that say otherwise are the ones looking at it on very short time horizons. As public market companies like MicroStrategy have recently realized, Bitcoin is the only safe haven to store value — cash will just melt away from inflation and quantitative easing, gold is stagnant, and tech stocks are overextended. Now, we’re seeing giants like Guggenheim Partners and Ruffer pile in as they come to that same realization as well. Hyperbitcoinization is inevitable.”“Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies have been a store of value for many people for quite some time already. The considerable capitalization of the crypto market corroborates this, and it’s likely that quite a few readers of this article are using cryptos in this way already. Whether it is ‘reliable’ or not depends on the definition of reliability. Of course, it is true that Bitcoin’s — let alone other cryptos' — price is quite volatile and will probably remain so, meaning anyone who uses it for a store of value might experience some strong emotions. On the other hand, it is very reliable in the sense that nobody can take your Bitcoin away, as long as you keep your private keys secret and store them safely. This constitutes a unique advantage of cryptocurrencies in the store-of-value context.”“The institutions are here. This year, we’ve seen a number of large traditional firms either announce or begin to explore Bitcoin. While custody is still challenging for institutions, the Paul Tudor Jones announcement earlier in the year as well as the improvement of institutional Bitcoin solutions have led to much broader acceptance of Bitcoin within the traditional financial community. Bitcoin is no longer a bad word on the street.”“Bitcoin is a speculative investment. Even if we see the price goes up, we have to remember that it’s still speculative. When will it become a reliable store of value? As I’ve been saying for years, Bitcoin may eventually evolve into a reliable store of value, but this growth process will take at least five to 10 years. We’ll know that we’ve reached the goal when Bitcoin becomes far more stable and far less volatile — in a word, boring.”These quotes have been edited and condensed.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors’ alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

128,"Bitcoin (BTC) HODLer volume has marked previous tops and the start of bull cycles. As the dominant cryptocurrency heads toward $30,000, HODLer activity could be a useful tool to potentially gauge BTC’s next peak.Since October, as Cointelegraph reported, the HODLing activity of Bitcoin has continuously increased. Fewer HODLers have been moving their holdings, which indicates an overall bullish market sentiment.The term “HODLer” refers to long-time holders of Bitcoin. It is possible to track the activity of HODLers by evaluating addresses that have not moved BTC for several years.If HODLers move their assets when the price of Bitcoin is going up, it might indicate an intent to sell to take a profit on the rally.Conversely, if HODLers move their assets when Bitcoin price declines, it could mean they are doubling down on their investments.Hence, based on the price trend of Bitcoin, a spike in HODLer activity could signal that a major price movement is imminent.For now, HODLer volume suggests that a prolonged Bitcoin pullback is not likely to happen. The volume remains low in comparison with previous peaks, which shows that the confidence of long-time holders remains high.However, HODLer volume could lag behind and begin to spike as the price of Bitcoin slumps in the near term. If so, the possibility of an extended correction could still emerge.As such, it would be important to observe the HODLer volume in the near term, especially if Bitcoin struggles to rise above $30,000.The technical momentum has been driving up the price of Bitcoin in recent months. But if that slows down, HODLers could move to sell, anticipating a correction to occur from the large number of investors sitting on unrealized gains.Until the HODLer volume spikes to previous highs, it would be premature to predict a sizable pullback in the short term.Various macro factors, such as the declining dollar and the drop of Bitcoin liquidity, have made BTC more attractive as a store of value, particularly for institutions.Cointelegraph previously reported that Bitcoin is becoming less liquid due to increasing HOLDer activity.This means that there is fewer BTC that could be bought or sold, which makes BTC more scarce as it heads into 2021.Rafael Schultze-Kraft, chief technology officer of Glassnode, emphasized that this is bullish for Bitcoin in the longer term. He said:"
129,"The COVID-19 pandemic dominated the news in 2020, affecting myriad sectors — health, economics, social justice, politics and trade, as well as the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. As country after country locked down to halt the virus’s spread, governments seized upon stimulus payments to preserve economic life. While necessary, these measures raised the specter of global inflation. This, in turn, pushed many traditional investors and institutions to take a new look at cryptocurrencies as an alternate store of value, especially Bitcoin (BTC), the top crypto. Following a March 11 dip, BTC went on a tear, reaching record levels by year end. With that as a backdrop, here are 2020’s top 10 stories of the crypto and blockchain world.The world’s oldest and most widely held cryptocurrency shattered price records and then some in 2020. Now, at the end of the year, Bitcoin’s market cap is standing at about $500 billion — surpassing Visa and Berkshire Hathaway — and its price on spot markets continues to inch toward $30,000.The pre-rally record high of $19,850 was set in December 2017 by retail traders in Asia (many of which just discovering cryptocurrencies) driving the price, but this year, it was by mature investors continuously purchasing increments of Bitcoin and often holding it off-chain as a long-term investment, as the New York Times noted.“We’re seeing fresh stories about institutional crypto adoption on almost a daily basis at this point,” Bitcoin Depot CEO Brandon Mintz told Cointelegraph in mid-December. MicroStrategy, Square, Paul Tudor Jones, Guggenheim Investors and even venerable insurance company MassMutual were among those purchasing BTC in 2020. “We are being driven by corporations and billionaires now, not just retailers,” said Minerd.“2020 was unequivocally the year of decentralized finance,” declared Da Hongfe, the co-founder of the Smart Economy network, in a Cointelegraph op-ed. True to that, the amount locked in DeFi had soared to almost $15 billion on Dec. 30, compared with only $658 million at the beginning of the year, according to DeFi Pulse.Indeed, a new term, “yield farming,” entered the crypto lexicon. In return for staking one’s BTC or Ether (ETH) as collateral with a DeFi firm, a user might receive a governance token enabling the holder to “debate, propose, and vote on all changes to the [platform’s] protocol.”Ownership of these governance tokens became quite lucrative in 2020. First issued in June, Compound’s COMP rose in value from $61 on June 18 to $382 on June 21 following its launch on United States exchange Coinbase Pro. It is closing the year at $148 on Dec. 31, 2020.DeFi is a “game changer,” Giuseppe Ateniese, a professor at the Stevens Institute of Technology, previously told Cointelegraph. “With decentralized finance, there’s no human in the loop, no server, no organization. There’s no bias.” It isn’t like a traditional car loan, where if the borrower defaults, the bank goes after the car seeking repossession, he explained. “With DeFi, assets are digital and locked/committed through smart contracts. If I don’t pay the loan back, the digital asset that I used as collateral is taken, and there is nothing I can do about it.”It took Bitcoin 12 years to gain 100 million users. Then, in a single month, the network additionally gained a potential 300 million more users as payments giant PayPal announced it would allow users to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC).“It’s already having a huge impact,” declared Pantera Capital in November. “Within four weeks of going live, PayPal is already buying almost 70% of the new supply of bitcoins.” The following month, Pantera updated: “Within two months of going live, PayPal is already buying more than 100% of the new supply of bitcoins.”Bitcoin halvings, designed to limit BTC’s issuance rate — which is capped at 21 million units — occur roughly every four years, and they are typically marked by some anxiousness. They are analogous to a company telling its workers to expect a 50% pay cut. Here, it is the block reward for the Bitcoin network’s validators, known as miners, that is sliced in half.The May 2020 halving reduced miners’ block reward from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC, and it came and went without calamity — no exodus of miners or collapse in the network’s computing power (hash rate), as some had feared. Seven months later, Bitcoin is selling at roughly three times its pre-halving level ($8,566 on May 11).The race to issue the first central bank digital currency, or CBDC, at scale moved closer to resolution in 2020, with China’s August announcement of a trial run of its digital yuan in four city hubs — Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Hong Kong — a test area with 400 million people, or about 29% of the country’s population.Many anticipated China’s digital currency electronic payment (DCEP) project would soon achieve full rollout, but disagreements arose as to its significance. Would a digital yuan challenge the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency, as the Financial Times feared? The publication wrote in August: “China’s rapid development of a central bank digital currency has the potential to upset the global monetary order.”Or are CBDCs still so riddled with unsolved problems, such as fraud prevention and cyber attacks, that launching one now at scale would be irresponsible, as United States Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell implied in October?In any case, China will not have the world’s first CBDC. That distinction belongs to The Bahamas, an island nation in the West Indies that made history on Oct. 20 with the official launch of its central bank digital currency, the so-called Sand Dollar, built on a blockchain platform.2020 was the year publicly owned corporations and institutional investors started to move the crypto needle, and no listed company embraced crypto with quite the fervor as MicroStrategy, a Nasdaq-listed business intelligence firm. Not only had it accumulated $250 million in Bitcoin by August, but it made BTC its primary corporate reserve treasury.As CEO Michael Saylor explained, unprecedented government stimulus measures undertaken to combat the COVID-19 crisis were expected to have a “significant depreciating effect on the long-term real value of fiat currencies and many other conventional asset types, including those traditionally held as part of corporate treasury operations.” In this new world, Bitcoin is a dependable store of value “with more long-term appreciation potential than holding cash.”MicroStrategy continued to purchase BTC through the year, and in late 2020, it raised $650 million through the sale of convertible notes to buy even more Bitcoin. As of Dec. 21, the company held a total of 70,470 BTC, purchased at an average price of $15,964 per Bitcoin. The Wall Street Journal marvelled at the firm’s transformation, asking: “Is this a publicly traded company or is it a hedge fund?""In December, exchange Coinbase announced a bid to become the first crypto-native corporation to be listed on a major U.S. stock exchange. The 35-million-customer company could be valued at $28 billion, according to research firm Messari, if its initial public offering comes to fruition.“It is a massive event,” Vladimir Vishnevskiy, director and co-founder of Swiss wealth management firm St. Gotthard Fund Management AG, told Cointelegraph, and not only in the U.S. but in Europe too, because “the IPO will provide a marker in terms of how markets are ready to value such companies.”The IPO is a “milestone for the crypto industry,” noted Fortune magazine. “It’s far from clear, however, whether the United States Securities and Exchange Commission would sign off on such an arrangement.” Coinbase stirred some controversy in 2020 for discouraging employees from political activism in the workplace, and in November, the New York Times reported that some of Coinbase’s black employees had voiced concerns of discriminatory treatment. Others noted the exchange was still plagued by untimely service outages during times of high price volatility.Even so, the IPO announcement is a major event, said University of Texas finance professor John Griffin, “showing that the path of Coinbase to work within the regulatory process is an economically profitable one.”Telegram Group Inc. had sought to build a decentralized blockchain platform along the lines of Bitcoin and Ethereum — only better, that is, “vastly superior to them in speed and scalability,” according to Pavel Durov, founder and CEO of the open-source encrypted messenger service firm, with some 300 million users globally. But Telegram failed to overcome resistance from the SEC and pulled the plug on its TON (Telegram Open Network) project in May.The Dubai-based firm had already raised $1.7 billion to launch the project’s “Grams” token, but the SEC deemed the coins to be unregistered securities and moved to halt their distribution — not just in the U.S. but anywhere in the world. A federal court gave the agency preliminary support.“We are still dependent on the United States when it comes to finance and technology,” wrote Durov in a blog, adding: “This may change in the future. But today, we are in a vicious circle: you can’t bring more balance to an overly centralized world exactly because it’s so centralized.” Telegram had the participation of a number of prominent investors, including blue-chip venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital.COVID-related government stimulus efforts had many investors worried about inflation in 2020, and some were willing to give cryptocurrencies a fresh view as an alternate store of value. Prominent among them was Paul Tudor Jones, a hedge fund investor who reported in May that a portion of his assets was now invested in Bitcoin.The endorsement of a celebrated investor like Jones — who predicted the 1987 stock market crash — paved the way for mainstream investors and others to become involved in crypto. “Making the case for Bitcoin as his preferred hedge against what he [Jones] calls ‘the great monetary inflation’ has significantly reduced ‘career risk’ for many of his peers considering an allocation to Bitcoin,” Bitwise Asset Management’s David Lawant previously told Cointelegraph. The Wall Street Journal also commented:“The [Bitcoin] rally has attracted a wide cast of characters, from the Wall Street billionaires Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller to momentum investors who aim to ride winning assets higher and losing markets lower. Their participation, in turn, has fueled more buying.”The XRP token was the third-largest cryptocurrency by market value — trailing only Bitcoin and Ether — when in late December the San Francisco-based firm ran into a buzzsaw in the form of the SEC.Led by outgoing chairman Jay Clayton, the commission filed legal action against Ripple and its top-two executives, alleging that the XRP coin created by Ripple was in fact a security, and that the firm had raised over $1.3 billion through an unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering. In the three days following the announcement, XRP’s price plummeted 41%, and it became unclear whether the firm would survive in its present form.On Dec. 27, Coinbase, the largest U.S. exchange, announced that it would suspend XRP trading, and with others delisting the token, the climate around the coin has become increasingly unstable. On Dec. 29, Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest digital asset manager, reportedly liquidated more than 9.18 million in XRP.Ripple denounced the SEC’s action as “an attack on the entire crypto industry here in the United States” as the company’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated that he would continue to support its customers in the U.S. and globally.All in all, corporations and institutional investors seeking an alternate store of value amid the ongoing COVID-19 crisis propelled crypto to record levels in 2020. Elsewhere, blockchain innovation continued on several fronts, including decentralized finance and CBDC development.In the U.S., a wary SEC stymied digital token expansion, launching lawsuits against XRP and Telegram’s TON. A change of administration in Washington, including new SEC leadership, however, could bring more regulatory clarity in 2021."
130,"Bitcoin (BTC) has posted its highest transaction volume since early 2018 as data points to more and more investors entering the market.Figures from on-chain analytics resource Digital Assets Data highlights December 2020 as already sparking Bitcoin’s second-largest transaction volumes.At a total of $252.37 billion for the remaining 24 hours of December may yet take the tally further still as it rivals December 2017.Other indicators, such as the size of unprocessed transactions in Bitcoin’s mempool and network transaction fees, also suggest heightened activity overall.As Cointelegraph additionally reported, wallets containing both large and small balances also continue to increase to unprecedented levels.Google Trends, meanwhile, has captured the highest levels of search interest in the term “Bitcoin” worldwide since February 2018.The reason, one which is attracting attention from mainstream sources as well as seasoned crypto traders, lies in the price bull run that is continuing unabated this week. At press time, Bitcoin was challenging $29,300 amid a stubborn refusal to consolidate lower.At $539 billion, the largest cryptocurrency surpassed the market cap yesterday of finance giant Berkshire Hathaway, the CEO of which, Warren Buffett, famously likened Bitcoin to “rat poison squared.”Despite its 290% year-to-date returns, however, Bitcoin still pales in comparison to the performance of the largest altcoin Ether (ETH). As Digital Assets Data confirms, ETH/USD has sealed gains of almost 500% since Jan. 1. Versus the March lows, performance is even stronger.In a series of tweets on Wednesday, Bobby Ong, creator of price data site Coingecko, gave his predictions for the crypto market in 2021. Among the major tokens, Ether would see a return to higher transaction fees but pass its existing all-time high from 2018.“ETH will break past its $1,500 ATH mainly driven by DeFi. Gas fees will skyrocket again and highlight scalability issues,” he wrote.For Bitcoin, Ong forecast a price trajectory towards $100,000, alongside the launch of a long-awaited exchange-traded fund and the first central bank adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet."
131,"Within the last hour, the Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied to set a new all-time high at $29,000. On Dec. 29, the Bitcoin price attempted to push through a stiff resistance cluster at $28,500, but after rallying to $28,600, the price rejected with a sharp correction to $27,300.Today’s move to $29,000 came after a high-volume surge pushed through the $28,500 resistance, but the battle for $30,000 is far from over.Data from Material Indicators shows there are still sell walls near the $30,000 level at Binance and other major cryptocurrency exchanges.Barring another sustained high-volume surge in purchasing volume, the presence of sell walls suggests that a rally to $30,000 may trigger a strong sell-off and cause BTC price to revisit key underlying supports at $28,000 and $27,300, where the 20-day moving average currently resides on the 4-hour timeframe.Many retail traders expect the Bitcoin price to soar well above $30,000 once the psychological barrier is overcome, but Nunya Bizniz, a popular trader on Twitter, pointed out that above $30,000, Bitcoin price begins to look a bit overextended, as the 1.618 Fibonacci retracement is at $30,196.Given that Bitcoin price has rallied 64.9% since the start of December, hitting the 1.618 Fib level could provide a signal that a pullback is on the cards, but ultimately, volume will be the primary indicator of where the price may go.Currently, Bitcoin price has gained 302.6% for the year and is vastly outperforming gold and traditional markets like the Dow and S&P500. For Q4, BTC has rallied by 168.32%, securing the second-best quarterly performance since 2017 when the digital asset gained 210.13% in Q4.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

132,"National Football League player Russell Okung is a strong proponent of Bitcoin (BTC). And while he may be converting a portion of his salary into BTC, his employer, the Carolina Panthers, isn’t paying him in virtual currency — although a few excitable crypto-focused publications were foxed by the story.A spokesperson from the Carolina Panthers confirmed to Cointelegraph that Okung, like the rest of his teammates, is paid in dollars only. What he chooses to do with the money is his business, the spokesperson said. In other words, the player doesn't have any agreement with the team to receive compensation in the form of BTC. Offensive tackle Okung is currently in the final year of a four-year contract and will earn $13 million this year, according to Spotrac. The NFL player is reportedly using a crypto startup called Strike to convert some of his earnings into Bitcoin. A beta version of the application, which claims to allow users to “send money instantly, with no fees, anywhere in the world,” is available for iOS, Android and Chrome.Okung may have contributed to the confusion in a recent tweet proclaiming that he is being “Paid in Bitcoin.” The tweet was a response to a post from May 2019 when he first expressed his desire to get paid in BTC.Paid in Bitcoin. https://t.co/Ey6oOcmLjAIt's not entirely clear whether Okung intended to show that he's getting paid in Bitcoin or to promote the crypto startup with the following tweet:Do it, now. pic.twitter.com/9eAJxcBxLiThe NFL star has amassed a large following on Twitter due to his celebrity status and Bitcoin evangelism. His Twitter headline reads, “life liberty, and #bitcoin.” His followers include Michael Saylor and Anthony Pompliano, among other crypto proponents. His recent tweets promote the idea of buying Bitcoin and educating citizens on the impact of inflation on the buying power of the U.S. dollar.You can make “x” a year and watch it slowly erode with inflation or you can protect your hard earned money with #bitcoin"
133,"Bitcoin (BTC) has had a stellar 2020, but how are other top crypto assets faring? Let’s take a look at how some of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization performed this . First, Bitcoin has seen a massive gain since Jan. 1, as its price soared from $7,195 to as high as $28,422.Within 12 months, the price of Bitcoin rose by 290%, outperforming all major stock indices and most stocks, apart from a select few including Tesla (TSLA).The main catalysts behind Bitcoin’s rally have been the increase in institutional demand, favorable financial conditions as a result of central bank liquidity injections, and the decline of the U.S. dollar.The combination of the three macro factors fueled Bitcoin’s momentum in October. Eventually, as major institution-focused platforms including CME and Grayscale saw a large spike in volume and inflows, accelerating Bitcoin’s rally.Ether (ETH) price performed strongly throughout 2020, despite its recent stagnant phase against Bitcoin.The Ether price started 2020 at $128 across major exchanges and at its peak on Dec. 30, ETH achieved $748.The primary driver of Ether’s rally throughout November was the release of Eth2. After reaching a threshold of over 400,000 ETH in deposits, Eth2 commenced.Eth2 is a major network upgrade for Ethereum as it scales the blockchain exponentially over time. Without Eth2, Ethereum is able to process under 20 transactions per second. With Eth2, this figure increases to potentially thousands of transactions per second.In year-to-date performance, most of the old school altcoins (the one's from 2017 and earlier), including XRP, Cadano (ADA), and Stellar (XLM), lagged behind Bitcoin pr.Out of the original altcoins, XRP initially performed particularly well in November as Bitcoin rallied towards its all-time high.XRP began the year at $0.1923 and surged to as high as $0.9210, demonstrating a four-fold increase in about 11 months. However, as BTC surged past $20,000, altcoins took a hit, causing XRP to drop to $0.52. After the SEC's lawsuit against Ripple, XRP dropped further, declining to as low as $0.17.Polkadot, Chainlink, EOS, and Tezos have also rallied since the beginning of the year. The four smart contract-related cryptocurrencies each saw considerable catalysts for short-term rallies when BTC rallied towards $20,000.For instance, Chainlink benefited from the explosive growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Chainlink is an oracle-focued blockchain network and the objective of an oracle is to feed data to DeFi protocols.As such, as the total value locked in DeFi reached $16 billion, Chainlink rallied and so did many other DeFi-linked tokens.Despite various respective catalysts, Polkadot, EOS, Tezos, and Chainlink lagged behind Bitcoin in year-to-date gains. The main reason behind the muted price action was Bitcoin’s meteoric rally post-$20,000, which caused altcoins to pull back.Specialized tokens, such as Wrapped Bitcoin, USDC, and Tether also saw significant growth in terms of market cap. These tokens are mainly utilized on DeFi protocols and the rapid increase in user activity made each token endemic to the DeFi ecosystem.Tether has just surpassed a $20B market capitalization! 

This fantastic milestone is another confirmation for Tether maintaining its number one spot as the most liquid, stable and trusted currency! pic.twitter.com/sorWjzChIoTether, in particular, saw a rapid increase in market capitalization in the fourth quarter of 2020. As Cointelegraph reported, Tether, the most used stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market, surpassed $20 billion in valuation."
134,"On-chain data suggests that high-net-worth individuals continued to buy Bitcoin (BTC) after Christmas. Analysts at Santiment said that smaller traders sold about $647 million worth of Bitcoin and this sum may have been bought up by Bitcoin whales.Data also signals that large investors have been buying and holding their purchases throughout 2020, without booking profits in an aggressive manner. According to Glassnode analysts, this has caused the number of Bitcoin in circulation to decline by about 1 million.That means, out of the total available supply, 14.5 million Bitcoin are considered illiquid. Glassnode analysts say that this leaves only 4.2 million Bitcoin in constant circulation that are available for trading..This could further increase the imbalance in the demand and supply equation boosting Bitcoin’s price higher.However, every bull market goes through periodic corrections and Bitcoin may also be due for one. Therefore, traders should weigh the risks before buying at the current levels.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find the altcoins that may join Bitcoin in the breakout.Bitcoin had formed a gravestone Doji candlestick pattern on Dec. 27 but the bears could not pull the price down on Dec. 28. The bears again tried to start a correction on Dec. 29 but the hammer candlestick formation suggests strong buying on dips.The bulls have pushed the BTC/USD pair to a new all-time high at $28,587.67 today. This suggests that the uptrend has resumed. The next level to watch on the upside is the psychological barrier at $30,000.Although the rising moving averages suggest an advantage to the bulls, the relative strength index (RSI) has risen deep into overbought territory, which suggests that a correction could be around the corner.Overbought levels at the start of a rally is a sign of accumulation, but after a mature rally, an RSI above 80 suggests buying due to FOMO and this usually leads to a correction. Therefore, traders should remain cautious and protect their paper profits with a suitable stop-loss.A break below $25,800 could signal the start of a deeper correction to the 20-day exponential moving average ($23,836) and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($20,077).Ether (ETH) formed an inside day long-legged Doji candlestick pattern on Dec. 29. This suggests that the bears tried to pull the price down but the bulls absorbed all the selling and staged a strong recovery by the end of the day.The bulls are currently attempting to push the price above $750 but the Doji candlestick pattern suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears.If this uncertainty resolves to the upside and the ETH/USD pair rises above $750, the uptrend could reach $800 where the bears may again mount a stiff resistance.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest that bulls are in control.However, if the bulls fail to drive the price above $750, the pair could attract profit booking by the short-term traders. If the bears sink the price below $$680, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($645).A strong rebound off the 20-day EMA will suggest that the sentiment remains bullish and traders are buying on dips. On the other hand, a break below the 20-day EMA may signal the start of a deeper correction.XRP continues to be in a strong downtrend and every attempt to start a relief rally is facing aggressive selling by the bears. The altcoin dipped to $0.172536 on Dec. 29 but the long tail on the candlestick suggests that bulls are attempting to defend this level.The relief rally could face stiff resistance at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.358202. If the price turns down from this level, the bears will again try to resume the downtrend. A break below $0.172536 could result in a fall to $0.10.However, if the bulls defend the $0.169 support, the XRP/USD pair could consolidate in a tight range for a few days before starting the next trending move.The bulls have managed to keep Litecoin (LTC) above the $124.1278 support for the past few days but the failure to resume the uptrend suggests a lack of demand at higher levels.When the price fails to rise, it could attract selling by short-term traders and that may pull the price down to the 20-day EMA ($110).If the LTC/USD pair rebounds off this support, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend. If they succeed in driving the price above $140, the pair could rally to $160.However, the RSI has formed a negative divergence, which suggests that the momentum is weakening. A break below the 20-day EMA could drag the price down to $95.40.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is struggling to rise above the $370 overhead resistance but the positive thing is that the price has not given up much ground. This suggests that traders are not closing their positions in a hurry.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 60 suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the bulls can push and sustain the price above $370, the BCH/USD pair may rise to $430 and then to $500.This positive view will be negated if the pair drops below the 20-day EMA ($317). Such a move could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days.Polkadot (DOT) soared above the $5.60 to $6.0857 overhead resistance zone on Dec. 28 and followed it up with another sharp up-move on Dec. 29 that carried the altcoin to $7.70, just above the $7.67 target objective mentioned in the previous analysis.The bears are currently attempting to defend the $7.70 level but the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests aggressive buying by the bulls on intraday dips.If the price does not drop below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of $6.6428, the DOT/USD pair could resume the uptrend, with the next target at $10.On the contrary, if the bears pull the price below $6.6428, a drop to $6.3163 and then to $5.9897 is possible. Such a move will suggest that the momentum has weakened and that could keep the pair range-bound for a few days.Cardano (ADA) broke above the $0.175 to $0.1826315 overhead resistance zone on Dec. 29 but the bulls have not been able to sustain the breakout. The price has dipped back below $0.1826315 today.However, the upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that bulls are in control.If the ADA/USD pair rebounds off the current levels, it will suggest that $0.175 has flipped to support. The bulls will then try to push the price above $0.1966315, which could result in a rally to $0.22 and then to $0.235.This positive view will invalidate if the price dips and sustains below $0.175. Such a move could result in a drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.161).Binance Coin (BNB) closed above the $35.69 overhead resistance on Dec. 28 and followed it up with another sharp up-move on Dec. 29 that pushed the price to a new all-time high at $39.99.The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that bulls have the upper hand.The bears are currently attempting to stall the up-move near $40 but if the price does not dip below $35.69, it will increase the possibility of the resumption of the uptrend. If that happens, the BNB/USD pair could rise to $50.Contrary to this assumption, if the price dips back below $35.69, a drop to the 20-day EMA ($33) is likely.The bulls could not propel Chainlink (LINK) above the $13.28 overhead resistance on Dec. 27 and the altcoin turned down on Dec. 29. The bears are currently attempting to sink the price below the $11.29 support.If they succeed, the LINK/USD pair could drop to $10 and if this support also gives way, the decline may extend to $8. The downsloping 20-day EMA ($12.24) and the failure of the RSI to sustain above 50 suggests that bears have the upper hand.This negative view will be invalidated if the pair rebounds off the current levels and rises above the $13.28 resistance. If that happens, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The pair could then rally to $16.39.Bitcoin SV (BSV) has been range-bound between $146 and $181 for the past few weeks. The flat moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.In a well-defined range, traders buy the dips to the support and sell near the resistance. Thus, the BSV/USD pair may rebound off $146 and extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.The longer the consolidation, the stronger will be the breakout from it. If the pair rises above the moving averages, the bulls will once again try to push the price above $181. If they succeed, a rally to $216 and then to $227 is possible.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below $146, the trend will shift in favor of the bears.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

135,"2020 has been a year of upheaval throughout the world. Overshadowed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the events of this year brought forth new challenges no one was prepared for, upending the way we live, work, and transact. Early this year, global financial markets took a severe hit as stocks, commodities and even cryptocurrency prices fell. Against the backdrop of economic uncertainty and the declining value of the U.S. dollar, crypto assets are moving higher up the radar screens of commercial banks, hedge funds and other institutional investors. As we approach the end of a tumultuous year, it would be timely to recap the events that have been significant for the crypto industry this year, while looking ahead to new developments in 2021.Unless you’ve had your head in the sand for most of 2020, you probably witnessed the explosive growth of the DeFi sector this year. Particularly with crypto lending and decentralized exchanges, which attracted an enormous amount of capital inflow in a very short period of time. DeFi applications have been running in parallel with legacy financial systems in the last few years, but the void left by traditional financial services during this crisis demonstrates the pressing need to move to a much wider adoption of DeFi services. In a world where cash payments are no longer welcome and people predominantly work from home and transact over the internet, the move to DeFi seems a natural one.Related: Yield farming is a fad, but DeFi promises to change the way we interact with moneyWhile there’s no denying the real potential of DeFi, one question we should be asking is: Will this growth be sustainable? As we’ve seen in the past with other subsectors of crypto, they tend to follow a cycle where, following exponential price increases of new tech platforms and protocol tokens, the market goes into profit-taking mode. This results in fast declining prices, which precedes a slow recovery phase. The platforms that have survived those volatile early stages are now slowly consolidating their positions as adoption increases, and token prices are starting to be driven by more fundamental criteria such as number of users and platform volumes.As DeFi is still currently only experimented with by yield-seeking traders, it remains to be seen whether DeFi will chart the same path in 2021 and beyond; however, its transparent, highly liquid and flexible financial models certainly hold great potential to benefit the real economy at large.Related: DeFi needs real-world adoption, not just disruptive pioneeringThe economic rollercoaster of 2020 and high volatility of the financial markets have yet again cast a spotlight on Bitcoin (BTC) and its function as a store of value. This has attracted an increasingly large number of prominent financial players. While Bitcoin may not be used as a transactional currency anytime soon, it’s clear that Bitcoin still maintains its digital gold status and is now increasingly perceived as a credible store of value by mainstream market participants.Large private and publicly-listed corporations are seen diversifying their treasury positions into Bitcoin as a way to hedge against the impending inflation and benefit from potential gains in Bitcoin’s price appreciation — most notably, Michael Saylors’s MicroStrategy, divesting $425 million into Bitcoin this September.Related: Institutional investors won’t save crypto, but they will help it growWhat’s perhaps even more interesting is that we’re seeing the world's central banks begin to warm to the world of crypto. While they have certainly watched the space from the sidelines with great interest, the COVID-19 crisis became a catalyst for them to act. In tandem with the Bank for International Settlements, several major central banks around the world took early steps in the right direction by publishing a report outlining a potential framework for introducing CBDCs as an alternative to cash.Related: Central bank digital currencies and their role in the financial systemThat said, significant technical and structural barriers must be overcome before any CBDCs become reality. To support these efforts, Mastercard created a virtual testing platform to allow central banks to assess and explore the implementation of national digital currencies, and is already beginning to test how it could incorporate CBDCs into its operations. PayPal has also marked its entry into the cryptocurrency market, enabling U.S.-based PayPal users to buy and sell digital currencies directly from their PayPal accounts.Related: Will PayPal’s crypto integration bring crypto to the masses? Experts answerOverall, it seems as though the blockchain and crypto industry is now being taken into consideration more seriously as a technology and an asset class by both private and public institutions, who are finally starting to realise that this industry will be here to stay for the long run.Even before the global pandemic, there had been growing interest in the use of non-physical forms for cash; but when COVID-19 struck, it accelerated the shift towards remote, contactless payments, and the use of cash has fallen — this has all but strengthened the case for a digital payment system which, once merely thought of as just a convenience, is now more important than ever.Related: Digitized Europe: The shift to a cashless worldMoreover, in places where people cannot access closed banks but are connected to the internet, donations made in cryptocurrencies could serve as a practical alternative to enabling more individuals to receive financial help, including some of the most disadvantaged. In addition, donating in crypto can make moving money across borders much easier and much faster, with much lower processing fees.Related: Philanthropy: A missing catalyst of blockchain adoptionAs a distributed ledger technology, blockchain also has a key role to play in the post-COVID-19 world. Trust-minimising blockchain solutions can be helpful when dealing with remote parties, as is the case during times when travel has become nearly nonexistent. To foster innovation and creativity within the tech community, blockchain hackathons could promote the development of blockchain-powered solutions with the potential to enable financial inclusion, reduce the digital divide and tackle the challenges posed by the pandemic.As we begin our recovery from perhaps the most dangerous health crisis that humanity has faced in a very long time, financial topics such as increasing global stimulus measures, ongoing market volatility and the looming spectre of a global currency reset are set to dominate the headlines in 2021. The current and upcoming financial crises triggered by the world’s governments reactions to stop the spread of COVID-19 have the potential to fast-forward the adoption of digital currencies.Related: How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the crypto space? Experts answerWe see these macro events as the prime drivers for central banks as they work to develop their digital currency models. Looking ahead, the advent of CBDCs will represent a seminal point in terms of the maturation of the technology, providing the crypto industry with a plethora of new opportunities — and challenges — for the creation of next-generation smart open finance products and solutions that will cater to the yet untapped global mainstream audience.In addition, with signs of strong growth in the nonfungible token space, we can also expect to see a growing number of artists, NFT creators, games and marketplaces joining the space. As the world becomes more and more digitalised, NFTs are primed to be the solution to the question of ownership in the virtual marketplace as well as a new source of revenue — particularly when on-site events and sales are unavailable or out of reach.In such turbulent times, what is clear is that while the coronavirus pandemic presents many challenges, it is also a unique opportunity to rethink how trust-minimising solutions like blockchain can help us discern legitimate data from social media noise.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
136,"Bitcoin is becoming more difficult to buy, according to analysts at Glassnode. The amount of BTC received and spent among entities is decreasing, which means the liquidity is declining.If Bitcoin (BTC) liquidity is low, it means there is less BTC available to buy and sell. In the medium term, this could make BTC even more scarce.Throughout 2020, institutions have been increasingly accumulating Bitcoin, which has become compelling because of its fixed supply.In recent months, the concerns about inflation and rising central bank liquidity have intensified. This trend has led high-profile institutional investors, like Paul Tudor Jones, to consider Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation.Meanwhile, a trend that was kickstarted by MicroStrategy’s $425 million Bitcoin purchase in the summer spilled over to other financial giants. Eventually, PayPal, Square and even insurance conglomerates like MassMutual stepped into the fray.Consequently, the institutional accumulation of Bitcoin has accelerated since. As a result, Glassnode found that only 4.2 million BTC are in constant circulation for buying and selling. The firm wrote:In the past 12 months, $27.8 billion worth of Bitcoin has become illiquid. More long-term investors are holding onto their BTC, refraining from selling their assets.If long-time holders continue to move away from selling their BTC, the dominant cryptocurrency would become more scarce and difficult to accumulate.Such a trend would push up the value of Bitcoin in the longer run, fueling the ongoing bull cycle. The analysts explained:Another factor that could cause the circulating supply of Bitcoin to decrease in the foreseeable future is miners.Kyle Davies, the co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, said that there is a shortage of ASIC miners. Typically, miners would deploy capital to acquire hardware such as ASIC miners. But given that they are unable to buy, that could potentially drive inflows into BTC. He said:There is a big shortage of ASIC’s. Miners only need to sell enough bitcoin to cover existing USD operational costs. They are incentivized to hold all capital that would otherwise be deployed into buying hardware, in $BTC.The combination of multiple factors, such as increased HODLing activity, the likelihood of miners selling less BTC, and the drop in Bitcoin liquidity could further fuel BTC’s momentum in the first quarter of 2021."
137,"When you ask someone what superpower they’d most like to have, they usually come up with the ability to fly, or to read thoughts, or maybe to see through multiple layers of clothing.This year, all we wanted was the ability to hibernate.Imagine! Going to sleep sometime around the Australian wildfires… taking a peek outside in mid-March and thinking “Ooooh, no, not sure about this at all” and cuddling up in a warm, happy bed until the U.S. election was over.But think what you would have missed in crypto! 2020 was another decade-in-a-year for the industry, packed full of characters who charmed, hackers who harmed, and degens who farmed.To celebrate a year that ended on a high note for hodlers, the Cointelegraph team of artists has created a poster-sized limited edition NFT commemorating some of the biggest stories of 2020. It’s titled “In crypto, hindsight is 20/20"" and is available for just 0.02020 ETH.Naturally, there will only ever be 2,020 copies.GET YOUR 20/20 HINDSIGHT LIMITED EDITION NFT HEREHow many of the stories can you spot? We’ll get you off to a start with a few of our favorites…Here’s a story that could have been featured in any one of the first few months of the year. The Securities and Exchange Commission took issue with Telegram’s $1.7 billion private sale, and eventually Pavel Durov gave up on launching the network.Although the technology didn’t die — it was resurrected and just achieved mainnet status thanks to the Free TON community — it was yet more proof that Jay Clayton’s SEC would maintain an activist stance on crypto in 2020. At least he’s gone now, and good riddance.Back in February we presciently questioned whether DeFi was coming to an abrupt end as bZx was attacked twice. And when we say “presciently” we mean “wrongly”.DeFi didn’t disappear, exploits continued throughout the year, and the gainz multiplied in a veritable orgy of yield farming that allowed degens to trade their way to untold riches… and then lose them again when Pickle turned fickle.This being 2020, that cycle continued all year.The acceleration of the global pandemic brought two key concepts at the heart of the crypto community into sharp focus. It became clear that government control of the money supply spigot means no fiat asset is safe (and that it makes a kind of brrrrrrr-ing sound as it’s turned on) and that Bitcoin’s narrative shift from means-of-exchange to store-of-value might actually help the digital asset’s credibility.Almost nothing good has come of the disastrous response to the pandemic. While hodlers may have benefited financially from the proof that their thesis on Bitcoin as hard money was correct, the politicization of the virus means that the world has suffered a year that has threatened democracy itself.Let’s all hope for a better, and healthier, 2021.Despite the wild rumors promulgated by sources who have to remain nameless in case they’re fact-checked, Binance did not pay $400 million for CoinMarketCap. Or anything close to it.But it was still a mega-deal that demonstrated a 2020 trend: the slow dissipation of public adoration for Binance. Reaction to the deal was wary, to say the least, and the upstart-turned-incumbent found itself embroiled in controversy as ranking changes appeared to benefit it unfairly, following promises of the data aggregator’s independence.These days, CoinGecko is catching up fast. Bobby Ong was rumored to be on the verge of selling the site for $5 million earlier this year. He must be grateful for the uncharacteristic lack of vision on the part of its suitor…The third halving (or halvening, for those who prefer Middle Earth’s Westron tongue) was almost entirely devoid of drama.It was supposed to happen. It happened. Code is law.Of course, the after-effects have been more intriguing than the event itself (although it certainly threw our video team for a loop).Plan B’s stock-to-flow model predicted a surge in Bitcoin’s price as a direct result of the halving and subsequent supply crisis, and despite the naysayers it’s right on schedule.Right. On. Schedule.Hope for the mass adoption of crypto as a payment solution has often been predicated on debit or credit cards that make it easier to spend. So when Wirecard, which counted major companies such as Crypto.com and TenX as customers, appeared to misplace $2.1 billion there were… concerns over the future of the sector.Those concerns haven’t dented the ambitions of Crypto.com, which soon replaced Wirecard with PayrNet, while some saw the fall of Wirecard as a net positive for the industry.One man and a worthless token can change the world.Of course, that one man now works with a dedicated team of DeFi developers, the worthless token topped out at $43,678, and the world was already changing… but don’t let the details fool you.The story of Andre Cronje’s contribution to technology and finance may well be told over drinks in the boardroom for decades to come.At least the Wright brothers had each other.Michael Saylor may be a genius (he’s invested over a billion dollars of his company’s treasury in Bitcoin) and he may be a lunatic (read his Twitter feed) but what we can say for certain is that he’s boldly going where no major company has gone before.Saylor’s dramatic announcement has been heralded as the moment that mainstream business entities beyond funds and investment banks had to confront a new reality. If MicroStrategy’s bet was successful, it could immediately place other corporate treasuries at risk — specifically, at risk of being unable to claim similar portfolios due to Bitcoin’s limited supply.There’s often a fine line between courage and craziness. Perhaps Saylor is 2020’s best crypto example of that truth.If MicroStrategy was a pointer to increased institutional adoption of crypto, PayPal was the biggest indication yet that Josephine Public would soon be exposed to digital assets.Crypto assets aren’t tradeable outside the PayPal ecosystem, but that hasn't stopped the company buying an estimated 70% of all newly-issued Bitcoins as a reserve.And while PayPal's own stock soared on the news that it would support Bitcoin, it also provided the impetus for an increasingly parabolic price movement for the leading digital asset… which rapidly flippened the company’s market cap.“Taxation is illegal,” declared John McAfee in January of 2019, clarifying (for those who might have a vested interest) that he hadn’t filed a return in eight years.“No, you’re illegal,” the IRS responded — we’re paraphrasing — and had him arrested and thrown in a Spanish jail.It was certainly quite the year for crypto-related arrests.Gradually, then suddenly. That’s how Bitcoin reclaimed the territory lost since the FOMO days of December 2017.Despite ‘dying’ over and over and over again (in the minds of critics, at least) Bitcoin is now sitting comfortably at well over $25,000 and enjoying a growing consensus that it is a genuine alternative to gold.Even the most conservative prognosticators are coming around.Gradually, then suddenly.Speaking of gradually… Ethereum took a long and winding road to the next iteration of the leading smart contract platform. But as the deposit contract filled up, the prospects for a successful December 1st launch finally became clearer.Many of the year’s top trends — from DeFi to the growing adoption of NFTs — feature Ethereum as a key player.

138,"Bitcoin (BTC) returned to hitting records on Dec. 30 after a fresh rebound took it above its $28,400 all-time high.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView showed BTC/USD tackle its existing historic top during trading on Wednesday.In a strong resurgence overnight, Bitcoin confirmed that it had no time for bears after briefly dipping as low as $25,830 over the past 24 hours.Daily gains were at 7.5% at press time as $28,560 became reality.The move brings Bitcoin ever closer to sealing $30,000 as a new psychological level before the end of the year, something that seemed all but impossible just one week ago.As Cointelegraph reported, however, analysts still believe that a reversal could take the largest cryptocurrency down to existing support at $19,500.On Tuesday, Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe nonetheless highlighted $27,500 as the critical area to break in order to pave the way for new all-time highs.The knock-on impact among major cap altcoins was clearly felt, with Ether (ETH) nearing $740 after rising 5.5% on the day.Polkadot (DOT) added to existing strength to see weekly performance approach 50%.As before, the exception was XRP, which maintained 10% daily losses as continued delistings by major exchanges further weighed on sentiment. The troubled coin nonetheless managed to reclaim $0.20."
139,"During a bull market, negative news is quickly digested, and the collateral damage is often limited. Therefore, even as XRP price dumped aggressively due to the uncertainty regarding the outcome of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's lawsuit, other altcoins have largely been unaffected.Moreover, as Bitcoin’s (BTC) strong rally takes a breather, several altcoins have broken out of their overhead resistance levels and are attempting to resume their uptrend. Let’s look at a few tokens that have risen sharply in the past few days and analyze their charts to ascertain whether the rally could extend further.Zilliqa's Zilling (ZIL) token has risen sharply in 2020. Part of the rally could be attributed to the decentralized finance boom that dominated a large portion of the year.After launching its decentralized exchange, ZilSwap, on Oct. 5 and noncustodial staking on Oct. 14, the token rallied considerably. These new features allowed the community to stake directly in the smart contract, whereas previously, they had to do it through a third-party intermediary.To date, the community has staked about 30.49% of the total outstanding supply, and the low eligibility threshold of 10 ZIL may have attracted greater participation from tokenholders.During the coronavirus pandemic, most people have stayed indoors and spent their time on social media. Thus, the timing of Zilliqa’s SocialPay launch could not have been better. The platform launched in May, and it rewards users for sharing Zilliqa’s updates and announcements on Twitter.All these fundamental developments may be the reason for the increase in the number of wallet addresses and monthly transactions in 2020. But can the token continue its outperformance in 2021? Let’s study its charts to find out.The altcoin has been in a strong uptrend, and it rallied from an intraday low at $0.0296388 on Dec. 12 to an intraday high at $0.0996 on Dec. 27, a 236% rally in about two weeks. Usually, these vertical rallies are not sustainable in the long run. Periodic corrections or consolidations are needed that can cool the up-move and increase the longevity of the trend.The ZIL/USD pair has formed successive inside day candlestick patterns on Dec. 28 and today. This suggests a contraction in volatility as the bulls and the bears decide on the next directional move.If the inside day resolves to the upside, the uptrend could resume. Conversely, if the inside day candle is followed by a sharp down-move, the bears may have gained the upper hand and a deeper correction would be expected.Therefore, if the bears sink the price below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.0728748, a drop to the 50% retracement level at $0.0646194 and then to the 20-day exponential moving average ($0.0570) is possible.A strong bounce off this support hints that the positive sentiment remains intact, as traders are accumulating on dips. The bulls will then attempt to resume the uptrend, and if they can push the price above $0.0996, a rally to $0.14 may be possible.On the other hand, if the price slides below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that a short-term top could be in place, as bulls are not keen to buy on dips.The Terra protocol’s Luna token seems to have benefited from greater adoption of its existing products and the proposed launch of new ones. Its Chai payments app witnessed over 2.8 million transactions in November, with payment volumes crossing $90 million.To capitalize on the strong demand for U.S. stocks, commodities and exchange-traded funds, Terra launched the Mirror Protocol on Dec. 4, enabling the creation and trading of synthetic assets. This could continue to attract traders as long as the assets remain in a strong trend.Terra is also attempting to address the product referral marketing category that mainly benefits the direct referrer. The protocol plans to officially launch BuzLink, a marketing tool, in February 2021, which will reward the entire referral chain after the sale is done.Luna has risen from an intraday low of $0.45 on Dec. 24 to an intraday high at $0.70 today, a 55% gain within a week. The upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) close to the overbought zone suggest bulls have the upper hand.The LUNA/USD pair broke above the $0.57 overhead resistance on Dec. 28, which completed a rounding bottom pattern. This bullish setup has a target objective of $0.86.However, the Doji candlestick pattern with a long wick today shows that traders are booking profits at higher levels. This could drag the price down to the breakout level at $0.57.If the pair rebounds off this level, or even from the 20-day EMA ($0.51), it will suggest that bulls are in control. A break above $0.70 could resume the uptrend.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink and sustain the price below $0.57 and the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the recent breakout was a bull trap. The trend may favor the bears if the pair drops below $0.45.The coronavirus pandemic has made people and businesses even more aware of the power of digital technology. VeChain developed the E-HCert App in collaboration with the Mediterranean Hospital of Cyprus to store COVID-19 test records. After its successful implementation, Aretaeio Hospital has also joined the VeChain ecosystem to integrate its lab testing services, which will make the data readily accessible to patients to use as required.The VeChainThor blockchain also recently received a 5-Star-Rated Blockchain Service Certificate from TÜV Saarland, a European certification body. This could increase confidence in its ecosystem and also improve investor sentiment about VET token. In a further boost, Grant Thornton Cyprus revealed itself as one of the VeChainThor Authority Masternodes. These developments could open up new possibilities for the future.VeChain Token (VET) has rallied from an intraday low at $0.011724 on Dec. 23 to an intraday high at $0.02120375 today, an 80% gain in a short time. The bears are likely to defend the $0.02210 level aggressively, as it has been acting as a stiff resistance for the past few months.However, if the VET/USD pair does not break below $0.018, the bulls will make one more attempt to drive the price above $0.02210. If they succeed, the pair will complete a rounding bottom pattern that has a target objective at $0.0353.The 20-day EMA ($0.0165) has started to turn up and the RSI is above 60, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand. Even a consolidation between $0.018 and $0.0221 would be a positive sign and would increase the possibility of a breakout of the overhead resistance.Contrary to this assumption, if the price again gets rejected at $0.02210, it could attract profit-booking from the short-term traders, and that may pull the price back below the moving averages. Such a move could suggest that the pair may consolidate in a large range for a few days.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

140,"Since the creation of the first cryptocurrency over a decade ago, many have often been skeptical of their legitimacy, with some even dismissing them as a fraud. But in 2020, this paradigm seemed to have shifted. What has emerged is a shared recognition that Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets are here to stay and that they will play a key role in the future of global finance. This is not some far-fetched vision reserved to crypto-anarchists — financial actors that were traditionally wary of cryptocurrencies are now expressing confidence in their disruptive potential. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, for instance, have recently reversed their initial opposition to cryptocurrencies, becoming some of the latest to offer new banking services and offerings for the digital assets market.Related: Will PayPal’s crypto integration bring crypto to the masses? Experts answerAs optimism and appreciation for the long term potential of cryptocurrencies continue to grow, so will the opportunities for revenue expansion among players within the ecosystem. Bitcoin miners, for instance, saw their topline figures surge by close to 50% on a month-on-month basis in November, as Bitcoin prices rallied more than 60% to above $18,000 over the same time period. Yet, in a highly competitive environment, success has largely been confined to a few industry leaders while remaining elusive to many.For miners, gaining access to highly advanced mining equipment — one that boasts the highest level of power and cost efficiencies, and the fastest processing speeds — remains the single most critical factor to securing a competitive edge.Related: Cryptocurrency mining profitability in 2020: Is it possible?The crypto mining industry has undergone a succession of substantial transformations to arrive at today’s advanced technical state. In its early days, mining was done using simple computers without any complex or high-powered devices. General-purpose central processing units, or CPUs, were all it took to produce Bitcoin. This led to a rapid expansion of the Bitcoin network, as the allure of easy money prompted an influx of new entrants — so much so that these first-generation miners were unable to keep pace with demand, rendering them obsolete in just a year’s time.Graphics processing units were introduced next and made mining Bitcoin more efficient and profitable. Combining several GPUs became a common sight, as miners sought to further increase their mining performance and capabilities while maximizing gains. Despite these advancements, second-generation miners did not stand the test of time due to their high energy consumption and lack of long-term efficacy.In 2011, field-programmed gate arrays, or FPGAs, emerged as the next logical step of progression. They were fast, highly energy-efficient, offered better performance and easier cooling than their predecessors. Nonetheless, FPGA miners were short-lived and eventually replaced by ASICs, which, until today, remain the dominant technology for the Bitcoin mining industry. Designed, built and optimized for the sole purpose of mining, ASICs are recognized for their superior harmonization of power consumption, performance and cost — around a million times more energy efficient and 50 million times faster in mining Bitcoin than the CPUs used in 2009.Indeed, crypto mining has come a long way. Aside from performance-related developments, there have also been notable improvements to the environmental aspect of the technology, such as higher energy efficiency and faster hash rates. With a growing emphasis on sustainability, this is a trend likely to continue as chip design providers look to develop innovative solutions to cater to this evolving demand.Two main developmental areas come to mind. First, the reengineering of current mining hardware to radically utilize less energy; and, second, a reprogramming of current mining chips to allow the use of hybrid energy for optimal cost performance.Reengineering of the current mining hardware. Already, there are several concepts out in the market that are being researched and rigorously put to test — one of them being the use of photonic chips to perform computing. In theory, the technology appears promising, with two to three orders of magnitude better energy efficiency over current electronic processors. Yet, in reality, it remains inconclusive as to whether the power savings are realizable, particularly as Bitcoin scales. Until then, ASICs and their ongoing enhancements will continue to dominate the crypto mining space and lead the charge on energy efficiency in crypto mining.Reprogramming of the current mining chips. Against common belief, the crypto mining industry is a relatively green one. As of December 2019, Bitcoin was powered by over 70% of renewable electricity. While the benefits of using renewables are undisputed, the truth is that renewables are an intermittent source of energy and are not always reliable for Bitcoin miners, who have a constant energy requirement. Fossil fuel-based power, on the contrary, serves generally as a more steady source of energy. To strike a balance between the sustainability of the industry and sustainability more broadly, a hybrid model can be adopted, whereby renewables are used predominantly as an energy source, with fossil fuel-based power setting in during production shortages. This entails redesigning and reprogramming current mining chips to enable greater ease of toggling between the two variants of energy sources, with no disruption to the mining processes.As cryptocurrencies continue to rise in prominence, so will the influx of competition from new providers wanting a slice of the pie. Healthy competition can be positive in that it can lead to more innovation that brings greater efficiencies and maturity to the industry. To fully capitalize on the growth of the nascent cryptocurrency market, however, incumbent chip designers will need to invest further into research and development, particularly in areas of energy optimization and power performance.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
141,"The monthly relative strength index (RSI) of Bitcoin (BTC) shows the dominant cryptocurrency is primed for another rally.The RSI is a momentum indicator that measures whether an asset is overbought or oversold. When the RSI surpasses 75, it signals the asset is overbought, and when it drops below 30, it means the asset is oversold.A pseudonymous trader known as “Crypto Capo” noted that the monthly RSI of Bitcoin is set to close above 80. Historically, when this has happened, BTC has saw a strong rally afterward.Although the monthly RSI of Bitcoin is above 80, which is technically overbought, BTC’s RSI tends to become overbough for prolonged periods during a bull cycle.Hence, traders often refer to an overbought RSI on a high time frame chart, like the monthly candle chart, to forecast an extended rally in the short term to medium term. The trader said:However, the trader emphasized that one indicator cannot accurately predict the price cycle of Bitcoin. Crypto Capo explained that the combination of a few indicators could serve as guidance for the future. He wrote:Traders have differing perspectives on where Bitcoin is headed in 2021, but most traders remain overwhelmingly bullish.Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michael van de Poppe said he anticipates Bitcoin to reach $65,000 to $85,000 by next year’s end. He stated:Meanwhile, the options market is pricing in a 22% chance of Bitcoin achieving $120,000 by next year, which could also serve as a potential guideline on where BTC is heading in 2021.In the short-term, however, some traders are cautious in entering leveraged positions. A pseudonymous trader known as “TheBoot” said the ideal scenario is to wait for Bitcoin to consolidate at $25,000 or enter after the next price upsurge. The trader explained:Cointelegraph previously reported that whales have been buying Bitcoin more aggressively since Christmas, which could buoy the mid-term bull case for BTC entering into 2021."
142,"In a period filled with holidays, the cryptocurrency industry refused to take a day off. Strong market performances from Bitcoin (BTC) and some other high profile alt-coins like Ether (ETH,) was offset by the legal action against Ripple by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. In response, a number of prominent trading platforms, including Coinbase, Crypto.com, and FalconX responded by halting trading or deposits of the XRP token.The latest findings by Santiment, published in Cointelegraph Consulting’s biweekly newsletter, indicate that the balance of wallets holding dormant BTC over a 365-day period has become more active. Between December 13 and 20, more than 146,620 BTC (~$3.9 billion at the time of writing) that fit this description moved on the blockchain, marking its highest weekly volume since July 2019.These long-term investors tend to trade based on extensive analysis or intimate market knowledge, which is why intense spikes in dormant Bitcoin tend to be more indicative of larger shifts in market conditions and interim price volatility.Still, with Coinbase’s high-profile IPO right around the corner, and institutional buying is high, so it’s not unreasonable to expect conditions to remain positive going into 2021. Many investors were considering the possibility of a “Christmas Dump” as $2.3 billion in Bitcoin options contracts were set to expire, the largest ever in a single day. With that event in the rear-view mirror, many investors are now optimistic that the momentum of 2020 will continue into the new year.Read the full newsletter edition here for more news and signals, complete with detailed charts and images.Cointelegraph’s Market Insights Newsletter shares our knowledge on the fundamentals that move the digital asset market.

143,"As one of the first countries to industrialize in the 1760s, Britain’s manufacturing revolution instigated one of the greatest practical and ubiquitous changes in human history. But even more extraordinary than the cultural shift itself, is the fact that Britain’s industrialization remained way ahead of potential competition for decades. Only in the early 1900s did historians come to grips with the issues of causation. Max Weber’s pithy answer, “the Protestant work ethic,” pointed to Puritan seriousness, diligence, fiscal prudence and hard work. Others point to the establishment of the Bank of England in 1694 as a foundation for financial stability.In contrast, continental Europe lurched from one national debt crisis to another, then threw itself headlong into the Napoleonic wars. Unsurprisingly, it was not until after 1815 that industrialization took place on the European mainland, where it was spearheaded by the new country of Belgium.250 years later, another revolution has begun with the launch of Bitcoin (BTC), but this one is more commercial in nature than industrial. Though the full impact has yet to play out, the parallels between these two historical events are already striking.Bitcoin may not match the obviousness of industrialization, but the underlying pragmatics touch on the very foundations of the non-barter economy. Like the establishment of the Bank of England, the creation of the cryptocurrency infrastructure has been prompted by ongoing and worsening threats to financial stability: systemic fault-lines created by macroeconomic challenges stemming from the 2008 financial crisis.Where a central bank once anchored financial enlightenment, it now plays the role of antagonist. For those who could “connect the dots” in 2008, there was the realization that central banks no longer existed as guardians and protectors of national currencies, but rather as tools for creating politicized market distortions, abandoning their duty to preserve wealth in favor of creating the conditions for limitless, cheap government debt. While many of the underlying intentions were benign, the process inherently worked to punish savers and reward reckless debt.Meanwhile, it has steadily taken time for the potential of digital assets to reach their potential and approach something like critical mass, though thankfully full acceptance shouldn’t take as long as Britain’s industrial revolution. Over the past 12 years, cryptocurrencies have moved from unknown to novel to significant, growing interest. As a result, profound changes are underway, affecting the mechanics by which investors, the investment industry, wealth managers and even the commercial banking sector are engaging with cryptocurrencies.This interest has accelerated as we enter into a period of deep economic uncertainty and growing awareness that structural soundness is shifting away from traditional investment options. Not only that, this growing financial innovation and public interest has largely occurred outside of the central banks’ control, if not outright antagonism led by the banks’ regulatory arms in government.Now, many central banks are trying to join a game they’ve tried almost every way of beating, with digital currencies that adopt the glowing sheen of crypto innovation, but which also eschew the underlying innovations and philosophy that made those innovations so popular to begin with.The popularity of cryptocurrency has largely been due to its protean fungibility — it has been whatever the independent financial community has needed it to be, from digital currency to speculative financial instruments to smart contracts that can power smart financial technology.However hard central banks might try to co-opt the hype of cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency succeeding will mark the fundamental end of critical aspects of the central banking monopoly by offering a more competitive vehicle for facilitating commercial transactions and providing a more stable medium to store monetized assets. Cryptocurrencies actually offer real returns on “cash” deposits, something that the fiat banking system has long since abandoned. Most of all, cryptocurrencies reveal the fictitious nature of fiat currencies as a principle.Cryptocurrencies as an ecosystem will increasingly constrain, redirect and set the parameters for government macroeconomic policies. Certainly, sound alternatives to fiat currencies will drive the latter to the periphery of commercial life, concomitantly reducing the number of tools the nation-state has at its disposal to regulate or respond to changing economic conditions. Above all, this means that government financial engagement can no longer be a rule unto itself. It will have to engage by the same principles as everyone else. A level playing field here has dramatic implications.Against the backdrop of the essential limits of fiat currencies, current geo- and macroeconomic policies and a new emerging world order, cryptocurrencies offer vast potential as an efficiency facilitating frictionless commerce and investment, a medium of stability against uncertainty and inflation, increased security in value transfer and wealth management, optimum autonomy in an increasingly intrusive climate, and “cash” asset preservation/growth in a world of negative interest rates.The edifice that supports the concept of a “global reserve currency” is also weakening. This will reduce political influence over global finance, as well as nations’ abilities to run a long-term balance of payments deficits, current account deficits and borrow at little or no interest. Indeed, given current trends, changes in trading mechanics may speedily evolve to the point that such “reserve currencies” no longer have a function at all. And cryptocurrency success will hasten the end of the U.S. dollar monopoly in global commerce.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
144,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $26,000 on Dec. 29 as fresh fallout from Ripple’s threatened lawsuit with the United States Security and Exchange Commission was felt throughout crypto markets.Data from Cointelegraph Markets, Coin360 and TradingView showed BTC/USD hitting lows of $25,830 during Tuesday trading.$27,000 support failed to hold overnight, sparking a retest of lower levels that now center on $26,000. On the weekend, Bitcoin hit all-time highs of $28,400 before swiftly reversing.The latest losses come as XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, hits $0.23 thanks to major U.S. exchange Coinbase opting to suspend trading from next month. The SEC’s lawsuit against the token threatens to classify XRP as an unlicensed security and make trading it legally impossible.“There is going to be a rangebound construction, after which 2021 will most likely break out again,” Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe summarized about Bitcoin’s short-term perspectives in a video update on Monday.Van de Poppe is eyeing altcoins as next in line to see major gains. XRP notwithstanding, the market is already showing signs of life, with Ether (ETH) climbing above $700 for the first time since May 2018 this week.Another winner on Tuesday was Polkadot (DOT), now the seventh-largest token by market cap, which saw a 22.5% daily rise, capping weekly performance of nearly 34%.For Van de Poppe, the next “impulse wave” on Bitcoin in 2021 should take the market to $40,000 or $50,000, but “until then, altcoins will most likely do well.”He additionally pointed to a likely top in Bitcoin market cap dominance, which at almost 70% should soon give way to altcoin presence. December tends to see BTC dominance peaks, with 2017, the time of Bitcoin’s first attempt to crack $20,000, a notable comparison."
145,"Bitcoin (BTC) whales have been buying more since Christmas, on-chain data shows. This indicates that high-net-worth investors are continuing to eat up the supply of BTC.It is nearly impossible to segregate institutional investors from individual investors through on-chain data. However, the trend shows that investors with large capital are increasingly entering into the Bitcoin market despite its rally.According to the analysts at Santiment, around $647 million worth of Bitcoin likely transferred from small addresses to large addresses.Addresses holding over 1,000 BTC or more are considered whales by many analysts, as 1,000 BTC is equivalent to over $27 million at the current price at $27,100. The analysts wrote:Bitcoin has increased nearly threefold since mid-2020, and the upside for BTC is arguably limited in the near future.Still, most on-chain data points show that fewer whales are selling across major exchanges. Ki Young Ju, CEO at CryptoQuant, said:There are two main reasons why whales might be accumulating Bitcoin at the current price range.First, in spite of Bitcoin’s overextended rally, whales might believe that the psychological barrier at $30,000 will break. If so, options data suggests $36,000 could be a likely target in the near term.Second, there is no solid reason to anticipate a major correction coming, apart from the CME gap and the high futures market funding rate.But if Bitcoin consolidates after each rally, as seen in the past two days, then the funding rate would likely normalize. When that happens, the derivatives market would be less overheated, raising the probability of a new rally.A pseudonymous trader known as “Byzantine General” said that the market is currently giving conflicting signals. Both long and short contract holders are being aggressive, which makes both a long and short squeeze possible. He said:Typically, the price of Bitcoin on Coinbase is higher than Binance and other Tether-reliant exchanges. However, in the past week, Bitcoin has been trading slightly lower on Coinbase, by around $20 to $30.Although the gap is small, it shows that the U.S., which drove Bitcoin’s rally throughout December, might be seeing slowing buyer demand. But the Asian market and the derivatives market are seeing an increase in buyer demand.Considering that the demand for Bitcoin in the U.S. spot market appears to be cooling down, Bitcoin could consolidate for longer with lower volatility."
146,"Several central banks have resorted to unprecedented monetary expansion and aggressive rate cuts to support their respective economies badgered by the coronavirus pandemic. Record liquidity has resulted in sharp rallies in the S&P 500, gold, and Bitcoin (BTC), which suggests that investors are plowing money into assets of their choice.While gold is way below its all-time high set in August, both the S&P 500 and Bitcoin are near their all-time high.The last five trading days of the year and the first two of the next year have historically been bullish for the S&P 500, dubbed as the ""Santa Rally."" It will be interesting to see whether Bitcoin continues its Santa rally into 2021 with the arrival of institutional investors.Another interesting thing to note is that Bitcoin has rallied from a low at $10,377.10 in October to a high at $28,419.94 in December, a 173.87% rally in three months. Although the sentiment is bullish and the institutional inflows are accelerating, every bull market witnesses strong corrections and Bitcoin is unlikely to be an exception.Traders should protect their paper profits and not get carried away with greed because corrections after vertical rallies can be ruthless. Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the overhead levels that may act as a strong resistance that can trigger a correction.Bitcoin formed a Doji candlestick pattern on Dec. 27 with a long wick, which suggests profit booking above the $27,000 level. The bulls are again struggling to sustain the price above $27,000 today.If the bears sink the price below $25,819.69, the BTC/USD pair could drop to the immediate support at $24,302.50 and then to the 20-day exponential moving average at $22,951.A strong bounce off this support will suggest that the uptrend remains intact and the bulls are buying on dips. If that happens, the bulls will attempt to resume the uptrend.However, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the formation of a short-term top. The correction could then deepen to the 50-day simple moving average at $19,577.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls push and sustain the price above $28,419.94, the pair could rally to $30,000, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance.Ether (ETH) rebounded off the 50-day SMA ($566) on Dec. 23, which suggests that the bulls are accumulating on dips. The buyers again pushed the price back above $622.807 on Dec. 25, indicating that the correction could be over.The ETH/USD pair picked up momentum on Dec. 27 and cleared the $676.325 overhead resistance. This suggests that the uptrend has resumed. The next target objective on the upside is $800.The upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) close to the overbought territory suggest that bulls are in command. This positive view will invalidate if the pair turns down and plummets below the $622.807 support.XRP is in a downtrend. The altcoin broke below the critical support at $0.435 on Dec. 23 and this intensified the selling, resulting in a sharp fall to $0.2132.The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.426) and the RSI in the negative territory suggest that bears have the upper hand.When the sentiment is bearish, minor rallies are sold into and that is what happened on Dec. 25. The XRP/USD pair turned down from $0.384998, just above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the most recent leg of the decline.However, the bulls are currently trying to keep the pair above the $0.25 support. If they succeed, the pair may remain range-bound between $0.25 and $0.38 for a few more days. The first sign of strength will be a break above the 20-day EMA.Litecoin (LTC) broke above a flag pattern and the overhead resistance at $124.1278 on Dec. 25, which indicated the resumption of the uptrend. The breakout of this setup has a target objective of $160.However, the bears are not willing to throw in the towel as they are currently attempting to stall the up-move at the $140 overhead resistance. If they can sink and sustain the price below 124.1278, a drop to the 20-day EMA ($107) may be on the cards.On the other hand, if the bulls can defend the $124.1278 level, it will suggest that this level has flipped to support. That could enhance the prospects of a break above the $140 to $145 overhead resistance zone.The rising moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside.The bulls are currently trying to propel Bitcoin Cash (BCH) above the $370 overhead resistance. If they succeed, it will be a huge positive because during the previous two attempts, the price had quickly reversed direction from this level.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 64 suggest that bulls are in command. If they can drive the price above $$370 and sustain the breakout, the BCH/USD pair could rise to $409 and then to $430.On the contrary, if the bears again defend the $370 resistance and the price turns down sharply, it could keep the pair range-bound between $370 and $255 for a few more days.Polkadot (DOT) had been trading in a range between $3.53 and $5.60 for the past few weeks. The bulls have pushed the price above the $5.60 to $6.0857 overhead resistance zone today.If the bulls can sustain the price above $6.0857, it will suggest the start of a new uptrend that could retest $6.8619 and then rally to $7.67. The gradually upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 68 suggest bulls have the upper hand.The bears are likely to defend the $6.8619 level aggressively but if the bulls do not allow the price to dip below $6, it will suggest that the uptrend remains intact. This bullish view will be invalidated if the DOT/USD pair re-enters $5.60.Cardano (ADA) rebounded off the $0.13 support on Dec. 24 and the bulls have been sustaining the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.154) since then. This is a positive sign as it prepares a launchpad to thrust the price above the $0.175 to $0.1826315 overhead resistance zone.The RSI has risen into positive territory and the 20-day EMA has started to turn up gradually. This suggests that bulls are attempting to gain the upper hand.If the bulls can push the price above the overhead resistance zone, the ADA/USD pair could resume the uptrend and rally to $0.22 and then to $0.235.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair again turns down from $0.175, it could extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.The bulls are currently attempting to propel Binance Coin (BNB) above the $35.69 overhead resistance. If they succeed, the altcoin could resume the uptrend and rally to the all-time high at $39.5941.The bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance at the all-time high but the upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls have the upper hand.If the bulls can push the price above $39.5941, the BNB/USD pair could pick up momentum and start its journey towards $50.This bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels and plummets below the 50-day SMA ($30). Such a move will suggest profit-booking at higher levels.Chainlink (LINK) plummeted to $8.05 on Dec. 23 but rebounded strongly from the lower levels as seen from the long tail on the day’s candlestick. The bulls again bought the dips on Dec. 24, indicating strong demand at lower levels.The failure of the bears to sustain the LINK/USD pair below $11.29 attracted buying from the bulls who pushed the price to $13.2448 on Dec. 27. However, the bears are in no mood to relent as they sold close to $13.28 as seen from the long wick on the candlestick.Both moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is just below the midpoint, which suggests a balance between supply and demand.The bulls may gain an upper hand if they push and sustain the price above the downtrend line. Conversely, a break below $10 will suggest advantage to the bears.The bulls are currently attempting to sustain Stellar Lumens (XLM) above the $0.14 support. However, any rise from the current levels could face selling at the downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.159) and then at $0.17.If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, it increases the likelihood of a break below $0.14. The next support on the downside is at $0.11 and then $0.08.Conversely, if the bulls can push the price above $0.17, the XLM/USD pair may move up to the downtrend line. The sentiment is likely to remain negative as long as the price remains inside the descending triangle pattern.A break above the downtrend line of the triangle will invalidate the bearish setup and that could result in a rally to $0.231655.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

147,"Crypto exchange giant Binance is set to expand its cryptocurrency trading catalog with the launch of a European-style Bitcoin (BTC) options contract.Announced on Dec. 28, the launch follows a successful testnet trial carried out back in November. The press statement also revealed that the new options contract will be priced and settled in Tether (USDT).As part of the announcement, Binance identified the growing appetite for BTC options as the reason for debuting the new product. Earlier in December, Bitcoin options crossed $1 billion for the first time with total open interest almost reaching the $6 billion mark.Commenting on the launch, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao remarked that Bitcoin recently reaching $28,000 underscored the increasing level of investment in the crypto space, adding:Back in April, Binance joined the expanding cast of exchanges rolling out Bitcoin options trading with the launch of American-style BTC options contracts. The major difference between the American and European formats is that traders can only exercise the latter at the expiration of the contract. Binance's previous iteration of Bitcoin options was also criticized for being one-sided as users were unable to ""write"" options and pocket the premium. As a consequence, Binance options were generally more expensive due to the inability to conduct arbitrage.The European BTC options announcement is the latest from Binance in a busy December. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the exchange recently began offering Segregated Witness, or SegWit, support for Bitcoin deposits."
148,"Bitcoin (BTC) has had a week like no other, hitting fresh record highs of $28,400 and staying near the top — what's next.As markets return to digest a wild Christmas, Cointelegraph presents five factors set to help with Bitcoin price direction this week.Markets have been spared a nightmare this week after U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to sign off on Congress’ $900 billion coronavirus stimulus bill.Set to add a large amount of debt to the Federal Reserve’s existing mountain, the package includes various benefits for businesses but stops short of providing Americans with the same level of direct financial support seen in March.Trump had said that the low direct payment amount of the second stimulus — $600 against $1,200 last time — meant that he could not condone it, but subsequently changed his mind.Markets have thus begun a new week on a positive note, with slight gains seen on S&P 500 futures prior to the Wall St. open.At the same time, gold has returned in style, with data showing that the precious metal is now on track for its biggest one-year gain in a decade.Versus the end of November, XAU/USD is up $111 or 6.25%.“As President @realDonaldTrump vetoed just nine bills, the fewest number since Warren Harding, who served just two years, from 1921-1923,” gold bug and infamous Bitcoin naysayer Peter Schiff tweeted as the bill was signed.After striking a fresh tone with a wider audience over Christmas with runs to new all-time highs, Bitcoin may soon have to face the music with the establishment, sources warn.Hitting $28,400 and capping monthly gains of 55%, Bitcoin is now firmly on regulators’ radar as its mainstream appeal heightens. Even for its proponents, the next year may prove to be a challenging time.With outgoing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin leaving his mark with an attempt to force new laws over noncustodial wallets, his replacement, Janet Yellen, may hardly be an improvement, they say.“Generally, I think we have had challenges with the Dems — they prefer more regulation, more oversight,” Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at digital-asset manager CoinShares, told Bloomberg on Sunday.As always in the U.S., the patchwork of political allegiances means that any assault may be tempered by the presence of crypto-friendly figures elsewhere. The new chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Elad Roisman, is considered to be a fan.Concentrating on the latest Bitcoin spot market action, Monday is shaping up to be a major test for bulls given the momentum seen over the weekend.After hitting all-time highs of $28,400 on Sunday, Bitcoin saw a pullback which many had already expected.“#Bitcoin undergoing a very healthy correction as it went quite vertical. Might be the temporary top for now,” Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe summarized on social media.Van de Poppe is eyeing the potential for altcoins to begin their response to Bitcoin’s recent glories, arguing that signs are already beginning to appear that “altseason” is around the corner.“After #Bitcoin finishes the run (and it is quite vertical), the money will flow towards large caps. And after that towards mid-caps and small caps,” he continued.While floundering against BTC, some popular altcoins are still delivering significant returns in USD terms, with market leader Ether (ETH) trading above $700 for the first time since May 2018. Versus its lows of $113 in March, ETH/USD is now up 530%.Bitcoin is contending with the largest “gap” to ever appear on futures markets this week.Data from CME Group’s futures shows that on Friday, trading ended at around $23,825. Monday began with a wick to lows of $26,500 from opening levels, with the difference ranking as the biggest ever seen in a weekend.These so-called futures “gaps” refer to the void between Friday and Monday trading sessions, and the BTC/USD spot price has a habit of returning to “fill” them later on.In recent weeks, however, this trend has weakened, with gaps remaining between $16,900 and $19,500 which have only been partially filled.This has in turn given rise to theories among analysts — including Cointelegraph’s Van de Poppe — that Bitcoin could still reverse downwards to revisit sub-$20,000 levels just long enough to take care of its unfinished business.Should that not in fact occur, analysts may instead need to come to terms with the loss of what was once a solid indicator of near-term Bitcoin price trajectory.On the topic of price trajectory, the latest action puts Bitcoin at odds with one of its best-known and most reliable price models — stock-to-flow.After rising to hit exactly what the model’s demands last week, the weekend ensured that BTC/USD outperformed, with Sunday’s retracement to the mid $26,000 range ensuring compliance swiftly returned.As noted by both its creator PlanB and Saifedean Ammous, author of “The Bitcoin Standard,” Bitcoin is overall staying highly faithful to what stock-to-flow requires on an almost daily basis.“Bitcoin's price continues to track the predicted value from @100trillionUSD 's stock-to-flow model with astonishing precision,” Ammous summarized.Going forward, the model’s various incarnations demand price levels of anywhere between $100,000 and $576,000 between now and the end of the current halving cycle in 2024."
149,"During a Christmas rally that has pushed the Bitcoin all time high mark ever higher, a pair of recent tweets indicate that a former critic of the digital currency is continuing to take steps towards a full-blown hodler conversion: billionaire investor and owner of the Dallas Mavericks Mark Cuban. The Tweet came on December 23rd, when Cuban announced that fans buying Mavericks gear would receive a 25% discount when they used Bitcoin to make their purchase. Oddly enough, however, the report Cuban linked to instead said that purchasers who buy more than $150 worth of gear using Bitcoin would receive a $25 gift card, and did not mention a 25% discount:Want to spend your $BTC somewhere... Spend it with the Mavs and get a 25 percent discount for using Bitcoin !https://t.co/De7Y5f28s8This gift card offer, as well as a wider Mavericks policy of accepting Bitcoin as payment for tickets, strikes some observers as odd given Cuban’s history of denigrating the asset. Earlier in 2020 he dusted off a zinger he first fired off in September of 2019: that he prefers bananas to Bitcoin as a commodity. Many have described coming around to Bitcoin’s virtues as a store-of-value as a process and not an event, however, and Cuban seems to be taking the requisite steps.In a Tweet just today, Cuban seemed to praise Bitcoin’s programmatic monetary policy, saying that publicly traded companies would be wise to restrict their share inflation:Public companies should learn a lesson from BItcoin and commit to not issue new shares of stock. Ever. Their stock prices would immediately jump.It’s a positive comment that’s part of an ongoing, years long about-face that has landed Cuban on Cointelegraph’s list of Bitcoin critics who have withered in 2020. Still, hodlers should be cautious about fully welcoming another member into their ranks. As he progresses in his journey towards hard money, Cuban has expressed disdain for what he believes to be “religious” zealotry among holders hoping for a doomsday scenario, and in yet another tweet this week, it’s a theme he seemed to riff on, pretending to be one of the faithful:Blasphemous I say, just Blasphemous ! https://t.co/Jk47KqY2x6"
150,"Bitcoin (BTC) whale clusters show that the $23,409 level has become an area of focus for large traders. This indicates that the ongoing bull run is buoyed by whales continuing to accumulate above $23,000.Whale clusters form when whales purchase Bitcoin and do not move their BTC holdings from the price of purchase. Clusters are useful in determining Bitcoin’s support levels, especially when the market moves rapidly.According to analysts at Whalemap, a data analytics firm that tracks Bitcoin whale activity, BTC has formed a strong floor in the $23,000 to $23,500 range. They said:It is important for Bitcoin to establish solid support areas during a bull run due to the risk of sudden corrections. If whale clusters are present at high price levels, like $23,409, then whales are likely to bid slightly higher and sustain Bitcoin’s momentum.Peter Brandt, a long-time trader, pinpointed the parabolic line of Bitcoin dating back to October as a key area to watch.The line indicates $24,000 as the critical support area, which would mean BTC needs to stay above it to prevent a large drop. Brandt wrote:In the near term, the whale clusters and the parabolic trendline show that $23,409 and $24,000 are the two key levels Bitcoin must hold.Below $24,000, the chances of an accelerated correction increase, which could worsen if whale cluster support areas are breached.Traders generally believe Bitcoin could rise to two levels: $30,000 and $36,000. The latter has become a popular near-term prediction because the options market indicates a high probability of $36,000 being hit in the upcoming months. Of course, the former is a key psychological level. A pseudonymous trader known as “Byzantine General” said that he foresees Bitcoin topping out at $30,000. He explained that $30,000 is the “golden ratio extension” level and also has sell orders on Coinbase and Bitfinex. He said:On Dec. 27, Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin immediately saw big volatility, ultimately shedding 6.5% within a span of a few hours after the price topped out at $28,200 across major exchanges. Given that resistance areas with heavy sell order scan be met with large pullbacks, the $30,000 area could present a major short-term roadblock to Bitcoin."
151,"The supply and demand equation determines the price of an asset. In the past few months, the uptick in institutional demand for Bitcoin (BTC) has resulted in a strong bull run. This uptrend may continue until demand exceeds supply.On-chain data shows two withdrawals of more than 12,000 Bitcoin each from Coinbase Pro this week, which is just short of the 28,000 Bitcoin mined in November. This suggests that demand from institutional investors remains intact even after Bitcoin’s recent rally because they are bullish in the long term.Meanwhile, Mexico’s second richest man, Ricardo Salinas Pliego, said in an interview with Cointelegraph that Bitcoin has been his “best investment ever.” Salinas has about 10% of his liquid portfolio in Bitcoin and he is in no hurry to sell as he wants to “sit around for another five or ten years.""The strong demand and HODLing by institutional investors has propelled Bitcoin’s market capitalization to above $500 billion for the first time. It has also boosted Bitcoin’s market dominance to above 70.5%, which suggests that the inflow of money has largely been into Bitcoin.However, at some point, fresh money will stop flowing into Bitcoin and that could result in a correction or consolidation. Traders may then divert their attention to select altcoins, which could pick up momentum.Let’s look at the charts of top-five cryptocurrencies that could rally in the next few days.Bitcoin price broke above the $24,302.50 overhead resistance on Dec. 25 and resumed the uptrend. This breakout has a target objective of $28,664.04 and the price hit an intraday high at $28,419.94 today.The BTC/USD pair’s incessant rise has sucked in traders who had been waiting on the sidelines for a dip to enter. Institutional investors, momentum traders, and speculators have also joined the party that has kept the uptrend intact.However, the current pace of rise is not sustainable. The long wick on today’s candlestick suggests profit booking at higher levels. Even if the uptrend continues, the pair may again face selling near the $30,000 mark.If the uptrend stalls, the short-term traders may rush to the exit and that could pull the price back to the 20-day exponential moving average ($22,613). If this support holds, the pair could again attempt to resume the uptrend.On the other hand, a break below the 20-day EMA could drag the price to the critical support at $20,000. Therefore, traders may avoid chasing prices higher.The 4-hour chart shows the formation of a Doji candlestick pattern, which suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. Although the uncertainty resolved to the downside, the long tail on the candlestick shows buying at lower levels. This suggests traders are purchasing on every minor dip.However, if the bulls fail to propel the price above $28,419.94, the selling may continue and that could pull the price down to the 20-EMA at $25,446. The overbought levels on the relative strength index also point to a possible correction.A break below the 20-EMA and the support at $24,302.50 will suggest that the momentum has weakened.In a strong uptrend, traders usually buy the dips to the 20-day EMA ($105) and that is what happened on Dec. 23. Litecoin (LTC) rebounded sharply on Dec. 24 and the momentum picked up after the bulls pushed the price above the $118.64 to $124.12 overhead resistance zone.The immediate target is $145 but if the bulls do not allow the price to drop and sustain below $124.1278, the rally may extend to $180. The rising moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest bulls are in control.This bullish view will be invalidated if the LTC/USD pair turns around from the current levels or the overhead resistance and drops below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that traders are not buying the dips.The 4-hour chart is also in an uptrend with both moving averages sloping up and the RSI in positive territory. However, the momentum has weakened as bulls are facing resistance near $136.If the bulls do not allow the price to sustain below the 20-EMA, the pair could be on target to reach $145. But if the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below $118.6497 and the 50-simple moving average, it will suggest the start of a deeper correction.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been repeatedly attempting to break above the $353 overhead resistance for the past few days. Although the bulls had pushed the price above $353 on two occasions, marked via ellipse on the chart, they could not sustain the higher levels.This suggests traders are aggressively selling on any rise above $353. However, the positive thing is that the bulls have accumulated on declines below $280 and are currently attempting to push the price above $353.If they succeed, the BCH/USD pair could start its journey toward $500. It may not be a straight dash to the target objective because the bears will again try to stall the rally at $409 and $430. But if both these levels are scaled, the pair could pick up momentum.The upsloping moving averages and RSI above 61 suggest bulls have the upper hand.The 4-hour chart shows the pair is currently trading inside a large range between $255 and $370. The bulls are currently attempting to drive the price above the $353 to $370 overhead resistance.If they succeed, the pair could start an uptrend that has a target objective of $485. The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the positive territory, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand.However, if the price again turns down from the current level or $370, the pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.The long wick on Dec. 23 candlestick shows traders booked profits after Monero (XMR) hit $167, the target objective of the breakout from the inverse head and shoulders pattern.However, the positive thing was that the bulls purchased the dip to the 20-day EMA ($151) on Dec. 24. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that the sentiment remains positive.The long tail on today’s candlestick shows that bulls are buying on dips. If they can push and sustain the price above $170, the XMR/USD pair could rally to the next target objective at $197, just below the psychological resistance at $200.This positive view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could signal a deeper correction to $135.50.The 4-hour chart shows that the pair has been trading inside an ascending channel but the bulls have failed to push and sustain the price into the top half of the channel. The pair has usually turned down from the midpoint of the channel.This suggests short-term traders are taking profits at intermittent levels. However, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the midpoint of the channel, the pair could rally to the resistance line of the channel, indicating a pick-up in momentum.On the other hand, a break below the support line of the channel could signal a possible change in the short-term trend.THETA has rallied vertically in the past few days, which pushed the RSI deep into the overbought territory. This has started a correction as seen from the sharp fall today.However, if the price does not dip and sustain below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.31994, it will suggest that traders continue to buy on dips as they anticipate the rally to extend further.If the bulls can push the price above $1.742, the THETA/USD pair could rally to the $2 psychological level and then to $2.40.Contrary to this bullish assumption, if the bears sink the price below the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $1.18957, it will suggest that the momentum has weakened.The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls are currently attempting to defend the 20-EMA. If the pair rebounds off this level, the bulls will attempt to resume the uptrend. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls are in control.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair breaks below the 20-EMA, it will suggest that the short-term momentum has weakened. That could pull the price down to the next support at the 50-SMA.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

152,"The Cointelegraph YouTube channel had some of its wilder moments in 2020: from getting hit with the YouTube ban hammer to witnessing firsthand the antics of crypto’s most eccentric personalities. Here are some of our favorite blooper moments from this year — we hope you enjoy them more than we did!2020 has been a year of firsts for many: the first year of the new decade, an unprecedented global pandemic, and Cointelegraph’s first ever YouTube strike. And, honestly, we’re still quite puzzled by it. The strike came in the final minutes of a seven hour virtual livestream event hosted by Cointelegraph on May 11th to celebrate Bitcoin’s third halving. The stream featured industry experts, high-profile investors, and well-known personalities from all corners of the crypto sphere. Some notable moments:Everything was proceeding as smoothly as could be expected until the final panel of the day: the Crypto Influencers. This panel featured a number of prominent crypto personalities including Altcoin Daily, Bad Crypto Podcast, Altcoin Buzz, Naomi Brockwell, Bitboy Crypto, Layah Heilpurn, and notably Chico Crypto.After going live, the panel immediately descended into chaos. Midway through the host’s introduction, Crypto Chico began yelling at the other guests, calling them shills and dropping multiple f-bombs. After finishing his tirade, he disappeared from the panel and was never heard from again — at least not on any of our channels.The panel resumed as best it could, but 20 minutes later YouTube suddenly and permanently removed the livestream and the Cointelegraph YouTube channel its first ever strike. According to the warning, the livestream was removed for violation of YouTube’s community guidelines. The specific violation was for producing ‘harmful or dangerous content’. Cointelegraph’s appeal to the strike was rejected and no further clarification was received as to the exact reason behind the strike. Due to the antics of Crypto Chico and their proximity to the issuance of the strike, it is possible his behavior may have played a significant role in YouTube’s decision. But it is impossible to know for certain.Watch the livestream highlights here:No year is complete without a substantial dose of cringe worthy content...and unfortunately Cointelegraph is no exception.The Cointelegraph YouTube channel had a strong start in this department with the publication of a video interview with Satoshi Nakamoto claimant Craig Wright. The video garnered over a thousand comments, with many remarking on the awkward interaction between the host (me) and Craig Wright. One of the most liked comments on the video came from a small-time YouTuber named River:This interview was awkward. There is no contenting that. As the host, I felt it quite strongly during the recording. However, the reason for the awkwardness was not what most people seemed to think. I don’t despise Craig Wright or feel any animosity towards him despite his bold claims.In fact, the interview was actually conducted using a well-known technique called mirroring. In an effort to pry more information and details out of him, I often paused after his answers or repeated back to him his most recent talking point. The result was an interview that appeared to be cringey and possibly even hostile, but was quite effective at revealing Wright’s personality traits and exposing several of his bolder claims.Watch the full interview here.John McAfee is infamous around the world for his eccentric hobbies and larger than life personality. In the crypto sphere, the American computer scientist is best known for his multiple presidential candidacies, outrageous price predictions, and a bet (now nicknamed ‘The D*ckening’) to eat his own genitalia on live television if Bitcoin fails to reach $500K by the end of 2020. He has even managed to remain active on Twitter despite currently residing in a Spanish jail, where he faces extradition to the US over tax evasion charges. Cointelegraph is therefore no stranger to covering McAfee’s wild side. That’s why no one on the video team was surprised when McAfee (upon request) brandished his AK-47 during a virtual video interview with Cointelegraph’s former head of news, Dylan Love. In the same interview, he claimed he is ‘99% certain’ of Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity and also described how he traumatized a visiting journalist by faking a game of Russian roulette. McAfee may be getting older, but his stories never do.Watch the full interview here.To round off the year, the Cointelegraph video team would like to extend a huge thank you to you, the viewers, for supporting the channel and watching our content. In 2020, the Cointelegraph YouTube channel… From all of us on the Cointelegraph video team, we can’t wait to see what next year brings and we hope you will stick around to join us.

153,"Bitcoin (BTC) hit all-time highs of $28,400 before crashing thousands of dollars on Dec. 27 — the latest chapter in its Christmas trading frenzy.Data from Cointelegraph Markets, Coin360 and TradingView showed BTC/USD gain and then lose huge amounts in USD terms during trading on Sunday.After topping 15% 24-hour gains, Bitcoin encountered heavy selling pressure above $28,000. Unable to sustain its extremely rapid upwards trajectory, the largest cryptocurrency then fell to lows of $26,500.At press time, volatility ensured that no firm market direction was in control as BTC/USD fluctuated around $27,000.As Cointelegraph reported earlier in the day, Bitcoin set a number of records with its latest moves, including passing a $500 billion market cap for the first time.In addition, Monday should see the largest gap in Bitcoin futures markets ever created.This is gonna be the biggest CME gap in history pic.twitter.com/IWBsyQsXabSince overcoming $24,000 resistance, Bitcoin has traded in uncharted territory with only impromptu sell levels creating fiction in what looks to be an increasingly parabolic market.With institutional investors taking a break, talk turned to retail buyers fuelling the latest phase of the Bitcoin bull run.“The bull cycle of bull cycles has started, as more and more players are starting to adopt towards Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies,” Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe summarized to Twitter followers.Van de Poppe continued to eye $19,500 as a possible retracement zone, with altcoins in line to benefit from Bitcoin’s example once its own gains slow — potentially next month.Binance order book data meanwhile shows that a formidable sell wall at $30,000 will likely be the next major hurdle for the BTC bulls. "
154,"Bitcoin (BTC) continues its blistering holiday weekend rally, surpassing $27,000 on Dec. 27. What's more, the market capitalization of Bitcoin has surpassed half a trillion dollars for the first time ever. The new record-highs for Bitcoin come less than three days after breaking resistance at $24,000. This also means that BTC price has now doubled over the past two months after gaining nearly $10,000 in the month of December alone. Bitcoin's market capitalization is also now over $510 billion, which puts it just under Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, the tenth-largest company in the world. This comes less than a day after surpassing Visa's market cap.As Cointelegraph reported, this weekend's surge has put the price of Bitcoin above the mean trend line of the popular stock-to-flow model (around $24,900), which forecasts a $100,000 target by December 2021. At the same time, the current bull cycle appears to be different and more sustainable than in 2017 with many traders expecting more upside over the coming months. The reasons for this include a frenzy of institutional buying, stronger fundamentals, less available supply on exchanges, and still relatively little interest from retail buyers.However, this doesn't rule out the possibility of major pullbacks in the near term, particularly as BTC price appears to be steaming toward the next psychological resistance at $30,000. ""Vertical moves often end in a swift correction (remember Summer '19)? Those swift corrections are made for the establishment of a sideways range,"" warned Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michael van de Poppe on Dec. 27. He added: "
155,"After a historic day in which the headlines could hardly keep up with price action and Bitcoin set a new all-time high above $26,500, traders and analysts are now turning their attention towards what could be in store for the digital currency over the next five days as 2020 comes to a close.While a 8-9% daily gain might be pittance compared to Bitcoin’s historical volatility — there was a 42% rally as recently as 2019 — as Messari founder Ryan Selkis pointed out, today’s rally featured only the second $2,300 candle in the digital currency’s history:Bitcoin’s first $2300 candle took 8.5 years.

It’s done that again today. pic.twitter.com/FfiCrG9OhXPerhaps caught in the euphoria, some traders are already looking towards when daily candles eclipse five figures:When will #Bitcoin have its first $10k daily candle?Positive headwinds are swirling for Bitcoin’s next step. “Bitcoin” is currently trending on Twitter with 164,000 recent tweets — comfortably outstripping the next highest trending item, the archeological discovery of a street food stall in the ruins of Pompeii. Additionally, as Cointelegraph has previously reported, this recent rally has put Bitcoin back on the path plotted by the popular Stock to Flow (S2F) model, which forecasts a price of nearly $300,000 before 2024.Another popular folk metric indicated that Bitcoin mania still has a long ways to climb towards 2017 peaks as well. According to Google analytics, search history for “Bitcoin” is barely at a fifth of all time high levels:Google Trends data:

Searches for 'buy #Bitcoin' are around 1/5th of their all-time peak

Will searches eventually 10x the last peak? It has begun. pic.twitter.com/MUgRfPsvlDAll together, the positive sentiment and parabolic price action have a greater and greater number of traders clamoring for ‘30k by the 30th” — a $30,000 price on the 30th of December:Retweet for 30k #BTC by the 30thDespite the positive sentiment and price action that puts Cape Canaveral to shame, some traders are already lining up possible short positions. One trader is calling for a blow-off top in the next two weeks:Update - Weekend blow off in full motion.

I suspect the hammer will come within the next 2 weeks pic.twitter.com/3xAirpOJrzWhile it remains the minority sentiment, he’s not alone and thinking turbulence could be ahead for Bitcoin. $2.3 billion worth of Bitcoin futures expired on Christmas day, which historically has led to choppy markets. "
156,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has reached a new all-time high of $25,945 on Binance on Dec. 26 just a day after it achieved its previous record high on Christmas day.There are many broad reasons behind Bitcoin’s rally, such as the high institutional demand for BTC. But for the current intraday rally, excessive shorting on Binance Futures was likely the primary catalyst.Before the upsurge, many traders were shorting Bitcoin across most major futures exchanges. This eventually led to a short squeeze as short-sellers were selling so close to the previous all-time high. As soon as the record-high broke, BTC began to surge rapidly as Bitcoin price entered price discovery.According to data from Bybt.com, more than $131 million worth of Bitcoin futures contracts were liquidated in the last 24 hours. As long as the derivatives market continues to see an increase in sellers, the probability of more short squeezes in the near future remains high.What's more, the current rally means that BTC is now above the mean line of the popular stock-to-flow model, which forecasts a $100,000 target by December 2021. #bitcoin price $25.3K above S2F model value $24.9K
real time S2F charts: https://t.co/K2eCFhz43I pic.twitter.com/ErGHZVDeuWMeanwhile, traders and technical analysts generally remain overwhelmingly positive on Bitcoin’s price trend. Popular trader Philip Swift, for example, noted that the number of big sellers has actually subsided during the current rally. 1. $BTC price action looks strong here.  Few sellers on Coinbase in the short term shown here by the lack of asks (yellow lines) above price.

In terms of on-chain activity... pic.twitter.com/NyLfPiH8gi""Large players, >1000btc wallets, have calmed down for 1st time in this huge run-up,"" explained Swift. ""We can see the number of >1000btc wallets decrease rapidly over the past week or so. Whereas we can see the 1-10 BTC wallets (mass retail) have continued to steadily climb in recent weeks.""He added:Traders are also increasingly cautious about shorting Bitcoin because it is yet to achieve a clear top. Until BTC peaks, the chances of a large short squeeze that will fuel the price rally even further in the short term remain high.Moreover, Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michael van de Poppe said the next impulse wave could see Bitcoin exceed the $40,000 mark. He wrote:The next logical top for Bitcoin would likely be when the institutional buying of Bitcoin slows down.16/ Here are the financial institutions and trading legends that have recognized Bitcoin is Gold 2.0 over the last 4 months:

- Fidelity
- JP Morgan
- Bloomberg
- Deutsche Bank
- Citibank
- Jefferies

157,"Ricardo Salinas Pliego, chairman at conglomerate Grupo Salinas and Mexico’s second richest man, has revealed to Cointelegraph in an interview that he bought his first Bitcoin in 2013, when it was worth around $200. That, according to the billionaire, was his “best investment ever”. After holding it all the way until its 2017 highs, he sold all his positions at $17,000 and bought it again later at a cheaper price.“We always return to the scene of the crime”, he joked.Now Salinas holds around 10% of his liquid portfolio in BTC and doesn't plan to sell any of it any time soon. ""I want to sit around for another five or ten years"", he said. While initially attracted by Bitcoin as a means of exchange, Salinas is now convinced that Bitcoin’s potential resides in its store of value features. According to Salinas, Bitcoin’s properties are particularly attractive in Latin American economies where fiat currency is being debased and inflation is rampant. “What's happening in Venezuela, in Argentina where fiat money is collapsing has become a scandal (...) It really opens your eyes to the problem of fiat cash”, he said.Salinas also points out, Bitcoin is the natural result of the evolution of money, from physical to digital. “Bitcoin is bits and bytes in the ether, but the good thing is that it cannot be debased and it cannot be confiscated that easily”, pointed out Salinas.Check out the full interview on our youtube channel and don’t forget to subscribe!"
158,"The year 2020 was a forgettable one for many reasons including lockdowns and economic restrictions. The shutdowns resulted in the worst economic crisis seen in decades. At the same time, most governments and central banks have responded with unprecedented fiscal stimulus and monetary expansion measures to revive their economies.Therefore, institutional investors who are wary of potential inflation — and possibly even hyperinflation — as a result, are scrambling to hedge their portfolios with assets that can protect them from gradual currency depreciation. Until now, gold was considered the best store of wealth, and it has not disappointed investors as it is up about 24% year-to-date.However, this year has seen an influx of institutional investors into Bitcoin, whose gains have been increasingly difficult to ignore, particularly versus gold and the S&P500, as shown in the chart above. Some institutions have diversified their portfolios with Bitcoin while others even reduced their gold holdings to invest in Bitcoin.With Bitcoin’s massive 244% rally this year, portfolios of several investors who had purchased early will certainly outperform those without BTC exposure. This trend will force other investors to take note, increasing the possibility of Bitcoin’s rally to be more sustainable this time around, which may become a rising tide that may also lift other cryptocurrencies with it.Therefore, let’s analyze the long-term charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies and spot the critical levels that may pose stiff resistance. While such technical levels may not necessarily mark the top, they can be useful for traders to make informed decisions.Bitcoin (BTC) is in a clear uptrend and is now in price discovery after breaking the all-time high made in 2017. Since clearing the $20,000 resistance, the rally has been sharp and that has pushed the relative strength index (RSI) deep into overbought territory.History shows that deeply overbought levels on the relative strength index (RSI) have resulted in sharp corrections. Therefore, the bears may try to pull down the price from the $25,000 psychological resistance.The critical level to watch on the downside is $20,000. If the bulls succeed in flipping this to support during the next major correction, it will act as a new floor. That is likely to prepare the BTC/USD pair for the next leg of the uptrend.A strong bounce off $20,000 will open up the possibility of a rise to $30,000 and then to the next likely formidable resistance at $37,000.Contrary to the bullish assumption, if the bears sink and sustain the price below $20,000 during the next correction, the aggressive bulls who have purchased above $20,000 may be forced to close their positions.If that happens, the price may extend its decline to the 20-week exponential moving average ($15,958). The deeper the fall below $20,000, the longer it could take for the uptrend to resume.Nevertheless, the current bull market is showing no signs of letting up. Moreover, six-figure Bitcoin price predictions for 2021 are becoming quite common with some traders even anticipating ""conservative"" targets of $200,000 by next December. Ether (ETH) is in the process of forming a large rounding pattern that will complete on a breakout and close above $800. This reversal pattern has a long-term target of $1,500.The bulls are currently attempting to push and sustain the ETH/USD pair above the $625 resistance and resume the uptrend. However, the rally is likely to encounter stiff resistance in the $800 to $1,000 zone.If the price turns down from $800, the pair could enter a minor correction or consolidation for a few weeks. However, if the price remains above the 20-week EMA ($470), the possibility of a rise to $1,000 is high.The bears will again try to stall the rally at $1000, but if the price does not fall below $800, it will boost the prospects of a breakout beyond $1,000. If that happens, the pair should retest the all-time high.This bullish view will be invalidated if the price dips and sustains below the 20-week EMA.XRP has been one of the most underperforming major altcoins in the past few months. The price is currently stuck in a large range of $0.10 to $0.80. The bulls attempted to propel the price above $0.80 but failed. That resulted in aggressive selling and the price has completely retraced the November gains.The flat moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest that the bulls have lost their grip and the XRP/USD pair could stay inside the large range for a few more months.In a large range, the bulls buy the dips aggressively and sell near the resistance. To change this trend, the price will have to either break above or below the range.If the bulls can push the price above the $0.80 to $1 overhead resistance zone, the XRP/USD pair may signal the start of a possible uptrend, which could surprise with a run to $2.50.However, the bears will aggressively defend the overhead resistance zone, particularly as the negative news of the SEC lawsuit against Ripple is already resulting in big losses for XRP holders. Therefore, the XRP/USD pair could remain in the given range for most of 2021.Litecoin (LTC) completed a rounding bottom pattern after the bulls pushed the price above the $80 resistance. This reversal setup has a minimum target objective of $136, just below the stiff resistance at $145.6725.The rising 20-week EMA ($73.18) and the RSI in the overbought territory suggest that bulls have the upper hand. An overbought level on the RSI is a sign of euphoria in a mature uptrend but is a positive sign when a new up-move is starting.The up-move can now reach $145.6725 where the bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance. If the bulls give up a lot of ground, the LTC/USD pair may consolidate just below this level for a few months. A break below $80 will signal advantage to the bears.However, if the bulls drive the price above $145.6725, it will clear the path for a rally to $180 and then to $220.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently stuck inside a large range of $160 on the downside and $515 on the upside. The price had been trading in the lower half of this range for the past many months but the bulls are currently attempting to push the altcoin into the upper half of the range.If the bulls can sustain the price above $320, the BCH/USD pair could gradually move up to $400 and then to the stiff overhead resistance at $515.The pair had turned down from $515 on two previous occasions, hence, the bears will again try to defend this level. If they succeed, the pair may reverse direction from close to $515 and extend its stay inside the range.This range-bound action will be invalidated if the bulls propel the price above $515. If that happens, the pair could start a new uptrend that may reach $870.Chainlink (LINK) rallied from $1.36 in March to a high at $20.1111 in August. After that, the altcoin pulled back sharply before finding support close to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $8.5229.The subsequent rebound could not sustain above $16.39, which may have attracted selling by traders who had purchased at lower levels. The selling intensified after the bears broke the 20-week EMA ($11.63) support.However, the long wick on the candlestick shows that the bulls again aggressively bought the dip below the $8.5229 support. The flattish 20-week EMA and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a few weeks of range-bound action.If the bulls can push the price above $16, the pair may retest the $20.1111 resistance. A break above this level may start a new uptrend that could reach $26.038. On the contrary, if the bears sink and sustain the price below the $8.5229 support, the LINK/USD pair could start a new downtrend.Cardano (ADA) has completed a bottoming formation and started a new uptrend. The bulls flipped the previous stiff resistance at $0.10 to support (marked by the ellipse on the chart), which indicates a trend chage. The break above $0.1543051 also started a higher-highs and higher-lows formation.The up-move is likely to face a strong hurdle in the $0.20 to $0.2360 overhead resistance zone. If the price turns down from this zone, but the bulls again manage to form a new high above $0.15, that will keep the uptrend intact.If the bulls can push the price above the resistance zone, the momentum is likely to pick up as there is no major resistance until the price reaches $0.40. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that bulls are in command.This positive view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the overhead resistance zone and breaks the higher-highs and higher-lows formation.Binance Coin (BNB) has been consolidating in a $25.1247 to $33.3888 range for the past few weeks. The bulls pushed the price above the range last week but could not sustain the higher levels. This suggests that bears are aggressively selling at higher levels.However, the upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 64 suggest that the bulls are in command. If the buyers can propel the price above $36, the BNB/USD pair could retest the all-time high at $39.5941. This level may act as stiff resistance but if the bulls do not give up much ground, the possibility of a break above $39.5941 increases. If that happens, the pair could rally to the next target objective at $52.1335. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down sharply from the all-time high, the pair may remain range-bound for a few months.After the initial run-up in August, Polkadot (DOT) has been consolidating in a large range between $3.50 and $6 for the past few weeks. The longer the time spent in consolidation, the stronger the breakout will be.For the past five weeks, the price has been trading in the upper half of the range. This suggests that the bulls are not waiting for a drop to $3.50 to buy. If bulls can propel the price above $6, a retest of the high at $6.8619 is possible. This level may again act as stiff resistance but if the bulls can push the price above it, the DOT/USD pair could start an uptrend.This positive view may be invalidated if the pair sharply reverses direction from the $6 to $6.8619 resistance zone. If that happens, the pair may continue its range-bound action for a few more months.Stellar Lumens (XLM) broke out of a long rounding bottom pattern on Nov. 24 with huge volumes but the bulls could not build upon this move and start a new uptrend. The price had been stuck in a range for the past three weeks, which suggests a lack of buyers at higher levels.The failure to start a new rally could have attracted selling by the aggressive bears who are currently attempting to sustain the price below $0.16.If they succeed, the XLM/USD pair could drop to the 20-week EMA ($0.118). A break below this support could signal that the breakout of the rounding bottom was a bull trap and the pair may spend some more time in the bottoming formation.Conversely, if the bulls again buy the dip to the 20-week EMA and drive the price back above $0.16, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels.The pair could pick up momentum after the bulls push the price above $0.231655. The first target on the upside is $0.30 and then $0.35. This zone may act as a stiff resistance but if the bulls can propel the price above it, the pair may rise to $0.50.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

His semi-weekly Uniswap gemhunting streams are a highlight for high-risk plays, but his greatest contribution might be a simple three-word phrase: APE TOGETHER STRONG“Ape together strong” — crypto’s own version of “send it.” Like the “pump it, Loomdart” of yore, it’s become the mantra of a new bullmarket, the battlecry of countless degens as they stand expectantly on obvious rugs. Still, even geniuses can’t get it right all the time:From Bankless podcast host David Hoffman, a play in two acts. Act one:Act two:Personal tokens are bad, and they should die with 2020. At the start of 2020, they were nibbling — and now it seems like just about everyone wants to take a big bite. While MicroStrategy and Grayscale seemed locked in a race to see who could steal the most headlines with absurd Bitcoin buys, other institutions such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs also started to dip their toes in the cryptocurrency waters. According to statistical research, it’s a trend that’s only going to accelerate into 2021 as big-name banks and funds look to secure their crypto positions on any dip.Indeed, it’s a trend that’s beginning to make one commentator’s tweet look downright prophetic: Elon Musk has been putting on a trolling clinic all year. Where 2019 was a bit of a flop — he pulled off a self-own coup by posting his way into a lawsuit from the SEC — in 2020, he’s managed to keep his nose clean and has had fun spending his energies bullying Bitcoin believers. One example was being a prototypical Reply Guy for Maisie Williams, the young actress who rose to fame playing Arya Stark on Game of Thrones. Williams threw out an innocent enough question into the digital ether:This prompted a gentle ribbing from Musk, pretending not to be such a nerd that he can name Arya’s lineage going back three generations: Williams got the last laugh in the end, however, turning the concept behind Musk’s quip back on him:As Musk’s behavior demonstrates, everyone on Twitter — including powerful CEOs — seem to occasionally conduct themselves with a flagrant disregard for their own career. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong is no different. After announcing a “no politics that I don’t like” mandate, in a now-deleted tweet, Armstrong — during normal working hours, no less — reposted a crackpot blog from another CEO filled with falsehoods, including the head-scratching claim that one of Joe Biden’s sons took his own life in order to escape political spotlight.Despite colossal mismanagement that has prompted an exodus of employees and public scrutiny, Armstrong will likely fall upward toward a huge paycheck if/when Coinbase goes public. And the man can’t even run a stable exchange!Personally, I aim to bring Armstrong’s energy into 2021: Do a godawful job at everything and get a raise anyway. What an absolute icon.One of the quirks that defines the wider Ethereum mythos is that the father of Ether, co-founder Vitalik Buterin, is an active and apparently highly spiritual tweeter, bringing folk wisdom about weightlifting and new-age philosophy to the trendline on the regular.   One of his more charming pieces is a wholly uplifting body of work that came when one trader sent some barbs his way. Trying to insult Buterin is an exercise in futility, as the man’s a walking koan:The man affectionately known as “Dima” might help guide all of us to nirvana in the new year:Decentralized finance is a dangerous beast that can often resemble a series of Ponzi schemes stacked on top of one another. An emerging vertical with grand ambitions, at its best DeFi looks like it might genuinely be the future of finance, and at its worst, it’s replicating the hollowed-out foundations of the cynical, boom-bust financial infrastructure it seeks to replace. Lawmakers trying to propose regulations to guide DeFi to stability, however, seem intent on throwing out a whole orphanage with the bathwater, as Uniswap founder Hayden Adams pointed out:Here’s to regulation that doesn’t “accidentally” ban running nodes in the new year. Some people lost money on a few of Andre’s projects because they aped into contracts before they were even announced. Some people lost money because they aped more than they should have. Some people lost money because they treated Andre as a Messianic figure, believing he could do no wrong. In all cases, Andre owes you nothing.Much of 2020 consisted of the same 40 traders dumping on each other, rug pulling one another, and everyone trying to find an easy win in a landscape populated with cynical, smart and vicious competitors. However, as a new bull run dawns and retail traders begin to pile in, the days of PvP (player versus player) are over:To success, money and better decisions in the new year."
160,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed $25,000 on Dec. 25, reaching a new all-time high of $25,020 on Bitstamp and surpassing the market cap of Visa in a historic milestone.Visa, the financial services giant, is valued at $460.06 billion according to Yahoo Finance. As of Dec. 26, Bitcoin is comfortably hovering above $462 billion.Bitcoin is essentially a peer-to-peer software protocol while Visa is a for-profit corporation. Some may argue that a direct comparison between the two is not apt as they are fundamentally different.But Bitcoin surpassing the valuation of Visa is symbolic above all else and the current market cap of Bitcoin would theoretically make it the thirteenth-largest company in the world.Meanwhile, throughout 2020, the institutional interest in Bitcoin has been surging. At a point where the institutional demand for Bitcoin continues to increase exponentially, the surpassing of Visa’s market cap could further boost the confidence around Bitcoin among institutions.More institutions and accredited investors have been gaining exposure to Bitcoin through Grayscale and the CME Bitcoin futures market. The assets under management of Grayscale is nearing $17 billion, as the open interest of the CME Bitcoin futures market consistently remains above $1 billion.Visa has also shown more enthusiasm toward crypto in recent months, following Square and PayPal’s support for Bitcoin.For instance, Wirex, the crypto Visa debit card issuer, became a principal member of Visa in Europe. Cuy Sheffield, the senior director and head of cryptocurrency at Visa, said:In the near term, traders and on-chain analysts say that Bitcoin’s trajectory remains optimistic.Analysts at Intotheblock identified $23,069 and $23,377 as the key support levels for BTC in the near future. They wrote:As long as Bitcoin stays above the critical support areas, traders anticipate the cryptocurrency market to see a broader rally.Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, expects the total cryptocurrency market capitalization to soon break its all-time high of around $780 billion. He said:"
161,"While 2020 has been a landmark year for the crypto space, there have been a few notable letdowns. Despite the growing mainstream acceptance of virtual currencies, some governments are still creating policies that stifle innovation, placing their countries at a disadvantage in the emerging digital economy.Decentralized finance was a major talking point going into the year, and the market segment did not disappoint, with massive growth in investment throughout 2020. However, rogue actors continuously deployed elaborate scams, riding on DeFi hype to fleece victims.Apart from that, several projects suffered opportunistic profiteering attacks with flash loan exploits and arbitrage, draining funds from liquidity pools. While there is an argument for not calling these events “hacks,” they offer in stark relief some of the growing pains of the DeFi space as participants work toward actualizing the end goal of democratizing finance.Still, in 2020, crypto exchanges are leaving substantial funds in vulnerable hot wallets. While cryptocurrency theft declined significantly during the year, reports of platforms getting hacked and user deposits and data being siphoned is no less a setback than it was in previous years, even if such news hardly affects the markets these days.Regarding the exchanges, 2020 is coming to an end, and several high-profile platforms have yet to adopt protocol improvements such as Segregated Witness, or SegWit. Users are still paying more in transaction fees than they should, while some argue that the exchanges continue to operate like altcoin casinos.Back in February, Cointelegraph reported that DeFi was pivoting from a niche market and moving toward mainstream adoption. At the time, the total value of Ether (ETH) locked in the market had recently crossed the $1 billion milestone.Currently, the total value locked in DeFi is almost $14 billion, with an expanding cast of projects and protocols offering diverse services such as lending, derivatives and payments, among others. Indeed, the growth of the DeFi market in 2020 was so huge that transaction volumes on decentralized applications increased by 1,200%, according to data from DappRadar.User retention, once a major bane of DApps, gave way to consistent patronage as the DeFi “degen” culture emerged in the latter half of 2020. Even decentralized exchanges saw record trading volumes, especially during the third quarter of the year.In June, Compound Finance introduced liquidity mining, opening the yield farming floodgates. While notable DeFi actors rolled out projects that attempted to stitch together several financial markets, fringe protocols arose, capitalizing on the hype in the DeFi arena to defraud investors.From meme coins to rug pulls and even malicious contract codes, rogue actors consistently perfected their strategies to siphon more funds from yield chasers in the DeFi space. On the one hand, automated market makers, or AMMs, such as Uniswap saw record volumes, but a significant portion of this trading activity was in support of these “scamcoins” designed to steal funds from victims.Indeed, in several instances during the year, Cointelegraph highlighted the rising level of fraud within the DeFi space that seemingly threatened to overshadow the pioneering achievements in the sector. According to blockchain intelligence firm CipherTrace, DeFi is now the largest contributor to crypto-related crime, despite an overall decline in cryptocurrency thefts in 2020.According to the CipherTrace report, as of November, the total loss from DeFi hacks amounted to over $100 million. Also, 45% of all cryptocurrency hacks in the first and second quarters were from the DeFi arena, with the proportion now closer to 50% in the second half of the year, according to the crypto forensics firm. Malcolm Tan, chief advisor at DeFi AMM service KingSwap, told Cointelegraph of his disappointment in the activities of scammers in the sector, adding:As a growing market segment, it is perhaps unsurprising to see a few missteps along the way as legitimate DeFi projects move toward maturity. However, the regularity of flash loan exploits and other forms of opportunistic profiteering attacks have also served as a source for concern across the sector throughout the year.DeFi lending protocols such as MakerDAO, Compound, dYdX and bZx all suffered such attacks, with the entities involved employing several iterations of the same opportunistic profiteering vectors that targeted any glitch in the system. Taking advantage of issues like temporary price oracle malfunctions or network congestion, these attackers were able to trigger forced liquidations of under-collateralized debt positions or simply drain funds from liquidity pools.For Piers Ridyard, CEO of layer-one DeFi engine Radix, vulnerabilities in legitimate projects are an even larger problem for the sector than scammers, telling Cointelegraph: “While there are obviously some bad actors, as there are in any industry, my view is that the majority of losses have been caused by the fundamental complexity in producing DeFi applications.” He went on to add:Back in April, Chinese DeFi platform dForce suffered a $25 million hack as the project failed to guard against a known ERC-777 vulnerability. More recently, Compound Finance’s reliance on centralized price oracle feeds cost its users about $52 million in Dai liquidations when the price of the stablecoin reached a 30% premium on Coinbase.Apart from these attacks, other hacks have occurred across the DeFi space, with some being “black swan” events and others more likely repeatable unless mitigating steps are taken. Even the DeFi insurers haven’t been spared in the onslaught, with Nexus Mutual founder Hugh Karp losing $8 million to a suspected hacker.Perhaps even more disappointing is that on some projects such as Maker and Compound, the community voted against compensation for users affected in these events. On “Black Thursday” in mid-March, some vault owners lost 100% of their collateral as the price of Ether declined by half.While this year saw a continuation of greater regulatory clarity for the crypto space, some governments ensured that it was one step forward and several steps backward in the area of cryptocurrency regulations. In the European Union, strict Anti-Money Laundering standards have seen some exchanges forced to exit the region, owing to the rising cost of compliance associated with these laws.Additionally, stablecoin regulations appear to be the next battleground between crypto proponents and regulatory agencies. Almost every major intergovernmental financial institution has singled out stablecoins as the one crypto market segment that requires attention from traditional gatekeepers.As part of their efforts to counter privately issued stablecoins, many countries are now working toward creating their own CBDCs. However, the consensus is that most of these sovereign digital currencies are little more than virtual companions to national fiat.In the United States, some Democrats in Congress recently sponsored a bill requiring private stablecoin issuers to hold banking licenses. In response, many within the crypto space argued that such onerous regulations would discourage crypto startups, leaving the stablecoin field only accessible to established financial elites with deep pockets.Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also rocked the U.S. crypto industry back in November when he alleged that the Treasury Department was working to extend Know Your Customer verification to noncustodial wallets. Several major players in the U.S. crypto scene — including Jeremy Allaire, CEO of crypto payments outfit Circle — are already attempting to dissuade Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin from carrying out such a plan.Outside the U.S., India will be ending the year without any concrete position on crypto regulations by the government. Aside from the Supreme Court rescinding the 2018 ban on banks offering services to crypto exchanges back in March, not much has emerged by way of regulatory clarity for the country’s crypto sector.Kashif Raza, co-founder of Indian blockchain-focused law firm Crypto Kanoon, told Cointelegraph that the failure of the country’s government to formulate a clear legal framework for the cryptocurrency sector is a source of frustration for stakeholders:In July, Bitcoin consulting outfit Veriphi published a report showing that the incomplete nature of SegWit and transaction batching adoption had cost traders over $500 million in extra trading fees since 2017. Apart from SegWit and batching, many high-volume exchanges also have yet to offer support for layer-two protocols like the Liquid sidechain and the Lightning Network.Coinbase only adopted batching in March, with the company stating that user fees would decline by 50% following the move. Earlier in December, Kraken, another U.S. crypto exchange service, announced plans to support Lightning Network scaling technology in 2021.Social media commentary on the subject offers the consensus that exchanges prefer to be “shitcoin casinos” rather than supporting important Bitcoin improvements. Tweeting on the matter earlier in December, “Grubles,” a developer for Blockstream — a digital asset infrastructure company — characterized the situation of exchange platforms blocking Bitcoin improvements as the “altcoiner go-to move.” According to Grubles, this is done to push people toward altcoins: “Then once we have layer-2 you drag your feet because that also pushes people toward alts.” Samson Mow, chief strategy officer of Blockstream, told Cointelegraph on the matter:Ali Beikverdi, CEO of South Korea-based crypto exchange deployment service bitHolla, also decried the lack of broad-based adoption of Bitcoin improvement protocols. “Bitcoin is stuck with its current codebase and very little has been added to it,” Beikverdi told Cointelegraph, adding:Despite this, on the whole, 2020 has been a landmark year for the crypto space, with a flood of institutional investments and a growing sense of cryptocurrencies being a more mature asset class. The new year promises to be a pivotal one for the industry, with DeFi and central bank digital currencies likely to be the main focus. However, it’s also important to remember the ways in which the crypto industry did not make breakthroughs in 2020 and, perhaps, learn a lesson from it."
162,"The price of Bitcoin surpassed its all-time high on Christmas, reaching $24,681 on Binance. Following BTC’s strong rally, traders and analysts are exploring short-term bear and bull cases. The market sentiment around Bitcoin remains overwhelmingly positive, but there are some concerns put forth by analysts in the foreseeable future and as a result, the next move is not a clear-cut one.Bitcoin (BTC) has rallied above $24,600 with a relatively small short squeeze. In the past four hours, only $95 million worth of short contracts were liquidated, suggesting that this rally has not been triggered by a short squeeze. A short squeeze occurs when many short contracts, or sell orders, get liquidated in the futures market. This happens when sell orders are overleveraged, which means traders are aggressively selling Bitcoin with borrowed capital.Since the rally has not been triggered by a short squeeze, the futures market has been dominated by buyers and long contract holders. This trend led the funding rate across major Bitcoin futures exchanges to hit 0.1%. The funding rate is a mechanism that futures exchanges utilize to either incentivize long or short contract holders based on market sentiment. If there are more long contracts, the funding rate turns positive, which means buyers have to incentivize sellers.The average funding rate of the Bitcoin futures contract on most exchanges is 0.01%. When the funding rate is at 0.01%, the trader has to pay 0.01% of their position as an incentive to short-sellers, who are the minority of the market. However, when the funding rate increases and traders who are buying Bitcoin have to pay large funding fees, it becomes less compelling to long Bitcoin.Currently, as of Dec. 25, the funding rate of Bitcoin futures is hovering at 0.1%. As such, traders and strategists say that Bitcoin is at risk of a pullback because it has become less compelling to long BTC, at least in the short term. Mohit Sorout, the founding partner at Bitazu Capital, pointed to the extremely high funding rate of Bitcoin to suggest that a pullback is likely: “Would be utterly surprised if $btc just kept going up from here.”Edward Morra, a cryptocurrency derivatives trader, echoed a similar sentiment. He added that many traders in the futures market started longing or buying Bitcoin after it hit around $24,400. Following the drop, he expects the funding rate to reset after a local correction. Morra tweeted: “deriv traders weren’t buying the dip lower but instead turning omega bullish at the top again, classic. Now, spot chads will flush them, send premiums and funding to baseline and continue after a local correction.”However, some traders disagree that the futures funding rate is of the utmost importance during a strong bull run. Salsa Tekila, a pseudonymous Bitcoin trader, noted that the funding rate of BTC reached as high as 0.375% in the 2017 bull market. Considering that the price is much higher but arguably in an earlier stage of the rally, the trader said the funding rate alone might not be accurate to predict a top:Considering the previous historical price cycle of Bitcoin, traders are more cautious to forecast a peak in the short term. This leads to the bull case for BTC in the foreseeable future, which revolves around the theory that during a bull market, historical trends might not repeat.The short-term bull case for Bitcoin is based on two major factors: institutional accumulation and altcoin profits cycling into Bitcoin. Both trends are still ongoing, as inflows into Grayscale continue to increase, while altcoins lag behind BTC.Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, said that he expects Bitcoin to correct when the institutional buying slows down. But, until that happens, which would be visible by assessing Grayscale’s assets under management and CME futures data, Ju said he would maintain his bullish bias: “When institutional buying stops, the price will be likely to fall sharply. The new ATH would be determined by institutional investors when they stopped buying $BTC. Till then, I’ll keep my bullish bias.”According to Grayscale, the firm’s total assets under management hovers at $16.3 billion, with over $14 billion of it coming from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). The AUM of GBTC is considered a metric to gauge the institutional sentiment around BTC because it’s often the first point of entry for institutions into the Bitcoin market, particularly in the United States.The combination of the strong institutional accumulation of Bitcoin and the drying liquidity of the altcoin market buoys the short-term bull case for Bitcoin. Santiment, an on-chain market analysis firm, tweeted: “Liquidity has decreased rapidly in the vast majority of #crypto assets outside of $BTC and $ETH as the year is coming to a close.” This indicates that most of the interest in crypto is still concentrated around Bitcoin.Based on exchange heatmaps from Material Indicators, the next major resistances for Bitcoin are at $25,000 and $30,000. There are stacked sell orders above the two levels, which could cause a temporary pullback once those resistance areas are reached. Until then, with high institutional demand and the altcoin market lagging behind, the sentiment around Bitcoin remains strong."

164,"At the beginning of this unusual and sometimes difficult year, the cryptocurrency world reminisced about the crypto mining boom and whether it was now over. But soon, the fears were washed away as large companies registered on Nasdaq expressed clear interest in mining Bitcoin (BTC) for additional earnings.It has been said more than once that this year’s sharp rise in mining is directly related to the significant increase in cryptocurrency prices. During the summer, Bitcoin could be bought at just above $10,000; now, it’s priced at well over double the amount. Altcoins are not lagging behind, either. Ether (ETH) reached the $650 mark this month and Litecoin (LTC) was above $117 recently, although six months ago, the latter could be bought for just $41.As price analysts expect the bullish market trend to continue into 2021, the most up-to-date hardware offerings are likely to be in high demand. So, here are some of the most interesting products on the hardware market that miners should expect to see on the shelves in 2021.When it comes to Bitcoin mining, ASIC miners are the main choice for hardware. An ASIC, or application-specific integrated circuit, is a ready-made device that is easy to set up and program. When mining Ether and Ethereum-based tokens, things start to get more interesting, since they require putting together a rig that consists of a motherboard, GPU cards and several other components.So, what was in use this year and what did the world’s miners spend the most money on? Most recently, Riot Blockchain purchased 15,000 variations of the Antminer 19 series, to be delivered in 2021. Nathaniel Justin Yu, manager from International Marketing team at Bitmain, confirmed to Cointelegraph that the Antminer 19 Series models released in May 2020 were in high demand among Bitcoin miners:For those who decided to put together mining rigs by themselves, the list of the most in-demand equipment for mining this year naturally starts with the GPU cards. Two long-time rivals presented their newest lines this year: Nvidia with its top-end GeForce RTX 3000 Series GPU cards in September, followed by AMD’s Radeon RX 6800.Miners are still divided over which of these cards is better, but the main question is when will these cards be available to everyone, as demand significantly exceeds supply. While Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti and AMD Radeon RX580 are still top-end cards, the interest around the new offerings will likely spill into 2021.Next year, Bitmain will continue to delight users with series 19 ASIC miners. According to the manufacturer, new solutions will be implemented that help increase the efficiency of mining.Another Chinese manufacturer, Canaan Creative, introduced a new model of the miner AvalonMiner 1246 in September, which claims to have 30% better efficiency than the previous model. According to the producer, AvalonMiner 1246 could reach 90 terahashes per second, while A11 series process at an average of 60–68 Th/s.The miner will be available starting in January. Although this model is inferior in performance to Antminer 19, it’s cost is slightly cheaper. At around $3,000 it’s still worth a second look for those wishing to mine Bitcoin.While Nvidia was having difficulties with the release of its flagship GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, AMD is already working on the next one, having just presented its 6000 series. The company announced the release of the next series with a new RDNA 3 architecture in late 2021. According to the manufacturer, the GPU should surpass the previous one in performance by 50% and will require less power and cooling to run.But Nvidia should not be written off just yet. Despite some delays in launching its GeForce RTX 3000 cards, the company may be preparing to present new products during the event scheduled for Jan. 12, 2021. Presumably, the manufacturer will unveil Ti and Super modifications, which should please miners. In any case, the line will expand with cards of different price categories, and this will allow users to have more options when putting together mining rigs.If GPUs are the preferred method for mining, a good motherboard is an absolute must. The main feature in this case is the number of slots GPU cards can be installed into.Given what’s already available in the mining motherboard market, with the likes of MSI H310-F PRO, which has 13 GPU card slots, or the Asus B250 Mining Expert with 19 slots, miners should not expect to receive any special presents from manufacturers in 2021.However, new goods are on the way. Biostar, one of the biggest hardware producers, recently introduced a new TB360-BTC D+ motherboard designed for cryptocurrency mining. The motherboard has eight PCIe x16 slots, which is sufficient for a standard rig. However, the price and the sales start date are not yet clear.For efficient mining, the choice of each component is crucial. Apart from the correct GPU card and motherboard, uninterrupted internet and electricity is a must. Additionally, equipment for mining cryptocurrencies is very noisy and can get hot, so miners need to follow safety precautions. When mining at home, running the rig in an air-conditioned room is the best option for when it’s warm and a balcony when it’s not.Related article: The top crypto-mining graphics cards to get a big bang for your buckOn top of that, it’s worth choosing a powerful power supply with sufficient power and, most importantly, with protection against power surges and other electrical problems. One such option that will be shipped at the start of 2021 is the EVGA SuperNOVA 1000, which costs almost $200.Choosing a frame is not the last task, because it affects the level of noise generated by the rig. Guntis Vitolins from Mineshop company, which offers both ready-made rigs and equipment separately, noted to Cointelegraph that miners’ tastes in frames have changed this year:For those who do not want to figure out the complex topic of designing a mining rig, GPU card selection and so on, there are companies that offer turnkey solutions. This year, experts have been discussing the growth in sales of these ready-made rigs, dubbed “mining 2.0.”Vitolins further stated that “sales have increased dramatically since March 2020,” adding that GPU miners built with AMD graphic cards (the best cards for mining Ether) have been a particular hit.Looking at the growing cryptocurrency prices and the excitement around mining equipment gives hope that 2021 will start off no worse than the previous year for the industry. However, it is impossible to predict whether crypto mining will stay in fashion due to economic uncertainty amid the devastating COVID-19 pandemic.But, it is safe to say that miners in 2020 have become more experienced and battle-tested following Bitcoin’s mining reward halving and the not-so-smooth rainy season in China. Today, miners are no longer babies seeing the world around them for the first time, but ready for market shocks and able to adapt to any conditions. Furthermore, as large, public companies are starting to enter crypto mining, 2021 should further solidify the adoption and acceptance trend."
165,"Livecoin, a lesser-known Russian cryptocurrency exchange, has abruptly halted operations in the aftermath of an alleged hacker attack on Christmas day. According to Livecoin’s main page, the exchange has suffered a “carefully planned attack” causing the platform to lose control of all of its servers, backend and nodes.The exchange urged its customers to stop using its services including deposits, trading and API. “We were not able to stop our service in time. Our news channels were compromised as well. At the moment, we partially control frontend, and so we’re able to place this announcement,"" Livecoin’s main page reads.Livecoin said that it’s working hard to retrieve control of its servers, promising to provide a security update “in the next few days.” The exchange also claimed that it is cooperating with “local police authorities.”According to some reports, the incident took place on the night between Dec. 23 and Dec. 24. Hackers have apparently managed to take over Livecoin’s infrastructure and modify the prices on the exchange to abnormally high values.A co-founder of YellowBlock, a crypto educational website, known as ""Cryptorangutang"" said that Bitcoin (BTC) exceeded $320,000 per coin on the platform on Dec. 24. “Whatever is going on, I don’t recommend trying to make $ on this, very likely you will get your funds stuck,” he wrote on Twitter.According to comments of exchange users on Livecoin’s unofficial Telegram group, the exchange is not operating at the time of publishing despite the exchange having briefly opened a login page. Some Reddit users also suggested that Livecoin's ""hack"" could be a classic exit scam.Livecoin did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment. The exchange is apparently not actively running any official social media accounts on Twitter or Telegram.At the time of publishing, Livecoin’s trading volumes are not available on major crypto tracking websites like CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap. As of Dec. 24, Livecoin was reportedly ranked 173 among crypto exchanges, with a daily trading volume of around $16 million."
166,"Bitcoin (BTC) has broken $24,000 once again on Dec. 25 as bullish momentum returned for Christmas, which is looking rosy for bulls.Data from Cointelegraph Markets, Coin360 and TradingView showed BTC/USD repeatedly testing $24,000 resistance on Christmas Day.Hitting new all-time highs of $24,500 on Bitstamp at publishing time, Bitcoin refused to conform to bearish prognoses, shrugging off lows that resulted from legal action against Ripple.At press time, the largest cryptocurrency circled $23,900 as volatility intensified, with all-time highs in sight at $24,217.For some, such a move was expected, coming late in the year when Bitcoin tends to dominate over altcoins before a reversal takes place in January. Among adherents to this view is Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe.“Bitcoin dominance has been topping out in December in the past years. Every year it did,” he summarized on the day.With the holidays beginning, large buy-ins from institutional investors were less likely, these having the potential to dredge up liquidity and boost price performance even higher.As Cointelegraph reported, however, MicroStrategy, which has holdings in excess of 70,000 BTC, revealed that it purchased small amounts on a high-frequency basis instead of moving the market with a lump sum.Meanwhile, altcoins are also up on Christmas day, with Ether (ETH) regaining $600 and XRP, fresh from a 60% drop from Ripple’s lawsuit fears, rebounded to $0.35."

Rather, it represented the ""personal views"" of Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary under Trump soon to be replaced by Biden's pick, Janet Yellen.  ""You are delusional,"" a visibly irate Roubini retorted.Cryptocurrency skeptics have been buoyed this week by news that U.S. regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had decided to file a lawsuit against blockchain payments network Ripple. The largest investor in the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, XRP, Ripple saw a 60% drop in the value of the token once the news became public.At the same time, commentators noted that Bitcoin had barely reacted to the legal challenge. In the long term, however, surveys have shown that many remain concerned about the potential for government bans to impact Bitcoin's success.Proponents argue that this is impossible. The most effective way of reducing demand for a fully-decentralized asset, they claim, is for governments to reintroduce free markets on a sound monetary standard such as gold — an unlikely eventuality.""Bitcoin can't be easily banned,"" Saifedean Ammous, author of ""The Bitcoin Standard,"" summarized last year.Meanwhile, the outlook for Roubini if he continues his current lambasting of Bitcoin and altcoins looks bleak. As data shows, his outbursts have almost exactly matched local price lows for BTC/USD, making the economist an accidental bellwether for those looking to enter the market to profit.Fellow detractor Peter Schiff has a similar track record when it comes to Bitcoin itself."
168,"Hacked cryptocurrency exchange Exmo is not able to recover a large amount of stolen funds as hackers withdrew millions of dollars in crypto through the Poloniex crypto exchange.On Dec. 21, Exmo announced a major hack causing the platform to freeze all withdrawals from the exchange. The United Kingdom-based company now estimates total losses to stand at more than $10.5 million in various digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT), XRP, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Zcash (ZEC).Exmo executives allege that as much as $4 million of totally stolen assets cannot be recovered due criminals withdrawing the funds through Poloniex. A spokesperson at the Poloniex Compliance Department told Cointelegraph:According to Exmo’s calculations, Poloniex allowed hackers to withdraw $1 million in XRP and $2.8 million in ZEC. Exmo executives alleged that the reason behind the loss was lack of Anti-Money Laundering measures applied by Poloniex. As Poloniex reportedly moved its headquarters from the United States to Seychelles, Exmo filed a report on the issue to the Seychelles Central Bank.Poloniex subsequently denied Exmo’s allegations to Cointelegraph, claiming that the exchange has strong AML and Know-Your-Customer policies:As previously reported, Exmo’s security incident caused the platform to lose about 5% of its total assets. The exchange said that the hack only impacted the exchange’s hot wallets, promising to cover user losses. As part of an investigation to recover the stolen funds, Exmo provided wallets associated with hackers and announced collaboration with major global exchanges in Kraken and Yobit as well as crypto analytics firms Chainalysis and CipherTrace.In a Dec. 23 security incident update, Exmo said that the exchange expects to start resuming withdrawals for major cryptocurrencies between Dec. 25 and 26."
169,"While you're undoubtedly ""in it for the technology,"" the most popular and hotly-debated topic, particularly as far as public interest is concerned, remains the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and speculating on its value in the future. Currently, Bitcoin is in a bull market cycle, up over 200% year-to-date and outperforming everything else in 2020 with the exception of a few stocks like Tesla. But this rally seems different than the one in late 2017. For one, the all-time high has been definitively broken. Second, institutions are accumulating — while the public still sits largely on the sidelines. Six-figure price predictions per Bitcoin are becoming increasingly common for this bull cycle with accelerating central bank monetary expansion as the key driver.In fact, billionaire investors such as Ray Dalio are beginning to warm to the idea of Bitcoin alongside gold as a way to diversify against what he calls ""the depreciating value of money."" “We are in a flood of money and credit that is lifting most asset prices and distributing wealth in a way that the system that we’ve come to believe is normal is unable to, and that is threatening to the value of our money and credit,” he warned in a Dec. 8 Reddit session.As Cointelegraph reported in May, Morgan Creek's CEO Mark Yusko said BTC price could exceed $100,000 over the next year or so. The price has now more than doubled since, but it still has to gain roughly another 300% in the next 12 months to reach six figures. This estimate echoes the forecast of the popular Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model, which its creator, planB, says continues to be right on track. Last month, planB reiterated that he now has no doubt BTC will hit $100,000 by December 2021 due to a ""supply shortage."" “People ask if I still believe in my model. To be clear: I have no doubt whatsoever that Bitcoin S2FX is correct and Bitcoin will tap $100,000-288,000 before December 2021,"" he wrote last month.As reported, Bitcoin has caught up to the S2F model mean trend line in the past month. The $200,000 price prediction is even becoming relatively tame, according to other analysts. Popular on-chain analyst Will Woo says he's seeing more evidence of ""hodling"" this time around, as well as a dwindling BTC supply on exchanges as a result of the previously-mentioned shortage of stock.According to Woo, this will be a double-whammy for the bears.  “I've never been so bullish for 2021,"" he continues in another post. ""This re-accumulation phase coincides with spot market inventory depletion roughly 2x longer and deeper than the last cycle. It will send BTC.”Even higher price predictions stem from the argument that Bitcoin can challenge — or is already starting to challenge — and eventually supplant gold as a de facto store of value. Interestingly, some of the most bullish forecasts have started to come from legacy finance as Bitcoin rose to new all-time highs in early December to vastly outperform gold in 2020. In November, for example, an analyst from Citibank told clients in a note that Bitcoin could reach as high as $318,000 in 2021. Citibank managing director Tom Fitzpatrick cited Bitcoin's historic “unthinkable rallies followed by painful corrections.”Currently, the Citibank executive believes BTC is in the middle of a bull run that appears to be in “what looks like a very well defined channel,” which sets it up for a $318,000 target in December 2021. JPMorgan meanwhile is also starting to point out Bitcoin's increasing popularity among traditional investors. In fact, the investment bank giant sees a lot more upside potential from Bitcoin as ""digital gold,"" compared to the already ""very advanced"" adoption of gold. In a note to clients, the strategists said:Today, Bitcoin's market cap is less than 4% of gold's. This immense upside potential has also prompted other big-name investors to share their predictions that involve Bitcoin challenging and even surpassing gold with its $9 trillion market cap.Morgan Creek's Anthony Pompliano still targets around $100,000 in 2021. However, in the summer he gave a $400,00 target in the longer term if BTC starts catching up to gold. Meanwhile, Gemini exchange founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss believe Bitcoin ""being a better gold than gold,"" which means that price rising to $500,000 is now inevitable. MicroStrategy and other investment firms buying significant amounts of Bitcoin is only the beginning of a major shift, according to Cameron. What's more, Wall Street has started warming to Bitcoin as its quickly becoming a ""no-brainer"" for investment portfolios. Comparing it to the bottom of the first in a nine-inning baseball game, the Winklevoss twins expect Bitcoin's value to continue climbing in the coming years. “What if every Fortune 100 or 500 company does that, what if central banks start doing that? It hasn’t even started,” he added."
170,"Digital currency exchange Coinbase has awarded its first-ever Bitcoin Core developer grants, and a familiar name is among the recipients.João Barbosa and 0xB10C, the alias of a pseudonymous developer, were selected winners earlier this week. Although the funding amounts weren’t revealed, Coinbase said both developers will “be funded to work on Bitcoin for all of 2021” in amounts payable via BTC or USD.As Coinbase states:Barbosa’s development work was previously funded by crypto mining firm Bitmain before his grants were abruptly cut along with fellow developer Jonas Schnelli.Today, I lost my sponsorship.

After more than 3 years, Bitmain decided to halt funding Bitcoin Core developers (also Joao Barbosa/promag).

Thanks Bitmain for all the help (despite the disagreement we had)!

Help me to continue my work on Bitcoin Corehttps://t.co/5FeGoB76j8

❤️Barbosa’s development work is centered on improving the Bitcoin Core user experience on Android and iOS mobile devices. He plans to use the grant money to develop a Bitcoin Core GUI based on the Qt Quick framework.Coinbase first announced its Crypto Community Fund in October as a way to sponsor codebase development for Bitcoin Core. Depending on the success of the first grants, Coinbase plans to expand the program to other types of crypto projects in the future.Bitcoin was launched in early 2009 without a fundraise or developer grants. Early developers helped pave the way for new monetary ecosystems to emerge. Now, there are over 8,100 cryptocurrencies vying for adoption spanning several industries, use cases, and geographical locations. João Barbosa did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
171,"The hacker likely responsible for Ledger’s security breach in July recently dumped a large amount of data exposing the personal information of over 270,000 customers, including phone numbers and physical addresses. The leak also included 1 million emails of Ledger wallet owners and customers that were signed up to the company’s newsletter service.Amid the furor caused by the incident, Ledger says its focus is on improving its security infrastructure rather than reimbursing users for any losses that may occur. Meanwhile, some affected customers are reportedly considering taking legal action against the company in the form of a class-action lawsuit.The Ledger customer data leak also offers fresh fodder for the debate against implementing more Know Your Customer compliance protocols, critics of which argue that such measures encourage targeted cyber attacks aimed at exposing critical personal data.As mentioned, the hacker presumably responsible for breaching the Ledger e-commerce database back in July dumped the personal information of thousands of affected users online. The company was blamed on social media for not providing better protection of user data and downplaying the extent of the initial breach. At the time, the hardware wallet maker declared that only 9,500 customers were affected by the security breach.Addressing the disparity in the reported number of people affected, Ledger issued a statement on Dec. 21 declaring that the leak covered more material than it was able to analyze earlier in the year. However, the company affirmed that customer funds remained safe, adding: “This data breach has no link nor impact on our hardware wallets, the app or your funds. Your crypto assets are safe. While very truly and sincerely regrettable, this breach concerns only e-commerce related information.”Responding to the incident via Twitter, Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier remarked that the leak was indicative of the growing threat of cyberattacks. Appearing on the What Bitcoin Did podcast with Peter McCormack, Gauthier commented on the nature of the breach, stating that it was the result of a mistake in the company’s e-commerce stack.“It’s a wrong API key that got coded on the map client to import the database from the store that got coded in the wrong placements and so, therefore, was coded where it should not have been coded and exposed the database to a simple attack,” explained Gauthier.Amid the reactions to the leak, some cybersecurity experts highlighted that the incident was another pointer to the lack of encryption deployment by database administrators in storing user data. The Ledger CEO addressed the lack of encryption on the API keys, adding that it was an honest mistake and not a deliberate attempt to jeopardize customer safety by failing to hash API keys.Commenting on the leak, Ruben Merre, CEO of hardware wallet maker NGRAVE, remarked that the incident was reflective of rapid growth among crypto firms coming at the expense of security considerations. He added: “So many online platforms get hacked, and not necessarily because of the hackers’ skill. Often, platforms just have bad security governance, let alone implementation.”The data leak has triggered another round of phishing attacks as rogue actors, now armed with the emails of Ledger users, attempt to trick the wallet’s customers into revealing their 24-word seed phrase. Even before the data dump, such phony emails were a regular occurrence.However, the exposure of phone numbers and personal addresses potentially opens up Ledger users to more risk factors. Some users have reported attempted SIM swapping attacks on their numbers with the hacker presumably trying to compromise two-factor authorization protocols.Crypto investors have been targets of SIM swap attacks in the past. Back in June, Richard Yuan Li was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with a series of SIM swap attacks that targeted over 20 individuals.Apart from phishing and SIM swap exploits, the data leak also opens up the possibility of the risk factors moving beyond scareware into the realm of actual physical attacks. Indeed, some users affected by the incident claim to have received threatening messages asking for payments or risk possible home invasions.The Ledger CEO has acknowledged the possibility of physical attacks as a result of the company’s oversight, and has also assured users that their hardware wallet devices contained several protective protocols to safeguard against the theft of funds. Among these security measures is the use of incorrect pincode entries to format devices or a second password that displays a dummy account, leaving the owner’s actual funds safe from bad actors.Additionally, the consensus among security experts on social media is that consumers should be using post office box addresses or other public pickup locations instead of their actual home addresses for sensitive items like a Ledger hard wallet. For those with compromised phone numbers, the best line of action appears to be getting a new number and using a new email address to communicate the change to important contacts.While affected customers continue to deal with the fallout of the leak, Ledger says it is working to prevent future occurrences. In a statement to Cointelegraph, the company stated:Some affected users began advocating for legal action against Ledger immediately following the reported leak. There is even a “Ledger wallet leak” subreddit on the Reddit platform, where users are discussing possible modalities for a class-action lawsuit.With its headquarters in Paris, Ledger falls under the laws of the European Union. In November, the European Parliament adopted legislative amendments that will allow EU customers to institute class-action lawsuits against companies operating in the region within the next two years.According to the ruling at the time, once passed into law, class-action lawsuits can be filed against companies operating in the EU for cases involving financial services, tourism and data protection, among others.Ledger’s EU customers will require a qualified consumer protection body or some other recognized entity to represent the complainants. However, unlike U.S. laws, punitive damages from EU class-action lawsuits are restricted to the actual losses incurred by the class of plaintiffs.Apart from customers filing a lawsuit against the company, the data leak might also constitute a breach of privacy in the eyes of European regulators, specifically under the EU General Data Protection Regulation. In such situations, the EU has the ability to fine Ledger up to 4% of its revenue.Indeed, with the Ledger CEO having admitted to the company anonymizing user data improperly, the company could come under scrutiny from EU officials. Recital 26 of the GDPR mandates all companies to ensure complete removal of all the information that can identify users from their cache of stored or processed data."
172,"A public blockchain ecosystem has unveiled a Universal Passport that it believes will solve one of the industry’s biggest challenges: interoperability.Nervos says that its technology is compatible with existing standards, meaning that users who want to move assets from one network to another — or use apps based on different blockchains — will no longer need to contend with multiple interfaces and multiple identities.The company’s co-founder, Kevin Wang, told Cointelegraph: “We want to meet users where they are instead of asking them to get used to the interfaces that fit into the underlying plumbing or infrastructure.”Key elements of the Universal Passport — described as the beginning of Interoperability 2.0 — include a layer that sits on top of Nervos’ public blockchain infrastructure, enabling developers to create applications that are naturally multi-chain.“PW Core allows you to build applications that are accessible to all users on different blockchains. For example, with an application built on Nervos through PW Core, you can reach users on TRON or EOS or Ethereum. All they have to do is use their existing wallets,” Wang explained.An Ethereum compatibility layer known as Polyjuice also enables developers to seamlessly move existing smart contracts from the Ethereum blockchain so they can run on Nervos — preserving the investment that they have already made in their applications.Wang told Cointelegraph that this means that Bitcoin and Ethereum users can now operate Nervos applications directly from their existing wallets, without having to go through the inconvenience of downloading new software, acquiring tokens and remembering seed phrases.But the executive said that there is a much bigger picture to the Universal Passport, one that will enable everyday consumers to access Nervos applications through the web browsers they currently use. “For them, Nervos just complements their existing internet — and brings this decentralized world to the internet,” Wang explained.In time, Nervos hopes that it will become a natural way of onboarding internet users to blockchain technology — something that’s regarded as crucial given how the web has a much broader base of users.“Nervos is a fully decentralized world that provides an almost centralized-like user experience,” Wang added.Nervos believes that the future of the decentralized economy is going to be built on multiple blockchains — some specialized, some general. In the fullness of time, these platforms will come together to form an internet-like public network — but for this to be effective, it needs to be far easier to move assets from one chain to another.However, there’s a problem with some of the most well-known interoperability solutions that already exist in the marketplace, as they are only effective as long as blockchains are built using their toolkits. There also need to be substantial improvements when it comes to the user experience, as there’s a lack of wallets that can talk to multiple blockchains. If you’re an ETH user who also needs to use BTC, you’ll need to download a Bitcoin wallet.“Creating new standards trying to unite existing standards never worked out too well in the past,” Wang said. “Instead, we need to think about how to be compatible and support existing standards.”Overall, Nervos is trying to change the status quo in the crypto industry — and move the narrative away from the idea that there is a one-horse race to be the only blockchain solution. As the space continues to mature and expand, multiple networks will be needed — and the marketplace will be far healthier if they can interact with each other effortlessly.Disclaimer.

173,"Bitcoin (BTC) saw fresh rejection at $24,000 overnight on Dec. 24, but data shows that appetite for big buy-ins is only increasing.As recorded by on-chain analytics resource CryptoQuant, institution-focused exchange Coinbase Pro alone saw two large withdrawals of more than 12,000 BTC ($278 million) each this week.As Cointelegraph reported, while not proven, single large outflow spikes suggest that a buyer has purchased a large amount of BTC and the proceeds are being moved to a single storage wallet.""Another big Coinbase outflows a few hours ago,"" Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, added in Twitter comments.In November, miners unlocked just under 28,000 BTC in block rewards — barely more than the sum total of the two Coinbase Pro transactions. This implied supply squeeze forms a central argument for continued upward price action.Underlying desire to suck up the Bitcoin supply at $23,000 contrasts with external factors influencing market sentiment, notably revolving around Ripple's U.S. lawsuit and shifting expectations over the Mt. Gox rehabilitation proceedings.Concerns that Ripple's associated altcoin XRP could become all but untradeable thanks to legal action appeared to spark considerable volatility in Bitcoin over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the market is awaiting the distribution of funds to Mt. Gox's creditors, who after a six-year hiatus may well be keen to sell some or all of their BTC at 2020 prices, resulting in $3.2 billion of additional selling pressure.Beyond these short-term factors, however, it remains clear that institutions are bullish on Bitcoin as a whole, with fresh commitments surfacing almost constantly.Boom. +$500 million in one day https://t.co/L2MnXDCDQBInvestment giant Grayscale now controls $16.4 billion in assets under management, adding $500 million in a single day, its latest data from Wednesday confirms.

174,"From $3,600 lows to all-time highs of just above $24,000, 2020 was the year that Bitcoin (BTC) surprised analysts like never before.With predicting its next move becoming ever more difficult, there’s likewise never been more demand for an accurate Bitcoin price model.Cointelegraph takes a look at how the best in the business fared this year, and what’s worth following as 2021 gets underway — possibly with $20,000 as a starting point.No matter which way you look at it, 2020 was the year in which the stock-to-flow Bitcoin price model came of age.Already one of the best known in the industry, stock-to-flow’s various incarnations tracked BTC/USD as it ranged to its dramatic yearly lows and shot back up again.Best of all, Bitcoin’s entire program of behavior still fell within the models’ demands — as of December 19, it is following stock-to-flow to the letter (or digit).The stock-to-flow ratio is based on the amount of an asset already in existence (the stock) versus the amount being added via creation (the flow). In Bitcoin’s case, this ratio is intrinsically tied to block subsidy halvings — these reduce the flow by 50% roughly every four years.As such, with each halving, Bitcoin’s ratio becomes higher, and there is currently nothing in the way of it attaining and preserving the highest ratio of any known asset.In terms of price, several variants of stock-to-flow-based prediction have been created by PlanB, the anonymous analyst who has become a household name among Bitcoiners.Each model calls for different price targets to hit during the current halving cycle through 2024. The most conservative is $100,000 by the end of 2021.Despite fielding major criticism of stock-to-flow this year, PlanB has defended his model, and his faith was justly rewarded when Bitcoin rose to exactly hit the model price last week.It’s been a testing year for another popular Bitcoin price prediction tool. The Elliott Wave Theory — more of a price map than a strict set of targets — has had a difficult twelve months.Not specific to Bitcoin, Elliott Wave delivers a multi-step market cycle which aims to track highs and lows of an asset.Due to its nonspecific nature, however, those predictions are often huge, but Bitcoin has delivered before due to its inherently volatile nature early in its existence.2020 likewise produced moments of clarity using Elliott Wave, but April’s prediction of a fresh retracement to $3,000 — matching the pit of the 2018 bear market — failed to come to pass.Lastly, a sight to behold at $23,000 is Bitcoin’s position on the so-called Rainbow Chart.A light-hearted log chart of BTC/USD, Rainbow breaks down price levels into a series of buy and sell tips — roughly one for each color of the rainbow.Ranging from red (“maximum bubble territory”) to dark blue (“basically a fire sale”), these tell investors and hodlers what to expect next from Bitcoin based on its upward or downward direction.Right now, even at near all-time highs, BTC/USD is still heading upwards and is only in the light green band which the model describes as “still cheap.”As with stock-to-flow, Rainbow thus predicts more upside potential for Bitcoin, now that $20,000 resistance appears firmly a thing of the past."
175,"The mainstream has taken a growing interest in cryptocurrency as the price of Bitcoin (BTC) continues to reach all-time highs. To put this interest into perspective, researchers at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance recently found that 101 million people across the globe currently hold Bitcoin and other digital assets. The report states that in 2018, findings estimated the number of identity-verified digital asset users to be about 35 million globally.With such growth underway, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that crypto holders would get the idea of gifting cryptocurrency this holiday season. Social distancing requirements amid the pandemic have led to virtual holiday gatherings and digital gifts being sent across various geographies.Yet, while the idea of gifting cryptocurrency to friends and family may sound appealing, there are considerations to take into account before sending them to your loved ones — especially newcomers.Bill Zielke, chief marketing officer at BitPay, a leading Bitcoin (BTC) payment service provider, told Cointelegraph that sending crypto person-to-person has always been popular, noting that the firm expects more consumers to do so this holiday given the bullish market. “While Bitcoin remains the crypto of choice for purchases, XRP and Ether (ETH) have dramatically increased in popularity, representing 8% and 7% of BitPay’s transactions respectively,” he said.However, when it comes to sending cryptocurrency to new users, Zielke explained that education is key, as there are many coins and several ways to store them. There are also questions such as whether the wallet being used is open-source and noncustodial. Perhaps more importantly, the person that has received crypto should know what these terms mean.The saying, “Not your keys, not your Bitcoin” may come to mind here. While hardware and paper wallets are known for being more secure forms of cryptocurrency storage, there are huge responsibilities that come along with these mechanisms.Dave Jevans, CEO of blockchain intelligence firm CipherTrace, told Cointelegraph that when sending crypto to a beginner, it’s critical to ensure they understand this basic rule: “Your value, your responsibility.” Jevans shared that it’s essential for newcomers to comprehend the importance of safeguarding their private key, recovery phrase storage, and having a secure place to store the crypto once it has been received, or else there is the risk of losing access to funds.For those considering a more mainstream approach, “Crypto Wendy O,” a crypto YouTuber, told Cointelegraph that she recommends new users to set up an account on a well-known exchange:However, despite Coinbase being one of the most popular digital asset platforms in the United States, there are also downsides to the service. Coinbase and other popular exchanges like Binance have been experiencing technical issues as the price of Bitcoin climbs higher. While regular crypto users may be aware of these service failures, this could be very concerning for newcomers.While sending cryptocurrency directly to another user via a wallet address may be the most common way of gifting crypto, alternatives such as gift cards and ATM vouchers should also be considered.Zielke shared that BitPay has seen a spike in users turning crypto into gift cards. “During the months of November and December, gift card purchases using crypto have been our top-performing category,” he said. With well-known retailers like Amazon accepting gift cards purchased with Bitcoin through several native crytpo services, this could be a great option for gifting crypto to newcomers.Additionally, Jevans noted that crypto ATMs such as Coinme can provide depositors with vouchers redeemable by anyone. While this may make a great gift choice, Jevans remarked that depositing $250 or more will require Know Your Customer verification for most Bitcoin ATMs in the United States.Aside from giving cryptocurrency to friends and family, crypto donations are also a great way to give back this holiday season. Interestingly enough, this year has seen a number of new crypto-related fundraising opportunities from mainstream charities.For example, “Bitcoin Tuesday,” which was scheduled for Dec. 1 this year, encouraged users to make cryptocurrency donations to organizations such as Save the Children, No Kid Hungry and the American Cancer Society. The Giving Block, the crypto donations company behind the virtual event, noted that this year’s celebration was an order of magnitude bigger than last year’s. Most recently, The Giving Block partnered with The American Cancer Society to create the first-ever cancer research fund based exclusively on crypto donations.Alex Wilson, co-founder of The Giving Block, told Cointelegraph that donating cryptocurrency creates a virtuous cycle of giving, noting that higher market prices often result in more donations, leading to mainstream adoption. “It’s particularly beneficial this year because crypto asset prices have risen so dramatically,” he said.It’s also notable that The Salvation Army is accepting cryptocurrency donations this Christmas, launching its first-ever “crypto kettle” in the United States’ west. This unique initiative allows donors to give Bitcoin and Ether directly to The Salvation Army, one of the largest charities in the world. In a recent blog post, the organization noted that these transactions are easy to make, and most importantly, come with tax benefits.The tax benefits associated with crypto donations are certainly a consideration to be taken into account. According to Taxbit’s “Cryptocurrency Gifts and Donations Tax Guide,” donating cryptocurrency to a qualified charitable organization is not a taxable event. The guide further notes that donors will not realize income, gain or loss from making a donation. Moreover, if a donor has held cryptocurrency for more than a year prior to the donation, they will be eligible for the itemized charitable deduction for the fair market value of the cryptocurrency at the time of contribution, in addition to not incurring a taxable gain on an appreciated asset.Justin Woodward, a tax attorney at TaxBit, told Cointelegraph that there are tremendous tax incentives to donating cryptocurrency through an unrealized gain position. “Donating appreciated capital assets to a qualified charity allows you to avoid paying capital gains on the eventual sale,” he said.While there are clearly a number of ways to gift crypto this year, education is still key when it comes to deciding how to give back. Moreover, it’s apparent that the widespread use of cryptocurrency is still very much underway. As such, Zielke from BitPay remarked that 2021 may be the tipping point for crypto to really “become a cool gift to receive for special occasions.”"
176,"The unique power of blockchain and cryptocurrency can also be considered their weakness. Crypto users gain unparalleled privacy for financial transactions through a decentralized transactional system. Governments, however, demand transparency in financial transactions for legal concerns. This creates a paradox. People are less inclined to use financial instruments if, in doing so, they expose their money to the world. Conversely, there are a number of regulations requiring financial institutions to counteract terrorism and money laundering — serious concerns for many governments.The crux of the issue is that most public blockchains require a consensus of all participants to validate transactions. How can both sides — individual users and governments — achieve their conflicting objectives when they’re diametrically opposed?A potential solution to this problem involves balancing the privacy concerns of users with the centralized oversight necessary for governments to ensure that regulations like Anti-Money Laundering, Know Your Customer and Combating the Financing of Terrorism are observed. Implementing measures for confidential transactions alongside those for governmental surveillance strikes a delicate balance in which cryptocurrency assets remain discreet yet subject to the laws governing finance around the world.Related: Comparing money laundering with cryptocurrencies and fiatThe government’s need to monitor cryptocurrency transactions for counterterrorism and AML purposes is critical for public safety, especially since these two areas are interrelated. Money laundering can be used to fund terrorist activities, which — like everything else — require funding, even if it doesn’t involve money laundering. Surveying the money flow between parties on popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and others can provide invaluable information for preventing these crimes. Regulatory bodies need insight into which parties are paying whom and why, at the very least.However, cryptocurrency’s very nature makes it easy to mask these and other transactions. Bitcoin may be traceable with modern tools, but some transactions are completely untraceable with other cryptocurrencies. These legitimate concerns partly explain the formation of organizations like the Financial Action Task Force, which exists to counteract money laundering and terrorist financing, and whose efforts would greatly benefit from improved visibility into cryptocurrency transactions.Related: A minister’s look at what regulators expect from the industryThe general public’s privacy issues about using cryptocurrencies are, in many ways, opposed to the visibility the government requires for AML and terrorism efforts. People simply want to keep their business as discreet with cryptocurrencies as it is with conventional currency transactions. However, the transaction validation features of public blockchains can potentially expose this information, invading users’ financial privacy.Related: Blockchain can provide the right to privacy that everyone deservesThe first element of a solution providing consumer privacy in tandem with governmental oversight is to redress this issue. There are confidential transaction features — some of which are used by cryptocurrencies Monero (XMR) or Zcash (ZEC) — that obfuscate the amount and participants of a transaction while still validating it for a blockchain. These cryptocurrencies provide measures to prevent people from knowing the origin, the destination and the amount of a specific transaction. These approaches assuage many of the privacy concerns of cryptocurrency holders.Related: Dash claims ‘inaccurate categorization’ as ShapeShift delists privacy coinsBy pairing these privacy methods with the following ideas for cryptocurrency surveillance, governments can monitor activity for counter-terrorism and AML purposes. Say, for example, there is a cryptocurrency backed by an organization consisting of a finite number of banks. The first thing users would have to do is onboard with those institutions — much as they would with any other — which provides an initial layer of insight into cryptocurrency behavior while supporting mandates like KYC. Then, after users issue transactions to others enrolled in this organization, they would be obligated to disclose the details to one of the banking members for proof. This obligation can be enforced on the transactor by the use of cryptography so that the validators can ascertain that the disclosure has been correctly made.Related: The data economy is a dystopian nightmareSuch an approach would enable the government to collectively ask each bank the particulars of a transaction so it can monitor the money flow. The government would therefore have central oversight courtesy of the individual financial institutions’ input. With this paradigm, the banks validate transactions, the government collects all the data for central analysis and surveillance, and consumer privacy is upheld among financial organizations and cryptocurrency users. There are additional cryptographic approaches that, when coupled with blockchain’s cryptographic underpinnings, can support this model for both privacy and regulatory adherence.Related: You should care about decentralized identity in the wake of COVID-19Cryptocurrency usage is rapidly evolving. It’s unacceptable for financial institutions to tell national or international regulators that they don’t know whether transactions are legitimate. It’s equally unacceptable to expose the financial prowess of legitimate users to everyone on a blockchain.

177,"The current crypto bull run has been spearheaded by Bitcoin (BTC). As the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has previously hinted that Bitcoin is not a security, the regulator’s current lawsuit against Ripple is unlikely to stop the institutional inflow of money into Bitcoin. However, a few altcoins that may be at risk of facing a similar fate as Ripple could face selling pressure. Due to a change in sentiment, retail investors may sell some of their altcoin holdings and shift to Bitcoin.Even retail investors who plan to spend their stimulus checks for buying crypto-assets may prefer Bitcoin over altcoins. So, while XRP faces selling pressure, the lawsuit may prove to be bullish for Bitcoin.The institutions have been pumping money into Bitcoin at an unprecedented pace. Grayscale continued its buying spree and added 12,319 Bitcoin on Tuesday. That means Grayscale gobbled up about 44% of all the newly mined BTC in a month or around 28,000 Bitcoin.Bitcoin’s supply is not able to keep up with the institutional demand and if retail traders also turn net buyers, the price is only likely to boost further.Let’s look at the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies and establish their major trend.In a strong uptrend, the corrections usually last for about one to three days. Bitcoin closed in the red on Dec. 20 and 21 but the price turned up on Dec. 22 and the bulls are currently attempting to resume the up-move.If the bulls can push the price above $24,302.50, the BTC/USD pair could rally to $26,958. The upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) close to the overbought zone suggest bulls are in control.However, if the bears defend the overhead resistance level, the pair may consolidate in a tight range of $21,934.83 to $24,302.50 before starting the next move.Contrary to this bullish assumption, if the pair turns down and breaks below $21,934.83, a drop to $20,000 is possible. The zone between $19,500 and $20,000 is crucial because if it cracks, the pair may drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($18,529).The bulls are aggressively defending the 20-day exponential moving average ($603). Although Ether (ETH) rose above the $622.807 resistance on Dec. 22, the price has turned down once again today. This suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.However, the bulls are currently attempting to defend the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the ETH/USD pair could make one more attempt to rise above $640 and retest $676.325.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls have the upper hand. A breakout of $676.325 may start the next leg of the uptrend, which has a target objective at $763.614.Conversely, if the price dips below the trendline of the triangle, the pair could extend the decline to $540 and then to $480.The bulls defended the $0.425 to $0.40 support on Dec. 22 but renewed selling today has broken the range. XRP has plunged below the $0.326724 support but bulls may attempt to provide support at lower levels.However, the 20-day EMA ($0.513) has turned down and the RSI has dropped close to the overbought territory, which suggests that the trend has turned in favor of the bears.Even if the price rebounds off the current levels, the bears are likely to sell on relief rallies to $0.435 and then at the 20-day EMA.If the price sustains below $0.326724, the XRP/USD pair could sink to $0.25. If that happens, the pair will complete a 100% retracement of the most recent leg of the up-move.Litecoin (LTC) rebounded off $98.40 on Dec. 22 but the bulls could not push the price above the $118.6497 resistance. This suggests that traders are using rallies to offload their positions.The bears will now try to sink the price below the $98.40 support and the 20-day EMA at $95. If they succeed, the LTC/USD pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($80). Such a move will suggest a possible change in trend from bullish to range-bound.Contrary to this assumption, if the price again rebounds off $98.40, the pair may remain stuck in a tight range for a few days.The rising moving averages and the RSI above 60 suggest that bulls have the upper hand. A break above the $118.6497 to $124.1278 resistance zone could indicate a resumption of the uptrend that may reach $140.The long wick on Dec. 22 candlestick shows that bulls purchased the dip to the 20-day EMA ($299). However, they could not build up on the rebound and renewed selling by the bears today has pushed Bitcoin Cash (BCH) below the 20-day EMA.If the bears sink and sustain the price below the 50-day SMA ($281), the BCH/USD pair could drop to $250. The bulls may try to defend the zone between $230 and $250 and if they succeed, a strong rebound is likely.However, the bears will try to stall any relief rally at the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the price may turn down and break below $230, which could result in a fall to the next critical support at $200.Chainlink (LINK) bounced off the uptrend line on Dec. 22 but the bulls could not push the price above the moving averages. This suggests that bears are attempting to defend the 20-day EMA ($12.87).The LINK/USD pair has currently slipped below the uptrend line, which suggests a possible change in trend. There is a minor support at $11.29 but if this level cracks, the pair may drop to $10.The RSI has dipped below 43 and the 20-day EMA has started to turn down, which suggests that the momentum is shifting in favor of the bears.This negative view will be invalidated if the pair rebounds off the immediate support and rises above $13.28. Such a move will suggest that traders are accumulating at lower levels.Binance Coin (BNB) dipped to the 20-day EMA ($30.88) on Dec. 22 but aggressive buying at lower levels propelled the price back above $33.3888. However, the bulls could not build upon this rebound and the price had again dropped to the 20-day EMA today.If the bulls can keep the price above $32, the BNB/USD pair could trade in a tight range between $32 and $35.4338 for a few days.A break above $35.4338 could resume the uptrend and open the doors for a rally to the all-time high at $39.5941. The upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls have the upper hand.Contrary to this assumption, if the price breaks below the 20-day EMA, the pair may drop to the 50-day SMA ($29.50) and get stuck inside the $32 to $25.6652 range.The bulls pushed Cardano (ADA) back above the 20-day EMA ($0.153) on Dec. 22 but they could not sustain the higher levels. This suggests that every minor relief rally is attracting selling by the bears.The sellers will now try to sink the price to the critical support of the range at $0.13. As bulls had purchased the dip to this support on two previous occasions, they may again try to defend the level.If they succeed, the ADA/USD pair could extend its stay inside the $0.13 to $0.175 range for a few more days.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink and sustain the price below $0.13, the trend could turn in favor of the bears, and a drop to $0.12 and then to $0.11 may be on the cards.Polkadot (DOT) rebounded off the 50-day SMA ($4.93) on Dec. 22 but the bulls have not been able to build upon the recovery, which shows traders are selling on rallies. The flat moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.If the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA and the $4.43 support, the DOT/USD pair could drop to the bottom half of the large $3.53 to $5.60 range.The bulls are likely to buy the drop to the $3.80 to $3.53 support zone and a strong bounce off it could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days.On the contrary, if the price turns up from the current levels and rises above $5.60, a new uptrend could start. There is a minor resistance at $6.0857. But if this level is crossed, the up-move may reach $6.8619.Stellar Lumens (XLM) broke below the 20-day EMA ($0.166) on Dec. 21 and the 50-day SMA ($0.14) today. However, the long tail on today’s candlestick shows that bulls are buying aggressively at lower levels.If the price rebounds off $0.14, the XLM/USD pair may move up to the 20-day EMA where it is likely to face resistance. The 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI has dropped into the negative zone indicating advantage to the bears.If the pair dips and sustains below $0.14, it will complete a descending triangle pattern that could intensify selling and pull the price down to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement at $0.11535 and then to $0.083684.This negative view will be invalidated if the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA and the downtrend line.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

178,"Bitcoin (BTC) kept the volatility coming on Dec. 23 as a dive to $22,800 sparked a lightning-fast rally to classic $24,000 resistance.Data from Cointelegraph Markets, Coin360 and TradingView tracked BTC/USD as factors including panic among XRP traders made unstable conditions prevail.At press time, the pair was circling $23,700 after briefly heading above sell levels at $24,000. All this happened in the same few hours, which saw Bitcoin go from current levels to $22,800 in a matter of minutes and back again.With volatility firmly evident, attention turned to the prospects for altcoins as problems at Ripple sent BTC dominance soaring to one-year highs.""Historically, we've been making a top structure in December, after which we had a wonderful first quarter for altcoins,"" Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe commented to Twitter followers on Bitcoin dominance action.Meanwhile, the biggest XRP holder, Ripple, is facing a new lawsuit from U.S. regulators over potential sales of unlicensed securities. Should the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) win its case, analysts worry that XRP trading will be effectively destroyed due to the legal ramifications.As Van de Poppe implied, Bitcoin's advance came at the expense of altcoins more widely, with various top-ten tokens seeing daily losses. The largest altcoin, Ether (ETH), was flat on the day at $611.Earlier today, Cointelegraph noted that a major stockpiling effort from institutional giant Grayscale failed to buoy market mood after the company added $285 million in BTC to its assets under management on Tuesday."
179,"A privately held exchange has launched on the Binance Cloud platform for the first time.Mandala says its goal is to deliver enhanced trading depth, security and transaction speeds to users — enabling them to trade cryptocurrency with confidence.This is coupled with a “unique focus on compliance” that will bring cryptocurrencies to the masses, with an ecosystem tailored to passionate beginners and institutional investors alike.In explaining why launching on the Binance Cloud was so significant, Mandala’s chief technology officer Zach Daniels said: “Binance allows us to take advantage of not only their liquidity and technology, but their development resources, as well. Through our relationship, we’ll be able to offer low fees, innovative features and a sustainable ability to grow alongside our user base.”According to Mandala, its team performs regular penetration testing to highlight areas of improvement within its infrastructure, and this is complemented by a bug bounty program that ensures security vulnerabilities can be detected as early as possible. A two-step verification system is also offered for all accounts as standard.Hundreds of digital assets are available through the exchange, not to mention an industry-leading matching engine. And as mainstream adoption continues to grow — with institutions beginning to explore Bitcoin for the first time in greater numbers — fiat-to-crypto liquidity ramps will make it easy for first timers to gain exposure to this maturing market.“Currently, the Mandala platform is set to host 264 assets creating 946 pairs available for trade immediately upon launch with high levels of liquidity on every order book,” the team recently revealed in an update for its community.Mandala also offers apps on Google Play and Apple’s App Store, enabling account owners to execute trades and monitor the latest market activity while they’re on the move.Users who register with the platform benefit from an at-a-glance look at how top cryptocurrencies are performing — and can effortlessly access technical charts that show how major trading pairs have fluctuated over a timeline of their choosing. Traders can also gauge how Bitcoin is performing against dozens of altcoins — enabling them to spot opportunities for new positions they can enter.Founded in 2020, Mandala has big ambitions to become a household name in the digital asset marketplace — and build trust among its users. As Deloitte recently noted, trust is essential to overturning the “generally pessimistic view of crypto assets and exchanges alike,” and making consumers from all budgets and backgrounds feel welcome.To stand out from the crowd, the exchange has also confirmed that it will allow up-and-coming projects to list their assets through the Mandala exchange, with COO Rich Howe revealing that a number of applications are already under consideration.A new token called MDX has also been established that allows owners to benefit from advanced order types on Mandala that aren’t available to other users. This asset also unlocks access to trading bots that can fulfill orders automatically, social trading features, and a reduction in transaction fees based on how much MDX they have locked in their wallet — in some cases as low as 0.05%.“Our social network and marketplace will allow users to share investing insights, compare strategies and develop followings,” a video setting out the benefits of MDX explained.Disclaimer.

180,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell by almost $1,000 in under an hour on Dec. 23 as spot markets refused to buy fresh good news from institutional investors.Data from Cointelegraph Markets, Coin360 and TradingView showed a surprise bearish trading session for Bitcoin on Wednesday, which hit local lows of $22,800.It took less than 60 minutes for BTC/USD to descend from highs of $23,718, reaffirming volatility as a feature of the current landscape as well as the selling pressure surrounding $24,000.At press time, the pair circled $23,000 as the market took a brief respite to determine direction before Wall Street opened.The move contrasts with bullish accumulation continuing from institutional quarters, with Grayscale adding more BTC to its assets under management on Tuesday than the entire previous week combined. That week-long accumulation, although lower, still witnessed a new all-time high for Bitcoin.Grayscale added 12,319 BTC ($284.5 million) on Tuesday, while last week’s tally was 11,512 BTC ($266.1 million). For context, Bitcoin miners are currently able to release around 28,000 BTC per month in block rewards.“Bad news for Bitcoin bears,” analyst Kevin Rooke commented on Grayscale’s continued commitment to Bitcoin buy-ins.As Cointelegraph reported, MicroStrategy, which now owns over 70,000 BTC, reportedly did not move the market with lump-sum buying last week when it upped its reserves by $650 million.Wednesday, meanwhile, saw further signs of fresh institutional deals, with Coinbase seeing a sudden large outflow in what one analyst suspected was another over-the-counter purchase.“12,006 $BTC flowed out from Coinbase a few hours ago. As I said, it went to custody-looked-like wallets,” Ki Young Ju, CEO of on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, tweeted."
181,"Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, is listing another batch of fan tokens by a major sports-focused token platform, Chiliz.According to a Dec. 23 announcement, Binance Launchpool — a platform allowing users to stake tokens for up to 30 days to earn rewards — will soon feature three more sports fan tokens: Dota 2 esports team OG, Atlético de Madrid Football (ATM), and AS Roma Football Club (ASR).As part of the new allocations, Binance users will be able to stake Binance Coin (BNB), Binance Dollar (BUSD), and Chiliz (CHZ) against OG, ATM and ASR fan tokens starting from Dec. 24 up to Jan. 23, 2021.Starting from Dec. 30, Binance will also list OG, ATM and ASR in its Innovation Zone and open trading against major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether (USDT). The upcoming trading pairs include OG/BTC, OG/USDT, ATM/BTC, ATM/USDT, ASR/BTC and ASR/USDT.Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said that traditional sports and esports industries are more actively exploring and engaging in the crypto industry. “Fan tokens have been well-received by our users, and we are happy to work closer with Chiliz to continue providing access to them,” Zhao added.The latest development brings the second phase of the collaboration between Binance and Chiliz after the two companies announced a strategic partnership on Dec. 14. In conjunction with the announcement, Binance announced the listing of Chiliz fan tokens for Paris Saint Germain (PSG) and Juventus (JUV) football clubs on its Binance Launchpool.Alexandre Dreyfus, CEO and founder of Chiliz and its affiliate startup Socios, said that the companies expect to add “many more partners from the sports and entertainment space in the near future.” Dreyfus noted that the collaboration intends to boost the industry’s digital transformation, fan engagement and monetization ecosystem.Chiliz and Socios have been actively expanding their leadership as global fan token providers. In August 2020, Chiliz and Socios announced plans to launch a Visa debit card featuring fan tokens for major teams like FC Barcelona. In July 2020, Brazil’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Mercado Bitcoin, launched CHZ trading against the Brazilian real. Previously, Chiliz and Socios sold $1.3 million worth of FC Barcelona’s fan tokens in less than two hours."
182,"A recently published survey by the cryptocurrency exchange platform Independent Reserve shows nearly 20% of young adults in Australia own virtual currencies in 2020.According to the 2020 edition of the Independent Reserve Cryptocurrency Index (IRCI), Australia’s general crypto sentiment improved significantly compared to 2019. Indeed, figures from the IRCI survey put the 2020 crypto index at 47, a gain of over 10% from its previous value of 42, published in the 2019 reportThe survey, which covered 1,100 respondents saw across different demographics, saw almost 20% reporting that they owned cryptocurrencies. Participants between the ages of 25 to 44 were the most likely to acknowledge holding one crypto or the other. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Australia’s crypto sector experienced significant growth in 2020. Unsurprisingly, the IRCI showed Bitcoin (BTC) as the most popular virtual currency in Australia with over 88% of respondents declaring that they were aware of the largest crypto by market capitalization. The report also showed equal BTC awareness among men and women but men were three times more likely to know about altcoins than women.Indeed, the IRCI survey also revealed a growing disparity in crypto adoption between men and women. While the ratio was two-to-one in 2019, the cryptocurrency ownership proportion has doubled and is now four-to-one between males and females.COVID-19 also seems to have played some role in shaping the crypto sentiment in Australia throughout 2020. Figures from the IRCI survey show 34% of respondents did not buy cryptocurrencies due to the economic uncertainties driven by the pandemic.Young adults in Australia also seem to be having positive expectations for Bitcoin in the coming years. Over 40% of respondents aged 25 to 34 relayed optimism about increasing crypto adoption in the future.Despite bullish price outlooks for Bitcoin dominating the wider crypto discourse, the IRCI report indicated a more muted expectation among young adult Australians, most of whom predict BTC will be below $30,000 by 2030. In contrast, respondents above 45 were more inclined to offer a price forecast above $30,000 in the next decade.The year-on-year improvement in crypto sentiment indicated by the IRCI is part of the generally favorable 2020 for the industry in 2020. Apart from strict regulations against privacy coins, the government has shown a positive disposition towards cryptocurrencies and blockchain during the year."
183,"Just two days after filing a Form D exemption with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Anthony Scaramucci’s hedge fund, Skybridge Capital, has launched its proposed Bitcoin (BTC) fund.In a Dec. 23 interview on the Yahoo Finance channel, Scaramucci claimed that the effective registration with the SEC had now been completed and the fund had been started with $25 million of SkyBridge’s own capital.The fund will be opened to accredited investors on Jan. 4, with a minimum subscription of $50,000, although Scaramucci claimed that the company was already putting together a “nice book” of preliminary orders.In the interview Scaramucci claimed that SkyBridge is trying to “democratize the hedge-fund industry,” and that “Bitcoin is still somewhat difficult to buy.”He followed this by praising Grayscale, which offers a fund providing easy Bitcoin exposure for institutional investors and currently holds over half a million Bitcoin.However, the SkyBridge fund will be cheaper, he explained, charging an annual fee of 0.75% against Grayscale’s 2%. It will also trade at the net asset value of Bitcoin rather than the 20-30% premium seen with Grayscale, Scaramucci claimed. The fund will rely on Fidelity Digital Assets for custody of the Bitcoin. Scaramucci pointed out Bitcoin’s attribute as a store of value, and drew a comparison between its current $440 billion market cap and gold’s $10 trillion, saying:"
184,"Over the past year, many prominent and colorful crypto personalities have been apprehended and arrested. From the jailing of antivirus pioneer John McAfee to the laying of charges against executives from one of the world’s largest exchanges, 2020 didn’t exactly shake off crypto’s reputation as a honeypot for criminals.Over the first 10 months of 2020, blockchain forensics company CipherTrace estimates that losses from thefts, hacks and frauds totaled a whopping $1.8 billion, a figure fueled in part by the rise of various DeFi platforms.The report suggests that 2020 is on track to record the second-highest value in losses linked to cryptocurrency crimes, trailing 2019, when proceeds of those crimes exceeded $4.5 billion.Let’s take a closer look at some of the highest-profile figures embroiled in legal issues this year.On Oct. 1, the United States Department of Justice filed criminal charges against BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes, as well as three of his associates for violating the Bank Secrecy Act. Compounding their problems, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed a civil enforcement action against Hayes and his company for flouting AML regulations.The Hong Kong resident has been missing in action in public since and is yet to resurface. But in a stroke of good fortune for Hayes, he might not be compelled to face the music anytime soon, as the U.S. and Hong Kong have suspended their extradition agreements in light of the recent political turmoil there.The DoJ alleged that BitMEX had been engaged in a variety of shady activities and had weak Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer policies that could easily be misused by third-party actors.BitMEX was also accused of operating a complex international corporate structure, with offices in premium international destinations such as New York and Hong Kong while claiming to be registered and based out of Seychelles.After the news broke, BitMEX announced the departure of Hayes as the company CEO, along with chief technical officer Samuel Reed and the head of business development Greg Dwyer.Prominent cryptocurrency exchange OKEx copped a lot of flak after it suspended crypto withdrawals on Oct. 16, effectively barring customers from taking out their crypto holdings.Reports surfaced that the suspension was related to the exchange’s Chinese co-founder Mingxing “Star” Xu being arrested by local authorities — although the exchange vigorously denied that was the issue.After being unreachable for more than 30 days, Xu finally made a media appearance on WeChat on Nov. 19. He revealed that he’d been assisting relevant authorities investigating OK Group’s “backdoor listing in 2017,” in which the exchange had sought to partner with an “undisclosed third-party entity” to make its offerings available to clients all over the world. Xu indicated that after having looked at his prior business engagements, investigators had finally clarified the matter and given him the all-clear.After a month, OKEx finally reenabled crypto withdrawals on Nov 27.Tech savant, crypto evangelist and eccentric millionaire John McAfee has been leading the crypto hype train for what feels like time immemorial now. In 2017, he famously proclaimed that within 36 months, Bitcoin would hit a price of $1 million or he’d “eat my d--- on national television.” He retracted his statement earlier this year to the relief of most people.McAfee was detained in Barcelona by local authorities in October regarding tax evasion charges levied by the U.S. government against him. He was also charged over fraudulently promoting a series of questionable cryptocurrency projects, from which he allegedly profited millions of dollars.Prosecutors claim that McAfee failed to file his tax returns for four years running, even while he raked in millions of dollars from his consulting work, speaking engagements, digital currency investments, etc. According to a statement released by the U.S. Justice Department, McAfee illegally siphoned his income from various bank accounts and cryptocurrency exchange accounts in the names of different nominees. He is also accused of not declaring a number of expensive assets, including a yacht and real estate.This is not the first time McAfee has been in trouble with the law. Back in 2012, his name was linked with the death of his neighbor, Florida businessman Gregory Faull. In 2019, he was ordered to pay $25 million in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the estate, but refused, saying: If convicted of the new charges, he could face up to 30 years in prison.Spanish national Santiago Fuentes was the operator of a cryptocurrency arbitrage firm called Arbistar that had tens of thousands of users investing Bitcoin (BTC) into its arbitrage trading bot. Blockchain investigations firm Tulip Research reported that since its inception, the firm had raised more than $1 billion in Bitcoin.Suspicions arose in September when Fuentes claimed that due to a “digital error,” Arbistar’s native trading module had been somehow disabled, wiping out more than a quarter of the company’s funds overnight.In the course of their investigations, Spanish authorities determined that Fuentes had been making use of his crypto outfit to allegedly facilitate various financial frauds and to launder money. Tulip Research traced back some of Arbistar’s withdrawal activity to a deep-web marketplace called Hydra.Fuentes was arrested in October and has been charged with financial fraud and money laundering. On Dec. 13, lawyers representing 130 former clients said they’d lost 4 million euros ($4.86M) among them, with Spanish media suggesting that in total, 32,000 people had lost 93.4 million euros ($113.5M).The 44-year-old Shasta County, California man was arrested by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation on Nov 16. while trying to flee from authorities using a sea scooter.Local media outlets reported that Piercey was able to evade agents for over an hour by first speeding off in a truck and then abandoning the vehicle on the edge of Lake Shasta, where he used a sea scooter — an underwater mobile device that can typically reach a maximum speed of 4 mph — to continue to evade police underwater for 25 minutes. He was arrested when he emerged.Police allege that Piercey solicited $35 million for crypto mining and other investments through Family Wealth Legacy LLC and Zolla Financial LLC.The two firms reportedly targeted wealthy investors, obtaining a minimum of $50,000 from each client. However, Piercey reportedly admitted that he had little to no understanding of cryptocurrencies.He reportedly spent $2.5 million of the obtained money via his schemes on renovating two of his homes and paying off his credit card bills. He is now currently facing multiple charges of wire fraud, mail fraud, money laundering and witness-tampering. If found guilty, Piercey could face life in prison.Over the years, Sydney-based socialite and concert promoter Harpreet Sahni had built a reputation as a man who regularly rubbed shoulders with Australia’s elites, including ex-Prime Ministers Tony Abbott and Julia Gillard, former Premier of New South Wales Mike Baird, and former cricketer Glenn McGrath.But in October, Indian police authorities claimed that Sahni and his close aides had allegedly swindled around $50 million from clients. He was promoting a scheme called “Plus Gold Union Coin” (PGUC), which promised to deliver profits ranging between $5,000 and $8,000 per day to backers.Investors who tipped around $7,000 in PGUC were told they could potentially rake in more than $100,000 within a year. Investors had to lock into a 12-month contract during which they couldn’t cash out their crypto holdings. However, as PGUC’s popularity grew, token holders began to grow suspicious.The PGUC website would go offline for weeks at a time and when the currency plummeted, there was no way for investors to minimize their losses or withdraw their assets. The invested money — estimated to be around $50 million — disappeared, with all correspondence stopped with clients.Sahni now faces roughly 24 years in prison and is awaiting his sentencing.The U.S. Department of Homeland Security identified Dublin-based IT professional Conor Freeman as the man behind a theft involving more than $2 million worth of crypto. He was arrested by Homeland Security officials on Nov. 16 and forced to hand over more than 142 Bitcoin.Freeman was reportedly working with a group able to gain access to the email addresses and phone numbers of victims via various social media platforms. They also had contacts inside the telecom industry who enabled them to initiate sophisticated SIM-swap attacks.That’s where a scam artist is able to obtain a SIM card that is directly linked to their victim’s mobile number, enabling them to gain access to an individual’s 2FA messages and one-time passwords that are used to validate identities and approve larger financial transactions.Freeman pleaded guilty to stealing cryptocurrencies worth $1.92 million from Emmy award-winner Seth Shapiro — producer of Game Changers and The Chosen One — as well as illegally obtaining an additional $250,000 from two other victims, Michael Templeman and Darran Marble.Earlier this year in July, Chinese police took 109 people into custody in connection with the PlusToken Ponzi scheme. Among them, 27 were allegedly the scheme’s masterminds — including Chen Bo, Luu Jianghua, Lu Jianghua, Lu Qinghai, Jin Xinghai, Wang Yin and Zhang Qin — while the remaining 82 people arrested held smaller roles within the organization.The PlusToken scam raked in an estimated $5.7 billion from more than 2 million investors. Based out of China, the project presented itself as being a cryptocurrency wallet that provided high returns if users purchased PLUS tokens with either BTC or Ether (ETH).In 2019, key members moved large amounts of crypto out of the platform, with 25,000 BTC sent to various addresses, including Bitcoin mixers between February and March, and in June, 789,534 ETH was transferred from the firm’s coffers. However, by the end of the year, the entire scheme had been exposed, and by July 2020, the project had been taken down by Chinese police.In November, the Jiangsu Yancheng Intermediate People’s Court revealed that authorities had confiscated 194,775 BTC, 833,083 ETH, 487 million XRP, 79,581 Bitcoin Cash (BCH), 1.4 million Litecoin (LTC), 27.6 million EOS, 74,167 Dash, 6 billion Dogecoin (DOGE) and 213,724 Tether (USDT) — estimated to be worth $4 billion. Earlier this month, Chen Bo and 13 of his co-conspirators were sentenced to jail terms ranging from two to 11 years."
185,"As Bitcoin (BTC) price tested the $17,580 low on Dec. 11, investors remained relatively calm despite some analysts issuing bearish estimates. Last week’s trading may have finished at the same level where it started, but the fundamentals for Bitcoin have become even stronger.Each time Bitcoin makes a new high, investors expect some form of correction. Despite failing to break through the $24,000 resistance, the price quickly bounced from its sub- $22,000 dip on Dec. 21. This event might have given sellers some hope, but looking under the hood, there is not a single sign of weakness sign.In the past week, Bitcoin dominance continued to gain as it climbed from 64.3% to 67.3%. This move was aided by the Dubai-based financial advisory firm deVere Group's $46,000 prediction for 2021. Moreover, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) surpassed $1.3 billion of futures contracts. This creates indisputable evidence of the growing institutional participation in BTC markets.This news appears to have given further confidence to investors, causing Bitcoin to reach a new $24,300 all-time high on Dec. 20.In the past week, Bitcoin outperformed the top-15 altcoins, which climbed 7.7% on average. More importantly, the volume from altcoins has been disappointing compared to Bitcoin's 50% increase. This indicator strengthens the recent dominance performance, as does BTC establishing $22,500 as a new support.Crypto fund manager Grayscale Investments also continued to aggressively add BTC to their portfolio which now contains $13.3 billion in Bitcoin.Over the past week, 11,620 BTC were added, totaling 576,650 BTC. Therefore, it was another excellent week for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Similar excitement can be seen by analyzing the fund's premium over the effective BTC held by each share, which currently sits at 0.00095064 BTC.As shown above, the premium increased from 18% to 40% in the past seven days. This extraordinary level can be partially explained by a temporary suspension of new shares being issued.Albeit unusual, a similar move occurred six months ago. By halting the offer to institutional clients, any additional demand needs to be met by secondary sales, thus creating pressure for a larger premium.Perpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate that is usually charged every eight hours. Funding rates ensure there are no exchange risk imbalances. Even though both buyers and sellers' open interest is matched at all times, the leverage can vary.When buyers (longs) are the ones demanding more leverage, the funding rate turns positive. Therefore, the buyers will be the ones paying up the fees. This issue holds especially true during bull runs, when there is usually more demand for longs.Sustainable rates above 2% per week translate to extreme optimism. This level is acceptable during market rallies but problematic if the BTC price is sideways or in a downtrend.In situations like these, high leverage from buyers increases the likelihood of large liquidations when the price drops abruptly.Take notice how, despite Bitcoin's weakness on Dec. 21, the weekly funding rate managed to avoid the negative territory. This data indicates that both short (sell) and long (buy) traders use roughly the same leverage.This is a neutral reading, as both sides have powder left to increase their bets.Data from TheTie also shows that a recent BTC price increase occurred while tweets related to ‘Bitcoin’ reached the highest level seen since Dec. 2017. Despite the recent correction on the social activity indicator, the current level remains 10% higher than the previous month.While a significant bump in Twitter activity does not necessarily equal vigorous retail buying it certainly helps to gather more attention as the cryptocurrency continues its uptrend.The best way to gauge overall market sentiment is to measure whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options. Generally speaking, call options are used for bullish strategies, whereas put options are for bearish ones.A 0.70 put-to-call ratio indicates that put options open interest lag the more bullish calls by 30% and is therefore bullish.In contrast, a 1.20 indicator favors put options by 20%, which can be deemed bearish. One thing to note is that the metric aggregates the entire BTC options market, including all calendar months.As Bitcoin price broke $20,000, investors rushed to seek downside protection. As a result, the put-to-call ratio peaked at 1.08 on Dec. 19. The very unusual level favoring the more neutral-to-bearish strategies reverted soon after, as the indicator returned to 0.60.This shows that investors optimism was not harmed by the 10% price correction that followed the $24,200 all-time high.Overall, each of the indicators discussed have quickly returned to a neutral-to-bullish range and this relatively positive given that the market recently tested a $21,910 low.As BTC holds above $22,500, investors are quickly regaining their confidence whilend the consistent bounces back from each dip are a positive sign.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

186,"Bitcoin (BTC) has won over a number of mainstream financial gurus in 2020 against the backdrop of a difficult year for the United States economy. Some markets experts, such as Dennis Gartman, however, still remain skeptical of the digital asset. Gold and Bitcoin are not really equivalent, according to Gartman’s Tuesday interview with Bloomberg. “Gold has been around for thousands of years, Bitcoin has been around for 20 years,” he said. Gartman put out a financial commentary series for 30 years, called The Gartman Letter.Bitcoin has not been around for 20 years though. The asset’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, published the written framework for Bitcoin in 2008, and the asset officially launched on the web in 2009.“Bitcoin is the millennials’ gold.I understand that, I get that,” Gartman said. “I will never understand Bitcoin as far as being able to buy it at $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 — I shall leave that for people who are wiser, smarter or more courageous than am I.”As many have projected before him, Gartman believes Bitcoin’s price will eventually falter. “I fear that once, in the not-too-distant future, the monetary authorities, the various central banks around the world, are going to refuse to give up their monopoly on monetary policy and will walk in one day and Bitcoin has been rendered zero,” he said, adding:Gartman showed no hard feelings against Bitcoin market participants though, simply explaining that he prefers gold over the digital coin. He also mentioned Bitcoin’s limited supply and the arguments for the asset’s expected price rise as a result. “Now, there’s what, 7,000 various cryptocurrencies out there,” he added, positing:On the opposite side of Gartman’s sentiment, 2020 has hosted a growing trend of traditional financial players allocating capital to Bitcoin."
187,"As anyone following the crypto industry will have noticed, yes, Bitcoin (BTC) did recently smash its previous all-time high of around $20,000. Now, many analysts anticipate the cryptocurrency to eventually rise to the mid-$30,000s or even higher within the next few years.As things stand, BTC is trading at around $23,300, briefly testing the $24,000 mark on several occasions. However, despite all of these positive developments, many prominent individuals from the financial mainstream have spoken negatively about the crypto industry, using cliche adages — such as “crypto is for criminals” and “crypto is all hype, no substance,” etc. — to describe BTC and other prominent digital currencies.For example, renowned economist and financial strategist David Rosenberg recently referred to Bitcoin as a “massive bubble,” propping up the argument by saying that the supply curve of Bitcoin is unknown even though some people claim to know otherwise. Similarly, Mark Cuban, who is generally quite open-minded in regard to various futuristic technologies, also bashed Bitcoin, claiming that it is “more religion than solution.” However, he did concede that despite its shortcomings, it may be useful as a store of value.And while crypto tech is far from perfect — admittedly being many years away from replacing legacy financial instruments such as fiat — the aforementioned opinions may seem to come across as the ramblings of annoyed traditionalists who fail to see the immense potential of the technology.As soon as Bitcoin broke the $20,000 mark, it was inevitable that analysts from across the board would seek to use the “this bull run is the same as 2017” argument to undermine the financial traction being gained by the industry as a whole.In this regard, “CryptoYoda,” an independent cryptocurrency analyst, pointed out to Cointelegraph that one can see that the fearful perspective provided by the financial mainstream stems from a lack of understanding of the technology. As such, he believes that what is happening right now is a shift from debt-based fiat currency to trustless financial systems:In a similar line of thinking, Jason Lau, chief operating officer of OKCoin, told Cointelegraph that it’s safe to say that the long-looming promise of mainstream players entering the crypto space has finally been fulfilled. In his view, this ongoing bull run has been driven by traditional financial institutions buying Bitcoin price dips as an investment and treasury product: “They have a long term strategy for these assets. So with increased demand, HODLing, and fewer block rewards due to the recent halving, the price may have no limits.”Additionally, another major difference between the ongoing cycle and the one witnessed before is that back in 2017, the industry was in the midst of a feverish initial coin offering craze, with the bubble duly bursting within just a few month’s time, resulting in the entire crypto economy crashing almost overnight.According to Adam O’Neill, chief marketing officer of Bitrue — a digital-asset management platform — these days, people in crypto are much more pragmatic, adding: “Publicly-listed companies like MicroStrategy and PayPal have come on board, and the growth of the CME Bitcoin Futures market indicates increased demand for regulated exposure.”It is no secret that despite its bullish outlook, a certain degree of uncertainty in regard to BTC’s value still exists, as was made clear in November when the price of the flagship cryptocurrency dipped by $3,000 within a span of just 24 hours. That being said, it is unfair to compare BTC, which is just over a decade old, to legacy systems that have been around for more than a hundred years.So, it’s worth exploring the true meaning of the term “safe haven,” especially as the world struggles with COVID-19-induced financial destruction. CryptoYoda believes that while precious metals like gold and silver certainly are tangible stores of value, they are not very practical — i.e., they are difficult to store, transport, secure, etc. He added:O’Neill believes that while it may not be fair to compare Bitcoin to traditional stores of value, in recent times, the world’s leading cryptocurrency appears to be shouldering that expectation quite well. In his view, the digital-gold narrative is incredibly strong within the community, with a lot of people truly believing in the technology and actively working to make Bitcoin more valuable, whether by running nodes, mining, writing and reviewing code, or HODLing it.Additionally, it’s also important to recognize how far Bitcoin has come in relation to various legacy financial systems, with an increasing number of mainstream investors now looking to enter the domain. Providing his insights on the matter, Yoni Assia, founder and CEO of eToro — a social trading and multiasset brokerage company — told Cointelegraph that crypto is no longer just the domain of computer programmers and fintech advocates, adding: “We expect this to continue into 2021 as fears of inflation continue to creep up globally.”While crypto stands to completely redefine the way in which the global financial ecosystem works, it still faces many pertinent issues that need to be ironed out. For example, over the first 10 months of 2020 alone, losses from cryptocurrency thefts, hacks and frauds amounted to a whopping $1.8 billion, according to blockchain forensics company CipherTrace. The company even suggested that 2020 was on track to record the second-highest value in losses linked to crypto crimes, exceeding $4.5 billion.Furthermore, due to regulatory uncertainty, crypto continues to be used by certain sections of society as a means of tax evasion. For example, the United States Justice Department recently indicted John McAfee, an antivirus software creator and crypto proponent, accusing him of tax fraud worth millions of dollars linked to his crypto proceeds between 2014 to 2018. Furthermore, CryptoYoda believes that in its current state, the industry is far from perfect, adding:That being said, fiat currencies are also used by criminals; however, in such scenarios, the “fiat is for criminals” argument is never drawn out. For example, according to a recent BBC report, HSBC allowed tech-savvy scamsters to transfer millions of dollars around the world even after it had learned of their ploy.The leaked documents claim HSBC moved around $80 million through its U.S. business to its accounts in Hong Kong between 2013 and 2014. What’s even more surprising is that the endeavor kicked off right after the banking institution was fined a whopping $1.9 billion in the U.S. over money laundering charges. Other reports have also suggested that banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Standard Chartered have too been implicated in moving some $2 trillion of “dirty money” between 1999 and 2017.So, it seems that both the traditional and crypto worlds only manage to see the speck in their brother’s eye but not the log in their own. Furthermore, since there are fewer well-known advocates for crypto in comparison with traditional finance, it’s of no surprise that the aspiring blockchain sector is losing out on the media spin war. As a result, many common misconceptions continue to seep into the consciousness of the masses, ultimately damaging the perception and delaying the adoption of the technologies."
188,"Following record price highs of more than $24,000 per coin, Bitcoin (BTC) has consolidated, retracing slightly in price. The asset might have stalled for now, but the future remains bullish according to TradingView general manager, Pierce Crosby. ""Right now, I see very near-term headwinds for Bitcoin,” Crosby said, adding:Bitcoin cracked its 2017 all-time price high of $19,892 on Dec. 1, 2020 before subsequently retracing more than $1,000. After stabilizing, BTC went on anothe run, slamming through $20,000 and entering price discovery with no historical levels remaining above.Since its latest surge past $24,000, crypto’s largest asset has traded sideways over the last several days after pulling back slightly. In the past, Bitcoin’s cooling periods have sometimes resulted in money flowing into altcoins, creating a period of positive pricing for digital assets other than BTC. Crosby, however, remains unsure about the alt scene.""Altcoins I have less confidence in, especially as the rotation into ‘majors’ happens,” he said. “Majors” refers to the share of cryptocurrencies holding large market caps. “We could expect a rotation back to alts in the spring, but unfortunately for ‘alt lovers,’ Bitcoin is on a stronger footing relatively speaking.""MassMutual and MicroStrategy are two examples of mainstream financial entities jumping on the Bitcoin train, investing large sums of capital."
189,"More and more traditional banks have started announcing support for digital assets as the price of Bitcoin (BTC) continues to make headlines for record-breaking all-time highs. Even major banks like JPMorgan Chase, which previously frowned upon Bitcoin, have taken a newfound interest in the cryptocurrency. Contrary to what Goldman Sachs stated recently, JPMorgan’s strategists have noted that “the price of gold would suffer from a structural flow headwind over the coming years” due to Bitcoin’s growth. While JPMorgan Chase is clearly taking a softer stance on Bitcoin, some leading banks are going a step further by offering clients custody services for digital assets. For example, FV Bank, a Puerto Rico-based digital bank, announced on Dec. 21 that it received permission from the Puerto Rico Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions to provide custody services for all major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ether (ETH), along with support for ERC-20 tokens.Miles Paschini, CEO at FV Bank, told Cointelegraph that the bank will begin offering custody services integrated within its digital platform in early 2021. Both institutional and retail customers will then be able to open an account with fiat and digital asset balances. Paschini added:According to Paschini, FV Bank account holders will be provided cryptocurrency deposit addresses for each digital asset they wish to hold in their accounts. The digital assets will be managed in a secure and insured custodial account linked to the user’s digital bank account. Services will be accessed through online and mobile banking applications.Nitin Agarwal, chief revenue officer at FV Bank, added that there has been great demand over the last few months from the bank’s existing customers to invest in and securely hold digital assets. As such, Agarwal commented that digital assets are proving to be attractive investments to international business, institutional investors and retail customers alike: “I anticipate the convergence of these products will drive growth in the bank for years to come.”Indeed, some major banks including Standard Chartered, DBS Bank of Singapore and BBVA have also added crypto services recently. In October this year, DBS hinted at three new offerings for clients: cryptocurrency trading, custody, and a platform for conducting security token offerings. Three months later, DBS established its cryptocurrency exchange division known as the DBS Digital Exchange.Following this, Standard Chartered bank announced a partnership with United States-based investment management firm Northern Trust to provide institutional custody for Bitcoin starting next year. Spanish bank BBVA also announced in early December trials for its first commercial service for the trading and custody of digital assets. The new service will be offered through BBVA Switzerland, and will make it possible to manage Bitcoin transactions and deposits.Moreover, Swiss banks are preparing to offer digital assets through the Swiss Stock Exchange, also known as SIX, which recently created a new program enabling banks across Switzerland to provide clients access to digital asset-related products and services, set to launch next year.Wayne Trench, CEO of OSL, one of Asia’s leading digital asset platforms and member of BC Technology Group, told Cointelegraph that major players such as DBS, alongside the likes of Fidelity Digital Assets and Standard Chartered, are just a few of the big names that have unveiled custody solutions for digital assets. According to Trench, banks will continue to offer support for digital assets due to demand from the clients of traditional custodians:Trench added that there have also been major regulatory breakthroughs, such as the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission allowing Type 9 licensed asset managers to hold up to 10% in digital assets without additional terms and conditions.According to Paschini, digital assets and cryptocurrencies are a growing investment asset class in addition to a payment and settlement mechanism. As such, he noted that banks would be well-advised to get involved with digital assets, with Bitcoin currently outperforming the stock market.It’s also important to point out the growing interest in digital assets from institutional investors. Not only has this caught the attention of major banks lately, but major hedge funds are taking note. Just this week, Anthony Scaramucci’s multi-billion-dollar hedge fund, SkyBridge Capital, filed a formal application with the United States securities regulator to launch a new Bitcoin fund.While it’s revolutionary that banks and traditional financial institutions are adding support for digital assets, ever-changing compliance and regulatory challenges must also be taken into consideration. This has especially become the case as the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, announced a proposed rule change for virtual currency transactions with unhosted wallets. While the rule is currently a proposal, the change would mean that banks and money services businesses would be required to verify the identity of their customers while submitting reports for CVC transactions that exceed $10,000. In addition, records of CVC transactions over $3,000 would be required when a counterparty uses an unhosted wallet or “otherwise covered” wallet, such as those held at a financial institution not subject to the Bank Secrecy Act.John Jefferies, chief financial analyst at CipherTrace, a blockchain intelligence firm, told Cointelegraph that these proposed rules could impact banks supporting digital assets, noting that compliance should be a top priority:Jefferies added that regulatory agencies have also suggested more extreme repercussions, including fines and jail time, for those who fail to comply with regulations: “This elevates the stakes for banks and others adding cryptocurrency services to their offerings for the first time.”Additionally, a CipherTrace survey conducted in December found that only 22% of bankers and financial investigators feel confident detecting crypto-related payments on their networks, suggesting the need for better risk detection.Paschini, however, remains confident in FV Bank’s newly added support for digital assets. Paschini explained that the company is already subject to strict Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering requirements, along with transaction reporting. Rather than regulations, he believes the main challenge for banks moving forward will be adopting the correct technical infrastructure and protocols."
190,"Bitcoin (BTC) price hit highs above $23,500 on Dec. 22 as Monday’s weakness flipped to see bulls challenge previous levels.Data from Cointelegraph Markets, Coin360 and TradingView show BTC/USD returning to positions lost over the weekend, topping out at $23,625 at publishing time.After plugging $21,800 on Monday, the markets have set a different tone today, with Bitcoin gaining over 5% and adding $1,200 in just six hours.Macro factors combined to support Bitcoin’s appeal, with the United States Congress passing a further $908 billion coronavirus stimulus bill.“Another $900 billion dollar advertisement for Bitcoin,” Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of exchange Gemini, summarized following the vote. Heatmap orderbook data shows that selling pressure at $24,000 and definitive resistance at $25,000 remained, somewhat dampening prospects of a stronger rally toward new all-time highs.At the same time, Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe warned that a dip below $20,000 would not be “surprising” under current conditions.“People are focused on $19,500 for now, and I think this is a very critical level to watch, but I would not be surprised if we dip below $19,500 towards $18,500 to liquidate all the people that have taken longs at that range,” he summarized in a video update on Tuesday.Meanwhile, fresh comments from Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, cast doubt on the idea that the company's huge Bitcoin buy-ins were responsible for last week’s intense upside. Speaking on Funky Crypto Podcast, Saylor said that his purchases came in the form of high-frequency batches of $1,000–$2,000, and not a lump sum. “I was not a green candle. The green candles were other guys,” he revealed.Those “other guys” may not yet be publicly known, according to Rafael Schultze-Kraft, chief technical officer of on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode. In a series of tweets on Monday, Schultze-Kraft argued that big buyers MicroStrategy, Grayscale and others are far from the only ones filling their bags.“Do you really think they’re alone? Of course not,” he wrote."
191,"Huobi Group, the company behind major global crypto exchange Huobi, is apparently planning to return to the United States with a new license secured from local regulators.After ceasing operations in the U.S. in late 2019, Huobi seems to be interested in opening a trust company business in the country. Trusts are companies tasked with managing assets for a group of owners or investors. Grayscale's trusts use this structure to offer cryptocurrency exposure within traditional markets.According to a Dec. 22 announcement by Huobi Technology Holdings, the company’s Nevada-incorporated business Huobi Trust has received a Trust Company License from the Financial Institutions Division of the Department of Business and Industry in Nevada.Lan Jianzhong, executive director of Huobi, noted that Huobi Trust has not yet started providing any related trust services. “Shareholders and potential investors are advised to exercise caution when dealing in the shares of the Company,” Jianzhong wrote in the announcement.Huobi did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request to provide additional information about the development.Huobi US, or HBUS, the operator of United States-based crypto exchange Huobi, officially ceased operations in December 2019. The move came shortly after Huobi Global announced that it would freeze all U.S. client accounts by mid-November. The exchange said that the event was caused by issues related to American regulatory ecosystem.The exchange has been putting effort into tapping new markets over the world in recent years. In November 2020, Huobi Global, Huobi Group's flagship crypto exchange headquartered in Singapore, announced a new entity Huobi Labuan to launch trading services in Malaysia. In August, Huobi announced a wide array of measures to expand its presence in Russia."
192,"Bitcoin (BTC) has wowed investors with all-time highs and year-to-date returns of over 200% — but there are stocks that still beat it.As of Dec. 22, markets' data shows that no fewer than five companies’ stocks have given investors better rewards than a Bitcoin position since the start of 2020.First pitting itself against Bitcoin and winning is an unlikely success story — fitness equipment manufacturer Peloton Interactive.At 384% annual returns, $PTON has delivered significantly thanks (most likely) to lockdowns forcing consumers to work out at home instead of at the gym or outside. The company also offers online fitness classes in a nod to the same market.Peloton remains tiny compared to Bitcoin overall, however, with a market cap of $42.4 billion.Another player keenly benefiting from COVID-19 is biotechnology heavyweight Moderna, one of the companies developing a vaccine for the coronavirus.With its product already being rolled out as of late December 2020, Moderna has emerged as one of the frontrunners when it comes to immunization in the United States.Unsurprisingly, its stock has reacted in kind with year-to-date returns of 619%, giving the company a $54.7 billion market cap.Already a household name this year, Zoom has exploded as the medium of choice for recreating office environments online in 2020.Despite controversies regarding hacks and susceptibility to downtime, Zoom’s software has allowed it to gain a giant $116 billion market cap and annual stock returns of 495%.Should a vaccine give governments confidence to allow physical offices to operate as normal, however, demand for work-from-home conference software could well drop.In one of two entries not strictly tied to the virus, Enphase Energy, a renewable energy management company, has made huge gains this year.The company is still small with a market cap of just $21 billion, but in a formative 12 months, its stock has delivered returns of almost 490%.Like the best-performing stock of 2020 (see below), clean energy forms a popular market sector which is only set to expand despite questions over how far renewables can go in replacing fossil fuels throughout the global economy.This month, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak even launched an energy savings business with its own token, WOZX.It comes as no surprise, but Tesla is by far the best-performing stock of the year, shrugging off any suggestion of a bubble month in, month out.The numbers are dizzying — 850% year-to-date returns, a market cap of nearly $620 billion and most recently an entry into the S&P 500.Compared to Bitcoin’s 218%, $TSLA looks like a unicorn never seen before, but priced in BTC, the stock looks decidedly less parabolic.Elon Musk, its CEO, meanwhile continues to flirt with Bitcoin on social media, sparking wild speculation about a potential buy-in or stock conversion.Zooming out, however, and Bitcoin remains the best-performing asset of the decade. Even at the start of the year, with BTC/USD at $7,200, its supremacy as an investment was undisputed. "
193,"Riot Blockchain, a Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency mining company, has inked another deal with Chinese mining giant Bitmain to buy 15,000 Antminers. According to a Dec. 21 announcement, the Colorado-based firm expects the new purchase will contribute a 65% increase to its total Bitcoin (BTC) mining hash rate.The purchase cost Riot $35 million, comprising of 3,000 S19 Pro Antminers and 12,000 S19j Pro Antminers. The company expects to receive and deploy the new miners starting from May 2021 up to October 2021.With the latest purchase, Riot further expands its total mining equipment from Bitmain, as the company has been regularly receiving and deploying new miners in 2020. At full deployments of more than 37,000 miners, Riot estimates its total operational hash rate to surge from 2.3 EH/s to 3.8 EH/s, consuming about 120 megawatts of energy.Riot CEO Jeff McGonegal said that continued growth in deployed miners is “paramount to a miner’s success,” adding further: “Expanding the Company’s bitcoin mining hash rate and operating on a cost-effective basis is very important, particularly during periods when the bitcoin spot price has appreciably increased.""As part of its partnership with Riot, Bitmain has been consistently delivering its latest Antminers to the United States-based firm. In October 2020, the companies announced a deal for 2,500 Antminer S19 Pro on top of the previous batch of 5,100 Antminers deal and another one for 8,000 Antminers in September.Bitmain, one of the world’s largest crypto hardware suppliers, have been actively tapping the North America market. In September 2020, Bitmain announced that mining operator Core Scientific will become its first North American cooperative repair center. Previously, Bitmain partnered with Foundry, a wholly-owned crypto mining subsidiary of Digital Currency Group. As part of the partnership, Foundry was set to provide financing to Bitmain’s end customers in the market."
194,"CoinDCX, a cryptocurrency exchange based in India, continues to aggressively expand its business with a massive new fundraise.According to a Dec. 21 announcement, CoinDCX has raised $13.9 million from industry investors like Coinbase and Polychain in its Series B funding round. Led by major blockchain software firm Block.one, the new raise also included Singaporean investment firm Temasek, Jump Capital, Uncorrelated Ventures, Mehta Ventures, and Alex Pack.This was CoinDCX’s third round of funding in 2020, bringing the company’s total raised amounts to $19.4 million. In March 2020, CoinDCX raised $3 million in a Series A round from firms like Polychain and BitMEX. The exchange subsequently secured $2.5 million in additional Series A funding from investors like Coinbase and Bain Capital in May.CoinDCX plans to use the newly raised funds to continue driving crypto adoption in India with products like a crypto investment app called CoinDCX Go. The application was launched in public beta on Dec. 10 as part of CoinDCX’s so-called “Try Crypto” program, which aims to onboard 50 million Indians to their crypto services.CoinDCX’s recorded 20% growth in trading volumes and a 12% increase in new customers over the past two quarters. The exchange also saw 21% month on month growth in trading volume in October 2020.Sumit Gupta, CEO and co-founder of CoinDCX, said that CoinDCX tripled its staff from 30 employees in March 2020 to 90 employees in December. “This has been the most exciting year for CoinDCX. While the pandemic forced everyone indoors, CoinDCX scaled up exponentially and continues to do so,” Gupta said.CoinDCX’s solid growth in 2020 further demonstrates that crypto adoption is rising in India after the country's Supreme Court struck down the Reserve Bank of India’s ban on banks providing services to crypto companies. According to a survey by CoinDCX, the majority of Indian investors do not see an “easy way” to access exposure to crypto assets though."
195,"Roughly $2.3 billion worth of Bitcoin futures is set to expire on Christmas day, setting the stage for a volatile week in the cryptocurrency market. In a Monday tweet, crypto data provider Skew reported that 102,200 Bitcoin (BTC) options will expire on Friday.Options contracts allow holders to buy or sell Bitcoin at a specific price, which is known as the strike price. The Friday expiry has notable clusters around the $15,000 strike price and the $20,000 strike price, according to Skew.The expiry date of Bitcoin options contracts is widely regarded as a volatile event for the flagship cryptocurrency because, as the expiry nears, holders adjust their contracts. Traders who are in profit may also decide to receive the payout and dump the cryptocurrency.Such events have been known to cause large fluctuations in Bitcoin’s value. Typically, the impact of a contract on BTC price becomes more apparent roughly one or two days before expiry. Crypto derivatives trading has soared this year as more traders and institutional investors look for added Bitcoin exposure. Last week, crypto derivatives platform Deribit began offering Bitcoin futures with a $100,000 strike price expiring on Sept. 24, 2021. In other words, Bitcoin enthusiasts who think the cryptocurrency will reach a six-figure moonshot can now take that bet in the futures market.Bitcoin is currently in the midst of a bull market that’s being fueled in part by institutional investors and large over-the-counter trades. Even with the anticipated futures volatility, there’s a good chance that Bitcoin will remain well supported by institutional demand and the rise of so-called illiquid wallets — i.e., addresses that have sent less than 25% of the BTC they’ve ever received. Chainanalysis believes illiquid wallets hold 77% of the 14.8 million mined BTC that hasn't been lost."
196,"MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor recently tweeted that he purchased another 29,646 Bitcoin (BTC) at an average price of $29,646. With this purchase, the company has deployed the $650 million raised through a recent convertible debt offering. The business intelligence firm now holds 70,470 Bitcoin and that makes it the fifth-largest individual holder of Bitcoin.The current Bitcoin bull run has largely been driven by institutional investors. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase believe that in order for the uptrend to continue, fresh institutional money needs to keep trickling in as it has done in the past few weeks, or Bitcoin could witness a correction.Every bull phase witnesses several sharp corrections and Bitcoin’s current bull run is likely to be no exception. However, when the main trend is up, investors view dips as a buying opportunity as it allows a low-risk entry point. Therefore, if Bitcoin corrects, several new investors are likely to show interest until its uptrend remains intact.One such hint can be seen from the conversation between Saylor and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Saylor suggested Tesla convert its balance sheet from U.S. dollars to Bitcoin. Musk did not reject the idea but asked whether such a large transaction was possible.As a response, Saylor said that he was willing to share his playbook with Musk so he could see how it is done. If a popular company such as Tesla adopts Bitcoin, it could lead to a rush from several other firms.Let’s look at the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot the critical levels on the upside and the downside.The bulls pushed Bitcoin above $24,000 on Dec. 19 and Dec. 20, but on each of these days, the buyers could not sustain the higher levels. This shows that bears are mounting a stiff resistance in the $24,000 to $25,000 zone.Typically, momentum traders dump their positions when they find that the rally has stalled. That seems to have happened today, which pulled the price down to $21,934.83. However, the long tail on today’s candlestick shows that investors are aggressively buying on dips.Today’s fall has eased the overbought levels on the relative strength index (RSI), which is a positive sign. This means the bulls are likely to try and resume the uptrend. If they succeed, a rally to $26,958 is possible.However, if the price again turns down from the overhead resistance zone, the BTC/USD pair may remain range-bound for a few days. The pair remains in a strong uptrend as long as the price sustains above the critical $20,000 support.A break and close below this support will be the first indication that demand is drying up at higher levels and that the sentiment may be shifting from buying on dips to selling on rallies. Below $20,000, the pair may drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($18,136).Ether (ETH) could not pick up momentum after breaking above the ascending triangle pattern on Dec. 16. The failure to resume the uptrend could have attracted profit booking from short-term traders, which has pulled the price back below the breakout level at $622.807 today.However, the bulls are currently attempting to defend the 20-day exponential moving average ($599). If they succeed, the ETH/USD pair will attempt to resume the uptrend. A break above $676.325 may bring the pattern target of $763.614 back into play.The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is just above 54, which suggests that the up-move is losing momentum. If the bears defend the $660 to $676.325 resistance zone, the pair could enter a consolidation for a few days.Contrary to this assumption, if the price slips below the 20-day EMA and the trendline of the ascending triangle, the advantage could shift in favor of the bears.XRP is currently range-bound between $0.435 and $0.6794. The altcoin turned down from the resistance of the range on Dec. 17 and has broken below the 20-day EMA ($0.543) today.The price could now drop to the $0.435 support where buyers may step in. As the range is well defined with two touches on both the upside and the downside, traders are likely to buy near the support and sell near the resistance.The flat 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint indicate the possibility of a few more days of range-bound action. The XRP/USD pair could start a trending move if the price rises above $0.6794 or slips below $0.435.The uptrend in Litecoin (LTC) hit a wall at $124.1278 on Dec. 19 and the price is currently correcting the most recent leg of the up-move. The bulls are attempting to arrest the pullback at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $101.1868.If they manage to do that, the LTC/USD pair may again rise to $124.1278. If the bulls can drive the price above this resistance, the pair may resume the uptrend and rally to the next target at $140.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below $101.1868, a drop to the 20-day EMA ($91) is possible. A break below this support will signal a possible change in trend.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) surged above $353 on Dec. 20 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. Today again, the altcoin had risen above $353 but the bears aggressively defended the higher levels as seen from the long wick on the candlestick.The bulls are currently attempting to defend the 20-day EMA ($297). If the price rebounds off this support, the bulls will make one more attempt to push and sustain the BCH/USD pair above $353. If they succeed, the pair may start its journey to $500.However, if the bears defend the $338 to $353 resistance zone, the pair could gradually drop to $240 and the pair may spend some more time inside a range before starting the next trending move.Chainlink (LINK) formed a Doji candlestick pattern on three successive days from Dec. 17 to Dec. 19. This showed uncertainty and hesitation among traders to buy at higher levels even though the price had risen above the $13.28 resistance.The failure to move up attracted selling and that dragged the price back below $13.28 on Dec. 20. The bears continued their selling today and the price has plunged below the moving averages.If the bears can sink the price below the uptrend line and the $11.29 support, the LINK/USD pair could drop to $10. Contrary to this assumption if the price rebounds off the uptrend line, the bulls will again try to propel the price above $13.28.Cardano (ADA) had been consolidating in a tight range of $0.16 to $0.17 for the past four days. The price plunged below the support of the range and the 20-day EMA ($0.15) today.The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has dropped to the midpoint, which indicates the bulls have lost their advantage. If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, a drop to $0.13 is possible.If the price rebounds off this support, the ADA/USD pair could remain range-bound for a few more days. The next trending move could start after the bulls push the price above $0.175 or if the bears sink the pair below $0.13.Polkadot (DOT) is range-bound between $5.56 and $3.53. The bulls attempted to push the price above the range on Dec. 17 but failed. The price formed the Doji candlestick pattern on Dec. 18 and 19, which showed indecision among the bulls and the bears.The uncertainty resolved to the downside on Dec. 20 and the DOT/USD pair has seen renewed selling today. The bears are currently attempting to sink the price below the 50-day SMA ($4.9).If they manage to do that, the pair could drop to $4.50 and then to $3.80. The flat 20-day EMA ($5) and the RSI in the negative territory suggest that the advantage is shifting in favor of the bears.This view will be invalidated if the price turns up and rises above the $5.6 to $6.00857 resistance. Such a move will signal the start of a possible uptrend.Binance Coin (BNB) broke above the $25.6652 to $32 range on Dec. 19 and surged to the overhead resistance at $35.4338 on Dec. 20. However, the altcoin could not scale above this level, which has led to profit booking today.The bears are currently attempting to sink the price below the breakout level at $32. If they succeed, the price may again enter a range-bound action.However, if the price rebounds off the current levels, it will suggest that traders are buying at this level as they anticipate it to be the new floor. The bulls may make one more attempt to propel the price above $35.4338.If they are able to do that, the BNB/USD pair could retest the all-time high at $39.5941. Conversely, if the pair again turns down from $35.4338, the pair is likely to drop below $32.Stellar Lumens (XLM) slipped back below the $0.18 support on Dec. 20 and has slipped below the 20-day EMA ($0.170) today. The altcoin could now drop to the $0.14 support where buyers are likely to step in.The flat 20-day EMA and the RSI close to the midpoint suggest a range-bound action for a few days.If the price rebounds off $0.14, the bulls will try to push the price above the downtrend line. If they succeed, the XLM/USD pair may start its journey to $0.231655.However, if the price turns down from the downtrend line, the pair may be at risk of forming a descending triangle pattern that will complete on a break below $0.14.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

197,"Bitcoin (BTC) price has been on a tear in recent months, leading to a new all-time high at $24,200. However, BTC saw a correction on Dec. 21 as the equity markets also opened in the red. Bitcoin’s price dropped by 6% on Monday, while the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) saw a strong bounce.Such drops and uncertainty appear to be due to the reported emergence of a mutated coronavirus strain in the United Kingdom and, therefore, more restrictions on the horizon, which could have a big impact on the markets, as seen in March.On the 4-hour chart, a bearish divergence shows the breakdown from $24,000 to Monday's lows of $22,000.However, zooming out, this is still significantly higher than Bitcoin’s price three months ago, while such corrections are very common in both bull and bear markets.Therefore, such dips shouldn’t catch experienced traders by surprise. In that regard, the levels to watch are shown in the chart above. But for the bearish divergence to confirm, Bitcoin’s price should reject the previous area of resistance.If that rejects at $23,400 to $23,600, more downside is on the table and the higher time frame levels will be tested as support. However, if this $23,400–$23,600 region breaks to the upside, a new all-time high before the year's end is likely.The only level to watch for Bitcoin at this point is the area around $18,500. This weekly level has many confluences around the previous all-time high and is the last region of consolidation.On the daily time frame, the recent higher low is found at $17,500. In other words, Bitcoin’s price has to sustain above this level on the daily time frame to remain bullish.Interestingly enough, based on the weekly chart, a drop toward $12,000 would still give a bullish outlook to the chart. However, such a correction would be significantly larger than any standard 20% to 40% bull market correction. But even such a severe 50% drop would not necessarily break the bull market cycle and would present a great ""buy the dip"" opportunity.The DXY index is seeing a slight bounce at the beginning of this week, fueled by the previously mentioned market uncertainty.Since investors tend to seek safety in times of crisis and uncertainty, such an event could push the DXY index even higher in the short term. This was seen during the March crash, after which the unprecedented balance sheet expansion by the Federal Reserved marked the DXY top.The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has been rejected at the all-time high region, which means that a correction could be on the horizon.Frequently, the total-market-cap chart shows a better view of the market's state than Bitcoin alone. Thus, a correction to $550 billion would put Bitcoin in the $18,500 region, the crucial short-term support zone that must be held to avoid any more downside.Altcoins may benefit, in particular, at the beginning of 2021if Bitcoin’s price can sustain above $18,500 and start consolidating from there. Until then, coronavirus fears and uncertainty will likely continue to hamper the markets.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

198,"Business intelligence company MicroStrategy has added to its Bitcoin (BTC) stash, with a purchase of 29,646 BTC for a total of $650 million, an average of around $21,925 per BitcoinCEO Michael Saylor tweeted the news immediately following a pullback in price to $22,247, although it is unclear whether the acquisition coincided with this event.MicroStrategy announced its intention to buy more Bitcoin earlier this month with a $400 million debt security sale to raise funds for the purchase. The bond sale ultimately brought in $650 million, which has now been used to buy Bitcoin as promised.The company is now holding a total of 70,470 BTC, bought at an average price per Bitcoin of $15,964. This makes it the fifth-largest individual hodler of Bitcoin, one place ahead of the United States government, which reportedly owns 69,420 BTC.MicroStrategy started its Bitcoin journey in August with a purchase of 21,000 BTC for $250 million. At the time, the company stated that its intention was to adopt Bitcoin as its primary reserve currency as a hedge against U.S. dollar inflation.This was followed by further purchases, including a $425 million acquisition in September,  which were carried out through Coinbase's over-the-counter desk.Most recently, Saylor encouraged fellow billionaire Elon Musk to follow his lead and use BTC to replace the U.S. dollar as Tesla's primary reserve currency. This would encourage other S&P 500 firms to follow suit, argued Saylor, compounding the benefits of the move."
199,"Italian authorities have found Bitgrail’s founder responsible for fraudulent activity related to the 2018 hack of the platform that resulte in the loss of $150 million.Francesco Firano, the sole director of now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Bitgrail, is accused of taking over customer funds prior to reporting the theft of crypto from the exchange.According to a Dec. 21 announcement by the Postal and Communications Police — a cybercrime unit of the State Police of Italy — Firano kept the platform intact for months despite having identified a major security breach involving Nano cryptocurrency:Firano subsequently denied allegations by the police, claiming that the authorities provided false information about the matter. “The postal police went into hiding instead of correcting the articles, Firano argued on Twitter. The executive also noted that he was not arrested by the police.The announcement seems to indicate that Firano withdrew 230 Bitcoin (BTC), worth 1.7 million euro, or about $1.9 million, at the time, just three days before reporting the larger theft of Nano that occurred in prior months. The BTC was traced to Firano’s personal account at The Rock Trading exchange platform. While the authorities noted that there were attempts to convert the money, the majority of the funds remained in the company's accounts. Authorities have stated that the actual hackers who stole the Nano remain unidentified. In a preliminary injunction, Firano was barred from holding managerial positions or conducting business activities, but his liberty of movement is otherwise not restricted.The latest news follows years of controversy around Bitgrail’s hack — one of the largest hacking incidents in Italy. In February 2018, Firano officially announced that 17 million Nano, formerly known as Raiblocks, was stolen in a hack. Nano developers subsequently provided an official comment showing that Firano asked for the altcoin’s ledger to be altered the next day after reporting the hack.In January 2018, the Italian Bankruptcy Court sentenced Firano to return as much of the assets as possible to his customers after local authorities seized more than $1 million in his personal assets.Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly claimed that Firano was associated with The Rock Trading. In reality, the funds were sent to his standard personal account at the exchange."
200,"Bitcoin (BTC) has had an interesting year, recovering from major sell-offs to eventually skyrocket to new all-time highs.However, Bitcoin's performance and cryptocurrencies increased adoption worldwide have still failed to bring some observers into the crypto camp. Yet compared to other bull run years like 2017, 2020 has seen much less crypto criticism, with a number of Bitcoin naysayers appearing to have somewhat softened their stance towards digital assets.As we look back on crypto in 2020, Cointelegraph has noted some of cryptocurrency's biggest critics.Anatoly Aksakov, a member of the Russian State Duma and a major representative of Russia’s crypto-related legislation efforts, was a noteworthy cryptocurrency critic in 2020.The official is confident that the global adoption of payments in crypto like Bitcoin would result in a “destruction of a financial system.” In October 2020, Aksakov predicted that decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have no future, arguing that central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, are the future of the financial system.While it remains to be seen what comes of Aksakov's prediction about Bitcoin, some of his previous comments show that he isn't exactly a prophet. In a May 2020 live stream talk with Maria Butina, Aksakov said that crypto mining “is becoming a thing of the past” due to Bitcoin’s third halving cutting the miner block reward from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.“[Crypto mining] is not profitable anymore, and as far as I understand, this business is poised to disappear in future,” Aksakov argued. Despite this doom prediction, Bitcoin miners have come into some money over the course of 2020, with Bitcoin miner revenue surging to pre-halving levels as of early November.In keeping with Russian authorities' constant game of ping pong in regulating crypto, Aksakov regularly changes his stance on the industry. In early December, Aksakov called cryptocurrencies a “highly profitable business,” and stressed the need to legitimize it by recognizing crypto as property.A member of Russia’s State Duma, Aksakov is also chairman of the National Banking Council at Russia’s central bank. In mid-October 2020, the Bank of Russia officially released its plans on the development of Russia’s CBDC, the digital ruble.Nouriel Roubini, a professor of economics at New York University’s Stern School of Business, is one of the world’s biggest crypto critics, often referred to as “Dr. Doom” in the crypto community. Known for his claims that “cryptocurrency as a technology has absolutely no basis for success,” the award-winning economist has stayed firmly critical of crypto and Bitcoin in 2020 despite admitting that BTC “maybe is a partial store of value” in late 2019.On Nov. 7, 2020, Roubini argued that cryptocurrency itself is a “misnomer,” because a currency needs to provide a unit of account. Roubini continued to bash Bitcoin, criticizing its apparent limited scalability:At the same time, Roubini admitted Bitcoin's potential function as a store of value. “It's maybe a partial store of value, because, unlike thousands of other what I call shitcoins, it cannot be so easily debased because there is at least an algorithm that decides how much the supply of Bitcoin raises over time,” Roubini noted.Peter Schiff, a millionaire broker and CEO at Euro Pacific Capital, is another famous Bitcoin naysayer, criticizing Bitcoin as early as 2013. Also referred to as a “gold bug” in the crypto community, Schiff is also one of the world’s biggest proponents of gold investment.Over the course of 2020, Schiff delivered multiple negative and controversial remarks about Bitcoin, predicting that gold will moon while Bitcoin will crash in the near future.On Oct. 28, 2020, while gold plunged to yearly lows against Bitcoin, Schiff argued:On Dec. 4, Schiff said that Bitcoin’s past performance does not guarantee its future success but rather “assures its future failure.”Despite regularly criticizing Bitcoin, Schiff has not stayed away from the world’s largest coin completely. In January 2020, Schiff claimed that he lost access to his crypto wallet, noting that having BTC “was a bad idea.” In August 2020, the gold advocate told people on Twitter to send BTC to his 18-year-old son, Spencer Schiff. “Since so many of you Bitcoin guys are ribbing me because my son bought Bitcoin, why not really rub it in by gifting him some as a belated birthday present,” Schiff wrote.Mark Cuban, a billionaire investor and owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is another major crypto sceptic, calling Bitcoin a bubble back in 2017. While admitting that crypto could be a “reliable financial instrument,” Cuban did not stop criticizing Bitcoin in 2020 over its supposed complexity.In an April 24 interview with Morgan Creek Digital’s Anthony Pompliano, Cuban reiterated his long-running stance that Bitcoin is too complicated to use. “It’d have to be completely friction-free and understandable by everybody first, and then you can say it's an alternative to gold as a store of value,” he said.Cuban stated that Bitcoin is a questionable means of exchange due to its apparent lack of fungibility for goods and services without converting into fiat currencies:Despite his criticism of Bitcoin, Cuban still owns a tiny bit of crypto. The billionaire investor claimed to have about $130 dollars in Bitcoin as of April 2020. Back in 2017, Cuban recommended investing up to 10% in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.In a Nov. 7 interview with Yahoo Finance, Ray Dalio, American billionaire hedge fund manager and founder of Bridgewater Associates, claimed that he doesn’t see digital currencies like Bitcoin succeeding the way other people do. He also expects global authorities to “outlaw” Bitcoin if its price goes too high.Dalio also criticized Bitcoin for not being an effective medium of exchange and a store of value, stating:Dalio subsequently admitted that he “might be missing something” about Bitcoin:Dalio has significantly softened his stance to Bitcoin, claiming that it could be a diversifier to gold on Dec. 8. The hedge fund veteran previously called the top cryptocurrency a bubble back in 2017.Despite a select number of well-known critics bashing Bitcoin in 2020, it appears that the seminal cryptocurrency has drawn less public skepticism than in previous years. Prominent naysayers like Warren Buffett, Bill Gates and Donald Trump have largely remained silent about Bitcoin and crypto this year. Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman, who predicted a “total collapse” of Bitcoin in 2018, refrained from commenting as well.According to data by major Bitcoin-themed website 99bitcoins, 2020 has been the year with lowest Bitcoin “obituary” rate since 2013. Only seven cases of ""Bitcoin death"" were reported in media monitored by 99bitcoins, compared to 41 ""obituaries"" in 2019, and 93 in 2018. The biggest year for Bitcoin deaths was 2017, the last year in which Bitcoin saw a major bull run before 2020.Whether one looks at Bitcoin's withering critics, the growing interest of major banks and financial institutions in cryptocurrency, or the meteoric bull run this year, one thing seems clear: crypto is here to stay."
201,"Exmo, a cryptocurrency exchange headquartered in the United Kingdom, has suffered a major security breach causing the platform to freeze all withdrawals.According to a security notice, Exmo detected suspicious withdrawal activity on Monday, with large amounts of major coins like Bitcoin (BTC) leaving the platform’s hot wallets.Maria Stankevich, head of business development at Exmo, told Cointelegraph that the incident is “nothing very serious,” as the affected hot wallets comprise 5% of the total assets held by the exchange. “Let us stress that all the assets in the cold wallets are safe,” the announcement reads.According to the announcement, other affected cryptocurrencies included Ether (ETH), XRP, Tether (USDT), Zcash (ZEC) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). The exchange mentioned correspondent crypto wallets that were likely to be involved in the hack, asking global exchanges to block the associated wallets.Stankevich noted that the exchange has not yet calculated the amount of the losses, claiming that Exmo is now focused on tracking the movement of withdrawn funds.Exmo launched a security investigation and also reported the case to the London police. The company asked users to not deposit any funds to Exmo wallets until the issue is resolved. “We want to assure you that if any user fund is affected by this incident, it will be covered completely by Exmo,” the company said.Earlier in December, Exmo received a temporary registration from the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority, allowing it to continue trading for an extended period until July 9, 2021"
202,"Institutional investors may be all that’s pushing up the price of Bitcoin (BTC), a new report from JPMorgan Chase claims.In comments on Dec. 18 quoted by Bloomberg, strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou added to recent forecasts about the role of institutions in Bitcoin’s future.According to JPMorgan, the largescale inflows seen this month must continue to avoid a price correction.As Cointelegraph reported, theories tied to recent price rises include institutional investors buying via over-the-counter trades that suck up the available supply. This has been called a liquidity crisis, which will only accentuate with time, while this week, another analyst claimed that the cycle could fuel the Bitcoin bull run indefinitely.For JPMorgan, however, buyers need to keep up the pace to avoid the opposite scenario: losses.Concerning Grayscale, which now has $13.1 billion in crypto assets under management, they reasoned that the sheer size of inflows means that they “are too big to allow any position unwinding by momentum traders to create sustained negative price dynamic.""Despite this, Bitcoin was still ""overbought"" at current price levels near $24,000 as the relative strength index (RSI) rose above 70. A later price dip on Monday brought the RSI below this threshold.Previously, Panigirtzoglou and others suggested that Bitcoin could benefit from a $600 billion cash injection from institutional uptake after insurance giant MassMutual revealed a $100 million allocation.Building on previous warnings over gold losing its place to Bitcoin, meanwhile, the latest findings identified a new “trend” formed by Grayscale. Exposure to Bitcoin could involve one buying one unit of Grayscale while selling three units of the SPDR Gold Trust.“If this medium to longer term thesis proves right, the price of gold would suffer from a structural flow headwind over the coming years,” they added.The correlation between gold and Bitcoin has decreased since October as Bitcoin rallied to new all-time highs. Gold saw rejection at $1,900 on Monday after extending a modest recovery from lows below $1,800."
203,"Bitcoin (BTC) lost $23,000 support on Dec. 21 as Monday trading saw a long-awaited correction begin to take shape. The move comes as U.S. futures also dropped in pre-market hours by roughly 2.5% on concerns over the new coronavirus strain in the U.K. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView showed BTC/USD hitting lows of $22,410 at press time, with 24-hour losses totaling around 3.3%.The move confirms suspicions among analysts that Bitcoin is due for a retracement after a week of near-constant gains. Traders are now eyeing $20,000, which orderbook data paints as a potentially formidable support level.At the start of last week, the largest cryptocurrency was still at under $19,500, a level which Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe believes could now form a short-term price target.$22,800, he added in comments over the weekend, forms a crucial area to hold in order to preserve the prospects of further upside.Major altcoin tokens saw a swift knock-on effect from Bitcoin's losses, with leader Ether (ETH) seeing a 6% daily dive.Litecoin (LTC) was down 8.5% at press time, while XRP lost 7.4% to hit $0.53."
204,"Bitcoin (BTC) surged to a new all-time high over the weekend, but what’s in store as a new week begins?With $24,000 still in play, Cointelegraph takes a look at five factors influencing BTC price action over the coming days.A sigh of relief from the United States as Congress was poised voted to accept a $900 billion coronavirus stimulus bill.The dollar rose amid news that the bill, which includes a second round of stimulus checks for eligible Americans, was agreed after months of failed talks. Previously, direct payments had been absent from the bill, but since returned as a modest $600 versus $1,200 in March.The move nevertheless beat the $787 billion stimulus tag for the 2009 financial crisis in one fell swoop.Eyes will now be on whether the bill can pass in a vote on Monday — the flagging U.S. dollar would suffer as a result of a rejection, likely to Bitcoin’s advantage.“Brrrrrrrr another $1 Trillion to be printed by the Fed,” James Todaro, a popular commentator on Bitcoin and coronavirus-related topics on social media, summarized in response to the news.Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe meanwhile sounded the alarm about the longer-term impact of adding more debt to the U.S.’ tally through financing the stimulus bill.“Agreement on the $900 billion coronavirus relief bill. Another step towards weakening the U.S. Dollar,” he wrote on Monday.In a curious contrast to March, mainstream media are already suggesting to recipients how they can put their stimulus check to work by buying BTC.BTC/USD remained near $24,000 on Monday, having hit all-time highs of $24,217 on Saturday and retained $20,000 support without any major tests.Adding to the power of the banking sector was a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to allow the six biggest banks to start buying back their own stock again in 2021.Worth $11 billion, the permission means that stock buybacks — something scorned by proponents of Bitcoin and sound money — can resume for the first time since the March crash.The Fed was unfazed about negative fallout further down the line, however, with Bloomberg quoting Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles describing banks as a “source of strength” in 2020.Fed stress tests, he said, “confirm that large banks could continue to lend to households and businesses even during a sharply adverse future turn in the economy.”As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin seemed to benefit from rising central bank balance sheets, with price gains coming in step with the Fed and other institutions heaping money onto their existing debt mountains.While BTC/USD stabilized over the weekend, a jump in the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) meanwhile failed to produce noticeable selling pressure on the largest cryptocurrency. DXY bounced off lows of 89.7 on Dec. 18 to hit 90.5 overnight on Sunday — still circling nearly three-year lows.Short-term price action meanwhile focused on a large range with $26,000 as its top, but a bottom that could stretch below $19,500.That was according to Van de Poppe on Sunday, who in his technical analysis highlighted various lows from earlier in the month and before which need to be liquidated.Specifically, these involve CME Group Bitcoin futures gaps, two of which are over $1,000 in size and remain unfilled, leaving the potential for a wick as low as $16,900.“Lower timeframe, we’ve got some critical things we have to watch,” he said. “We did see a higher high, a new all-time high yesterday. However, less volume on the whole for potential bearish divergence.”He said that support levels at $22,800 would need to hold this week to fuel any further upside, but that a period of “consolidation” similar to other recent bouts of low-volatility trading action could soon reappear.“That would fuel a potential strong move on ETH/BTC,” he added about the prospects for the largest altcoin Ether (ETH) to gain in Bitcoin terms.A high-profile Twitter exchange which even made it into mainstream media over the weekend has meanwhile failed to impact Bitcoin price action in real terms.Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, briefly discussed sending “large transactions” in Bitcoin with MicroStrategy CEO and serial BTC stockpiler Michael Saylor.After calling Bitcoin his “safe word” — contradicting another popular tweet from earlier this year — Musk then told followers that Bitcoin “is almost as bs as fiat money” before tweeting about Dogecoin (DOGE).Despite the tongue-in-cheek nature of his content, Musk managed to excite a wider audience keen for bullish statements on Bitcoin. Even naysayer gold bug Peter Schiff joined the fervor.“It seems like @elonmusk was only joking about exposing Tesla shareholders to Bitcoin,” he considered.Tesla stock rallied almost 6% at the end of trading on Friday, with markets yet to open at press time on Monday.Despite the looming sense of an incoming price correction, Bitcoin investors stayed prudent over the last week, data shows.Analyzed by on-chain monitoring service CryptoQuant, outflows to exchanges kept going over the past week, with more and more BTC moving away from trading arenas and into private storage.The overall balance on exchange was at its lowest since mid 2018 on Monday, a sign that unlike the previous all-time high of 2017, $24,000 BTC is not a product of a speculative trading frenzy.While calling it a “speculative guess,” Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, suspected last week that spikes in BTC outflows at exchange Coinbase Pro were down to large institutional buys using over-the-counter (OTC) trades. Should that status quo continue, the Bitcoin bull run would face no genuine hurdles.“Conclusion: This BTC bull-run never stops as long as these OTC indicators keep saying institutional-buying,” he wrote in a subsequent Twitter thread."
205,"Seasoned Bitcoin (BTC) investors know that the crypto market trades in cycles, and now that BTC price has surpassed its previous all-time high, a full-on bull cycle is underway. As this new cycle gathers steam, the mainstream media are all abuzz with articles about Bitcoin and everyone from world-renowned investment gurus to Uber drivers seem to have an opinion on the best tips, tricks, and moon coins one should buy in order to generate instant riches.Similar to the last bull market, this one will also be riddled with posts from crypto-Twitter celebrities who somehow managed to turn $100 into $10,000 or more, but this is not necessarily the experience of the majority of cryptocurrency investors who oftentimes find themselves subject to the whims of cryptocurrency whales and the wild price swings seen on exchanges offering crypto derivatives.For the average investor with limited time and a full-time job, day trading is not an option. Add to this the fact that data shows the majority of high-frequency traders fail to generate substantial profit.While there are some that do have the time to research legitimate crypto projects and conduct fundamental and technical analysis, this can fast become a full-time job in itself.Fortunately, there is a much easier and more effective way to trade Bitcoin during bull and bear cycles and this tactic is called dollar-cost averaging.For the average investor who is looking for a more simplified approach, multiple studies have shown that dollar-cost averaging Bitcoin purchases has provided a return on investment that most funds would boast about.As shown in the chart above, an investor who purchased $1,000 in 2017 have significantly increased their portfolio value and outperformed all traditional markets during the 3 year timespan.This buy and hold strategy is a tried and true method for investing in Bitcoin but not every investor is comfortable putting a bulk amount of money into an asset as volatile as Bitcoin.For investors who are more risk-averse, dollar-cost averaging is an even ‘safer’ method to invest in risk on assets.Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is a well known investment technique that investing greats like Warren Buffet have touted as a way to invest in volatile markets. Although the “Oracle of Omaha” was specifically referring to the purchase of large index funds, the same truth carries over to crypto.Instead of taking a lump sum of money and investing it all at once, an investor would instead divide the larger sum into smaller amounts and then invest those smaller amounts periodically over time. The idea being that while it can be difficult to time a market top or bottom, making regular purchases provides the best average entry price.For example, using the Bitcoin DCA tool, an investor can see that $100 invested weekly into BTC since the Dec. 2017 all-time high would currently be sitting on a portfolio worth $40,867 at the current Bitcoin value. As shown in the chart below, a total investment of $15,700 invested over the course of $100 per week resulted in a 160% increase in value in three years.Even large institutions utilize this strategy to increase their exposure to Bitcoin and Ether.Most recently, Microstrategy made waves in the crypto and traditional investment world when its CEO Michael Saylor announced that the company has purchased more than $425 million worth of Bitcoin and made BTC its primary reserve currency.When discussing the acquisition on Twitter Saylor stated:While this is clearly an institutional example of DCA, as Saylor described, smaller trades were spread out over time in order to get the best average price for the given timespan without causing a noticeable spike in the market.Day traders, investment pundits and crypto Twitter celebrities often post eye-watering profit-and-loss screenshots of their trades which would make any investor want to FOMO into Bitcoin but this is proven to not be the most effective method.Data reflects grim statistics for day traders as 80% to 95% of day traders actually lose money. This figure is not just for cryptocurrency markets but with all trading markets as well.So the next time you see that flashy advertisment or email newsletter guaranteeing massive gains and sure-fire crypto picks that are sure to be the next moon coin for the low price of $1,000 per month, remember that another dollar-cost averaging is a more reliable method for accumulating smaller amounts of Bitcoin in regular intervals.It may not be flashy and fund shattering, but it is a trusted, prudent approach to building long term wealth.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

206,"For a country of 25 million people, Australia punches well above its weight both economically and in the world of blockchain. Australians have long been enthusiastic adopters of new technology, from cellphones to smart homes, so it’s little surprise they’ve embraced crypto too.Chainalysis ranks Australia 20th out of 154 countries surveyed this year for its ""The 2020 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report,"" citing favorable regulation that legitimizes the technology as driving ""steady growth in adoption.""Australian crypto educator Alex Saunders, founder of Nuggets News, said the Australian crypto community encompasses everyone from hardcore Bitcoin (BTC) maximalists to well-known Ethereans and large contingents of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV) followers.""There's just a huge percentage of people per-capita compared to most countries that are interested in crypto and blockchain,"" he explained.The past year has seen the crypto ecosystem flourish despite the pandemic. The federal government released a five-year plan called the ""National Blockchain Roadmap,"" banks and the finance sector have warmed up to the technology, and local projects were instrumental in driving the mid-year decentralized finance boom.A raft of Australian DeFi projects came to global prominence in 2020, including Synthetix, which began life as stablecoin project Havven in the country's largest initial coin offering in 2018, before morphing into a decentralized version of BitMEX using synthetic assets.Synthetix founder Kain Warwick is also known as the “father of modern agriculture” for popularizing the concept of yield farming, which sparked the 2020 DeFi boom.""We've had some really big projects come out of Australia,” explained David Rugendyke, founder of Eth2 staking service Rocket Pool.Based in Brisbane, Queensland, Rocket Pool is a decentralized Eth2 staking service that will enable users without the minimum 32 Ether (ETH), or the desire to run their own validator, the ability to stake. Ren is a decentralized way to create tokenized Bitcoin and other coins that can be used in DeFi, while mStable allows users to swap U.S. dollar stablecoins with zero slippage and earn high yields. THORChain, meanwhile, is a forthcoming cross-chain version of Uniswap. Henrik Andersson, chief investment officer of Melbourne-based fund Apollo Capital, said:Rugendyke said that mostly favorable regulations are one reason local projects are able to thrive, as it enables them to “build in a way which is going to satisfy regulatory requirements but also not stifle what they're trying to do.""To give a couple of examples, in October, crypto-friendly capital raising platform Stax Capital launched the first initial public offering in Australia with permission to accept crypto in the form of Tether (USDT) for its client West Coast Aquaculture Group. Upon completion in November, around 89% of the $5 million raised had been contributed in Tether.And at the start of the year, a judge in New South Wales allowed a plaintiff to put up cryptocurrency as collateral against potential legal costs, with the judge calling crypto a ""recognised form of investment"" — albeit a highly volatile one.But it’s not all good news: Australian exchanges, including CoinSpot and CoinJar, were forced by regulators in August to delist privacy coins including Monero (XMR), Bytecoin (BCN) and Zcash (ZEC). Regulators also don't seem keen on ICOs, with many falling foul of current laws that consider them ""managed investment schemes"" requiring licensing.In February, Jemma Green, executive chairman of West Australia-based Power Ledger, told the Senate Select Committee on Financial Technology and Regulatory Technology that the tax treatment of ICOs was not ""fit for purpose"" and was part of the reason that only 0.79% of the $26 billion raised through ICOs to date was in Australia.One area in which Australia lags behind is in the use of crypto for day-to-day payments. A Reserve Bank of Australia study in March finds that while 80% of Australians are aware of cryptocurrencies, less than 1% have used crypto to make a consumer payment.Chainalysis noted in its report that people in developing economies in the Asian region make crypto payments far more often:The adoption of crypto for payments has been a little hamstrung in Australia because the country has one of the most advanced electronic payments systems in the world. The New Payments Platform and its PayID service enables Australians to send or receive money instantly, 24/7, using only an email address or phone number.Funnily enough, Ripple launched a very similar crypto-based service this year, also called ""PayID,” and promptly was sued by the New Payments Platform in the Federal Court for copyright violation. In November, Ripple changed the name to ""PayString.""PayID has also been cited by the Royal Bank of Australia as a key reason the country doesn’t require a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, despite the bank actively researching one. In October, the RBA’s head of payments policy, Tony Richards, said to not expect a CBDC any time soon:Saunders said it was a short-sighted decision. ""It's kind of disappointing to hear the RBA say that they don't see a use case for central bank digital currencies, when every other central bank on the planet is talking about how they're the future and trying to roll them out,"" he said.Despite its reluctance, the RBA has since partnered with two of the country’s four major banks — Commonwealth Bank and National Australia Bank — along with Ethereum developer ConsenSys and financial services company Perpetual to explore a wholesale central bank digital currency using an Ethereum-based digital ledger.In another welcome sign that banks are looking more favorably at the industry, three of the ""Big Four"" banks formed a company in September called Lygon to digitize bank guarantees using blockchain technology. The aim is to cut the processing time from weeks down to a single day — mainly for commercial lease guarantees — using IBM's Hyperledger technology.The government announced $4.95 million in this year's budget to support ""two blockchain pilots directed at reducing business compliance costs.""But probably of more significance was the release of the National Blockchain Roadmap at the start of the year, which was developed by the federal government’s Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources in consultation with industry group Blockchain Australia. It sets out 12 key recommendations over the next five years and identifies the three most promising use cases for the technology: recording credentials and qualifications for the education sector, supply chain tracking for agriculture and wine exports, and Know Your Customer identity verification for the finance industry.These three areas are also the focus of Blockchain Australia's proposed $60 million Cooperative Research Centre. The CRC requires a $30 million contribution from the industry that would be matched by the government, but so far, only a handful of organizations are on board.While the three use cases are being addressed by various initiatives, supply chain tracking could offer the most immediate benefits, with an estimated $1.7 billion of lower quality food and produce passed off as “Australian” overseas — mostly in China. A new public body called the APAC Provenance Council was set up mid-year by local blockchain businesses in concert with VeChain, Mastercard and Alipay.The aim is to offer guidance to exporters about supply chain tracking and to offer them trade financing. The organization has an innovative ""milestone""-based payments system that can provide partial payments when certain conditions are met along the journey, such as when a shipment leaves customs, as verified using blockchain.One thing that certainly didn't happen in 2020, and won't be happening any time soon, is the much-hyped transformation of the Australian Securities Exchange's CHESS share registration system, which was expected to be overhauled using distributed ledger technology.""The ASX has just pushed back rolling out blockchain for stock trading until 2023, which is the third time they've pushed it back,” explained Saunders.The ASX blamed the latest delays on surging volumes amid the March market crash, requiring it to triple the system's capacity — although part of the reason for the delay is likely the concerns expressed by some key stakeholders.Australia was already well served by crypto exchanges, but the major players have been looking to expand their market share here in 2020. Binance, Gemini and Crypto.com all extended fiat services to Australians this year, with Crypto.com recently announcing it had bought an Australian company in order to use its Australian Financial Services License and issue a Visa credit card.Kraken Australia opened mid-year after taking over local exchange Bit Trade. The United Kingdom-based money app Revolut — which is one of the largest brokerage firms in Europe, with a million customers — also extended crypto trading services to tens of thousands of Aussies.After a year of being confined to quarters during the pandemic — all of the state borders slammed shut, and Victorians endured a severe four-month lockdown — the crypto community is looking forward to a return to normality in 2021. Saunders said he’d been confined to Tasmania for most of the year and was eager to return to in-person events to see how the landscape had changed:"
207,"When the price of an asset hits a new all-time high, momentum traders plow in as they sense an opportunity to ride the trade higher. The same was seen after Bitcoin (BTC) price broke above the $20,000 mark on Dec. 16. By Dec. 19, the price had hit an intraday high at $24,197.46, a 21% rally in four days.These sharp moves in Bitcoin price attract traders who use derivatives to try and amplify their gains or hedge their existing positions by buying downside protection. This resulted in the open interest on Bitcoin options hitting a new all-time high at $6.5 billion earlier this week.While professional traders use complicated options strategies to establish their positions, the retail traders generally buy naked options with a dream of earning a windfall on the options contract. This can be seen from the high open interest on the $36,000 strike price and the $52,000 call option.For every option contract, there is a seller and a buyer and generally, professional traders prefer to sell the option contracts and pocket the premium when the expiry is worthless. Therefore, retail traders should make informed decisions before buying naked options contracts.The bullish momentum on Bitcoin has pulled select altcoins higher. Let’s look at the charts of top-5 cryptocurrencies that could offer trading opportunities in the coming week.Bitcoin picked up momentum after the price broke above the $20,000 overhead resistance but the quick rise of the past few days has pushed the relative strength index (RSI) deep into the overbought territory. This suggests the possibility of a consolidation or a correction in the next few days.Usually, after the price breaks above a critical level such as an all-time high, it turns down and retests the breakout level. In this case, the BTC/USD pair may turn down from the $25,000 to $26,000 resistance zone and retest the breakout level at $20,000.If the price rebounds off this support aggressively, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend. If they succeed, it will suggest that $20,000 is the new floor for the pair.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day exponential moving average ($20,356) and the $19,500 support, the pair may drop to the 50-day simple moving average at $17,960.Although the trend is up, the 4-hour chart shows that the bulls are finding it difficult to sustain the price above $23,795.29. This suggests that after the recent sharp up-move, the bears are attempting to stall the rally. The negative divergence on the RSI is a signal that the momentum may be weakening.If the price dips below the 20-EMA, the pair could drop to the $22,272.63 support. This is an important short-term level to watch out for because if it cracks, the short-term traders may book profits. That could quickly pull the price down to the 50-SMA and then to $20,000.This view will be invalidated if the price surges and sustains above $24,000. Such a move will suggest that momentum traders are in control.Ether (ETH) broke out of the ascending triangle pattern on Dec. 16 and the price rallied to $676.325 on Dec. 17 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels as seen from the long wick on the daily candlestick.However, a positive is that the bulls have not allowed the price to drop below the immediate support at $622.807. The price is currently stuck between $622.807 and $676.325.If the bulls can propel the price above $676.325, it could start the next leg of the uptrend that could reach the pattern target of $763.614. The upsloping moving averages suggest that the bulls have the upper hand.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $622.807, the ETH/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($599). If the price rebounds off this support with strength, the bulls will try to resume the uptrend.The trend will turn in favor of the bears if the price drops below the trendline of the triangle.The 4-hour chart shows a symmetrical triangle formation, which generally acts as a continuation pattern. If the bulls can push the price above the triangle, the pair may resume the uptrend.On the contrary, if the price dips below the triangle, a drop to the $622.807 support is possible. If the bears sink the price below the 50-SMA, the pair may lose momentum and drop to the trendline of the triangle.Litecoin (LTC) picked up momentum after breaking out of the symmetrical triangle on Dec. 16. The target objective of the breakout from the triangle was $119.77 and that was hit on Dec. 19.However, the momentum is strongly in favor of the bulls. If the price does not dip below the 50% Fibonacci retracement at $101.868, it will suggest that the bulls are not booking profits in a hurry.A shallow pullback will increase the possibility of a rally above $124.1278. If that happens, the LTC/USD pair could rally to $140.Contrary to this assumption, if the price dips below $101.868, the pair could correct to the 20-day EMA ($90). A deeper correction will suggest that the momentum has weakened and that may result in a range-bound action for a few days.The pair is currently witnessing a correction on the 4-hour chart that may reach the 20-EMA. A strong rebound off this support will suggest that the sentiment is positive and the bulls are buying on dips. If the bulls push the price above $124.1278, the uptrend could resume.The RSI is showing signs of a negative divergence. If the price dips and sustains below the 20-EMA, it will suggest that the momentum has weakened and a deeper correction may be on the cards.Cardano (ADA) has been trading inside a $0.13 to $0.175 range for the past few days. The altcoin turned down from the overhead resistance on Dec. 17 but the bulls have not given up much ground. This shows that traders are in no hurry to book profits.The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls have the upper hand, If the buyers can propel the price above the $0.175 to $0.1826315 overhead resistance zone, the ADA/USD pair could rally to $0.22 and then to $0.235.If the price turns down from the current levels but rebounds off the 20-day EMA ($0.154), the bulls will attempt to resume the uptrend.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair could drop to $0.13 and extend the stay inside the range.The 4-hour chart shows that the price is currently consolidating in a tight range of $0.16 to $0.17. The flattening 20-EMA and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.If the bears sink the price below the 50-SMA, the pair could drop to $0.150 and such a move will increase the possibility of the continuation of the range-bound action.On the other hand, if the pair rises above $0.17, the bulls will try to push the price above the $0.175 to $0.1826315 resistance zone. If they succeed, the uptrend could resume.Binance Coin (BNB) had been stuck in a $25.6652 to $32 range for the past few weeks. The bulls pushed the price above the overhead resistance on Dec. 19 and have followed that with another up-move today.The BNB/USD pair has currently reached the $35.4328 overhead resistance from where the price had reversed direction on Nov. 25. If the bulls can push and sustain the price above this resistance, a retest of the all-time high at $39.5941 is possible.The 20-day EMA ($30) has started to turn up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand. If the bulls can push the price above $39.5941, the uptrend could continue, with the next target at $50.This bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels and dips back below $32. Such a move will suggest a few more days of consolidation.The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls had pushed the price above the overhead resistance but could not sustain the higher levels. This suggests that the bears are aggressively defending the $35.4338 level.However, the upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest advantage to the bulls. If the bulls do not allow the price to slide below $33.3888, it will increase the possibility of a break above $35.4338.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $33.3888, a drop to the 20-EMA and then to $32 is possible.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

208,"For much of 2020, it wasn’t exactly a hard year to be a cheerleader for cryptocurrency. Emerging from a brutal macro bear market, the space once again proved doubters wrong and attracted a new batch of converts as money-printing efforts across the globe turned savers and traders onto the power of hard currency. After a coronavirus-related dip, prices have surged across the board, new verticals like decentralized finance are in a state of parabolic growth, and even institutions are finally getting in on the fun.Yet, in a year where portfolio values have risen and longtime proponents got to take a well-deserved victory lap, there are a few voices and names that stand out for their devotion and fervor.As 2020 comes to a close, here are a few of those proponents we’re thankful for:As the red-hot DeFi summer came to an end, Canadian YouTuber and amateur meteorologist Frankie MacDonald caught the attention of crypto Twitter for his earnest, impassioned takes on Bitcoin (BTC). MacDonald, who has been producing homemade content since 2009 and has amassed nearly 125,000 Twitter followers, has been offering periodic updates on Bitcoin price action throughout the year, and in a video titled “My Advice About the Bitcoin,” he definitively declared that “Bitcoin is worth more than American dollars.”One particular clip in Frankie’s considerable 2020 cheerleading oeuvre stands out, however. On the evening of Aug. 7, on the side of a lonely Nova Scotian highway under a setting sun, MacDonald proclaimed into the growing great northern darkness a wish, a rite, a blessing:Here is Me Saying Bitcoin Once Again pic.twitter.com/724b0kYOSzIt rings with justice. It brings a tear to the eye. It animates in every hodler’s soul a gallant zeal like the hymn of a long-forgotten motherland. MacDonald posted the “Here is Me Saying Bitcoin Once Again” video on Aug. 7. Since then, Bitcoin has soared over 60% — taking flight as if borne on the wings of Nike herself.Thanks, Frankie.The rich folk! You know the ones. They’re rich, and their cheering on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might help them get even richer, so they waved the pom-poms all year with vigor. One bearded rich guy bought nearly 5,000 Bitcoin while calling the digital currency “an instrument of economic empowerment.” A different, but also grizzled rich guy bought up a bunch of BTC on what seemed like a monthly basis until finally cracking the billion-dollar mark, making sure to tweet on the daily while he was at it. Earlier this month, a bald, famously spirited rich guy bought some Bitcoin and disturbingly proclaimed, “I’ll grow bigger, and bigger, and bigger.”Most notably in rich-folk news, one of the first rich guys to dip their toes into digital currencies ran a major ad campaign promoting his digital asset investment vehicles. While he ended up soliciting a bunch of new investors, most of crypto Twitter didn’t seem to like it.So many rich folk were buying Bitcoin, in fact, that it became impractical to report on rich folk buying Bitcoin unless associated with some other newsworthy event.An observer can’t be faulted for having difficulty telling these rich folk apart. In the case of Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, it’s near impossible on account of them being identical twins, and their cheeky social media handles might well be managed by the same intern:In the midst of winter, #Bitcoin found within itself an invincible summer#Bitcoin quietly tiptoeing above $19K. No big deal. Nothing to see here.Snark aside, many of the names mentioned above are responsible for building foundational tools and gateways to provide other investors access to cryptocurrency. Because of these rich folk, more than one more humble investor might find their way to financial freedom.In a year where the rich guys seemed to be locked in a race to see whose institution can hoover up the largest sums of Bitcoin, a Canadian restaurant chain serving up Middle Eastern fare threw its hat into the ring by converting all of its cash reserves into Bitcoin. On Aug. 18, the official Twitter for Tahini’s — a restaurant chain operating four corporate locations and three franchised locations in Ontario — made the big reveal accompanied by a long, thoughtful Twitter thread explaining the move:As a small company that started in London Ontario Canada we operate 4 corporate locations and 3 Franshise locations about to open up in Ontario. We just converted our entire cash reserves that were originally used as savings into #Bitcoin
Time for threadThe justifications seemed to be straight from the Bitcoin maximalist handbook: Cash is a depreciating asset, while Bitcoin is not; cash reserves are less attractive in an inflationary environment; the fiat world is a “game of musical chairs” and eventually “the music will stop and some people will get left out.” The thread was also surprisingly intimate at times, describing the “come to Bitcoin” journey as one of gradual enlightenment. The restaurant chain also stands out not just for the bravery and transparency of making the conversion, but also for the intellectual seriousness and resolve with which it converted.In a follow-up thread, the chain laid out the history of gold while making a case for Bitcoin’s superiority. Recent tweets also show Bitcoin meetups at franchise locations as well as the chain engaging in the time-honored crypto Twitter tradition of dunking on Nouriel Roubini:It seems like @Nouriel loves being wrong for a decade. Enough is enough Professor https://t.co/4DcyZp0iqZWe look forward to seeing what else Tahini’s cooks up in the new year. Proponents for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies come from all walks of life, but rarely has there been a vocal champion for the digital currency at the highest levels of government. Following the recent election cycle, however, that appears to have changed. Incoming Senator Cynthia Lummis holds the distinction of being the first woman elected to the office from Wyoming, as well as being one of the first willing to fully endorse Bitcoin as a store of value.In an interview with ABC News earlier in the year, the former state treasurer wasn’t shy about her support:Lummis’ support isn’t just a token oddity, either. As 2021 looms, it’s becoming increasingly important for politicians to have an understanding of the function and potential of cryptocurrencies if they’re going to enact regulation allowing the space to continue its growth. Memes can accomplish many things: create laughter; galvanize a population; construct and spread a community’s values. The absolute best, however, infect the psyche of everyone who sees them with some core kernel of truth — a distilled drop of an epoch, a fully reified and self-contained historical monad. Five-dollar words aside, they’re also supposed to be funny. That’s exactly what the folks at the Institute for Memetic Research and Development have done with their website brrr.money.Holy shit who did this?

Sound on for extra effect.

Try it for yourself https://t.co/k4MLHT81Nz pic.twitter.com/eeRywv0yDvWe thank the geniuses at the institute for their contributions this year, and look forward to more of their work. "
209,"In future years, it’s possible that 2020 will be seen as a watershed moment for cryptocurrencies. When Black Thursday hit in March, it wiped billions off the markets in a matter of hours. Anyone would have been forgiven for thinking recovery would take years. But by December, Bitcoin (BTC) has gone on to achieve a new all-time high, breaking the $20,000 resistance and almost reaching $24,000 in the process. This has come at the end of the first year in Bitcoin’s history where it was tested against the backdrop of a global recession.Indeed, 2020 has also seen active addresses approach 2017 levels, according to data from Glassnode. So, as much as speculation points to institutional investors as the reason for Bitcoin’s meteoric recovery, the data suggests that general adoption is on the rise.This leads to a question: Which companies, governments and other entities have made the greatest contribution to cryptocurrency adoption in 2020? In no particular order, here are Cointelegraph’s top picks:When it emerged in late October that the payments industry behemoth was planning to integrate cryptocurrencies into its platform, the markets responded with gusto. PayPal’s news confirmed what many had been suspecting for some time, but the announcement came with a surprising cherry on top: PayPal also announced that from January, users would be able to spend cryptocurrency at any of its 26 million merchants.It isn’t just Bitcoin that has benefitted from the news, which appears to be creating a positive reinforcement cycle for PayPal’s stock too. Shares in the company have risen by 17% over the months since its announcement. While users in the United States can already take advantage of the service, PayPal will launch crypto trading to all of its 300 million global user base starting from next year.The relationship between cryptocurrencies and U.S. regulators has long been a tense one. However, in July, things took a sudden u-turn when the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a memo providing the green light for banks to start offering cryptocurrency custodial services.The move covers all national banks and federal savings associations, effectively removing a significant regulatory hurdle for cryptocurrency adoption in the country. Not only is this a critical development for retail holders of cryptocurrency, but it also paves the way for institutional adoption. Furthermore, banks no longer have a reason to refuse services to legitimate cryptocurrency service providers, assuming they’re prepared to comply with general Know Your Customer standards.From a practical perspective, it will take some time for banks to install the necessary security policies and infrastructure for handling digital assets. Nevertheless, the actions of the OCC are a substantial leap in furthering crypto adoption in the United States.Perhaps as a direct result of the OCC’s actions, and no doubt related to the ongoing bull market, it emerged in December that Wall Street was officially going in on digital assets. S&P Dow Jones Indices issued an announcement confirming it will debut cryptocurrency indices starting in 2021. The news comes thanks to a partnership with Lukka, a U.S.-based blockchain data provider.It’s not yet clear which assets exactly will feature as part of the indices. However, with 550 cryptocurrencies in scope, it seems to be a fair bet that the vast majority of the top-ranking tokens will be included. The move could help to spur further institutional adoption of cryptocurrency, as more mainstream market infrastructure makes digital assets more accessible to Wall Street investors.The CEO of Galaxy Digital has perhaps done more than any other individual to advocate the adoption of Bitcoin this year. After his firm’s earnings showed a 75% year-on-year rise, he went on the record to state his belief that Bitcoin would go on to hit $65,000 after it exceeds its 2017 all-time high.A few days later, he was back to recommend that everyone put 3% of their net worth into the asset and hold onto it until 2025. By early December, he upped the ante again, encouraging investors to put 5% of their portfolio into crypto.Demonstrating he’s prepared to put his money where his mouth is, he also told CNN that he has 50% of his own net worth tied up in digital assets. A week or so later, Bitcoin soared through its previous all-time high.The founder of Barstool Sports has had an on-again-off-again relationship with cryptocurrencies for most of 2020. In August, Dave Portnoy, aka “Davey Day Trader,” invited the Winklevoss brothers to his house to teach him about Bitcoin. Following that, he started shilling alt coins, leading some members of crypto Twitter to start calling him out for his lack of experience. A day later, he claimed to be on the road to becoming a crypto millionaire.After abandoning digital assets entirely, the capricious entrepreneur came back to Bitcoin a whole two weeks later, declaring this time that “my heart is crypto.”Whether you were laughing or rolling your eyes, Portnoy’s antics undoubtedly helped to draw attention to cryptocurrencies. Therefore, his influence in adoption earns him a place on this list.In 2018, the Reserve Bank of India dealt a death blow to cryptocurrency firms operating in the world’s second-most populous nation. As the result of government actions to stop local banks working with crypto companies, Indian citizens could no longer trade cryptocurrencies on exchanges, forcing them onto peer-to-peer networks, and, in the case of those wanting to trade from fiat, to the black market.In March this year, the Supreme Court of India issued a landmark ruling overturning the decision and deeming it “unconstitutional.” The move effectively relegitimized cryptocurrencies to 1.3 billion people.Although there have been some tentative rumblings that another u-turn may be on the way, the ruling of the SCI has given the Indian crypto scene a considerable boost. By June, a wave of new exchanges had launched in the country, opening up cryptocurrency services to millions of new users.It was all the way back in February 2019 when banking behemoth JPMorgan announced it was planning to launch its own cryptocurrency to help speed up settlements within its network. In October this year, JPM coin was finally released, effectively a straightforward dollar-backed stablecoin. However, given the size of JPMorgan’s global reach, it’s estimated that the coin will save the global finance industry hundreds of millions of dollars in peripheral costs.Related: JPM Coin debut marks start of blockchain’s value-driven adoption cycleThe move is unlikely to have any impact on the crypto markets at large, simply because JPM Coin is only to be used within JPMorgan’s closed network. However, the bank reportedly processes transactions worth around $6 trillion over more than 100 countries every single day. Therefore, it could easily become one of the world’s most adopted cryptocurrencies by transaction volume. In mid-December, Goldman Sachs signed on to use JPM Coin for its repo trades.Decentralized Finance has had a stellar year in general, but it’s fair to say that the release of Uniswap V2 in May has made 2020 a milestone year in terms of decentralized exchange adoption. By August, the exchange had topped the trading volume of Coinbase Pro, and by December, it had achieved over $50 billion in lifetime volume.Furthermore, Uniswap inadvertently found itself the victim of its own success when SushiSwap launched in August. The new exchange emerged as a clone of Uniswap’s code but with its own token in the background. Dubbed a “vampire attack,” the move appeared to threaten Uniswap’s dominance by draining liquidity from the exchange. Even worse, SushiSwap’s move spawned a string of similar copycat exchanges, with several setting up home on Binance’s newly launched Smart Chain.Related: Uniswap fights back as competitors drain value from the DEXHowever, Uniswap had the last laugh after it launched its own token in September, distributing UNI to anyone who had ever contributed liquidity to the platform. The move helped Uniswap win the liquidity wars, and it continues to outperform its rivals today.It was in September 2019 that reports first emerged regarding NBA player Spencer Dinwiddie planning to tokenize his contract extension worth $34 million. His plan was to sell digital tokens linked to the contract, where investors could receive principal and interest.It’s fair to say that Dinwiddie’s road to a tokenized contract sale was far from smooth. After coming up against opposition from the NBA itself, Dinwiddie went ahead and launched a Gofundme campaign in May, attempting to raise nearly $25 million worth of BTC as a means of allowing participating fans to decide the fate of his next team move. However, he closed the campaign after having raised just $1,160, which he donated to charity. He later managed to sell 10% of the token shares of his NBA contract to eight investors.Nevertheless, it’s fair to say that Dinwiddie’s support of cryptocurrency has helped to bring it to mainstream attention. Bleacher Report called him the “bitcoin savant of the NBA.”Launched by eToro in September, GoodDollar is a social impact project aimed at delivering a digital universal basic income at scale. GoodDollar mints its tokens, called G$, based on the yields generated by investing a basket of cryptocurrency reserve assets into DeFi protocols. It then distributes them as a basic daily income.Since the platform launched in September, the company claims to have signed on more than 40,000 people from 180 countries, and said it distributed over 14 million G$ tokens. Users can’t yet change their tokens for fiat, but they can use them to purchase online services via the Facebook GoodDollar marketplace, which currently has nearly 16,000 members.The idea of a universal basic income already had broad support, including from former U.S. presidential candidate Andrew Yang. However, the coronavirus pandemic has precipitated further backing for the idea given so many people continue to be affected by the economic fallout. Therefore, GoodDollar is an intriguing experiment in generating a sustainable source of funding for a UBI.Bear with us here — this last entry is controversial. But it can’t be ignored that the biggest Bitcoin bull run in history has come at a time when the world is fighting the devastating coronavirus pandemic. In November, Cointelegraph already highlighted the fact that the economic fallout of the virus had contributed to shifting perceptions on Bitcoin and digital money.Even before that, it was becoming apparent that the pandemic was accelerating digital innovation thanks to stay-at-home orders and tracing shifts that followed previous historical disease outbreaks. After all, it was Ben Franklin who first observed that “out of adversity comes opportunity.”The rise of DeFi and 2020’s epic crypto bull run underscore the true potential of cryptocurrencies to help redistribute wealth and generate new avenues of value. Therefore, if it’s possible to take something positive away from the catastrophic health crisis of 2020, it won’t have been for nothing.On a more positive note, viewed purely through the lens of cryptocurrency adoption, 2020 has been an extremely promising year. Furthermore, all the signs are there that 2021 won’t repeat the events of 2018 after the last epic bull run. With that in mind, here’s to looking forward to more good news from the crypto space in the year to come. Cheers, and stay safe."
210,"The United States Internal Revenue Service is blinded by its desire to defeat cryptocurrency. It rushes to enforcement without first thinking how best to get there. It has spent millions of taxpayer dollars training its personnel and procuring private contractors to uncover noncompliance by crypto users. The IRS is arming its people to aggressively enforce the tax laws applicable to cryptocurrency. All the while, it ignores “established” frameworks to help achieve tax compliance and collection on crypto transactions. Crypto tax amnesty is the easiest and fairest way to get from point A to point B, yet the IRS prefers unfair and aggressive tactics that disproportionately affect one population of taxpayers — the young.That framework, a well-publicized amnesty program, began over 10 years ago. There is already a fine blueprint to follow. In March 2009, the IRS announced a foreign tax amnesty program named the Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program, or OVDP. The program came in response to U.S. taxpayers not disclosing their foreign bank accounts and not reporting billions of dollars in tax on foreign income. In exchange for voluntary disclosure and payment of tax, OVDP offered taxpayers an opportunity to avoid criminal prosecution and pay far smaller penalties (sometimes, none at all). Without OVDP, taxpayers faced jail time and a variety of draconian civil penalties. The program was a great success — in just seven months, some 15,000 disclosures were made, netting nearly $3.5 billion in back taxes, penalties and interest.Seeing the utility of OVDP, the IRS extended the program through several iterations. In total, some 56,000 taxpayers came forward and the IRS collected more than $11 billion in back taxes, interest and penalties. Even the worst prognosticator could predict a similar result with a crypto tax amnesty program. Consider this: There is a crypto “tax gap” of $25 billion dollars, nearly 37 million Americans now own some form of cryptocurrency, and the compliance rate is only about 50%.The tax gap is wide enough, the population is many, and the compliance rate is dismal. Because of this, crypto tax amnesty could produce far more disclosures than OVDP and collect many more tax dollars. The similarities are apparent, but several key differences further favor crypto amnesty.The first difference lies in the demographic of crypto users. Nearly 60% of Bitcoin (BTC) users are under 35 years old, 17% of whom are barely out of high school, currently in their early 20s. This is important because this demographic is by far the least experienced group of taxpayers. Unlike taxpayers engaging in transactions abroad, millennials are the least likely to recognize the nuances of reporting capital gains and losses, limits on capital losses, disallowance of capital expenditures, carryover losses, stepped-up basis, carry-over basis and adjustments to basis, and the list goes on and on.Despite this inexperience and youth, the IRS refuses to offer crypto users a tax amnesty program. Instead, the IRS offered tax amnesty to a far more experienced group of taxpayers engaging in foreign transactions. These taxpayers are far more likely to understand the nuances of tax law and employ tax attorneys and CPAs, and are more often tax “cheats,” whereas crypto evaders are often inadvertent. Despite this, the IRS unscrupulously targets the least-experienced demographic.Related: Crypto could save millennials from the economy that failed themThere is yet more unfairness beyond the simple demographic. Foreign Bank Accounting Reporting, or FBAR, is a foundationally solid area of tax law, while cryptocurrency taxation is not. Fairness dictates that amnesty should be offered upon the simple fact that cryptocurrency taxation is often misunderstood, and is a new and emerging area of tax law. The rules are not well settled, and the current IRS guidance only consists of two IRS Notices and a set of FAQs — neither of which, by the way, are legally binding on the IRS. That is, a crypto taxpayer can not legally rely on them. Until legally binding guidance is released and the rules better developed, crypto tax amnesty is the fairest solution.The crypto demographic is further handicapped by the fact that third-party reporting of crypto transactions is virtually nonexistent (only two of the nine U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges have published policies on transactional reporting). In other contexts, taxpayers can rely on annual 1099s or brokerage statements to report their basis and capital gains or losses. This is not available to most taxpayers in their 20s who are engaging in cryptocurrency transitions and likely only accustomed to simple W-2 tax returns. Rather, they must sit down with a pencil and paper and track spot prices (with no NYSE to rely on), determine fair market values, adjust their basis, and calculate their gains and losses across multiple exchanges at different times with different fees.Coinbase, one of the largest and most popular exchanges, just switched from issuing 1099-K forms to 1099-MISC forms. This is significant because the reporting thresholds for the latter are much lower. For Forms 1099-K, there is a reporting obligation if the taxpayer exceeds 200 transactions or a $20,000 threshold. In contrast, 1099-MISCs are issued if a taxpayer receives more than just $600 in payments during the year. Now, because of lower thresholds, tens of thousands more taxpayer names are being provided to the IRS — all without a mention of basis. Until third-party reporting of cryptocurrency is in line with other capital transactions, crypto tax amnesty is the fairest solution.Or worse yet, perhaps some young taxpayers are paid in cryptocurrency or buy and sell products using cryptocurrency. In that instance, they must calculate a reasonable FMV for the cryptocurrency changing hands at different times — all the while tracking their basis. It is not difficult to imagine a young taxpayer keeping a constant log of cryptocurrency received for services rendered or exchanged goods, making proper FMV adjustments across multiple exchanges at different times.If a person receives Bitcoin on Day 1 in exchange for selling a video game, and then receives Bitcoin on Day 2 for selling a pair of sunglasses, he must calculate the FMV of the Bitcoin earned at different intervals, less basis, all with a solid understanding of the impact of self-employment tax and the need to pay estimated taxes. The young taxpayer’s logbook may rival that of a long-haul trucker. The missteps here are many, and crypto tax amnesty is the fairer solution, much fairer than crypto-based, self-employment tax audits.To add salt to the wound, there is still no IRS de minimis rule for crypto transactions involving even the smallest purchase of property. Arguably, the young taxpayer could incur a capital gain when he buys a pack of gum with XRP (a pack of gum costs $1.50 and Ripple trades around $0.50). Because he received a thing of value beyond the XRP he paid, he has a capital gain. In this regard, the current IRS regime teeters on the brink of absurdity.And finally, the IRS guidance on cryptocurrency taxation makes not one mention of penalties for noncompliance, while FBAR guidance is laden with discussions of penalties. Until a sensible de minimis exception is enacted, and until the IRS adequately educates young crypto users on noncompliance penalties, crypto tax amnesty is the fairest solution.The Taxpayer Bill of Rights addresses this very problem of unfairness, shouting amnesty at the top of its lungs.The Right To Be Informed, says:The Right to a Fair and Just Tax System, says:The IRS meets its burden with FBAR but fails miserably with its tax policies on cryptocurrency. It attacks the least experienced taxpayer but rewards the most experienced. It warns the most experienced taxpayers about penalties but leaves the least experienced guessing. It ignores that third-party reporting offers young taxpayers no quarter. It imposes complex tax nuances on the simplest demographic, and it disregards the foolishness of auditing that pack of gum.Crypto tax amnesty has gotten little fanfare because the right people are not concerned — it is a young person’s tax problem. Big banks and large corporations cared about foreign bank account reporting and a tax amnesty program emerged, but crypto users have no centralized backing to support them. In fact, their very existence is based on decentralization. Unfortunately, until the “right” people are affected, crypto tax amnesty is unlikely. But if institutional integrity holds meaning, the IRS should extend the olive branch — notwithstanding the absence of the “big hitters.”Mr. IRS Commissioner, with all due respect, open the borders and offer amnesty to this flood of young taxpayers. A fair and just tax system demands it.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
211,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed $24,000 on Dec. 19, reaching a new all-time high. On Coinbase, BTC peaked at $24,200 and has since consolidated into the $23,500 to $23,800 range.Three factors pushed the price of BTC upwards within a short period, leading it to a record-high. The factors are a large short squeeze, stacked sell orders at $23,600, and the market’s reaction to the U.S. Treasury’s self-custodied wallet rule proposal.According to data from Bybt.com, $138 million worth of short contracts were liquidated today. The mass liquidation of short contracts occurred just as Bitcoin surpassed $23,600. The $23,600 area was a key resistance level because of stacked sell orders across major exchanges.On Bitfinex, the $23,600 and $23,800 resistance levels had large sell orders before the rally occurred. As the Bitcoin price began to increase, it squeezed out shorts and sellers in the $23,600 to $23,800 resistance range.Typically, a short squeeze happens when a seller is forced to market buy their position because the price of Bitcoin goes up. This causes the buyer demand to surge within a short period, often leading to a large breakout to the upside.On Dec. 19, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin revealed a rule proposal concerning self-custodied wallets.The rule requires exchanges to keep track of withdrawals and deposits above $3,000 that originated from non-custodial wallets. If the transactions surpass $10,000, then exchanges would have to report directly to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).However, as analysts explained, the rule itself is not as bad as industry executives initially thought. Cointelegraph reported that unless the proposal becomes law, Bitcoin price and the wider crypto market would likely ignore the news.Jake Chervinsky, a general counsel at Compound Finance, said:Still, despite the positive catalysts, in the near term, traders believe Bitcoin could consolidate or pull back, due to the overextension of the rally.Scott Melker, a cryptocurrency trader, pinpointed the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of Bitcoin on the 4-hour chart to suggest that overbought bear divergences are likely to occur. He said:"
212,"Bitcoin (BTC) set a new all-time high on Dec. 19 as markets continued to deliver surprises in weekend trading.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and Tradingview showed BTC/USD just eclipsing its record level set this week, reaching $24,210 on Coinbase before reversing.Volatility was high as the previous all-time high of $23,777 just gave way before resistance kicked in once again. According to exchange orderbook data, sellers are ready at $24,000, with that area now forming a psychological barrier currently under attack from bulls.""Let's go, another all-time high during weekend hours?"" Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe tweeted, keenly eyeing the renewed energy in Bitcoin markets.The move continues a trend that has developed in recent weeks, significant price action occurring during weekends rather than strictly during the week.On Saturday, meanwhile Van de Poppe urged caution, arguing that crucial support still lay much lower on the BTC/USD chart at $18,500.""Such vertical rallies aren't sustainable for long. Thus, a correction will occur at some point. However, predicting when it happens is anyone's guess as Bitcoin may easily run to $30,000 and then see a 30% correction,"" he summarized."
213,"Bitcoin (BTC) price has seen a massive rally in previous months, accelerating from $10,000 to a recent all-time high of around $23,700. This is a rally of 135% in just a matter of a few months. It’s speculative to discuss where the price of Bitcoin could run from here. However, certain levels must be held for this rally to continue. Additionally, several indicators can be useful for analyzing the charts and anticipating potential areas of interest in price discovery.The daily chart for Bitcoin shows a massive breakout above $19,500. This rally led to a temporary top of $23,500 but automatically turned the $19,500 level into a critical level to hold.The chart also shows a clear support/resistance flip of the $16,000 level, triggering further upwards pressure leading to the breakout. Based on the daily timeframe, the recent higher low is made around $17,500. As long as Bitcoin sustains above that level, the uptrend is intact and continuation is likely.The Fibonacci extension tool is useful to define the potential short-term top of the rally. The first Fibonacci level is the 1.618 Fibonacci extension at $22,100, which has been surpassed. This means that the market is currently seeing an immense amount of buy pressure.The next level of interest is found at $25,800, the 2.618 Fibonacci level, which could be the next marker for a potential top.Such vertical rallies aren't sustainable for long. Thus, a correction will occur at some point. However, predicting when it happens is anyone's guess as Bitcoin may easily run to $30,000 and then see a 30% correction.The total market capitalization of cryptocurrency shows a massive upward breakout in the previous months, largely fueled by Bitcoin hitting its new all-time highs.Following BTC's footsteps, the total market cap is now approaching the final hurdle before going into price discovery.Just like Bitcoin, there are important levels to watch for a potential correction. The first is found around $550 billion, which could serve as support for the pullback. If that doesn’t hold, the next levels are $435-$445 billion and $380 billion.Historically, Bitcoin dominance tops out in December, after which a strong quarter starts for altcoins.To have such a strong quarter for altcoins, Bitcoin has to correct and stabilize, as that’s the best nature for altcoins to act in. Therefore, as history shows us, the next quarter could be a significant quarter for altcoins.The weekly Bitcoin chart shows a massive vertical run in the previous months, which frequently ends in a violent correction just like three years ago.As stated already, nobody knows when this big pullback will occur. Bitcoin may continue running to $30,000 before it starts to correct. However, the primary level to watch in this correction is the region around $18,500, as the chart shows.As long as that level holds, both Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will likely keep climbing with the total crypto market cap going into price discovery just like BTC.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

214,"Institutional investors are paying close attention to digital assets as Bitcoin (BTC) continues to soar past record-breaking levels, almost reaching the valuation of $24,000 for the first time in its history.Recent findings from a Bank of America–Merrill Lynch survey conducted between Dec. 4 and 10 show that about 15% of fund managers with $534 billion under management believe Bitcoin to be the third-most crowded trade behind being long on technology shares and shorting the U.S. dollar. In addition, a recent Fidelity survey found that out of almost 36% of the respondents, or 774 institutional investors, own crypto assets.Yet as Bitcoin continues to capture the attention of professional investors worldwide, security measures, along with insurance guarantees, are becoming more important than ever before. This has especially become the case as more traditional custodians and banks add support for digital assets.A report released this year from Big Four firm KPMG shows that the number one key action for crypto-asset custodians looking to build a sustainable business model is enabling next-generation security and resilience. KPMG’s report notes that this involves incorporating leading cryptographic techniques, including multi-sig, sharding and multi-party computation, and dedicated physical hardware. In other words, online and offline security measures are required for safeguarding digital assets.Lior Lamesh, CEO and co-founder of GK8 — an Israeli blockchain cybersecurity company — told Cointelegraph that when it comes to traditional institutions with large amounts of money and reputations to manage, offline security procedures, in particular, are critical for digital asset protection:For example, Lamesh said that the team of former Israeli military cybersecurity personnel behind GK8 has developed a completely offline solution for traditional custodians and banks seeking digital asset protection. It consists of an “air-gapped” cold vault that provides the ability to create transactions on a blockchain network while operating entirely offline.The process of executing blockchain transactions offline eliminates all potential attacks on users’ private keys, providing full protection against cyber threats, according to Lamesh. While he couldn’t disclose all the details, Lamesh shared that this solution is made possible due to patented cryptography that enables the vault to create, sign and send blockchain transactions in a unidirectional connection, without receiving any digital input that can include malicious code. In addition, GK8’s cold vault is backed by a $500-million insurance coverage.One company that leverages an offline custody solution is Prosegur, a Spanish security company that serves as a custodian of physical security for traditional banks and manages over 360 billion euros annually.Last year, the firm was attacked by the Ryuk ransomware, a Trojan virus that encrypts files on a compromised device, typically demanding payments in Bitcoin to decrypt them. This particular attack is concerning for a number of reasons, but security has become even more of a priority for Prosegur ever since the firm launched “Prosegur Crypto,” a service for custody and management of digital assets.Raimundo Castilla, CEO of Prosegur Crypto, told Cointelegraph that Prosegur’s new service addresses growing market demand for safeguarding digital assets, especially as more institutions become involved with crypto.According to Castilla, the company examined a number of diverse security offerings, including cloud solutions and hardware security module based cryptographics. However, he noted that the offline solution was different in that it leaves no risk for possible external attacks due to the fact that it’s entirely offline. “It is definitely the most secure solution we’ve encountered and was exactly what we were looking for as security experts,” he said.Yet companies like Prosegur are not the only ones opting for offline security solutions. OSL, one of Asia’s leading digital asset platforms and member of BC Technology Group, is also using military-grade offline security protocols to safeguard digital assets for hundreds of institutional clients and professional investors.Wayne Trench, CEO of OSL, told Cointelegraph: “These include military-grade online and offline security protocols, strict Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer requirements, market surveillance and client asset segregation.”Trench further shared that OSL has a number of rigorous onboarding procedures in place, along with full insurance in the case of both hot and cold wallet crimes. Security measures are mandatory for OSL, which recently became one of the first publicly listed companies licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong to operate regulated brokerage and automated trading services for digital assets.While offline security procedures are necessary for safeguarding billions of dollars in digital assets from cyber threats, there are some challenges worth recognizing.For instance, cold storage facilities are inherently less liquid than online solutions. While some investors may not consider this to be a dealbreaker, KPMG’s “Institutionalization of Cryptoassets” report notes that digital assets typically utilize public key infrastructure. However, PKI has presented challenges in the past in terms of disaster recovery. KPMG’s report points out that challenges such as these are magnified for crypto operations, which are dependent on the availability of public and private keys to transfer assets.The report further states that organizations managing key pairs will need to develop disaster recovery plans for securing private keys within each storage tier, for each type of digital asset. However, traditional techniques, such as the use of a hardware security module as mentioned may fall short, given its physical dependence. The report states:Despite concerns, traditional custodians and banks are well aware that security is the most important feature when supporting digital assets. Yet this has been challenging to navigate, as Castilla noted that the custody market typically offers standard cybersecurity solutions that haven’t always been invulnerable against the risk of loss from undue physical access.As such, Castilla explained that moving forward, solutions should transparently show not only the physical protection of assets and access to systems but also the cybersecurity of the space, in which the asset management occurs: “This is the way to manage secure transactions for blockchain-based assets, as this is an aspect of enormous vulnerability that institutional investors have to consider in their custody decision.”"
215,"The Bitcoin (BTC) futures funding rate on Binance Futures overtook Deribit on Dec.18, according to data from CryptoQuant. Historically, when this happened, the dominant cryptocurrency saw a local top or consolidation.The funding rate of major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ether (ETH), rose considerably in the past 48 hours. This typically indicates that the futures market is overheating, which raises the probability of a pullback.Bitcoin has already seen a relatively mino pullback and some consolidation after its recent rally.Within two days, from Dec. 16 to 17, the price of Bitcoin rose from $19,300 to as high as $23,800 on Binance. Following a 23% price spike, a 3% to 4% correction is relatively small, compared to historical corrections after a major rally.A Bitcoin pullback was bound to happen as the futures funding rate surpassed 0.1% on Dec. 18 across major exchanges.The Bitcoin futures market uses a system called “funding” to find balance in the market. If there are more long contracts in the market, the funding rate becomes positive. If so, buyers or long contract holders have to pay short-sellers, and vice versa.On Dec. 18, the funding rate surpassed 0.1% on Bybit and other leading exchanges for the first time since the November rally to $19,000. At the time, after the futures market got overheated, BTC saw a significant pullback to $16,000.A 20% to 30% pullback was likely at the time because the funding rate consistently remained high. This time around, the funding rate has cooled down comparably fast. As such, the chances of consolidation rather than a correction are higher, particularly as new retail investors still remain largely on the sidelines, other data shows.A pseudonymous cryptocurrency trader pinpointed that the Binance Futures funding rate overtook Deribit.Although this data does not have specific relevance, historical trends show that when it happens, Bitcoin tends to pull back. The trader said:One reason behind this trend could be the significance of Binance Futures as a way to gauge the overall market sentiment.When the price of Bitcoin sees a large price movement, Binance Futures often sees large liquidations because of its high open interest.Binance Futures consistently remain as one of the top three futures exchanges by open interest alongside CME and OKEx.Hence, when Binance Futures begins to show signs of overheating momentum, the market could turn cautious in the near term.In the short-term, traders are pinpointing the $23,350 resistance level as the key roadblock for Bitcoin.Technical analyst Cantering Clark said that if Bitcoin surpasses $23,350, an uptrend would likely ensue. He said:"
216,"This week various media reported that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was considering whether or not legislation governing self-custodied wallets should be implemented.This led some analysts and crypto pundits to speculate whether or not this would impact Bitcoin, and the current bullish momentum that has been driving crypto prices higher. The threat of new crypto sector-focused regulations is a credible event which has negatively impacted crypto prices in the past, but this time around there are a fewreasons why the proposed rule probably will not lead to a Bitcoin price crash. Initially, industry executives expressed major concerns when Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong shared what he had heard about the planned rule.Last week we heard rumors that the U.S. Treasury and Secretary Mnuchin were planning to rush out some new regulation regarding self-hosted crypto wallets before the end of his term. I'm concerned that this would have unintended side effects, and wanted to share those concerns.These worries were amplified when Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire told Ryan Selkis that the possible regulation could be detrimental to the entire cryptocurrency sector. The comments from the two industry heavyweights led the entire industry to become cautious about the planned rule proposal.However, recent reports suggest that the rule might require multiple transactions that are equivalent to $10,000 a day to be reported by financial institutions. Compared with the initial rumors about the rule, it is arguably less rigorous than it appeared. In fact, some experts say the proposed rule is similar to the existing FATF travel rule.Considering that the rule could be less restrictive than the initially planned regulation, and the fact that the market has had sufficient time to act on it, it's possible that the market has priced it in at this point.There are two main paths Mnuchin could take to introduce the self-custody wallet regulation. First, he could take the conventional route of rulemaking, which requires a hearing and a 30-day period.If Mnuchin takes the conventional approach, the proposal would have to be released this week before the current Presidential term comes to an end.Alternatively, Mnuchin could aim for a “good cause” way of passing the regulation. This would allow Mnuchin to speed up the process. Jason Civalleri, an attorney, said:At this point, it is more likely for Mnuchin to take the conventional approach. To take the “good cause” method, he would need to find sufficient evidence to prove that crypto sees significant criminal activity.Hence, the probability that the proposed rule would be introduced in the upcoming days remains the highest, which would be optimistic for Bitcoin. Matt Odell, a Bitcoin and privacy advocate, said:"
217,"Christopher Wood, the global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, has dumped five percent of their physical gold position in order to buy Bitcoin (BTC). This move shows that a growing number of institutional investors consider Bitcoin to be at par or a better store of value than gold.Wood also said that if Bitcoin were to have a big correction, he would buy more. The fact that institutional investors are content purchasing in the $16,000 to $20,000 range suggests that institutional investors are not worried about a pullback as they view it as an opportunity to accumulate for the long term.One River Digital Asset Management also recently revealed a $600 million bet on Bitcoin and Ether. CEO Eric Peters, said the hedge fund plans to buy more Bitcoin and Ether in the first half of next year to take the total allocation in the assets to $1 billion.This is further signal that the institutional demand for crypto assets is likely to remain high going into 2021.Nigel Green, founder and CEO of deVere Group, expects Bitcoin’s bull run to continue in 2021 as the digital asset's rally will be supported by the influx of “some of the world’s biggest institutions.” Green expects Bitcoin’s price to at least rise by 50% or even possibly double next year.However, not everyone is convinced about the prospects of Bitcoin. Billionaire Mark Cuban said that Bitcoin is not a hedge “against doomsday scenarios” and it is “unlikely to replace fiat currency anytime soon.”Will Bitcoin correct in the short term and give a bragging opportunity to the naysayers, or will it continue to rally higher? Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin (BTC) picked up momentum after it crossed the $20,000 psychological barrier on Dec. 16. The up-move continued on Dec. 17 and the price hit a new all-time high at $23,795.29.The BTC/USD pair has formed an inside day candlestick pattern today, which usually acts as a continuation pattern. This pattern suggests that bulls are taking a break after the aggressive buying of the past two days.However, the positive thing is that the price is close to the recent high, which suggests that bulls have not closed their positions in a hurry even after the sharp rally of the past two days. This indicates that traders expect the rally to extend further to $25,000 and then $26,000.Although it is difficult to call a top in a market backed by strong momentum, the pair could face strong headwinds at $26,000.On the downside, the critical level to watch is $20,000. If the bulls flip this level to support, then the next leg of the uptrend could resume. However, if the price dips below the $20,000 support and fails to recover the pair could witness a deeper correction.Ether (ETH) broke above the $622.807 resistance on Dec. 16, which completed the ascending triangle pattern. This bullish setup has a target objective of $763.614.However, after the breakout from a pattern, the price usually retests the breakout level. Even in this case, the price has corrected to $622.807.If the bulls can flip $622.807 to support, it will suggest that traders are buying at this level. That increases the prospects of the continuation of the uptrend. The rising moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) above 64 suggest that bulls have the upper hand.This positive view will be invalidated if the price dips and sustains below $622.807. Such a move could suggest that the recent breakout was a bull trap. This narrative will be further strengthened if the price breaks below the trendline of the triangle.XRP broke above the downtrend line and the 20-day exponential moving average ($0.54) on Dec. 16, which suggests that the correction could be over. The bulls attempted to sustain the momentum on Dec. 17 but faced stiff resistance above $0.65.The inside day Doji candlestick pattern today hints at indecision among the bulls and the bears. If the price dips below the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USD pair may drop to $0.50 and then again to $0.435420.If that happens, it will suggest that the pair may remain range-bound for a few days. A breakout of $0.6794 will invalidate this view.The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI oscillating between 43 and 57 also point to a possible consolidation in the near term.Litecoin (LTC) surged above the symmetrical triangle on Dec. 16 and followed that up with another strong move on Dec. 17. This move pushed the price above the $93.9282 resistance and the $100 psychological level.The long wick on Dec. 17 candlestick shows profit booking at higher levels but the bulls did not allow the price to stay below the $100 support. This suggests that traders are buying on every minor dip.However, the long wick on today’s candlestick shows that traders are again booking profits at higher levels. This is an early signal of exhaustion and if volume dries up the LTC/USD pair could correct to $93.9282 in the next few days.If the price rebounds off this support, it will confirm it as the new floor. That could start the journey towards the next target level at $140. Conversely, if the price breaks below $93.9282, the pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($84).Bitcoin Cash (BCH) broke above the $322.08 resistance on Dec. 17 but the price turned down from $331.69. This shows that the bears are aggressively defending this resistance.The inside day candlestick pattern today shows that the uncertainty continues as bulls buy on dips and bears sell on rallies. The rising 20-day EMA ($286) and the RSI above 59 suggest an advantage to the bulls.If bulls can propel the price above $338, the BCH/USD pair could rally to $371.70 and then to $400. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $300, the pair may drop to the 20-day EMA. Such a move could keep the pair range-bound for a few days.Chainlink (LINK) formed a Doji candlestick pattern on Dec. 17 and has made another one today. This shows indecision among the bulls and the bears, but the positive sign is that the price has sustained above the $13.28 support for the past two days.If the bulls can push the price above $15, the LINK/USD pair could rise to $16.39. A breakout of this resistance could signal the start of a new uptrend that may retest the high at $20.1111.The flat moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint do not point to a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price again turns down from $15, the pair may remain range-bound for a few days.Cardano (ADA) turned down from the $0.175 overhead resistance on Dec. 17 but the bears could not prolong the correction. The bulls purchased the minor dip and are likely to again try and push the price above $0.175.The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that bulls are in control. If the bulls can drive and sustain the price above 0.175, the next leg of the uptrend could begin. The next target on the upside is $0.20 and then $0.26.Contrary to this assumption, if the price again turns down from $0.175, a drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.152) is possible. A strong bounce off this support will increase the likelihood of a break above $0.175.However, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the ADA/USD pair could drop to $0.14 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($0.131).The bulls pushed Polkadot (DOT) above the $5.5899 overhead resistance on Dec. 17 but could not sustain the higher levels. This shows that the bears are aggressively defending this resistance.However, the bulls have not given up much ground and are likely to make another attempt to push the price above $5.5899. If they can sustain the price above this resistance, the DOT/USD pair could rally to $6.0857 and then to $6.8619.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 57 suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside. This positive view will invalidate if the price again gets rejected at $5.5899. In that case, a drop to the 20-day EMA ($5) is possible.Binance Coin (BNB) continues to oscillate between the $32 resistance and the $25.6652 support. In an established range, traders sell when the price nears the resistance as they expect the price to turn down.However, the bulls purchased the dip to the moving averages today and will now make one more attempt to push the price above $32.If they succeed in sustaining the price above the range, the BNB/USD pair could start the next leg of the uptrend that could retest the all-time high at $39.5941.On the contrary, if the price again turns down from $32, it will suggest that bulls have not been able to overpower the bears. That could keep the pair inside the range for a few more days.Stellar Lumens (XLM) broke out and closed above the $0.18 resistance on Dec. 16. This move suggests that the correction may be over. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone also suggest that bulls have the upper hand.However, the bears have not thrown in the towel yet. The long wick on the Dec. 17 candlestick shows that the bears are selling on rallies.If the price rebounds off the current levels or the 20-day EMA ($0.168), the bulls will once again try to resume the uptrend. A close above $0.21 could result in a retest of the $0.231655 resistance.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the XLM/USD pair may consolidate in a large range for a few days before starting the next trending move.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

218,"Cryptocurrency derivatives platform Deribit is letting traders bet on a $100,000 Bitcoin (BTC) price — and within a certain period, no less. As of Thursday, Deribit users can bet on the flagship cryptocurrency reaching $100,000 via options contracts that expire on Sept. 24, 2021. The lofty strike price was established following a surge in daily trade volumes. In options trading, a strike price is the value that a derivative contract can be bought or sold when it's exercised. Deribit processed 754,123 BTC options contracts in November, according to marketing material that appeared on Twitter Thursday.The exchange is currently listed as the tenth-largest crypto derivatives exchange on CoinMarketCap, or CMC. Volumes reported by CMC may not reflect actual market turnover due to methodological issues with how the data are collected and reported.Crypto data analytics provider Skew reported Thursday that Deribit is the largest derivatives market for Bitcoin trades. The firm also said that daily options trading in BTC surpassed $1 billion for the first time.Deribit tells Bitcoin.com:Bitcoin’s coveted six-figure moonshot is considered a foregone conclusion by its most ardent supporters. What some have found shocking as of late is that many of the most bullish forecasts are coming from outside the BTC community.Citibank has seemingly predicted a $318,000 BTC price next year, while Guggenheim has called for a $400,000 valuation. Meanwhile, JPMorgan says Bitcoin could soon receive a $600 billion catalyst, which would catapult prices sharply higher.Bitcoin's roller coaster year looks to end on a positive note as the digital currency vies for new all-time highs. The price came within striking distance of $24,000 on Thursday before pulling back modestly. Bitcoin is currently trading below $22,700, having gained 220% year-to-date at time of publication."
219,"The open interest on Bitcoin (BTC) options contracts has reached a new all-time high at $6.5 billion on Dec. 17. That figure represents a three-fold increase from 90 days ago and is proof that the market has grown significantly in the past 6-months. Investors must keep in mind that even though a $6.5 billion open interest is an impressive number, it doesn't necessarily mean that professional investors are bullish or bearish.Call options provide buyers with an opportunity to leverage without running the risk of liquidation. Meanwhile, put options are an excellent way to hedge against a potential future sell-off. Thus, both add to the total open interest seen in the current figure.A more interesting fact to analyze is the options profile set to expire over the next 30 days completely differs from longer-term ones. Bitcoin's 63% bull run since November certainly contributed to this distortion, as $22,000 and higher strikes were not frequent.Therefore, such a sizeable open interest near the $16,000 strike can be explained by pre-rally market levels.Notice how after the recent rally, a decent volume has gone through $24,000 and $28,000, totaling 14,800 BTC contracts. Unlike the ultra-bullish call options above $32,000, these options are not cheap.This means someone effectively paid up $1,200 for the opportunity to acquire Bitcoin for $24,000 on Dec. 25, less than ten days from the expiry. For a comparison, that's ten times more than the $32,000 call option traded.Although it’s still early to understand how professional traders are positioned for Friday's Dec. 25 expiry, the premiums paid on these options seem excessive for such a short period.A very different pattern emerges when focusing exclusively on longer than 30-day expiries that favor ultra-bullish calls. Unlike short-term ones, these aren't cheap regardless of requiring 70% or higher upside.This time around, the $36,000 strike dominates, followed by the incredibly optimistic $52,000 level. Those options require 40% or higher upside to 52,900 BTC contracts, totaling $1.2 billion in open interest.The largest open interest position for the $36,000 call option stands at the Jan. 29 expiry. Those traded for as high as $690 a piece recently, thus not a cheap gamble available for anyone.Instead of gauging investors' optimism by how high call options have been bought, investors should turn to the skew indicator. One should keep in mind that ultra-bullish options are relatively cheap for 40 to 50 days calendar expiries such as Jan. 25.When analyzing options, the 30% to 20% delta skew is the single most relevant gauge. This indicator compares call (buy) and put (sell) options side-by-side.A 10% delta skew indicates that call options are trading at a premium to the more bearish/neutral put options. On the other hand, a negative skew translates to a higher cost of downside protection, indicating bearishness.According to the data shown above, the last time some bearish sentiment emerged was Nov. 26, while BTC crashed 15%, testing the $16,200 level. This was followed by a period of extreme optimism as the 30-20% delta skew surpassed 25.This indicator is the most substantial evidence a trader interested in derivatives needs to recognize the current sentiment surrounding Bitcoin options. Whenever it surpasses 15, it reflects fear of potential price upside from arbitrage desks and professionals, and as a result is considered bullish.Therefore, the recent adjustment to 10 from 15 points as Bitcoin reached a new all-time high at $23,888 indicates a healthy market where investors have yet to become overly optimistic.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

220,"Bitcoin price surpassed $20,000 with ease on its third retest, buoyed by a surge in buy volume. Following the breakout, analysts anticipate the dominant cryptocurrency to eventually rise to the mid-$30,000s. However, in the short term, the expectations of a pullback are growing.There are compelling arguments for both short-term bull and bear cases. Traders who are highly optimistic in the near term state that the surge past $20,000 has confirmed a new bull trend. With no technical resistance above it, a continuation of the rally is anticipated. Because there is no historical data to rely on above $20,000, Bitcoin (BTC) has entered unprecedented territory.Analysts who are short-term cautious expect Bitcoin to face some retracement in the foreseeable future. The $20,000 level remains an attractive support level because it is the previous all-time high reached in December 2017. A retest of the previous peak would be a textbook technical pattern, which would reset everything and make the derivatives market less crowded.The options market is pricing a potential Bitcoin rally up to between $36,000 and $50,000 in the medium term. This shows that many options traders are expecting the Bitcoin rally to continue into 2021. A larger uptrend in early to mid-2021 would mean that BTC replicates the post-halving trend it saw in 2017. In 2016, Bitcoin saw its second block reward halving, and 15 months after that, it peaked at around $20,000.Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Bequant, told Cointelegraph that the options market pricing Bitcoin at $36,000 during a rally does not necessarily mean traders expect it to reach $36,000. For example, he explained that the probability of the $36,000 strike is currently at 12%, which is relatively low. Hence, while $36,000 and $52,000 could materialize, for now, the probability still remains low:Guy Hirsch, managing director for the United States at eToro, said that options interest suggests a rally to the mid-$30,000s could occur. But Hirsch emphasized that it is too early to call a peak for Bitcoin, especially considering that it has just surpassed the all-time high. It has been less than 72 hours since BTC broke past its record high, and it has yet to establish a support level and near-term resistance levels.Both Vinokourov and Hirsch anticipate that dips are likely to occur following the recent rally. Historically, throughout the bull cycles seen in 2017 and 2019, Bitcoin saw 20% to 40% pullbacks, which were useful to reset the derivatives market. Pullbacks can make rallies more sustainable because they prevent uptrends from becoming overheated and overwhelmed with buyers.Hirsch told Cointelegraph that $20,000 and $15,000 are potential areas Bitcoin could correct to if confidence dwindles. But if Bitcoin’s momentum continues to strengthen, he believes Bitcoin could simply consolidate higher. Even if pullbacks occur, Hirsch emphasized that dips would be short-lived due to the clear increase in institutional demand. He explained: “Either we consolidate and move higher as institutions take advantage of the buying opportunity, or confidence falls and we see a drop possibly to as low as $15,000, as some including even JP Morgan have suggested.”Generally, analysts expect large corrections, if they occur, to be bought up by institutional investors quickly. Vinokourov said that if profit-taking occurs, it would be the institutional investors rebalancing their portfolios. Hence, in this scenario, retail investors could begin buying the dip, with institutional investors accumulating later on. Although institutions have continued to buy throughout 2020, some institutions and accredited investors have been buying since $4,000, according to Vinokourov, who added:Bitcoin has continuously rallied since September, with one major dip to $16,000 in November. Other than that, BTC has not seen large pullbacks or long squeezes like in 2017. This has some analysts pondering whether the market dynamics have changed for Bitcoin and large corrections are less likely to happen.One of the main reasons behind the lack of severe corrections is Bitcoin’s declining reliance on the futures market. Spot volumes have been growing, fueled by the rising institutional demand across venues such as Grayscale, CME and Bakkt. Hence, long and short squeezes could have a smaller impact on the price trend of Bitcoin.The most favorable trend for Bitcoin, according to Hirsch, would be the establishment of a clear support area and lowering volatility, at least for a while. The volatility of Bitcoin has been increasing intensely for a prolonged period, which has rattled the markets every time a major price movement has occurred. According to Hirsch: “It’s important to realize that, with each passing month, we have been consistently hitting higher highs and higher lows. The latter is important because it is a strong indicator of increased adoption.”"
221,"The defense team of Alexander Vinnik, an alleged Bitcoin launderer who was sentenced to a five-year prison term, disagrees with the court’s decision.According to a Dec. 18 report by Russian news agency Kommersant, Vinnik’s attorney Frederic Belot has appealed the French court’s judgement, arguing that the defendant was not involved in any money laundering operations.Citing a Dec. 6 judgement charging Vinnik for “money laundering as part of an organized criminal group,” Belot emphasized that no “criminal group” consists of one person. “The court did not name a single name even supposedly belonging to this group,” Belot reportedly said.According to Belot, Vinnik was rather a victim of his anonymous “employers” at now-defunct crypto exchange BTC-e, as his involvement in managing the platform has not been proved: “Vinnik was just a full-time trader and he did not participate, at least consciously, in any money laundering operations,” Belot declared.Vinnik’s defense expects the court to hear the appeal in four months, Belot noted. Lawyers also argued that the judgement by the Paris court was based on an investigation subject to interference from United States intelligence agencies. According to the report, Vinnik faces a 50-year prison term in the U.S. in the event of potential extradition.Colloquially known as “Mr. Bitcoin,” Vinnik is the convicted creator of a global illegal scheme that laundered over $4 billion worth of capital flows through BTC-e. More than three years after his arrest in Greece, Vinnik’s trial finally happened in early December 2020. Vinnik previously denied his involvement at BTC-e, claiming that he was just an employee at the firm."
222,"In the space of 12 months, DeFi has become a $15 billion industry — spawning governance tokens that are now worth even more than Bitcoin.But the rapid explosion of protocols has brought considerable growing pains… and concerns that the sector is not on a sustainable footing. When interest rates in conventional savings accounts stand at a fraction of a percent, while yield farming generates triple-digit returns, it’s inevitable that questions will emerge about whether this is a bubble that’s fit to burst.As Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently pointed out on a podcast with Ryan Sean Adams, such sky-high interest rates are “just a temporary promotion that was created by printing a bunch of compound tokens, and you just can’t keep printing compound tokens forver.”SEBA, a regulated crypto bank in Switzerland, hit the nail on the head in September when it released a report that asks this: “What happens when the music stops?”Its analysts warned that the current yield farming trend in DeFi is not sustainable — and went on to predict that only a small handful of protocols would survive in the long-term. Indeed, Yearn.finance has already embarked on a plethora of mergers in recent weeks designed to bolster development resources and expand its liquidity pool.Although SEBA went to great lengths to stress that not all yield farming lacks merit, the company added: “Yield farmers made money by hopping from one protocol to another. As long as there are buyers for new protocol tokens, yield farmers can continue jumping among protocols. When buyers stop accepting the other side of the trade, this deranged activity will be arrested. Clearly, this trend is not sustainable.”It pointed to SushiSwap, a fork of Uniswap, as an example. Following its launch, a myriad of other food-themed forks emerged. “When markets took a bad turn, all except SUSHI corrected by more than 99% and became almost worthless,” SEBA’s analysts wrote.The bank ultimately drew parallels with the dizzying ICO boom seen in 2017 and 2018 — where most ambitious projects failed to stand the test of time.  Unfortunately, headaches in the DeFi space don’t end here. This year, Ethereum has established dominance as the main blockchain where protocols are based — and according to DappRadar, this network held 96% of total transaction volume in the DeFi ecosystem in the third quarter of 2020.As reported by Cointelegraph in September, this led to alarm bells being raised over Ethereum’s scalability issues — with transaction fees surging to an all-time high. Although it is hoped that Eth2 will dramatically increase the network’s capacity, experts warn it could be years before the transition to proof-of-stake is complete… and by then, the industry may have had little choice but to look for alternative blockchains.The research company BraveNewCoin touched upon these challenges in a recent report, where it identified 18 serious non-financial risks facing the DeFi sector.“Scalability risk is also the risk that Ethereum itself will not scale properly for DeFi protocols to be able to function sustainably over time. If network activity is too high (as it has been recently) it deters smaller investors and removes the ‘accessible’ aspect of DeFi — because smaller investors are earning rewards that are less than the fees required to obtain them. Not only does scalability risk impact investors, but it also impacts protocols,” BNC wrote.And all of this is before we mention the countless smart contract vulnerabilities that have led to millions of dollars in capital from being sucked out of the DeFi ecosystem by malicious actors. High-profile incidents appear to happen on an almost weekly basis — affecting investor confidence and jeopardizing the industry’s long-term potential.According to Unifi — which has already launched on five different blockchains — change is needed if the sector has any prospect of establishing a meaningful presence in the crypto industry into the 2020s and beyond.At present, the team behind this protocol believe the space is deeply flawed. On most DeFi platforms, those who make the most rewards are those who leave a platform first and move on to the next thing — creating distrust and causing confidence to evaporate. Resultantly, the top-ranking protocols with the highest total value locked are constantly changing.“Unifi is custom built to be an efficient, rewarding, and sustainable system. Capitalizing on the strengths of each blockchain Unifi is on, we have created a system where all chains contribute together to form a complete tokenomics model, ensuring the success of the entire protocol,” Unifi CEO Juliun Brabon said. Unifi says it isn’t a clone of any existing protocol — and instead, the project says it delivers a sustainable tokenomics system that is more akin to a blockchain than a conventional DeFi protocol. This is demonstrated by their governance token, UNFI, which incorporates proof-of-stake into its model. Unifi offers loyalty rewards to liquidity providers and traders, encouraging a sense of community instead of being a race to be the first out. The protocol adds that its multi-chain approach results in an ever-increasing audience with each new blockchain supported — with Ethereum, Tron, Ontology, Harmony and the Binance Smartchain united through the use of base tokens. In the last quarter of 2020 and continuing through 2021, Unifi is set to launch on additional blockchains — and new DeFi services, such as cross-chains swaps and a lending platform, will be released.In order to gain cross-industry support, Unifi says it has received investment from over 20 blockchain venture capital firms, including four major exchanges — Binance, MXC, Bibox and HBTC. Unifi’s governance token, UNFI was recently featured on Binance Launchpool.As 2021 begins, all eyes will be on DeFi to see whether it can maintain its current size — let alone build on the astronomical growth that was seen in 2020. Sustainability is shaping up to be crucial in making this happen, and encouraging user loyalty could be the key to success.Disclaimer.

223,"Peer-to-peer Bitcoin (BTC) volume in Nigeria continues to rise as Africa’s largest economy remains a bastion for crypto adoption. According to Quartz Africa, data from the Bitcoin P2P marketplace Paxful show the country ranks second only to the United States in trading volume.Since 2015, Nigerians have traded over 60,200 BTC on the Paxful platform amounting to about $566 million in volume over the period. Data from Coin Dance shows trading activity for the week ending Dec. 12 at 886.3 million naira (about $2.3 million).Bitcoin’s growing appeal among Nigerians is likely due to a confluence of factors, chief of which are stringent forex policies by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) as well as the rapid decline of the country’s fiat currency — the naira. In a communique issued on Dec. 16, the CBN directed international money transfer operators (IMTOs) to cease processing diaspora remittance payments in naira.According to the central bank, the move is in line with the new policy of allowing Nigerians to receive international payments in their domiciliary accounts. The central bank also issued a notice declaring that two IMTOs — TransferWise and Azimo were not authorized to operate in the country.While the CBN may be reversing some of its more stringent forex micromanagement policies, the scarcity caused by these previous banking laws seems to have pushed more Nigerians into alternative currencies. Indeed, Bitcoin adoption tends to soar in countries facing rising inflation and declining confidence in the national fiat currency.With a median age of 18 years, Bitcoin likely offers an alternative for the tech-savvy young population against the mainstream banking and finance architecture under the control of the government. During the October protests against police brutality as the government ordered banks to freeze the accounts of the movement’s backers, protestors switched seamlessly to BTC and crypto donations.According to data from Google Trends, Nigeria is still number one in terms of global search interest for Bitcoin. However, regulatory clarity for the crypto and blockchain space is yet to materialize in the country.Back in September, the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced plans to create a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the country. At the time, the Commission declared that it would regulate crypto assets as securities unless proven otherwise."
224,"Bitcoin (BTC) has gained 30% in a week and topped out at $23,777 on Dec. 16 — but hardly anyone in the world knows yet, data suggests.According to charts tracking public awareness of what Bitcoin has done recently, interest is still a fraction of what it was during its run to previous all-time highs exactly three years ago in 2017.Anyone who regularly reads crypto Twitter, also known informally as ""CT,"" may have the impression that the entire social network revolves around Bitcoin price action in 2020.This is not the case, however, as statistics show that beyond CT, Bitcoin's highs and lows this year are hardly a trend.The status quo is only now beginning to change, but according to analytics resource TheTIE, tweet levels are only roughly where they were in January 2018, already after Bitcoin hit just under $20,000.While roughly moving in step with price action, Twitter activity is indicative of a curious reversal in sentiment when it comes to Bitcoin and the mainstream. Consumers seeing headlines about price bubbles and criminal machinations genuinely appear to have dismissed crypto altogether — with the exception of the odd surprise publicity campaign.The theory holds true when looking at the popularity of Bitcoin on Wikipedia. Pageviews in December 2020 are but a small uptick on an otherwise flat landscape.Compared to January 2018, there is no contest — appetite for learning what Bitcoin is was an order of magnitude higher than today.Interestingly, even the crisis surrounding Covid-19 and its impact on markets in March, combined with Bitcoin's record recovery to all-time highs, failed to catch the attention of the majority.Lastly, a global measure of what internet users are searching for underscores how little exposure Bitcoin has right now — and the potential for it to transform.In what is perhaps the most surprising chart of all, according to Google Trends data, the term ""Bitcoin"" is less popular this week than in earlier in December or even November.Even May's block subsidy halving event proved more popular than this week's all-time price highs, suggesting once again that people inclined to Google about Bitcoin at all already have some specific interest in cryptocurrency more generally. Mainstream consumers have no incentive to become involved — or so they think.The evidence all points to the fact that Bitcoin, despite being a different asset to what it was three years ago, has not even touched mainstream consciousness. Institutions, however, are already ahead of the game.Commenting on the phenomenon, popular Twitter account Polkadot Brown said that his personal contacts are only prepared to buy — paradoxically — once BTC/USD hits new all-time highs.""This is the mentality of most retail investors,"" he wrote."
225,"The United States Department of the Treasury is looking for expert advice on cryptocurrencies to tackle legal challenges associated with the industry.The U.S. Treasury’s bureau, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, has posted two job applications for crypto policy officers. The agency is seeking professional expertise on crimes related to digital assets.Posted on Dec. 12, the two full-time and permanent positions target experts specializing in crypto-related finance threats and risk in order to “assist in the development of policy responses to these challenges.” FinCEN expects that new policy officers will provide insights on a wide array of areas like digital identity, regulatory and financial technology.The authority said that GS-14 and GS-13 positions require at least one year of specialized experience at a related level of difficulty, in accordance with grade levels in the Federal service. FinCEN specified that salary for both positions ranges from $102,663 to $157,709 per year.FinCEN emphasized that it expects new experts to perform “extremely complex and sensitive assignments” related to crypto, including the issuance of advisories and other guidance to financial institutions.FinCEN’s latest move apparently demonstrates that the authority is somewhat receptive to the industry's feedback on the rumored ban of the so-called “self-hosted” crypto wallets by the U.S. Treasury.As reported in early December, the rumored blockade envisions rules to ban or severely restrict ""self-hosted"" cryptocurrency wallets — a somewhat ambiguous categorization of self-custodied private key. On Dec. 9, several members of Congress representatives, including Warren Davidson and Tom Emmer, voiced their opposition to the allegedly upcoming ban, arguing the action would hinder American leadership and technological innovation.Major industry figures like Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire subsequently joined the effort, stressing that such an initiative does not address actual risks in the crypto industry."
226,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) parabolic surge in 2020 will not hurt major traditional assets like gold, according to Goldman Sachs.One of the world’s biggest investment banks, Goldman Sachs reportedly sent a note to investors, reassuring its clients that Bitcoin does not pose an existential threat to gold, Bloomberg reports Dec. 18. “We do not see evidence that Bitcoin’s rally is cannibalizing gold’s bull market and believe the two can coexist,” the company wrote.Goldman Sachs still admitted that Bitcoin’s ongoing rally could steal some demand from gold investors, stating:Amid Bitcoin breaking its new all-time highs in December, global investors are increasingly moving into Bitcoin. Christopher Wood, global head of equity strategy at independent investment bank Jeffries Financial, has reportedly cut his gold exposure to buy more Bitcoin. According to a Dec. 18 report by Indian news agency Business Standard, the renowned market analyst is trimming his gold investment for the first time in several years. Wood wrote in a note to investors that his BTC allocations account for 5% of his portfolio:According to the report, Wood plans to further increase exposure to crypto in case of corrections. Still, the analyst took a similar stance to Goldman Sachs by remaining bullish on gold as well. “This does not mean that GREED & fear is going to give up on gold. And the yellow metal should rally again if the Fed stays dovish in the face of the dramatic cyclical recovery that is coming on the other side of the pandemic, in line with GREED & fear’s base case,” Wood said.On Dec. 17, Bitcoin posted another historic all-time high, rising above $23,000. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $23,133, according to Cointelegraph’s BTC price index. In contrast, gold prices dropped on Thursday, with both spot hold and futures tumbling 0.3%. Gold lost about 10% from its all-time high in August of $2,076."
227,"Bitcoin (BTC) may be circling all-time highs, but a new storm is brewing around its smallest subunit, the satoshi or “sat.”As more first-time investors pile in to BTC, attention is once again highlighting the fact that many still think Bitcoin cannot be divided and is “too expensive.”A frequent point of debate throughout Bitcoin’s recent history, the problem of how to solve this misconception and introduce sats to a wider audience is now back in the spotlight.This week, statistician Willy Woo publicly approached listings site CoinGecko with an appeal to make the tiny satoshi more visible.“Put up a smaller unit as the default on BTC on your site and see if it catches on. Let’s start a trend,” he offered.Woo was responding to an experience from Magic Internet Money podcast host Brad Mills, who had been told by a prospective buyer that they could not afford an entire Bitcoin.Satoshis are the smallest original subunit of Bitcoin, which is divisible by up to eight decimal places. At current prices, this makes a single satoshi worth around 0.02 cents. One dollar is worth 43 sats.A dedicated resource now shows how much BTC/USD must gain in order for the one sat to equal one cent. For this to happen, Bitcoin would need to challenge the United States’ M2 money supply cap, Woo said — Bitcoin would need to hit $1 million.Against that backdrop, a $23,000 Bitcoin price still seems modest. Nonetheless, some currencies have already fallen to satoshi parity of their own accord. In July, the Argentinian peso joined the Lebanese lira in seeing one sat equal their smallest unit of account.He further noted that beyond sats, so-called “millisats,” which exist on the Lightning Network, could be used should the need arise. Lightning remains the most widely-accepted best bet for Bitcoin scaling, and advances in its user experience will allow entry-level Bitcoiners to send tiny payments for next to no fees in the future.This is achieved by performing transactions off-chain and syncing them later, avoiding the need for miner fees and congesting the Bitcoin blockchain."
228,"Cash App, the Bitcoin-friendly payments application from U.S.-based financial services company Square, has teamed up with Grammy-nominated rapper Megan Thee Stallion on a $1 million Bitcoin (BTC) giveaway.Megan announced the promotional campaign via Twitter on Dec. 17. The post has received more than 60,000 likes and 8,800 retweets at the time of writing. The rapper encouraged her followers to post “#BITCOINMEG” in order to be a part of the giveaway.The post does not make it clear how much BTC each person will receive, saying: “I’m giving $1 MILLION in Bitcoin to as many hotties as I can.” Numerous replies on Twitter feature screenshots from winners indicating they had received 50,000 satoshis each, worth roughly $11.40 as of this writing.Thanks cashapp and Meg lol I’ll hold on to this until my kids are grown pic.twitter.com/f0VOu1u369It appears that many of Meg’s followers are not aware of the value of the Bitcoin individual users receive, with replies to her post containing ultrasound images of unborn babies, links to college application forms, a variety of hard luck stories, and photos of smiling children gathered by Christmas trees in a bid to tug on the rapper’s heartstrings.One user claimed to have purchased a Telsa after misreading that he would receive $50,000.I thought this said $50,000 when I first glanced at it and I already ordered a tesla, can you help me out again? @theestallion pic.twitter.com/lV7Ieug0vdAmid the cries for assistance, computer science major “William Clemente III” urged Megan’s followers to hodl their new-found satoshis, sharing an image detailing the inflation of German Marks relative to gold over the past century alongside the plea:The campaign appears to have been largely successful in its aim of driving Bitcoin and Cash App adoption among noncrypto natives, with many of Megan’s fans stating they downloaded Cash App exclusively to participate in the giveaway, and others indicating they intend to research crypto further after receiving their first satoshis.

229,"Bitcoin (BTC) influencer Pierre Rochard has called on lawmakers to prevent more than $1.6 billion worth of seized Bitcoin from being auctioned, proposing instead that confiscated coins be put into a strategic BTC reserve.Rochard, a Bitcoin maximalist behind the recent controversy over Ether’s (ETH) total supply, wants legislators to draft and pass a bill containing amendments to the Judiciary Act of 1789 that would allow the United States Marshals Service to hold onto any Bitcoin it has received.In a blog post published on Dec. 16, Rochard warned against the auctioning of 69,370 Bitcoin seized by the IRS in November from an alleged Silk Road hacker, noting that the U.S. Attorney’s Office has filed a civil complaint for forfeiture of the BTC.Speaking to Cointelegraph, Rochard emphasized the “urgent” need to update the legislation, asserting he expects the U.S. Marshals Service to win its forfeiture case and auction off the Bitcoin “within the next six months.”“We need to get this law passed very quickly so that we can stop the auction,” he said.In his blog, Rochard emphasized that the past auctions of more than 144,000 Bitcoin in 2014 and 2015 generated only $122 million, while those same crypto assets would today fetch more than $3.32 billion.While the coins seized in November are worth $1.6 billion today, Rochard suggests the United States will reap more value by holding onto the Bitcoin for the longer term, urging lawmakers to allow “Congress time to deliberate on the disposition of this unique asset.”Rochard told Cointelegraph Bitcoin will soon play a “crucial” role in the treasury of national governments, predicting that “we will see governments develop large sovereign wealth funds of Bitcoin over the coming decade.”“If the U.S. wants to maintain its leadership, both financially and also in science and technology, then we should develop a Bitcoin reserve fund at the federal level,” he said, adding:“In the first instance, get the seized coins into it, but then as we move forward, we’re going to want to add to that reserve as well.”"
230,"Litecoin (LTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are rallying strongly as Bitcoin (BTC) fights to stay above $23,800. Many analysts say the surge in large-cap altcoins is directly connected to Bitcoin's price action and historical data shows the two tend to move in tandem when BTC goes through bull and bear cycles.As altcoins begin to show signs of newfound momentum, traders are becoming even more confident in the strength of BTC’s trend.Throughout December, altcoins stagnated against Bitcoin, particularly as BTC struggled to break out of the $18,000 to $19,400 range but this was in an environment plagued by low volume.At the time, the cryptocurrency market’s volume was on the decline as Bitcoin continuously rejected a $19,400. As such, most of the volume went towards BTC and the altcoin market was temporarily deprived of trading activity.Historically, after a major Bitcoin rally, altcoins that existed in 2011 to 2014 tend to surge. These cryptocurrencies include the likes of Litecoin, Dogecoin, and XRP.One of the major reasons behind this altcoin rally is volume. Traders like to pump up altcoins, causing the volume to spike within a short period, and fuelimassive volatility.Since these cryptocurrencies have significant historical relevance, when a rally starts, their momentum typically lasts longer than other obscure, smaller-cap altcoins.Litecoin, as an example, rallied by over 57% in the past 7 days. In the same period, Bitcoin rose by 34%, despite surpassing $23,800 on major exchanges.One positive trend analysts have spotted is that altcoins are not seeing extreme volatility as they did in 2017. A pseudonymous trader called MoonOverlord said:According to Qiao Wang, a quant trader and DeFi researcher, Litecoin is not necessarily 'digital silver' in the same way analysts view Bitcoin as 'digital gold'. Since its launch, the go-to argument in favor of Litecoin was that it could act like silver if Bitcoin becomes gold 2.0. Wang said:Litecoin has various strong fundamental factors that could cause the market sentiment around it to improve. For instance, the Litecoin team is enabling MimbleWimble, a privacy solution initially designed for Bitcoin.However, these fundamental factors are not sufficient enough to fuel a 57% rally in a week. The primary reason behind the abrupt rally of large-cap altcoins is likely a volume play by high-net-worth investors and traders looking to make a quick buck in the aftermath of a Bitcoin rally."
231,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price rise has brought all sorts of comments out of the woodwork. Although many carry a bullish tint, some folks still doubt crypto as a new store of value class. David Rosenberg, the chief economist and strategist, as well as president, of the firm Rosenberg Research & Associates, recently described gold’s supply as more predictable than Bitcoin’s.""Everybody seems to believe that we're going to get to that 21 million cap on the supply constraint, but there's really nothing in the protocol to suggest that the supply of Bitcoin can't go up once we hit that limit,"" Rosenberg said in a Bloomberg interview on Thursday.Bitcoin’s set 21 million supply serves as one of its biggest selling points as a store of value. The asset also has a consistent flow of BTC entering into circulation that continue until that supply reaches 21 million. Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, wrote these parameters into Bitcoin’s code.Gold, on the other hand, depends on a number of factors. Its ultimate supply remains fairly uncertain, especially considering technological advancements that might lead to cheaper gold mining or further discovery.“The one thing we do know about gold, is we know the supply curve of gold with certainty,” Rosenberg claimed. “We don’t know the future supply curve of Bitcoin,” he added. “People think they know, but they don’t really know.”The economist also called BTC “a massive bubble,” saying that folks do not understand the asset’s supply or its creator. “It’s the classic follow the herd, extremely crowded trade,” he expressed.Meanwhile, other mainstream financial giants seem to have a better understanding of the asset and its scarcity effect, stockpiling sums of Bitcoin as part of an institutional buying trend."
232,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) parabolic rally is only just getting started, according to Nigel Green, founder and CEO of the Dubai-based financial advisory firm deVere Group.In an article that was published to Newsmax on Thursday, Green boldly proclaimed that Bitcoin will have another “record-breaking year” in 2021, with prices set to explode by at least 50% and “possibly double.”He made the prediction just as Bitcoin peaked above $23,000 on Thursday for the first time ever. The flagship digital currency would go on to trade as high as $23,777 on Bitstamp before experiencing a minor pullback.Based on current values, Green expects BTC to reach between $34,500 and $46,000 at some point next year. While acknowledging that Bitcoin won’t go up in a straight line, Green says the influx of institutional investors will lead to a groundswell of consumer interest, creating the perfect storm for price discovery.He wrote:Green’s deVere Group has spent quite a bit of time researching digital assets. Last month, the advisory firm released survey results showing that 73% of respondents are bullish towards cryptocurrencies, up from 68% in 2019. This so-called survey of millionaires underscores an important shift underway within smart-money circles.Institutional demand has been a primary catalyst behind Bitcoin’s bull market and is one of the main reasons why the current uptrend differs markedly from the blow-off top in 2017.Another major catalyst is the narrative that Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty — something Green touched upon in his article.He explained:"
233,"The crypto space has come a long way since its inception in 2008. Many areas have improved over the last 12 years, such as custody and exchange solutions. If you ask the early adopters of crypto, they can tell you stories about how hard it was to set up a wallet or how cumbersome it was to go to a meetup and exchange Bitcoin (BTC) without being scammed.Since then, things have changed for the better when it comes to user experience and user interface. Nowadays, creating a cryptocurrency wallet is as easy as setting up an email address. The same goes with purchasing crypto — hundreds of reliable exchanges have emerged in recent years, enabling the simple and secure purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies.While I could mention many more examples in the crypto space that have improved over the last decade, there is still a major problem with most products and services in the crypto space: they are not in a fully integrated setup. This is where crypto banks come in and will be game-changers for the crypto space.When I use the word integrated, I refer to two areas: the first is in regards to the crypto ecosystem, which offers a great number of interesting and promising applications and services that are distributed over several platforms and service providers; the second area is in the context of the financial services industry, where crypto banks offer an integrated solution due to being a gateway between the crypto space and the traditional finance space. I will cover both areas, as they are equally important to understand the revolutionary aspect of crypto banks.Related: Crypto banks are going to swallow fiat banks in 3 years — or even lessCrypto banks allow you to have your crypto assets and your traditional assets — such as fiat currencies, securities and more — in one account. Most people who are into crypto must deal with multiple third parties. You probably have some crypto assets on multiple exchanges, hardware wallets, on services providing non-bank lenders, and maybe you’ve already interacted with popular decentralized financial applications. Of course, we should also not forget about your fiat bank account, which you need in order to send funds to another party to purchase crypto assets and send your revenues back when selling crypto.Ultimately, you have your data and assets all over the place, thus dealing with multiple counterparty risks.Crypto banks provide that you have all your various crypto holdings, fiat currencies and services in one convenient bank account and are dealing with one service provider. While distributed ledgers are good, distributed control is bad. Crypto banks allow you to have centralized control over your decentralized assets. This eliminates the current risks many crypto investors have when dealing with a large number of different providers in different jurisdictions. With a crypto bank, you have one specialized gateway to multiple services and products.Even though the benefits of crypto assets are obvious, the number of traditional players such as pension funds, traditional hedge funds or family offices that go into crypto is surprisingly small. While recent announcements such as PayPal’s new crypto offering also show a trend of institutions entering the space, the large majority is not yet doing so. The reason for this is the lack of regulations and trusted partners to work with.Crypto banks are the perfect partner to help institutional players enter the crypto space, make investments into the world of digital assets, and securely store assets with a full, banking-grade service offering.Often, institutions want to invest in crypto, but their investors or board of directors are afraid of the risk involved in dealing with crypto assets. However, if a fund can partner up with a regulated bank that specializes in crypto, this can change the opinion of important stakeholders. This could increase the adoption of crypto immensely, as the mass market often follows the big players. Getting more and more institutional players into crypto will benefit the whole space.Crypto banks work as the bridge between the crypto world and the traditional financial services world. By having a banking license, a crypto bank fulfills the requirements and standards of the traditional financial services world while offering services and products in the crypto space. Creating a seamless connection between these two worlds will be game-changing.Beforehand, the crypto space used to be mostly unregulated. Similar to custody and exchange solutions, this has changed greatly, benefiting investors in particular. Most jurisdictions have created laws and regulations around crypto assets and are further designing new laws to integrate them into the regulated financial services world such as in Switzerland.A crypto bank is, by design, compliant with regulations. In order to receive a banking license, a project needs to fulfill all regulatory requirements stated and examined by the regulator. This gives crypto investors the security that there will be no crackdowns on such service providers. If we look at the current situations of several exchanges dealing with regulators for not being compliant, one can understand the benefit of working with a regulated partner.Globally, the trend is heading toward more regulation. I believe that in the future, offering crypto services without some sort of license will be forbidden. Crypto banks are perfectly positioned, as they have been compliant from the start. This is a major issue for players in the crypto space that have been around since before increased regulations emerged for crypto.Although Satoshi Nakomoto's original idea was to get rid of centralized intermediaries and one of the old mantras of Bitcoin was to “be your own bank,” crypto banks will ironically be the game-changer for crypto assets by offering all services and products in a compliant, one-stop-shop solution.Currently, Switzerland and the United States are leading when it comes to granting banking licenses for crypto projects, but it can be expected that the number of specialized banks will increase globally over the next few years as their value proposition becomes evident.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
234,"The crypto industry has come a long way in recent years — and now, digital currencies are easily accessible for most consumers around the world. But one exchange argues that there is a much bigger problem to solve: educating everyday consumers about how these assets can benefit them.Blocktrade says it plans to exponentially expand its user base in 2021 and is working to create an advanced platform that’s easy to use and functional. Underpinning this strategy is a wealth of educational resources that will help newcomers learn everything they need to know about the markets, key players, and the rules.Bernhard Blaha, an entrepreneur who previously launched the blockchain-based fantasy gaming platform Herosphere, has joined Blocktrade as CEO — and has ambitious plans to give everyone access to crypto markets in the coming years.The company says it is shedding light on cryptocurrencies — often regarded as a topic that is difficult for the public to understand because of its technical nature — by producing simple features that are easy to follow, and encouraging its community to pass on their knowledge.This involves delivering a clear understanding of what different tokens or coins are, what they stand for, and empowering consumers with the skills they need to make fair and sustainable valuations for themselves. From here, this knowledge can be used to make informed decisions, resulting in astute portfolio management.Blaha told Cointelegraph: “It is a great opportunity for me as CEO of Blocktrade to step on board at a time when we are in the middle of a bull market again. Digital assets will dominate the future of financial services and life in general and I will make sure that Blocktrade is a respected and successful player in the international market.”Blocktrade, which is about to raise additional funding through a securities offering, says it has now legally completed its move to a new jurisdiction and will resume operations under a new flag in the first quarter of 2021.The tools used for this offering are seen as a preview for an extensive suite of services that will be made available to others, making Blocktrade a driver for the whole market. “It is important for us to change our perspective and evaluate our understanding of how users want to use exchanges,” Blaha said. Blocktrade will meet its users’ wishes by growing a full ecosystem consisting of a variety of services, with the exchange as a central hub. The platform’s priorities include education, bringing a variety of services in one place, and innovating on existing systems.The exchange’s extensive roadmap for the future comes as the crypto market reaches a new level of maturity, with the likes of Bitcoin attracting newfound demand from institutions. Interest among retail investors has also grown, with digital assets subject to increasing coverage in mainstream media outlets of late.However, Blocktrade says most people are not participating in financial markets, including in the crypto space, because they lack the necessary knowledge to invest in confidence. The exchange quotes research that shows just 15.2% of adults in Germany currently have exposure to shares or equity funds — a picture that’s replicated internationally.Blaha says this is a subject that he feels passionately about. In 2018, he co-created the Digital Assets Association of Austria, which aims to support crypto start-ups and provide clear information to the general public and the business community.Blocktrade’s platform is available on the web, as well as through Google Play and Apple’s App Store. On its website, the exchange describes itself as “the go-to asset marketplace for everyone” — and champions the power of community and trust.With a focus on positioning itself as a digital asset marketplace rather than a pure crypto exchange, Blocktrade's features and frontend will be overhauled and relaunched with a focus on usability in the coming year. Blocktrade will be one of the first digital asset exchanges to integrate its own crowdfunding process for the fundraising of new projects — and to offer security offerings or security token offerings with licensing partners. In this way, the entire digitization process of assets, including openings in the secondary market, will be carried out on one platform. With digital assets set to have a more significant role in the global economy in the 2020s, Blocktrade says it is positioning itself as the future of finance.Disclaimer.

235,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) parabolic run has turned early miners into millionaires at a pace rarely seen before. Data from Glassnode shows that the number of Bitcoin addresses holding at least $1 million has skyrocketed to 66,540 this week — an increase of 150%.The rise of millionaire wallets is attributable to early miners retaining their Bitcoin over the years, culminating with the asset's latest surge above $20,000.As Glassnode tweeted on Thursday:The tweet was accompanied by a chart showing the number of millionaire addresses at or near record highs, with the last major peak coinciding with Bitcoin's late-2017 top:Bitcoin’s rally intensified on Thursday, zipping through $23,000 with very little resistance. On-chain data suggests another parabolic move could be imminent as BTC enters a new phase of price discovery. At current values, Bitcoin has a total market capitalization of nearly $430 billion.While early Bitcoin miners benefited from larger block rewards, they were operating in a market that was highly speculative and much more volatile than today. Today’s miners receive only 6.25 BTC per block but have greater assurances that their efforts will be rewarded as Bitcoin evolves from an obscure, esoteric concept to a mainstream digital asset.As Cointelegraph recently reported, cryptocurrency mining has evolved from a small endeavor to an industrial business as more entities look to capitalize on Bitcoin’s network infrastructure. Institutional inflows have made mining the digital asset more appealing than ever before. Currently, miners produce roughly 900 BTC per day — a quantity that is being quickly consumed by institutions and businesses, many of which are recent adopters."
236,"Amid an ongoing bull run of Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin options are hitting a new historical milestone. Bitcoin options are derivative contracts that grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell BTC at a predetermined price.According to data from Skew, Bitcoin options volumes crossed $1 billion on Dec. 16. Skew announced the news Thursday on Twitter, noting that Bitcoin options saw its “first $1 billion day.”Deribit, a major global crypto futures and options exchange, had the largest BTC options volume on the day at $879 million. The exchange has emerged as the most popular BTC options exchange, historically dominating the Bitcoin options market.Bit.com, the cryptocurrency derivative exchange owned by Bitmain-backed financial service platform Matrixport, saw the second largest BTC options volumes on the day. According to Skew, Bit.com’s maximum Bitcoin options volume accounted for about $84 million.Major global crypto exchange OKEx is the third top BTC options platform in the list, with a maximum options volume standing at $62 million on Dec. 16.The Bitcoin options market has seen a parabolic growth in 2020 as even weekly volume fell short of the $200 million mark at the start of the year.The volume growth comes alongside a massive increase in Bitcoin options open interest, or OI, which stands for the total number of contracts outstanding in the market and not yet settled. According to data from Skew, Bitcoin options’ OI almost touched a $6 billion threshold on Dec. 16, surging from around $600 million in early January.The OI for Bitcoin options has been steadily increasing over the course of 2020. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, high OI rates are related to the increasing liquidity of options as well as growing number of market participants. Spikes in Bitcoin options’ OI can also be fueled by larger macroeconomic events like the decentralized finance hype and long term effects of the Bitcoin halving on the markets. Options are a derivative tool with several possible uses, including insurance for existing positions against possible drops, or speculating on price with an asymmetric risk-return profile.New record-breaking volumes in the Bitcoin options market come amid Bitcoin price hitting its new historical highs. On Dec. 16, Bitcoin posted a new record high by surpassing the $20,000 threshold for the first time since 2017. The largest cryptocurrency continued gaining momentum, briefly rising to $23,500 on Dec. 17."
237,"Bitcoin (BTC) is precisely following price predictions and not making investors wait longer for gains this bull cycle, says famous quantitative analyst PlanB.In a tweet on Dec. 17, the creator of the stock-to-flow price model noted that in its current halving cycle, Bitcoin’s growth is going as planned.Despite huge volatility this week, stock-to-flow remains conspicuous in its ability to forecast the pace of change in Bitcoin price over extended periods.Critics have argued that Bitcoin cannot repeat its behavior from the last bull cycle — specifically from 2017 — and gains this time around will be less pronounced while taking longer to materialize.Comparing performance since May (the date of Bitcoin’s third block subsidy halving event) with the performance after the first and second halvings in 2012 and 2017, this year could not be a more textbook result, says PlanB.“R.I.P. ‘lengthening cycles’ and ‘diminishing returns,’” he summarized alongside a fresh chart.Bitcoin’s run to highs above $23,000 further allowed it to fill in empty space on the stock-to-flow model. Prior to that, at just below $20,000, BTC/USD was in fact underperforming compared with the model’s demands.As Cointelegraph reported, however, even in November, Bitcoin was already beating its performance from the 2016 halving.Stock-to-flow’s various incarnations call for a Bitcoin price of anywhere between $100,000 and $576,000 by the end of the current halving cycle in 2024. BTC/USD exactly hit the original model’s daily prediction — $23,562 — on Thursday.To the chagrin of its skeptics, a rapidly increasing number of institutional financiers are beginning to share this view — and putting their money where their mouth is to prove it.This week, One River Asset Management revealed a plan to up Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) exposure to over $1 billion by early 2021. Guggenheim, which reserved the right to allocate part of its own capital to BTC, now says a fair value for Bitcoin is $400,000 — 1,600% higher than the all-time high seen on Thursday.Only a few new outliers tow the line for the bears. Among them is Claude Erb, the asset manager famous for writing “The Golden Dilemma,” a report arguing against the precious metal’s utility as a hedge against unexpected inflation.In a new paper titled, “Bitcoin is Exactly Like Gold Except When it Isn’t,” Erb produces a new price model loosely tied to network effect which gives a maximum theoretical value of $74,000 per Bitcoin.“Bitcoin has no track record as an inflation hedge, a store of value and a safe haven,” its abstract reads."
238,"As Bitcoin (BTC) keeps hitting new all-time highs past $20,000, its network fundamentals paint a different picture compared to the previous 2017 bull run.Three years ago, on this very day, Bitcoin reached its first major all-time high of $20,000, recording up to 2,000% gains for that year. Over the course of 2020, Bitcoin enjoyed another price rally pushing its price to new historic highs and crossing $23,500 on Dec. 17 for the first time ever.Comparing the bull runs of 2017 and 2020, one may think that December has a special significance for Bitcoin. But other than this coincidence, the rallies are very much different in terms of institutional demand and adoption levels. From a fundamental perspective, this year’s Bitcoin bull run is nothing like 2017 — especially in terms of transaction fees.Bitcoin’s 2020 bull run is significantly healthier in terms of costs per transaction. The miners’ revenue per transaction — a metric that also includes block rewards — amounted to $130 in December 2017 and about $60 on Dec. 14, 2020, according to data from Blockchain.com.Raw transaction fees are significantly cheaper. According to monitoring resources like BitInfoCharts, the average BTC transaction fee is down to $5 in December 2020 from $50 in 2017.The contrast is even more evident when looking at total BTC transaction fees, which are down from around 1,500 BTC on Dec. 21, 2017 to just 70 BTC on Dec. 14, 2020, according to Blockchain.com.Some mainstream media outlets highlighted the surprisingly low BTC transaction fees recently. On Dec. 13, an unknown user paid just about $12 for a 32,253 BTC ($628 million) transaction, Finance Magnates reported. BTC transaction fees still saw major spikes over the course of 2020. In October 2020, BTC transaction costs surged about 200%.Bitcoin’s 2020 rally is also different in terms of hash rate — one of Bitcoin’s key metrics indicating the computing power and overall network security as well as resistance to attack.According to data from Blockchain.com, the BTC hash rate has been steadily growing over time, with total hash rate surging from about 14 million terahashes (TH) per second in December 2017 to over 130 million TH/s in December 2020.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin hash rate has recorded some significant movement in 2020. In early November 2020, BTC hash power jumped over 40% in two days after seeing a sharp drop in October.It is worth noting that the increase in hash rate can also be attributed to more efficient mining devices that appeared in the past three years. Compared to 2017 miners, they produce approximately three times more hashes per watt of energy. Still, the network is unquestionably more secure than at the same point in the 2017 bull run.As cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow each day, the number of daily confirmed transactions has been steadily increasing each year. Despite BTC transaction fees staying much lower than in 2017, the Bitcoin network is processing significantly more transactions than three years ago.Bitcoin processed around 320,000 transactions on Dec. 14, 2020, compared to around 280,000 transactions in mid-December 2017, according to data from Blockchain.com. The all-time high in the number of confirmed transactions was recorded in May 2019, when BTC price started to recover from its drop to the low of about $3,000.The number of unconfirmed transactions in the Bitcoin network is another sign that Bitcoin’s 2020 bull run is much healthier in terms of network fundamentals.Amid the BTC rally of 2017, about 120,000 transactions were stuck in the BTC network in mid-December. According to the latest recorded data on Blockchain.com, the number of unconfirmed BTC transactions was just 68 on Dec. 16.As Bitcoin’s rally keeps gaining momentum, it remains to be seen whether the ongoing bull run keeps its positive trend in terms of network fundamentals."
239,"The Bitcoin price (BTC) has surpassed the $21,000–$22,000 resistance range to rise above a new high of $23,000 on Dec. 17. Meanwhile, on-chain analyst Willy Woo now says $100,000 is a “ridiculously low” target.The $21,000 level was particularly important for Bitcoin to continue its rally in the near term. Exchange heatmaps showed stacked sell orders at around $21,000 to $21,500, which meant BTC price had to break through to see a broader uptrend.Exchange heatmaps show no visible resistance levels and areas with large sell orders above $22,000. In the short term, this means the probability of BTC continuing its rally is high.Due to the optimistic market sentiment and the sell-side crisis, Woo said the BTC Top Cap Model shows $100,000 is a “ridiculously low target.” He said:Woo emphasized $55,000 as the milestone price for Bitcoin because it would mean BTC would have hit 10% of gold’s market cap.Currently, gold’s valuation is estimated to be around $9 trillion. Above $50,000, Bitcoin would begin eating up a relatively large portion of the market cap of gold, which remains the dominant safe-haven asset.Exchange order books and volume trends also show that traders have moved their sell orders higher, expecting Bitcoin to rise to $30,000 after $20,000 was finally breached yesterday.If the momentum of the futures, options and spot markets gets sustained throughout the upcoming days, the probability of BTC hitting $30,000 as the first local top remains high.According to Deribit Insights, the research arm of the biggest cryptocurrency options exchange, institutional funds remain bullish on Bitcoin.In the options market, call options represent buy orders, and put options refer to sell orders. Hence, when buyers of call spreads increase, it shows that the expectations of a larger Bitcoin rally are growing.Deribit Insights said that the exchange spotted large buyers of call spreads, which is indicative of bullish bias. They said:However, in the foreseeable future, one threat for Bitcoin is whale inflows. Data from CryptoQuant suggests whale deposits into exchanges rose to levels unseen since March 2020.$BTC All Exchanges Inflow Mean (End-of-day) hit the nine-month-high since the March great sell-off.

View Chart https://t.co/kLek1Plpuo pic.twitter.com/kgff0fdW06Considering that Bitcoin has rallied in spite of increasing whale deposits,  BTC can still see a sustainable rally toward $30,000 as institutional buying is only starting to gain steam. "
240,"Bitcoin (BTC) is seeing a new kind of “flippening” above $20,000 as its original whales keep selling their coins to bigger institutional buyers.Data from on-chain analytics service CryptoQuant shows that despite long-term investors rushing to offload BTC at a profit, buyer demand is still outpacing them.With BTC/USD continuing to explore new highs, the “original” whales are beginning to look like plankton as institutions line up to buy en masse.According to the CryptoQuant data covering exchanges, outflows hit yearly highs in the hours before $20,000 broke for the first time in history. The combined shortage of BTC on exchanges and institutional buying in over-the-counter venues lays the foundation for a fight over the remaining supply — and price rises are the only logical solution.“I’ll repeat... liquidity crisis incoming,” Danny Scott, CEO of United Kingdom-based exchange Coin Corner, summarized about the status quo.Even CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, who said that he shorted Bitcoin at $20,800, admitted that he had been surprised by the whale activity.“Will focus on the bigger whales next time,” he tweeted as the market kept absorbing large sells.Ki subsequently highlighted what he described as “massive” outflows from exchange Coinbase as evidence of the institutional over-the-counter, or OTC, activities. Current BTC reserves at exchanges are at their lowest levels since November 2018. “It looks like massive Coinbase outflows usually go to their new cold wallet for custody/OTC that held 6000–8000 $BTC. #Greyscale uses #GenesisTrading for buying Bitcoins, and #GenesisTrading uses Coinbase Custody,” he wrote alongside an annotated chart. As Cointelegraph reported, the extent of institutional uptake this month is rapidly becoming an order of magnitude more significant.In addition to Guggenheim giving a $400,000 price evaluation, hedge fund One River Asset Management confirmed on Wednesday that it planned to bring its Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) holdings to more than $1 billion by 2021.“There is going to be a generational allocation to this new asset class,” Bloomberg quoted CEO Eric Peters as having said.The $1 billion target immediately pits One River against the largest crypto institutions, among them Grayscale, which itself took its total assets under management over $13 billion this week."
241,"While Bitcoin (BTC) continues to push into new all-time highs, Ether (ETH) has also tagged new year-to-date highs following news the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plans to launch ETH futures contracts in 2021.BTC spiked into new highs on Dec. 16, gaining 10% in one day from $19,140 to $21,340. Dec. 17 has seen BTC extend the rally by a further 4% so far, with the market currently searching for support near $21,800 after posting a local top of $22,160.While many traders appear to be glued to the Bitcoin charts, Ether also pushed into new yearly highs after gaining 8.5% yesterday. Today, the price increased to a local top of $656 on BitMEX, with the markets currently hovering half a percent above yesterday’s closing price of $640.The rally followed news that CME intends to launch ETH futures in 2021 pending regulatory approval. It cited strong customer demand for the product.CME launched its Bitcoin futures contracts in December 2017, which signaled the top of that year’s historic rally.Some predict even greater moves upward for ETH to come. Twitter user “Altcoin Sherpa” noted that ETH has begun multi-month rallies in December, a month that has seen gains of at least 100% for each of the past three years. As such, the analyst predicts Ether will soon surpass $1,000 for the first time since 2017.Ethereum perma-bull “Wolfofethereum.eth” speculated that “the $ETH show is just getting started,” highlighting that Ether has outperformed BTC by 185% over the past 12 months.Set Protocol’s Anthony Sassano posted an image comparing the metrics for Ethereum when it last broke $500 and the situation today — noting a 900% increase in active developers, an 80% increase in 24-hour transaction count, a 60% increase in active addresses, and a 150% increase in network hash rate.ETH/BTC shorts on Bitfinex are currently sitting at record lows, suggesting the markets expect Ether to make gains over BTC for the foreseeable future. ETH/BTC longs are at their highest level since February 2018."
242,"Finance Redefined is Cointelegraph's DeFi-centric newsletter, delivered to subscribers every Wednesday.Today the crypto world is celebrating Bitcoin’s new all-time high. We did it guys! We’re back to $20,000 after three grueling years.So for this reason, this will be a bit of a Bitcoin-themed newsletter. How is Bitcoin related to DeFi, you ask? Well, for one thing, DeFi’s total value locked has a delta of about 0.2 to Bitcoin’s price. This means that for each 1% that BTC price goes higher or lower, DeFi TVL changes by 0.2%.Most of that relationship is due to the peculiar accounting choice of considering BitGo’s Wrapped BTC as its own asset in DeFi, while also counting all instances where WBTC is used in DeFi protocols. From a “natural” worth of $535 million, Bitcoin’s contribution to total value locked jumps to $2.9 billion — a pretty major discrepancy, right?But beyond Bitcoin’s use on Ethereum, there is also the phenomenon of Bitcoin DeFi. Now, the thing is that none of these are really “Bitcoin” DeFi, because Bitcoin just does not let you create the complex smart contracts needed to implement true DeFi. The only project I know of that sort of does that is Atomic Loans. You pledge Bitcoin natively, but all smart contracts are on Ethereum and your loan is disbursed there.Bitcoin DeFi does exist on RSK and Liquid, two Bitcoin “sidechains” — separate blockchains that use Bitcoin as their native currency. RSK also uses merge mining to validate its own chain, resulting in a much tighter bond with the main chain.The problem is of course that since Bitcoin doesn’t have smart contracts, the path for BTC to reach those “DeFi” sidechains is usually custodial and centralized. But we recently saw RSK push a solution that makes the bridge effectively trustless, so I’m starting to warm up to seeing it as two sides of the same Bitcoin.RSK has definitely been active on the DeFi front. This week, Sovryn launched its DeFi suite on RSK. It’s a mix of several building blocks, including a lending protocol and an automated market maker exchange, or AMM. Similar to bZX’s Fulcrum, the combined suite makes it easier to enter leveraged positions on Bitcoin without taking the manual steps you’d have to take on, say, Compound.Among the more interesting protocols on RSK we have TEX, a sort of mix between an AMM and an order book exchange. The mechanism is complex, but essentially it settles orders every few minutes based on an average of all limit orders submitted. The exchange was launched by Dollar on Chain, RSK’s Maker analog with a few additional features.On the Liquid side — the sidechain developed by Blockstream — there is less variety, although there is another interesting twist on decentralized exchanges called TDEX. It uses atomic swaps to perform trades and allows complete control over settlement price, unlike AMMs, where you don’t really know your trade’s price until the order is executed.The most popular type of Bitcoin on Ethereum is Wrapped Bitcoin, as I’ve mentioned. Quite simply, BitGo (and supposedly other partners) takes custody of Bitcoin that’s bridged to Ethereum, and then they mint the corresponding WBTC tokens. Very similar to Tether or other centralized stablecoins, it feels like a cop out.For tokenized Bitcoin to be relevant, we need to solve this pesky issue of relying on custodians to bridge it to new chains.The tBTC project is one such trustless Bitcoin bridging mechanism. The project really embodies the “make lemonade” principle to its fullest. To avoid Bitcoin’s smart contract limitations, it allows anyone to become a “bonding agent” tasked with performing the conversions between Bitcoin and Ethereum. In case of any wrongdoing, users have a claim to the agent’s bond on Ethereum, which is overcollateralized when compared to the bridged amount.As you may expect, tBTC’s mechanism of bonds and slashing is quite complex and is probably stifling adoption, so this week tBTC partnered with the CoinList exchange to provide an easier method for minting the token. That may also be interpreted as a cop out, but the fundamental feature is that the system is still open to anyone, instead of being operated by an exclusive and well-defined set of validators.Lastly, there is RenBTC. While the team uses fancy words like “Shamir’s Secret Sharing” and “Multi Party Computation” to justify itself as a trustless and permissionless bridging protocol, research by Wanchain seems to show that all BTC in their bridge is held by a single wallet, presumably controlled by the team. Wanchain is a competitor, so make of this what you will — I don’t really have the expertise to corroborate this quickly.In practice, Ren is definitely simple and permissionless enough. So much so that DeFi hackers have now turned to it to launder their proceeds. The most likely explanation I see is that the Bitcoin blockchain is just much harder to track, and mixing solutions are much more liquid on it than Ethereum’s Tornado Cash.If Ren is really as centralized as it seems, I could foresee major problems if the team continues letting hackers use it. The general rule of financial regulation is that if you can stop money laundering, you must — in a very vigorous and proactive way. Still, individual instances of money laundering are not a big deal, provided there is an acceptable anti-money laundering program.Overall, Bitcoin may become the most promising expansion avenue for DeFi. You just can’t argue with its $383 billion market capitalization. Whether it’s on Ethereum, on Bitcoin sidechains or anywhere else, DeFi would be a natural extension for Bitcoin as an asset."
243,"Bitcoin (BTC) has attracted a lot of proponents this year, with many folks expressing positive market sentiment following the asset’s recent rise to $20,000 and beyond. Not everyone is overly bullish though.Peter Brandt, a long-time traditional market trader and chartist, said Bitcoin is bullish, but surpassing $20,000 is nothing groundbreaking as far as the charts are concerned. “New highs are always a good indicator of healthy bull trend, but other than that the new highs mean very little of technical significance,” Brandt tweeted on Wednesday.Big-even price levels sometimes draw headlines and chatter. The $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 and $20,000 levels have garnered various forms of attention through the years, although such levels may not inherently hold an overabundance of hard and fast chart significance at any given point. Such levels sometimes play on psychology. Still, Bitcoin recently showed resistance just below $20,000, before finally cracking through with conviction on Wednesday.Meanwhile, other industry participants look toward the trend of big mainstream financial players entering crypto. “We’re seeing fresh stories about institutional crypto adoption on almost a daily basis at this point,” Bitcoin Depot CEO Brandon Mintz told Cointelegraph. MicroStrategy, Paul Tudor Jones, and MassMutual are included on 2020’s list of large players buying Bitcoin.Mintz added:In line with the institutional Bitcoin buying trend, Guggenheim Partners saw the $10,000 level as an opportunity to begin flowing funds into BTC, according to the company’s chief investment officer, Scott Minerd, in a recent interview with Bloomberg. “It’s a little more challenging with the current price closer to $20,000,” Minerd said. “Amazing over a very short period of time how big of a run-up we’ve had,” he noted, adding:Minerd subsequently clarified that rationale for the $400,000 price tag stems from aspects such as Bitcoin’s limited supply, as well as comparisons to other assets, including gold.The market still has not seen Bitcoin bear and gold proponent Peter Schiff switch his stance on the digital asset, however."
244,"Today Bitcoin (BTC) price blasted through the $20,000 level and in the process, a record $7.9 billion in futures open interest was set.Although the price increased by 74% over the past two months, the total accumulated short-seller liquidations amounted to $4.3 billion, which is lower than the $4.8 billion from longs.As shown in the chart above, the futures aggregate open interest increased by 90% over the past two months. Thus, signaling that investors are increasing their positions, which in turn allows even larger players to participate.It is also worth noting that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) now holds over $1.3 billion of these contracts, indisputable evidence of the growing institutional participation in BTC markets.By looking at daily liquidations, investors can better assess how traders have been using leverage. Unexpected price swings will tend to cause higher liquidations than those ongoing trends, such as the recent Bitcoin breakout to $20,800.Take notice of the largest candle represents longs getting their positions forcefully terminated on Nov. 26 as BTC price dropped 14.4% in 12 hours. Today's $20,000 resistance break caused $365 million worth of shorts to liquidate, but this is still no match to the previous month's $902 million bearish movement.The recent volume downtrend is another reason for bears to celebrate. Bitcoin's non-adjusted total trading volume decreased by 40% over the last three weeks.Bitcoin's daily average trading volume on spot exchanges reached $45 billion in late November and has since declined to $25 billion. While there is the possibility that exchanges may have inflated their volumes, there could also be some bearish maneuvers in play.Nevertheless, a similar 40% decline occurred at Coinbase's BTC/USD and Binance BTC/USDT markets. Therefore, bears might hope that such volume weakness indicates a lack of confidence in $20,000 turning into a support level.Perpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate usually charged every eight hours. Even though both buyers and sellers' open interest is matched at all times, their leverage can vary.When buyers (longs) are the ones demanding more leverage, the funding rate turns positive. Therefore, the buyers will be the ones paying up the fees.Sustained funding rates above 4% per week translate to extreme optimism. This level is acceptable during market rallies but problematic if the BTC price is sideways. A high carry cost might force longs (buyers) to reduce their positions, therefore increasing sell pressure.In situations like these, high leverage from buyers increases because of the increased risk that large liquidations will occur on surprise price drops.Thus, bears might be holding their cards close to their chest, awaiting the best moment to test the market.It’s possible that this could either happen closer to the Dec. 25 futures and options expiry or during weekends when order books are usually thinner.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
245,"Both Binance and Coinbase suffered technological issues on Wednesday — the same day Bitcoin (BTC) crossed the $20,000 price threshold for the first time. Binance related its issues to the number of people surfing the exchange. Changpeng Zhao, or CZ, Binance’s CEO, tweeted on Wednesday at 2:13 pm UTC:An update from CZ came about half an hour later, revealing improvements, as well as a dramatic surge in users on the platform. “Still some latency issues here and there. Working on it, all hands on deck,” he tweeted, adding: “Bitcoin goes up 5%, traffic goes up 30x.” By 2:56 pm UTC, CZ noted the situation as resolved.Bitcoin broke above $20,000 for the first time ever at 1:42 pm UTC on Dec. 16, reaching a price near $20,800 by 2:14 pm, according to TradingView.com data.At 2:45 pm UTC, Coinbase also reported issues via its status page. “Coinbase.com is experiencing connectivity issues,” the exchange posted. The exchange said that the problem was resolved at 4:27 pm.Coinbase has a history of technical difficulties during periods of high traffic, commonly referencing “connectivity issues” as the cause. Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s CEO, recently said the exchange is working toward solutions for handling high website engagement."
246,"2020 has been a big year for mainstream Bitcoin (BTC) adoption. One of the most recent entrants to the space is One River Digital Asset Management, a hedge fund headed up by CEO Eric Peters. The firm expects to own approximately $1 billion in Ethereum (ETH) and BTC by the first half of next year, and has already accumulated roughly $600 million worth of the asset, said a Bloomberg report on Wednesday. Alan Howard, Brevan Howard Asset Management’s co-founder and a known billionaire, is also involved in the endeavor.Peters’ position on Bitcoin lines up with other players', who view Bitcoin as a potential gold-like inflation hedge during uncertain economic times. Taking interest rates, money printing, and other factors into account, Peters told Bloomberg:Peters has boarded a thought leadership train that sees BTC becoming more and more prevalent in the days ahead. He explained:One River did not just buy the $600 million in BTC and ETH yesterday, however. According to the article from Bloomberg, Peters completed the purchases in November, sneakily acquiring stacks of the assets without stirring public hype.Bitcoin's price recently cracked $20,000, and remains above this level at time of publication."
247,"Crypto traders and investors received an early Christmas gift today as Bitcoin (BTC) price cleared the $20,000 psychological milestone for the first time in history. Today's breakout is equally significant as it serves to heal the scars of the traders who may have bought right at the top in 2017 and held their positions until now.The current uptrend in Bitcoin has been all about institutional adoption. The latest institutional investor to have announced a position in Bitcoin is the United Kingdom-based investment manager Ruffer Investment Company Limited.As has been the case with most institutional purchases this year, Ruffer said that they bought Bitcoin as an “insurance policy against the continuing devaluation of the world's major currencies.”Institutional participation has been so high that the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Fund Manager Survey shows that respondents believe that Bitcoin is the third most crowded trade behind technology stocks and short positions on the U.S. dollar.Institutional investors have continued to flock to Bitcoin because it has outperformed most major asset classes by a wide margin. Hence, institutional investors who were early to the Bitcoin party are most likely sitting on huge profits and their portfolios are outperforming other fund managers who only own legacy markets. As Bitcoin continues to draw more attention from the investor class, inquisitive clients may force more institutions to allocate a portion of their money to BTC.Now that Bitcoin has resumed its uptrend let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to identify the target objectives on the upside.Bitcoin (BTC) has soared well above $20,000 with a strong breakout. This shows that several traders have jumped in after the break above the psychological round figure at $20,000.Any asset that makes a new all-time high is in a strong uptrend. The BTC/USD pair has completed an ascending triangle pattern, which has a target objective of $22,808.98. If this level is also crossed, the pair may reach $25,000.The relative strength index (RSI) has still not reached the overbought zone, which shows that the BTC/USD pair has room to rally to the upside before the markets get overheated in the short-term.Usually, after every breakout, the price turns down and retests the break out level. If the bulls buy this dip, then the level acts as a new floor. In this case, if the bulls flip the $19,500 level to support, the uptrend will remain intact.This bullish view will be invalidated if the price reverses direction and breaks below $17,500.Ether (ETH) has surged today and reached the $622.807 to $635.456 overhead resistance zone. If the bulls can push and sustain the price above the zone, it will complete an ascending triangle pattern which has a target objective of $763.614.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 61 signal that the path of least resistance is to the upside.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current levels or fails to sustain above the resistance zone, then a drop to the 20-day exponential moving average ($572) is possible. A strong rebound off this support may keep the uptrend intact.However, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that traders are booking profits at higher levels. Such a move could keep the ETH/USD pair range-bound for a few days.XRP had found strong buying support at the $0.435420 level on Nov. 26 and the bulls again purchased the dip to this critical level today, which has resulted in a strong rebound.The flattening 20-day EMA ($0.530) and the RSI close to the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to stall the current recovery at the downtrend line.If the price turns down from the downtrend line, the XRP/USD pair could drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($0.42). This is the final support because if it breaks down, the next stop could be $0.326.However, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the downtrend line, the pair could rise to $0.60.Litecoin (LTC) is trading inside a large symmetrical triangle. The bulls defended the 20-day EMA ($80) on Dec. 14 and 15, which could have attracted buying and the price has surged to the resistance line of the triangle today.The rising 20-day EMA and the RSI above 61 signal that bulls are in control. If the buyers can push the price above the triangle and the $93.9282 overhead resistance, the next leg of the uptrend to $100 and then to $140 could begin.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current levels, the LTC/USD pair may extend its stay inside the triangle for a few more days.The long tail on the Dec. 14 candlestick shows strong buying by the bulls at lower levels. That was followed by another strong day on Dec. 15 and the buyers propelled Bitcoin Cash (BCH) above the $280 resistance.The long wick on the Dec. 15 candlestick shows that the bears are trying to defend the $300 resistance. Today’s price action shows buying by the bulls closer to $280 and selling by the bears near $300.This tight range trading is unlikely to continue for long. The RSI has risen back into the positive territory and the 20-day EMA ($280) is attempting to rise, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand.If the price sustains above $300, the BCH/USD pair could rise to $320 and then to $338. This positive view will be invalidated if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA ($273). Such a move could again pull the price down to $250.Chainlink (LINK) turned down from the overhead resistance at $13.28 on Dec. 13 but the bears could not sink the price to the uptrend line. This attracted buyers who are currently trying to push the price above the $13.28 resistance.If the bulls succeed, the LINK/USD pair could move up to $15 and then to $17.7777. If this level is also crossed a retest of the all-time high at $20.1111 is possible.However, the flat moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint does not signal a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.Therefore, if the price turns down from the current levels, the pair may consolidate in a range for a few days.Cardano (ADA) rose above the $0.155 resistance on Dec. 14 but the price turned down from the downtrend line on Dec. 15. However, the bears could now sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.149). This attracted aggressive buying by the bulls who have propelled the price above the downtrend line.The gradually rising 20-day EMA and the RSI above 59 suggest that bulls are in control. The ADA/USD pair could now rally to $0.1750 and then to $0.1826315. If this level is also crossed, the next target is $0.20.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance then the pair may enter a range-bound action for a few days.Polkadot (DOT) broke above the downtrend line on Dec. 15, which suggests that the bears have lost their grip. The altcoin could now rise to $5.5899 where it is likely to face stiff resistance from the bears.If the price again turns down from the overhead resistance, the DOT/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($5). If the bulls buy the dip to the 20-day EMA, it will increase the possibility of a break above $5.5899. Such a move could start a new uptrend that may reach $6.0857 and then $6.8619.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current levels and drops to the moving averages, it will suggest a lack of demand at higher levels. In such a case, the price may waver near the moving averages.Binance Coin (BNB) has bounced off the moving averages and the bulls will now try to push the price to the $32 overhead resistance. This level is likely to act as a stiff resistance as the price had turned down from it on three previous occasions.If the price again turns down from $32, the BNB/USD pair could fall to the moving averages and then to the critical support at $25.6652. The flat moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.The next trending move could start if the bulls push the price above the $32 resistance or if the bears sink the price below the $25.6652 support. Until then, the price action may remain volatile and random.Stellar Lumens (XLM) had turned down from the $0.18 overhead resistance on Dec. 14 but the positive thing is that the bulls defended the drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.16). The bulls are currently attempting to resume the uptrend by pushing the altcoin above $0.18.The 20-day EMA has started to slope up gradually and the RSI is trying to sustain in the positive territory, which suggests a minor advantage to the bulls. If the price closes above $0.18, the XLM/USD pair could move up to $0.205 and then to $0.231655.However, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above $0.18, the bears will try to sink the price back to the 20-day EMA. If that happens, it could keep the pair inside the $0.14 to $0.18 range for a few more days.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

248,"The Bitcoin (BTC) price surged to all-time highs on Wednesday, zipping past $20,000 in a show of bullish momentum for the flagship cryptocurrency. Although it’s easy to draw parallels between this year’s bull market and the speculative frenzy that drove the 2017 rally, the foundations underpinning Bitcoin are much stronger today than they were just a few years ago.While there are many metrics that could explain Bitcoin’s resurgence this year, it’s important to start from the very top. Unlike in 2017, investors today are accumulating Bitcoin with a clear purpose. The digital currency’s effectiveness as a hedge against inflation is leading to wider mainstream adoption, especially among savvy investors who understand monetary policy.Since inception, Bitcoin has been a superior store of value than any other asset. The May 2020 deflationary halving event highlighted Bitcoin’s scarcity to a wider audience than ever before.As crypto analytics firm Chainanalysis reported last month:2020 could go down as the year that major institutions flipped the script on Bitcoin — perhaps permanently. Unlike in 2017, when Bitcoin’s surge was mainly driven by retail speculation, the 2020 bull market appears to be guided by the cold, calculating hands of smart money.Cointelegraph has been reporting for months about Bitcoin’s gradual uptake by institutional investors. Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller, Grayscale, PayPal, Square, MassMutual, MicroStrategy, Ruffer Investment Company — these are just a few of the corporate and institutional names that have added Bitcoin to their holdings.Even Jim Cramer, the famed TV personality from CNBC’s Mad Money, bought the recent Bitcoin dip under $18,000.Such names were absent from the retail-driven euphoria of 2017 when FOMO, or fear of missing out, was the main catalyst behind Bitcoin’s brief spike towards $20,000.Another striking difference between the 2020 bull market and the one that preceded it in 2017 is the amount of Bitcoin held in so-called illiquid wallets.Chainanalysis describes illiquid wallets, also called investor-held Bitcoin, as wallets that send less than 25% of BTC they’ve ever received. Using this metric, illiquid wallets currently represent more than three-quarters (77%) of the 14.8 million BTC mined that isn’t characterized as lost. Chainanalysis says this amount “hasn’t moved from its current address in five years or longer.”The firm explains:As the following chart illustrates, the amount of “investor Bitcoin” held has surged dramatically since late 2017 when prices last peaked. In other words, investors are buying and holding BTC as opposed to flipping it for quick profits. Unlike in 2017, when Bitcoin network activity peaked with the BTC price, the number of unique active addresses has grown steadily for the past two years, according to data provider Glassnode.What’s more, roughly 19.6 million addresses either sent or received Bitcoin in November, marking the third-highest monthly total ever recorded.Data from Glassnode also reveal that, by June of this year, a record number of investors were holding at least 0.1 BTC. As Cointelegraph reported, more than 2.75 million addresses have been consistently holding more than this amount since April 2019."
249,"After toying with all-time price highs in recent weeks, Bitcoin (BTC) finally crossed $20,000 for the first time on Wednesday. The digital currency hovered around $20,800 at time of publication. “We have been waiting for this moment for years, and now that $BTC #Bitcoin has finally broken 20k, all bets are off,” Cheds, a crypto trader and analyst on Twitter, told Cointelegraph. “What happens next could make history,” he said, adding:Bitcoin has done quite well in 2020, despite the coin's dramatic fall in March when the price sank to $3,600 amid growing COVID-19 fears. From there, however, BTC carved out an uptrend, recovering faster than mainstream markets, taking it all the way to the levels seen today.“I am over the moon to wake up to Bitcoin breaking $20k!” CryptoWendyO, another crypto trader and analyst on Twitter, told Cointelegraph. “However, I'm traumatized from the prior bear market and still cautious as the atmosphere is extremely euphoric,” she added.After Bitcoin’s last major bull run, which ended with its 2017 high of $19,892, the asset fell into a multiyear bear market, floundering below $5,000 in late-2018 and early 2019.Looking to the future, CryptoWendyO sees $22,500 as a logical level from here. “$22,500 is my next target as it’s the middle area between fib 1 to fib 1.272,” she said, referring to Fibonacci price chart levels. “I like to look at things conservatively and expect some action at that area before $25,000.”All-time price highs, in theory, mean that every person who holds Bitcoin is in profit — as pointed out in a recent tweet by Messari CEO Ryan Selkis.It's official: no one has ever lost money holding bitcoin.In addition to Bitcoin’s major price action this year, several large mainstream players have jumped on board the train, investing hundreds of millions of dollars in the coin. Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy has become majorly bullish on Bitcoin, led by CEO Michael Saylor. Other bullish mainstreamers include Paul Tudor Jones, Square and MassMutual."
250,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent volatile price corrections might conjure up images of the 2017 crash in your mind, or maybe even the crash caused by COVID-19 back in March of this year. But the fact that Bitcoin has reached $20,000 for the first time in history is not a reason to sound the alarm.Despite the fact that the price of the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency is up more than 225% this year, the current bull run we’re living through is unlike the Bitcoin mania we saw back in 2017. Far from it. There are four key reasons for this:These four reasons aren’t just relevant now; they will all continue to play a role in the future growth of Bitcoin. Consider this your newsflash.

Dorsey purchased roughly $50 million worth of the cryptocurrency for his company.

Square lets customers use cryptocurrency as payment; PayPal lets customers and merchants purchase Bitcoin directly from their PayPal accounts. Both gateways are currently creating quite the windfall for Bitcoin’s market capitalization.Related: Will PayPal’s crypto integration bring crypto to the masses?

Whether a friend or family member talked to you about it at Christmas, or you heard about it in the news or in TV commercials, the fact is nearly every major media outlet was covering the price boom at the time.Fast-forward to the present day, and you can take a look at Google Trends to see that searches for the word Bitcoin have been trending at a high level recently, yet apart from investment-specific television programming, you don’t hear about Bitcoin in the mainstream media nearly as much, with some exceptions of course.This means we’ve reached a new milestone for adoption. More and more people know about cryptocurrencies than ever before, and now they follow the asset class more closely.Related: Bitcoin is the best treasury reserve asset humanity’s ever hadRussia, China, Canada, the European Union and many other countries are either already working on their own central bank digital currencies or publishing white papers detailing their intentions to do so. Moving away from paper money and plastic credit cards is the natural next step for the world as payment technologies continue to advance. But as crypto enthusiasts know, a digital currency built on a blockchain owned by a central bank or government isn’t the same as one built on decentralized technology.Related: Central bank digital currencies are dead in the waterThis is obviously a sign that the powers that be in the old financial world are seeing the writing on the wall. They are doing everything they can to protect a system that favors those in control. But CBDCs and more stringent government regulations will only continue to blur the lines between government-backed digital currencies and Bitcoin. It’s only a matter of time before society chooses the latter over the former.Not only are Google searches for the word Bitcoin at an all-time high, but the two countries with the highest surge in search volume at the moment are Nigeria and South Africa, both of which are developing nations with unique challenges. It turns out that search volume is not just a sign of new crypto investors doing research; it’s leading to large amounts of capital flowing into the space.Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of Luno — a crypto exchange serving emerging markets — recently tweeted that purchase volumes on the company’s exchange have tripled among retail investors in Nigeria, South Africa, Malaysia and Indonesia.Related: Emerging technologies can change the African financial landscapeWhile institutional investment is surely a driving force, pushing the value of Bitcoin higher, people around the world, who can no longer trust the economies they used to depend on, are putting their capital to work and betting on a Bitcoin revolution that’s going to change their future for the better.Don’t be mistaken. There are certainly many challenges still to come for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Just this month, Coinbase announced the suspension of margin trading because of changing government regulations. The news is a reminder that governments will continue to try to regulate everything, and detractors will continue to denounce Bitcoin’s fundamental value.Still, the future for Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies is bright. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss think Bitcoin is going to be worth more than $500,000 per coin within the next 10 years. An advisor at Citibank sees a $300,000 Bitcoin much sooner than that.Those numbers might seem like they are way too optimistic, but remember, it wasn’t that long ago that a $25,000 Bitcoin seemed impossible, and now we are almost there. Except that from here on out, the path to mass adoption is no longer about educating new investors, it’s about getting people, corporations and, eventually, governments to finally put their capital where their crypto is… and they will all do so sooner than you think.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

251,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has reached $20,000 for the first time in history on Dec. 16. The historic milestone comes just over two weeks after breaking its previous all-time high.At the same time, this rally is different from 2017’s due to several reasons that could help BTC soar even higher. These include growing institutional demand, the increasing perception among investors that BTC is a store of value, and stronger network fundamentals.In December 2017, data suggested that retail and mainstream investors were behind the Bitcoin rally. At the time, CME BTC futures had just launched and there was a lack of institutional investment vehicles.As such, the rally was mostly fueled by retail investors, which came to an abrupt stop after a strong whale-induced sell-off.This time, institutional investor-focused platforms are seeing an explosive increase in trading activity. For instance, the CME BTC futures market recently notched a $1.27 billion open interest, ranking just behind OKEx as the second-largest in the global Bitcoin market.Institutional investors are not likely to invest in Bitcoin with a short-term strategy. Many are increasingly viewing it as a digital store of value and an alternative to gold.As Cointelegraph reported earlier, the rise in Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust premium suggests that institutions are increasingly looking for exposure to BTC and paying above the spot market price for the privilege. Both institutions and high-net-worth investors are starting to acknowledge Bitcoin as a store of value and as a treasury asset.MicroStrategy, the publicly-listed company in the United States that purchased $450 million worth of BTC earlier this year, sparked a trend that has led other institutions to allocate their capital into Bitcoin.The perception of BTC as a hedge against inflation and a stable store of value could make BTC compelling for the broader financial sector in the medium to long term. Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, said:At the same time, Bitcoin’s performance has dwarfed gold’s this year once again as well as the S&P500’s, despite the precious metal and the latter breaking their own all-time highs this year.Hence, it is no surprise that Wall Street is now taking Bitcoin more seriously than in 2017. Further evidence of this was revealed on Dec. 3, when the S&P 500 announced its plans to roll out its own cryptocurrency indexes next year.As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin’s fundamentals are stronger than ever as the network is now moving $500,000 per second around the globe. In other words, Bitcoin transfers $4.627 billion in value per day.The network is also ten times more secure than in late 2017, as the hash rate and mining difficulty both continue to hit new highs this year. The hash rate indicates how much computing power is being dedicated to validating Bitcoin transactions and securing the network. "
252,"Bitcoin (BTC) hit its highest levels in two weeks on Dec. 15 as fresh bullish action took the largest cryptocurrency to nearly $20,000.Data from Cointelegraph Markets, TradingView and Coin360 show BTC/USD hitting $19,760 during trading on Wednesday.The move reverses the bearish sentiment that characterized the market as recently as Tuesday. After failing to crack resistance between $19,500 and $20,000 since the start of the month, Bitcoin saw lows of $17,550 before reversing upwards.This week, the reemergence of buyer support intensified, with Bitcoin showing a clear desire to quash the major seller wall at $20,000 once and for all.As Cointelegraph noted, beyond $20,000, little is in the way for Bitcoin as it hits uncharted territory, with only minor selling planned at higher levels, data shows.“#Bitcoin breaking above the resistance zone, which is close to a new all-time high. Bullish!” Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe summarized to Twitter followers about the latest movements.Quantitative analyst PlanB meanwhile suggested that reports of the United States agreeing on a $900 billion coronavirus stimulus package was contributing to Bitcoin’s gains.At press time, Bitcoin circled $19,700 as volatility remained heightened on short timeframes. Stock markets were also up on the day."
253,"Bitcoin (BTC) is “eating the world” thanks to 10-year returns of over 6,200,000% and annualized returns of roughly 200% per year, investment strategist Raoul Pal has said.In a tweet on Dec. 15, Pal revisited his oft-quoted phrase as new data showed the extent of Bitcoin’s outperforming of major assets.As noted by Charlie Bilello, founder and CEO of Compound Capital Advisors, a Bitcoin investment made in 2011 has delivered returns of 6,271,233%. Nothing has matched it since then, he said, and the next best bet, the Nasdaq, offers a paltry 512%.“Bitcoin is eating the world,” Pal summarized while sharing the figures.As Cointelegraph reported, 2020 has been a seminal year for hodlers, as Bitcoin trumps stocks, gold and other macro bets to easily claim the title of best investment.Against its lows of $3,600 in March, BTC/USD is up 440%.Alternatively, whether it’s dollar-cost-averaging or a one-time investment of $100 10 years ago, Bitcoin dwarfs other investments such as Apple or Amazon over the past decade. Bitcoin staying below $20,000 longer meanwhile will only make its breakout harder, well-known market commentators agree.In a tweet on Tuesday, macro analyst Alex Krueger argued that current price action is simply Bitcoin preparing to expand to new highs.According to Krueger, a push past $20,000 — something which has evaded Bitcoin so far — is all but guaranteed.“The more time BTC spends below 20K and the lower the funding and futures basis as price approaches 20K, the stronger the upwards break once it comes,” he wrote.BTC/USD has so far failed to quash selling pressure which begins at $19,500, with attempts to flip the area to support resulting in swift losses.Institutional buyers accumulating BTC has become bulls’ first line of defense in forecasting further upward momentum. Futures markets, an important institutional entry point, have seen record activity in recent months.Coupled to this, as Krueger notes, aspects such as the funding rate for perpetual swaps have delivered few bearish signals, despite Bitcoin retaking all-time highs.An exception came in late November, when funding rates increased just before BTC/USD dived to lows of $16,500.His comments echo those of developer Vijay Boyapati, who earlier this month said that a sub-$20,000 Bitcoin was a healthy thing.“The longer #Bitcoin spends hovering below 20k, the more energy is coiling beneath it, making the move beyond 20k that much more explosive,” he wrote.Bitcoin has remained above the $10,000 mark for a record 143 consecutive days and counting.

Following suit, insurance company MassMutual and investment manager Ruffer disclosed massive Bitcoin purchases in the last week as well.The Bank of America survey also found the fund managers are underweight in cash for the first time since 2013, after buying a disproportionate amount of stocks, commodities and other assets including Bitcoin over the last few months.This is not the first time Bitcoin has appeared in Bank of America’s monthly survey. In Dec. 2017, Bitcoin topped the survey’s list of most crowded trades, with 32% of respondents naming Bitcoin as the “most crowded trade.”Bitcoin was named for the first time in a Sept. 2017 edition of the survey, in which it received 26% of respondent votes for “most crowded trade.”On Aug. 18 2020, Bitcoin surpassed Bank of America in market cap size for the first time. Bitcoin now exceeds Bank of America in this metric by 45%."
255,"For the second day in a row, Bitcoin bulls have attacked the $19,500 level in an attempt to flip the crucial level from resistance to support. Each attempt to overcome the resistance is has been rejected near $19,550 but Bitcoin’s swift recovery from the Dec. 14 drop to $19,050 shows that investors remain interested in buying every significant dip.At the moment, the general consensus among traders is that flipping $19,500 to support will open the door to a new all-time high at or above $20,000. According to Cointelegraph contributor Micheal van de Poppe:Van de Poppe further explained that the current bearish convergence on the daily timeframe is not confirmed and he stressed the if Bitcoin price fails to reclaim $19,500 as strong support the likely outcome is that the price will drop to $18,500 where traders will look for a better entry.Even as Bitcoin struggles to hold onto $19,500, the daily chart shows the price continuing to make daily higher lows. Since recovering from the Dec. 11 drop to $17,586. BTC has also made daily higher highs which is a further signal that the digital asset is in a strong uptrend.While Bitcoin price attempts to trade in a new range, a handful of altcoins pushed higher with double-digit rallies.Elrond price surged 28% during the day and is currently up 115% in the past two weeks. SushiSwap’s governance token, Sushi, also rallied 9.84% to $2.80 and is up 44% over the past 4 days.Bancor was the most notable gainer of the day as it secured a 34.5% rally to $1.70 on the news of the Coinbase Pro listing that took place today.According to CoinMarketCap, the overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $566.6 billion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 63.6%."
256,"A United Kingdom-based investment manager has added Bitcoin (BTC) to its portfolio, underscoring the ongoing institutional shift toward digital assets.Ruffer Investment Company Limited, an investment manager with shares listed on the London Stock Exchange, has disclosed its new Bitcoin strategy.In a performance update and manager comment posted on Tuesday, Ruffer said it has added Bitcoin to its Multi-Strategies Fund, primarily as a defensive move against the “continued devaluation” of fiat money. The fund now holds roughly 2.5% of its assets in Bitcoin.The allocation was made in November after Ruffer reduced its exposure to gold in favor of BTC.The firm said:Founded in 1994, Ruffer has 20.3 billion euros ($27.2 billion) in assets under management as of Nov. 30. The firm has roughly 6,600 clients worldwide compromised of individuals, families, pension funds and charities.Ruffer’s move echoes a recent call by JPMorgan Chase that Bitcoin is quietly eating gold’s market share. In a note to clients that was released last week, quantitative strategies led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said Bitcoin adoption could lead to “structural headwinds” for gold.The strategists wrote:2020 has gone down as a transformative year for Bitcoin, with firms like Grayscale, PayPal, MicroStrategy and MassMutual rewriting the narrative on digital assets. Crypto pioneer and ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees believes powerful institutional players will shield assets like Bitcoin from government overreach. With major institutions in play, the Bitcoin market is forming a natural ""bulwark"" against intrusive regulations. "
257,"tBTC acts as Bitcoin (BTC) covered in an Ethereum wrapper, making it compatible on Ethereum’s blockchain for various purposes, such as decentralized finance, or DeFi. Users of tBTC can now mint the asset on crypto exchange CoinList.“Larger investors and retail that maybe aren’t quite confident using a fairly new DApp can actually go into CoinList and wrap and unwrap tBTC the same way they do WBTC today,” Matt Luongo, CEO and founder of Thesis, the entity behind tBTC, told Cointelegraph. Keep is another project under Thesis that is involved with tBTC.As two separate blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum are not inherently compatible with each other's networks. Ethereum, however, hosts much of the activity for the DeFi sector of crypto. Wrapping Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain allows users to hold their value in Bitcoin while using it to interact in DeFi. tBTC is a “trust-minimized bridge from Bitcoin to Ethereum,” Luongo explained.CoinList adding tBTC functionality improves simplicity for those looking to work with the asset. “Even though tBTC is censorship resistant and permissionless, it’s still a pain to use,” Luongo said. “It’s harder to do something without counterparties.”Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), a separate asset backed 1:1 by stored BTC, has become one of the industry’s popular options for Bitcoin on the Ethereum network, although WBTC’s model is more centralized, according to Luongo.Essentially, the entity in charge of WBTC oversees the asset’s minting, as well as the Bitcoin that backs it. Downsides to this model, however, can mean centralized control and points of failure. “If BitGo is bought by PayPal, if BitGo is hit by The Stable Act that may or may not be a thing in the U.S., or if BitGo is hacked, the money is gone, and users really don’t have a lot of recourse,” Luongo explained.In contrast, tBTC works with a network of blockchain validators and parties that individually contribute to the minting and backing of tBTC, kept in check by activity on the blockchain."
258,"Sovryn, a decentralized finance platform operating on the RSK Bitcoin sidechain, announced on Tuesday its public launch. Users can now access a full suite for trading Bitcoin (BTC) in a trustless, noncustodial environment, benefiting from powerful leverage and yield opportunities.The platform presents a mix of major DeFi building blocks, including a collateralized lending protocol and automated market maker exchange. Users can trade long or short with up to five-times leverage, while holders of Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT) and the Dollar on Chain (DOC) stablecoin can earn interest by lending their assets.Later in December, the project plans to launch decentralized governance forked from Compound’s contracts. RSK is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, thus supporting Ethereum’s Solidity smart contract language.Sovryn users who join early will have exclusive access to the sale of its governance tokens, planned for the first quarter of 2021. The tokens will allow holders to participate in governance, though the team introduced a staking requirement: The longer the tokens are staked, the more voting power they acquire.Prior to launch, Sovryn held an oversubscribed investment round for $2.1 million, choosing the figure for its symbolic significance for Bitcoin. The round was led by Greenfield One and included Collider Ventures, Monday Capital and other undisclosed investors. Collider Labs and BlockVenture provided initial capital and development support.The RSK sidechain recently saw a slew of upgrades and projects building on it. The project offers a faster, smart contract-enabled blockchain secured by merge-mining with Bitcoin. Its native token is rBTC, a wrapped version of Bitcoin. Recently, the project announced that it upgraded the bridge to allow trustless Bitcoin transfers to the sidechain.The RSK ecosystem is also gradually building out DeFi protocol building blocks, already featuring a stablecoin-generating protocol in Dollar on Chain. It has also developed an alternative type of decentralized exchange platform, which uses a hybrid model between order books and automated market makers."
259,"The Bitcoin price (BTC) reached the $19,400 mark in the past 24 hours, which has served as a critical resistance level since the start of December. However, on-chain indicators show that the dominant cryptocurrency could stagnate or consolidate until early 2021. Although BTC is nearing its all-time high at around $20,000, there are compelling reasons to expect more sideways action.On-chain analysts primarily explore two indicators to gauge the sentiment of an ongoing rally: the Spent Output Profit Ratio, or SOPR, and Long-Term Holder MVRV. The SOPR indicator shows whether short-term holders are selling at a profit or a loss. If SOPR increases, it means investors are selling at a profit, which typically means there is room for a minor correction. But if the SOPR decreases, it means retail investors are likely getting shaken out, and a trend reversal to the upside is likely.The Long-Term Holder MVRV is an indicator that looks at whether Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued. The MVRV divides the price at which investors are buying Bitcoin by the current market cap. It allows the indicator to gauge whether investors accumulate BTC at an abnormally high price, making the rally overheated. A rally becomes unsustainable if MVRV goes above 20.Bitcoin is currently in an ideal position, where the SOPR indicator is signaling the likelihood of a further profit-taking pullback, while the MVRV is indicating a long-term rally. This trend is positive for BTC, since it shows that the overall uptrend would likely be intact even if a short-term correction or consolidation phases occur.Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst and the creator of Woobull.com, said the SOPR has room to reset. Based on historical cycles, Woo noted that it could take until January to happen. Hence, at least in the near term, Bitcoin’s probability of consolidating or stagnating for a longer period remains high. While this does not mean that BTC would see a significant correction, it could result in lower volatility and a more cautious near-term price trend. Woo explained:One positive factor that could offset a potential SOPR-induced sell-off in the short to medium term is the Long-Term Holder MVRV. Glassnode analysts explained that the MVRV is far from the danger zone, which previously marked local tops. For example, when Bitcoin hit an all-time high in December 2017, the Long-Term Holder MVRV surpassed 20. In contrast, this metric is currently at around 3.Both SOPR and MVRV suggest that Bitcoin is still in the early phase of its bull cycle. SOPR is substantially lower than where it was during the 2017 peak, similar to MVRV. It goes in line with the narrative of a post-halving cycle, where Bitcoin tends to peak 12 to 15 months after a block reward halving occurs. If a similar cycle as the last halving in mid-2016 repeats, BTC could peak in mid-2021. Glassnode analysts explained that the MVRV ratio is currently extremely bullish, adding: “When LTH-MVRV reaches the red zone (above 20), this generally indicates a global top. But as we can see in the chart below, Bitcoin’s LTH-MVRV is still very far from the red zone.”However, Bitcoin breaking past $20,000 is a possibility in the near term. There are mixed opinions about what comes next after BTC cleanly breaches its record high. Some believe there could be a blow-off top in the $20,000 to $21,000 range as euphoria peaks. Others say that retail interest in Bitcoin could begin.There are two main reasons why the mainstream interest in Bitcoin would rise after BTC reaches a new all-time high. First, many retail investors lost large sums of capital in 2017 by buying near $20,000. As such, the all-time high remains a roadblock for many investors. Secondly, there is no historical ceiling for BTC above $20,000, so the price discovery period will likely begin.A pseudonymous technical analyst known as “Crypto Monk” said a break of $20,000 presents the “max pain scenario”: “All those people who could have jumped in below $10k but decided to pass by targeting crazy low prices are now hoping for a massive pullback to get a second chance.”Eric Thies, a cryptocurrency trader, told Cointelegraph that he expects Bitcoin to break $20,000. Thies said Bitcoin would likely see a newfound rally in January 2021 that would continue the ongoing uptrend after some consolidation:Alongside the historical significance of Bitcoin surpassing $20,000, on-chain data suggests that the number of BTC holders is generally increasing. On Dec. 10, the number of Bitcoin addresses with a balance reached 33.22 million, according to researchers at IntoTheBlock. This is a record high, and it suggests that the retail interest in BTC is increasing.Atop the strong on-chain fundamental factors buoying the ongoing rally, the institutional demand for Bitcoin continues to increase. On Dec. 15, Barry Silbert, the CEO of Grayscale, said the firm achieved $13 billion in assets under management. This is indicative of increasing institutional appetite for an exchange-traded fund alternative among accredited investors in the United States.The sustained institutional demand for Bitcoin has been crucial for the recent uptrend because it has made traders cautious in net-shorting BTC. The Bitcoin price was at risk of major corrections several times in the past week, most notably, the threat of a larger pullback to the $16,000 macro support area when the price fell under $18,000. Yet, traders seem reluctant to short Bitcoin due to the unpredictability of institutions accumulating BTC. A pseudonymous trader known as “Bitcoin Jack” said that he doesn’t want to bet against the billionaires, adding: “A cash position is the moderate approach between downside risk mitigation and getting blown up to the up-/downside. Reality is that I don’t know what will happen from here. Big cash flows are entering Bitcoin.”"

262,"The Bitcoin (BTC) price is heading to $50,000 in 2021, says the best-selling author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki. Kiyosaki pinpointed that a “wall of institutional money” is coming to Bitcoin in 2021, which could push the price up further.Kiyosaki, who is also a real estate mogul and an investor in precious metals, has historically liked various stores of value including silver.Based on the institutional inflow into Bitcoin, Kiyosaki noted that BTC below $20,000 is ideal, as $50,000 is the next target. He said:If Bitcoin hits $50,000, its market cap would reach $928 billion, which is around 10.3% of gold’s market cap compared with the current 2.9%.Bitcoin is in a favorable position to rally in the upcoming months because of its low correlation with the stock market.Traditional safe-haven assets, like gold, often pull back when U.S. equities rally. In the case of BTC, it has shown a relatively low correlation with U.S. stocks. Hence, Bitcoin has seen sharp uptrends even when equities increase in value.For instance, over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin price has increased by around 4.5%, recording a 6.5% gain at the day’s peak.BTC rallied in tandem with gold, while the Asian markets slumped and U.S. stocks slightly retreated. Holger Zschaepitz, a market analyst at Welt, said:The lack of correlation between Bitcoin and U.S. stocks likely comes from two factors. First, when risk-on assets increase, BTC benefits from an overall rise in investor appetite.Second, stocks have increased in recent months due to unprecedented central bank liquidity injections. Relaxed financial conditions benefit Bitcoin because investors move to hedge against inflation.The CME Bitcoin futures market’s open interest is hovering at $1.07 billion, just behind OKEx and Binance Futures.The data shows that institutional demand for Bitcoin is high to the point where institution-focused platforms are surpassing major retail exchanges in open interest and trading volume.Grayscale has also surpassed $13 billion in assets under management on Dec. 15, indicating a large increase in institutional inflow into Bitcoin.Record AUM for Grayscale...$13 billion https://t.co/bSFF7JtimbInstitutions appear to be rapidly accumulating Bitcoin following the high-profile publicized investments from the likes of MicroStrategy, Square and MassMutual.

As previously reported, the scam involved fake articles using unauthorised images of celebrities to advertise fraudulent crypto investment schemes and steal money. The Guardian itself became a victim of the scheme as the news agency accidentally ran some of these scam ads.According to the latest report, The Guardian Australia found five names of people who had registered hundreds of fake websites related to the scam, “all with addresses in the centre of Moscow.” The news agency said that Google has launched an investigation as two of the email addresses were linked to Gmail accounts.The Guardian noted that there is other information suggesting that the scam scheme may also have links to Ukraine, referring to a March 2020 report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, or OCCRP. The OCCRP investigation found a call centre running similar Bitcoin scams operating from Kiev.In March 2020, a whistleblower revealed the existence of a crypto scam operating from Ukraine.

However, BTC then dropped to $19,050 within three hours, recording a sudden 2.5% pullback.Bitcoin spiked to around $19,600 from the momentum of its relief rally and negative futures market funding rates. But it rejected the same level it broke down from since November due to selling pressure from whales.As Cointelegraph reported on Dec. 12, technical indicators showed BTC was oversold after dropping below $17,600.The four-hour candle chart saw a bullish divergence and a TD9 buy indicator, signaling that selling pressure was exhausted.Bitcoin’s price quickly recovered above $18,000 and continued its run past $18,300. BTC then breaking the whale cluster key resistance level at $18,800 further boosted its momentum.Buoyed by the relief rally, Bitcoin continued to soar, eventually surging to as high as $19,570 across major exchanges.The futures funding rates across Binance Futures and other major platforms turned negative as Bitcoin began to recover above $18,000.The funding rate of Bitcoin futures contracts turns negative when there are more short-sellers than buyers. This means the likelihood of a short squeeze increases, which could cause buyer demand to suddenly spike.Although the funding rate was negative for a brief time, since Bitcoin’s funding rate rarely turns negative, it was indicative of aggressive selling.A pseudonymous trader known as “Byzantine General” pointed out that short-sellers were highly aggressive throughout the relief rally. A move above $19,300 would squeeze many shorts, he added, saying:As soon as Bitcoin surpassed $19,300, it quickly made its way to $19,570, suggesting that a large short squeeze occurred.Despite the strong recovery, Bitcoin then saw a large sell-off above $19,500 as whales took profits.Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, said on Dec. 15 that he is reducing his position due to the increase in whale deposits to exchanges. He said:Unpopular opinion:
Don't buy the f*cking dip

Too many $BTC whales on exchangesSince then, Bitcoin has dropped back below $19,100, consolidating under the $19,400 resistance area once again.In the near term, the key for Bitcoin is to remain above the $18,800 support level. As Cointelegraph reported, this level holding would be a bullish sign that may propel BTC to have another go at new all-time highs."
266,"Over the weekend Bitcoin (BTC) price made a push back above the $19,000 level as traders showed up and provided enough volume to support the surge. At the time of writing, BTC price breaking above a pennant but the $19,300 to $19,500 range continues to present significant resistance. According to Cointelegraph contributor, Rakesh Upadhyay:As Bitcoin bulls attempt topush the price to the $19,500 resistance, a handful of altcoins have capitalized on BTC’s range-bound price action by rallying higher to key resistance levels.Yearn.finance’s (YFI) governance token is currently showing an inverse head and shoulders formation on the 1-hour timeframe and as the price pushes at the neckline traders will look for a breakout to the $27,750 to $27,850 level.Risk-averse traders will likely wait for a 1-hour close above the neckline at $26,276 before opening a position.The 4-hour chart also shows a VPVR gap extending from $26,115 to $27,851 and the RSI has entered bullish territory above 50. In the event of a pullback, the 20-MA may provide support as it sits closely below at $25,468.AAVE is also showing a similar construction to YFI except that it recently broke above the neckline of its inverse head and shoulders pattern to surge to a 5-day high at $91.78.This move and the accompanying high volume surge triggered a bit of profit-taking but traders who take a quick glance at AAVE’s chart will notice that lower support retests frequently occur after the rallies like the one seen today.Profit-taking led to the price retesting the $85.50 support and if this level can hold and Bitcoin doesn’t breakdown from its pennant, AAVE price will likely reclaim $88.30. A daily close above $91.78 will open the door to AAVE securing a new all-time high above $94.90.Another altcoin quietly making strong moves is Elrond (EGLD) which has rallied 75% since completing a rounding bottom on Dec. 7. Currently, EGLD is up 10.5% today and after topping out at $20.12 the altcoin is pulling back to retest underlying support levels.There is support at $17.42, and below this at $16.80 where the 20-MA resides and the volume profile visible range shows support.While the 4-hour chart suggests that the bullish move has ended, the daily timeframe shows EGLD on the verge of overtaking the Sept. 4 high at $20.50, after which there is no overhead resistance and the possibility of a new all-time high above $35.If Bitcoin price successfully breaks above $19,500 and flips the level to support it's likely that YFI, AAVE and Elrond will follow in tandem.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

267,"British Virgin Islands-based institutional mining platform, Genesis Mining, has published the findings from a survey of 1,000 current and former U.S.-based Bitcoin investors — two-thirds of whom believe BTC is a better long-term store of value than the dollar.More than half of respondents believe Bitcoin will beat out gold, real estate and the stock market over the five to 10 years, with 65% expressing faith that BTC’s value will continue to appreciate with time.Yet, despite the apparently favorable sentiment, just 17% of those surveyed predicted Bitcoin’s price would exceed $50,000 by 2030. This would only require the price to increase by 160% over the next 10 years, while BTC has already gained 166.5% during 2020 so far.A further 17% predicted that Bitcoin’s price would actually fall over the next decade, while one-sixth of respondents did not feel confident in speculating on BTC’s long-term price performance.In total, 50.1% of respondents estimated that BTC will be worth $20,000 or less by 2030, one-third predicted the price will be $10,000 or less, and 11.8% forecasted prices below $1,001.Almost one-third of respondents who predict a stagnate or bearish 10-year performance expected Bitcoin to be hindered by regulations, while one-fifth anticipated outright bans on cryptocurrency from governments.Roughly 17% of non-bullish respondents expected another cryptocurrency or a central bank-issued digital currency will capture a dominant market share and supersede BTC, while 16% predict Bitcoin’s historical meteoric hype-cycles will die down over time. Nearly 10% of participants do not believe “there is going to be a practical use case” for Bitcoin in the future.On the bullish end of the spectrum, one-tenth tipped Bitcoin would be worth six figures or more in a decade, with half of them expecting prices exceeding $500,000. Almost 30% of bullish respondents believe Bitcoin adoption will be driven by declining trust in fiat currencies, with 25.8% anticipating “a major economic depression” will spark widespread adoption. More than half of respondents believe “Bitcoin adoption has much room for growth” regardless of any political forces external to crypto.The survey had a good mix of investors, with a quarter allocating more than half their wealth to virtual currency investments, a quarter had crypto exposure of between 10% to 50%, another quarter had between 1% and 10% in crypto, while the rest had 1% or less of their wealth currently in virtual currency.A recent survey from fund manager Grayscale Investments found that the COVID-19 pandemic had a positive impact on Bitcoin sentiment, with 39% of respondents describing BTC as “more appealing” amid the pandemic.Last month, a survey of 700 high-net-worth individuals published by deVere Group found that 73% of millionaires either already own or are planning to invest in crypto assets by 2023."
268,"Strategists at JPMorgan said in a note that MassMutual’s $100 million Bitcoin (BTC) purchase shows that insurance firms and pension funds are now adopting Bitcoin. According to the analysts, typically this class of institutional investors is conservative in their style of investing so the recent allocation is quite significant.However, the strategists said that even if the pension funds and the insurance companies in the U.S., Japan, the U.K., and the Euro area keep 1% of their assets in Bitcoin, that could amount to an additional inflow of about $600 billion into Bitcoin.These investments by institutions may have increased the confidence of traditional investors on Wall Street who can now easily allocate a larger portion of their portfolio to Bitcoin.CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer revealed in a recent interview that he purchased Bitcoin on dips under $18,000 and will continue to add on declines as he wants to “diversify into all sorts of asset classes.”Another long-term bullish sign for Bitcoin is that the number of wallets containing a whole coin or more has risen to a new all-time high, according to on-chain analytics resource Glassnode. This shows that investors are not closing their positions at the all-time high but are buying more and withdrawing their Bitcoin from the exchanges to cold storage.Now that several fundamental factors favor Bitcoin and altcoins resuming their uptrends, investors will be curious to see if BTC will at last snatch a new all-time high above $20,000. Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin (BTC) broke below the 20-day exponential moving average ($18,492) on Dec. 11, but this proved to be a bear trap. The price quickly turned up and rose above the 20-day EMA on Dec. 12.The long wick on the Dec. 13 candlestick and today’s Doji candlestick pattern shows that the bears are attempting to defend the $19,500 overhead resistance. However, the positive thing is that the bulls have not given up much ground.The rising moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) above 58 suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside.If the bulls can push the price above the $19,500 to the $20,000 overhead resistance zone, it will complete an ascending triangle pattern that has a target objective of $22,808.98.Conversely, if the price again gets rejected at the current levels and the bears sink the BTC/USD pair below the trendline of the triangle, a drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($16,888) and then to $16,191.02 will be on the cards.If the price rebounds off $16,191.02, the pair may enter a few days of range-bound action.Ether (ETH) broke out of the descending channel on Dec. 13, which is the first sign that the correction could be over. If the bulls buy the current dip to the 20-day EMA (564) and do not allow the price to sustain inside the channel, it will indicate strength.The ETH/USD pair is in the early stages of forming an ascending triangle pattern that will complete on a breakout and close above $622.807. This bullish setup has a target objective of $763.614.The gradually rising 20-day EMA and the RSI above 55 suggest that bulls have the upper hand.This bullish view will fail if the pair breaks below the 20-day EMA and the ascending triangle. Such a move could drag the price down to the 50-day SMA ($501).The bulls could not sustain XRP above the 20-day EMA ($0.53), and the price dropped to $0.485419 on Dec. 12. The bulls bought the lows and are attempting to keep the altcoin above the $0.50 level.However, the lack of a strong rebound suggests that bears are selling aggressively. If the price sustains below $0.4850, the XRP/USD pair could resume the correction and fall to the 50-day SMA at $0.41.The gradually falling 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative zone suggest that bears are attempting to take control. This negative view will invalidate if the price rebounds off the current levels and rises above the 20-day EMA.Litecoin (LTC) bounced off the 50-day SMA ($71) on Dec. 11, and the bulls pushed the price above the 20-day EMA ($78) on Dec. 13. This suggests accumulation at lower levels.The LTC/USD pair could be in the early stages of forming a large symmetrical triangle, which usually acts as a continuation pattern. The bears could defend the resistance line of the triangle, while the bulls may buy on weakness to the support line.A breakout of the triangle could resume the up-move, while a break below the triangle will signal that bears have the upper hand. The flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a possible consolidation for a few days.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) recovered from $256.10 on Dec. 11 and reached $282.21 on Dec. 13. However, the bears defended this level aggressively and have pushed the price back below the 50-day SMA ($271).Both moving averages are flat and the RSI is just below the midpoint, which suggests a few days of range-bound action. The price may move back and forth between $231 on the downside and $280 on the upside.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can propel the price above $280, the BCH/USD pair may rise to $300 and then to $320. However, if the bears sink the price below $231, the pair may drop to $200.Chainlink (LINK) broke below the uptrend line on Dec. 11, but the bulls purchased at lower levels and pushed the price back above the uptrend line on Dec. 12. This attracted further buying, and the altcoin reached the $13.28 overhead resistance on Dec. 13.However, the price has turned down from $13.28 and dipped back below the moving averages. This suggests that the bears are defending the overhead resistance.Both moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is just below the midpoint, which suggests that the LINK/USD pair could remain range-bound for a few days. The price could seesaw between $13.28 and $11.43 for a few days.A break below $11.43 could signal that bears have overpowered the bulls and that could result in a fall to $10. Conversely, a break above $13.28 will suggest advantage to the bulls.Cardano (ADA) broke above the downtrend and the 20-day EMA ($0.147) on Dec. 13. This suggests that the correction could be over. However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily.The bears are currently trying to stall the recovery at $0.155. If the bears can sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the price can drop to $0.13. If the bulls again buy this dip, then the ADA/USD pair may remain range-bound between $0.13 and $0.155 for a few days.However, the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests buying at lower levels. The gradually upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI above 55 suggest that bulls have the upper hand. Above $0.155, the pair could rally to $0.175.The relief rally in Polkadot (DOT) has again hit a barrier at the downtrend line. This suggests that the sentiment is negative and the bears are trying to sell on minor rallies to the downtrend line.The flattening 20-day EMA ($4.92) and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a few days of range-bound action. The price may consolidate between $4.54 on the downside and $5.10 on the upside.However, if the bears sink the price below $4.54, the down move could resume and the DOT/USD pair could drop to $4.20 and then $3.80. A break above $5.10 will be the first indication that bulls are attempting to gain an upper hand.Binance Coin (BNB) is currently stuck inside a large range between $32 and $25.6652. The crisscrossing moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest that the range-bound action may extend for a few more days.The BNB/USD pair has risen above the moving averages and the bulls will now try to push the price to the $32 overhead resistance. This level has previously acted as stiff resistance and the bears will again try to turn the price down from this level.If they succeed, the pair may consolidate between $29 and $32 for a few days. On the other hand, if the bulls drive the price above the $32 to $33.3888 resistance, the next of the uptrend could begin.Stellar Lumens (XLM) broke above the downtrend line on Dec. 13, which suggests that the correction could be over. However, the bears are not ready to give up their advantage without putting up a fight.The sellers are currently defending the $0.18 resistance. The flattish 20-day EMA ($0.16) and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. This could keep the XLM/USD pair range-bound between $0.18 and $0.14 for a few days.If the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair may drop to $0.14. A break below the range will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears while a break above $0.18 will open the doors for an up-move to $0.205.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

269,"As Bitcoin (BTC) tested a $17,580 low on Dec. 11, investors remained relatively calm despite some analysts issuing bearish estimates. The week may have finished at the same level where it started, but the fundamentals for Bitcoin have become even healthier.Whenever the Bitcoin price drops considerably, there is usually some blatantly bearish analysis popping up and while this may sway the investment decisions of retail investors, professional traders know better. They avoid the FUD and the excessive pessimism that is the result of negative price swings.In the past week, Bitcoin dominance continued its uptrend up, from 63.5% to 64.5%. This move was likely fueled by MassMutual insurance company's $100 million acquisition and MicroStrategy's $650 million bond sale.This news appears to have given further confidence to investors who were doubting a potential $20,000 retest.Bitcoin outperformed the top-15 altcoins, which dropped 2.5% on average over the past week. However, overall volumes were disappointing compared to the previous month. This indicator partially invalidates the recent $17,580 low, as it denotes a lack of confidence.On the other hand recent data also display a moderate lack of interest at the current $19,100 level, but that is something that ought to be tested during the week when usually more volume goes through.Crypto fund manager Grayscale Investments continued to aggressively add BTC to their portfolio, surpassing $10.7 billion worth.Over the past week, 14,050 BTC were added, totaling 561,130 BTC. Therefore, it was another excellent week for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Similar excitement can be seen by analyzing the fund’s premium over the effective BTC held by each share, currently at 0.00095116 BTC.As depicted above, the premium increased from 11% to 22% in the past 7 days. The indicator reached an 8% premium on Dec. 9 but quickly recovered to 16%. Therefore it reflects positive momentum as it stands above its 3-month average of 12%.Perpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate usually charged every eight hours. Funding rates ensure there are no exchange risk imbalances. Even though both buyers and sellers' open interest is matched at all times, the leverage can vary.When buyers (longs) are the ones demanding more leverage, the funding rate turns positive. Therefore, the buyers will be the ones paying up the fees. This issue holds especially true during bull runs, when there is usually more demand for longs.Sustainable rates above 2% per week translate to extreme optimism. This level is acceptable during market rallies but problematic if the BTC price is sideways or in a downtrend.In situations like these, high leverage from buyers increases the likelihood of large liquidations during surprise price drops.Take notice how, despite Bitcoin's weakness on Dec. 11, the weekly funding rate managed to avoid the negative territory. This data indicates that both short (sell) and long (buy) traders use roughly the same leverage.Such an indicator can be deemed neutral, as both sides have powder left to increase bets.The funding rate might bring some distortions as it's the preferred instrument of retail traders and, as a result, is impacted by excessive leverage. On the other hand, professional traders tend to dominate longer-term futures contracts with set expiry dates.A trader can gauge their bullishness level by measuring how much more expensive futures are versus the regular spot market. The 3-month fixed-calendar futures should usually trade with a 1.5% or higher premium versus regular spot exchanges.Whenever this indicator fades or turns negative, this is an alarming red flag. Such a situation, also known as backwardation, indicates that the market is turning bearish.The above chart shows that the indicator briefly touched the extreme-optimistic 5% on Dec. 1 but later adjusted to 2.5% as Bitcoin failed to break the $20,000 resistance.The indicator’s recent surge to 4% shows confidence in the BTC price recovery, indicating optimism from professional traders.By measuring whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options, one can gauge the overall market sentiment. Generally speaking, call options are used for bullish strategies, whereas put options for bearish ones.A 0.70 put-to-call ratio indicates that put options open interest lag the more bullish calls by 30% and is therefore bullish.In contrast, a 1.20 indicator favors put options by 20%, which can be deemed bearish. One thing to note is that the metric aggregates the entire BTC options market, including all calendar months.As Bitcoin price approaches $20,000, it's only natural for investors to seek downside protection. As a result, the put-to-call ratio peaked at 0.70 on Dec. 2. Albeit the increase, it was still favoring the more bullish call options by 30%.After this protection-seeking period, the indicator has moved back to a healthy 0.64. Thus, such a metric indicates moderate bullishness.Overall, each of the critical indicators discussed above have held steady within their expected range, especially considering the market has recently pulled back to $17,580.As BTC holds above $19,000, investors are regaining confidence as the price bounces back from every dip.At the moment, every indicator remains neutral-to-bullish, thus supporting a potential new all-time high for Bitcoin.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

270,"An unprecedented year, 2020 has sent the global economy into a tailspin in an effort to compensate for COVID-19-related difficulties. If the traditional system collapses, Bitcoin will become vital, according to United States Senator-elect Cynthia Lummis. ""If we reach the point where we have overspent so much that things start crashing down, the black swan event occurs with regard to any fiat currency — whether it’s ours or yours or China’s or Japan’s — that there is a backstop available to every government in the world, and that backstop is Bitcoin,” Lummis told Peter McCormack during a recent episode of his What Bitcoin Did podcast.Government actions and media coverage around COVID-19 spiked in March, resulting in businesses' closures and economic difficulties. Problems have since persisted in terms of economic stimulus and health matched with government COVID-19 mandates.Hailing from the crypto-friendly state of Wyoming, Lummis wants to further Bitcoin awareness among U.S. authorities. “I really want to use my time in the U.S. Senate in part to help introduce the topic of Bitcoin,” she said, explaining her desire to:In contrast to Bitcoin and its consistent supply, the U.S. dollar’s framework inherently includes inflation, making devaluation inevitable, according to Lummis, who owns Bitcoin herself. “I am a HODLer,” she said. “I only buy. I’ve never sold,” she added.In line with a difficult year, the U.S. national debt has further ballooned in 2020, standing at more than $27 trillion as of publication, which concerns Lummis. “I know that there is no strategy, no plan, for the United States to begin to retire its debt,” she said. “When I entered Congress in January of 2009, we had just turned over to $10 trillion from $9 trillion in debt.”U.S. governing authorities have doled out a number of COVID-19-related funding efforts this year, while also printing massive amounts of cash. Further pandemic-related spending talks are also currently underway, Lummis noted, positing Bitcoin as a possible solution.In addition to a debt solution, the U.S. needs “an alternative path just in case we fail, and I see the alternative path as Bitcoin,” Lummis said, subsequently citing the asset’s store-of-value role and limited supply."
271,"MassMutual’s $100 million Bitcoin (BTC) purchase shows that the demand for cryptocurrency will be growing further, according to strategists at major investment bank JPMorgan.In an investor note on Dec. 11, JPMorgan strategists including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou reportedly suggested that Bitcoin adoption is now expanding from family offices and wealthy investors to bigger investors like insurance firms and pension funds.As reported by Bloomberg, the experts said that insurance firms and pension funds are unlikely to invest large amounts in Bitcoin, but even a small shift toward crypto could be significant.If pension funds and insurance companies in the United States, Euro area, the United Kingdom and Japan allocate 1% of their assets to Bitcoin, Bitcoin demand would grow by an additional $600 billion, the strategists calculated. This is almost double Bitcoin’s market capitalization, which stands at $356 billion at publishing time, according to data from CoinMarketCap.JPMorgan strategists wrote, “MassMutual’s Bitcoin purchases represent another milestone in the Bitcoin adoption by institutional investors. [...] One can see the potential demand that could arise over the coming years as other insurance companies and pension funds follow MassMutual’s example.”Massachusetts-based insurance firm MassMutual announced on Dec. 11 that the company bought $100 million in Bitcoin for its general investment account. MassMutual told Cointelegraph that the investment is part of a broad strategy with the goal of achieving “measured yet meaningful exposure to a growing economic aspect of our increasingly digital world.”MassMutual’s foray into Bitcoin comes amid major institutional player MicroStrategy planning a $400 million securities offering to invest in BTC. MicroStrategy adopted Bitcoin as its primary asset after purchasing $425 million worth of Bitcoin in August and September. "
272,"Bitcoin (BTC) begins a new trading week within 5% of the mythical $20,000 price level — but can it get there this time?As the largest cryptocurrency lines up for another shot at overcoming seminal resistance, Cointelegraph looks at the market factors influencing price performance on Monday.On a wider macro level, talk is firmly focused on the United States agreeing a coronavirus stimulus package this week.A major test of the dollar’s strength, negotiations have “no guarantee” of being successful, one government aide told mainstream media, but the cost of the package under discussion is around $900 billion.As Cointelegraph reported, this will contain benefits for various economic sectors, but will crucially not involve a second stimulus check for ordinary Americans.Prospects of both a stimulus package and vaccine rollout have helped buoy a flagging dollar, but for the meantime, risk assets are recovering.These include stocks, with the Japanese market beating two-year highs in early trading on Monday. Oil is also on the rebound, nearing $47 a barrel amid hopes that the vaccine will spur fresh demand.For Bitcoin, however, any major boost to USD is always a concern — 2020 has been characterized by the inverse correlation between BTC and the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY).At press time, however, DXY was falling away from 91 points once more, still not far from its lowest levels since April 2018.This week will also see fresh guidance from the U.S. Federal Reserve about its virus-related economic response, with the dollar potentially moving in step with any major updates.Within Bitcoin, the weekend has continued what is a relatively recent phenomenon for price action — more happening on Saturday and Sunday than during the week.After a lackluster five days’ trading, BTC/USD rallied after Friday, rising from near $18,000 to highs of $19,400.The move is conspicuous, with fresh gains leading to another round of confidence votes from various familiar investors.“Bitcoin quietly tiptoeing above $19K. No big deal. Nothing to see here,” Gemini exchange co-founder Cameron Winklevoss summarized on Sunday.At press time, BTC/USD circled $19,150, having seen its rally stall at the start of upper resistance at $19,400. The level is highly significant, coinciding with definitive selling pressure in a $600 window which ends at the almighty $20,000.A previous attempt to take $20,000 swiftly failed, resulting in last week’s lows of $17,550. A look at exchange orderbook data shows the sell bids intact in the same place. Conversely, should $20,000 finally break, little resistance remains until $22,000 — currently Bitcoin’s final price hurdle.“We do see that we’ve made another higher low, which makes it very likely that we’re going to achieve a new all-time high in the coming weeks if $19,400-$19,500 breaks,” Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe added in an update on Sunday.#Bitcoin rallying during the weekend towards the all-time high region.

What are the crucial levels to watch? This small video from @CryptoMichNL explains the levels.

Full analysis:https://t.co/o9pJSBgrlU pic.twitter.com/3dTlFJGei0Countering the hope of a $20,000 showdown meanwhile, the weekend has ironically unleashed another “gap” in Bitcoin futures markets, providing downward pressure.Roughly $1,000 in size, the difference between the end of Friday and the start of Monday trading for CME Bitcoin futures markets gives a lower price target of $18,100.As Cointelegraph has previously noted, these “gaps” traditionally get filled soon after they appear, but the size of the two now open has presented difficulties. The previous $1,300 gap, almost unrivalled in size, was only half closed with the run to $17,550.“Remember, $BTC may need to close the CME futures gap at $16,925 before we see new all-time highs,” forex trader Justin Bennett, founder of DailyPriceAction, said about that gap.In analysis for Cointelegraph, Van de Poppe likewise highlighted the gaps as a continuing phenomenon to track.“A new CME gap will be created as the recent closing price is $18,115. As such, this futures gap will likely become a significant point for entry or exit, which is why such gaps frequently become a self-fulfilling prophecy and get filled,” he confirmed.Institutional uptake meanwhile continues to buoy sentiment and give Bitcoin positive publicity in the mainstream.Last week’s announcement from insurance fund MassMutual, involving a $100 million allocation, has led to further compliments from previous arch Bitcoin skeptic JPMorgan. This was not lost on the wider establishment, with Bloomberg quoting the bank’s strategists forecasting further buy-ins.“MassMutual’s Bitcoin purchases represent another milestone in the Bitcoin adoption by institutional investors,” one said.Markets commentator Holger Zschaepitz subsequently noted that MassMutual was causing a particular stir as it has a more “traditional investor” focus.Away from the big players, however, evidence of the “big buy-in” is mounting.According to statistics from on-chain analytics resource Glassnode, the number of Bitcoin wallets containing a whole coin or more is at a new all-time high. As of Sunday, almost 827,000 wallets had a balance of 1 BTC or more.The difficulty in accruing a whole unit of Bitcoin has become an increasingly hot topic on social media amid the corporate investment narrative. This has combined with data showing that despite recent price rises, coins continue to leave exchanges for cold storage.The result is that investor sentiment is being gauged as long-term “HODL” over short-term speculation."
273,"The end of 2020 has been lighting up crypto-centric subreddits and feeds of Bitcoin hodlers as the appetite for the digital bullion reaches an all-time high.The explosion has been accelerated via the adoption of the network by PayPal, along with the long-sought out stamp of approval from respected figures like Michael Saylor, Jack Dorsey, and Paul Tudor Jones.The corresponding price appreciation and mainstream awareness from the likes of Maisie Williams and the most recent institutional buy-in from MassMutual continue to buoy the price and sentiment surrounding Bitcoin (BTC).The tide continues to rise as the work-from-home dynamic drives digital transformation and it increasingly appears that 2021 will be an action-packed year for the next chapter in the evolution of the Bitcoin network.Let’s take a look at some of the key areas to keep an eye on in 2021.Bitcoin mining has many fundamental similarities to gold mining; however, there are key differences to explore in the complex task of valuing Bitcoin miners’ operations. We will focus on Riot Blockchain as an example, which is a U.S. Bitcoin miner headquartered in Colorado.Riot began mining in 2017 and has recently released plans for increasing their hash rate with a delivery of mining hardware expected this spring of 2021. Currently, Riot has a hash rate of 1.5 exahashes per second, which accounts for approximately 1.11% of the Bitcoin network’s total current hash rate of 135 EH/s.The company mined 224 BTC, according to their Q3 earnings released on Nov. 9, which is in the ballpark of $4.1 million in revenue at $18,500 per BTC.Considering the figures above, investors will wonder: How can a company justify a market cap of $670 million with just $8 million in revenue and massive operating (electricity) costs?Even with over 1,000 BTC listed on its balance sheet, which is $18.5 million at the current BTC price, the valuation is very stretched, to say the least.Here’s where two considerations come into play that could justify a much larger Riot market cap along with other crypto miners, assuming the network moves further into a bull market.One does not have to dig deep before finding a wide range of optimistic targets for Bitcoin’s price one year from now. The range extends from Mike Novogratz’s $65,000 estimate to PlanB’s $288,000 based on the popular stock-to-flow model.Meanwhile, CitiBank has recently called for $318,000; the Winklevoss twins have suggested $500,000, and Ark Investment CEO Catherine Wood appears to agree with the latter.These price targets are the reason why miners have stuck around through the bear cycle of 2018 and operated at a loss at times. They expect the network to be around for the foreseeable future. Miners also know that there is power in serving as the validators of network transactions, and the continued rise in the network hash rate shows that Bitcoin is becoming more secure and competitive every day.Those paltry 224 BTC that Riot mined in Q3 would expand its revenue stream to a larger, more ambiguous number if the upper limit of Bitcoin’s price is undefined. This means that Riot’s profit estimation would be unbound if BTC undergoes another parabolic rally, even if the present-day valuation does not make sense for the “lifting cost” to mine one Bitcoin and the quantity of mined BTC.Worrisome aspects about getting behind a Bitcoin miner are the low barrier to entry and the massively efficient and competitive proof-of-work network which Michael Saylor described as a nest of “cyber hornets”.Anyone can dedicate their computing power to mining Bitcoin, albeit with a very low probability of successfully mining a block and being the first to solve the hashing algorithm.As the hash rate increases, miners band together in pools, using increasingly powerful hardware to have the best chance of successfully mining a block. While anyone could theoretically start mining, you won’t get far unless you have the latest Antminer S19 from Bitmain, which won’t be available in stock until April 2021.The last time Bitcoin went parabolic, which was in 2017, there was a shortage of ASIC chips and other mining hardware, and suppliers, such as AMD, Nvidia and Bitmain, couldn't keep up with the demand.If this situation occurs again with Bitmain and MicroBT, then any miners who currently own the next-gen equipment will have an advantage until more hardware enters the fight.Conversely, gold miners have a proven source of the metal beneath the ground. Gold miners need both the proper drilling and excavating equipment and rights to the land, which serve as barriers to entry for mining gold.Should the price of gold double to $4,000 per ounce, prospecting would increase, and the rate at which gold is extracted from the earth would increase. This would, in turn, break down the activation energy for entry and bring the supply and demand into equilibrium, consequently lowering the price if supply overshoots demand.However, no matter how much the mining hardware arms race continues, Bitcoin cannot be mined faster than 6.25 BTC every 10 minutes thanks to the supply schedule and difficulty adjustment that Satoshi Nakamoto built into the protocol. This heavily impacts the supply-and-demand dynamics of Bitcoin, something which I’ll touch on a bit later.Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) trades over the counter and allows investors to gain exposure to the underlying digital currency in common brokerage accounts, like a closed-end fund.Each share represents 0.00095346 Bitcoin after subtracting the annual 2% fee and premium of GBTC. Below is a comparison of the performance of GBTC vs. Bitcoin over the past four months.As shown by the narrowing gap between the asset prices during the end of September, GBTC tends to do slightly worse than BTC during a period of price consolidation.GBTC performs slightly better than the underlying asset as the premium expands, and increased market demand tampers with the inefficiencies of the OTC investment vehicle versus the real-time price of the underlying asset.This can be seen in the widening gap during the price increase over the past two months.The chart below shows even greater detail regarding GBTC’s premium over the past 12 months, in addition to the Net Asset Value in comparison to share price.The premium bottomed out at approximately 10% in times of bearish BTC price action (in April, July and September) and expanded to as high as 30% to 40% during the rapid price increases that occurred in February and August.The recent Bitcoin price acceleration to $19,000 from $11,000 is increasing the premium in accordance with this trend. It remains to be seen what competitor closed-end funds offering Bitcoin exposure would do to GBTC, as it is the sole product of its kind in the U.S. marketplace.On Nov. 25, VanEck launched a Bitcoin exchange-traded note trading on Germany’s Böerse Xetra exchange, and with SEC Chairman Jay Clayton stepping down in December, there may be an increased likelihood of a U.S. exchange-traded fund approval if the newly appointed SEC chairperson is more favorable toward the asset.Buckle your seat belt. Every 10 minutes, a block is mined, and 6.25 new Bitcoin come into existence as the block reward compensation.To put this into perspective, every hour, 37.5 BTC is mined. That equates to 900 new BTC per day. Before the May 11 Bitcoin halving, this figure was 12.5 BTC every 10 minutes, and in 2024, it will dwindle further to 3.125 BTC.The daily addition to the Bitcoin market cap is approximately $16.7 million of newly minted coins at current prices. GBTC itself reported a daily inflow of $115 million on Nov. 12, which is an 11x increase from the $50 million weekly in the previous month.This demand is 6.9x the new supply, and to quantify demand from Square, PayPal and exchanges across the world. Thus, it is clear that there is an increasingly large gap between the demand for Bitcoin and the newly mined coins entering the market. Historically, this dynamic has appeared in the year or so following a block reward halving.Last time, in the four-year cycle, it led to the 2017 run that put crypto briefly in the eyes of mainstream retail investors, as the price had appreciated 20x from $1,000 in January to $20,000 by the end of the year.If Bitcoin were to liken to gold’s status as a global store of value, the $9 trillion gold market is the benchmark that investors have on their radar.This would mean a 25-fold increase from the current Bitcoin market cap, assuming the two can co-exist amicably.While we continue to digest this rapidly changing digital ecosystem at our own unique paces, the Bitcoin network buzzes along and gains further traction, taking no prisoners in the process.What developments will 2021 bring for us to grapple with and discuss next?Happy HODLdays!The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

274,"December is proving to be another blockbuster month for Bitcoin as the flow of institutional investors injecting funds into Bitcoin continues to increase.Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy announced that it had raised $650 million worth of convertible bonds at a rate of 0.75% due in 2025. The company now plans to invest the net proceeds in Bitcoin after identifying its “working capital needs and other general corporate purposes.” When institutional investors show such a large appetite to buy Bitcoin (BTC) near the all-time high, it is no surprise that the corrections have been shallow.Tyler Winklevoss said in a recent interview with CNBC that institutional investors are worried about the “oncoming inflation and the scourge of inflation with all the money printing and the stimulus from the COVID pandemic lockdowns.” Hence, they have been putting money into Bitcoin.Today, Bitcoin price surged back above the $19,000 level and it may challenge the psychological $20,000 resistance. If this level is broken out with conviction, it may create FOMO among retail traders as many have not participated in the current rally.If money from retail investors also starts gushing in, then Bitcoin could pick up momentum and start the next leg of the up-move.Along with Bitcoin, there are a few altcoins that may participate in the up-move next week. Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies in order to spot the critical support and resistance levels to watch out for.Bitcoin closed below the 20-day exponential moving average ($18,435) on Dec. 10 and 11. However, the long tail on the Dec. 11 candlestick shows that the bulls purchased the dip instead of panicking and dumping their positions.The price rose above the 20-day EMA on Dec. 12 and this could have trapped some aggressive bears who went short in the past few days expecting a sharp fall. This short covering and buying by the bulls pushed the price above the descending channel today.The price has again reached the $19,500 to $20,000 overhead resistance zone. If the bulls can thrust the price above this zone, the next leg of the uptrend could begin.Conversely, if the price again turns down sharply from the current levels and plummets below $17,500, it could signal that a short-term top is in place. Such a move could pull the price down to the next support at $16,191.02.The 20-day EMA has started to turn up and the relative strength index (RSI) has rebounded off the 50 level, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand.The 4-hour chart shows an ascending triangle formation, which will complete on a breakout and close above the overhead resistance zone. This setup has a target objective of $23,576.However, the bears are currently attempting to stall the up-move at the $19,500 resistance. If the price turns down from the current levels, the bulls are likely to buy on any dip to the 20-EMA. A strong rebound off this support will improve the prospects of a breakout above $19,500.This bullish view will be invalidated if the BTC/USD pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the trend line of the triangle.A breakdown of a bullish setup traps several aggressive bulls and that could result in panic selling. If that happens, a drop to $16,191.02 may be on the cards.Ether (ETH) has broken out of the descending channel, which suggests advantage to the bulls. The price can now move up to the $622.807 to $635.456 overhead resistance zone.The RSI has bounced off the midpoint and broken out of the downtrend line, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand.If the bulls can push the price above the resistance zone, the next leg of the uptrend could begin. Although there could be some pit stops in between, the next target is $800.On the other hand, if the ETH/USD pair turns down from the overhead resistance but does not give much ground, it will be a positive sign and will increase the likelihood of a breakout of the resistance zone.This bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels and re-enters the channel. Such a move will suggest that the current breakout was a bull trap.The 4-hour chart shows an ascending triangle formation, which will complete on a breakout and close above $622.807. The moving averages on the verge of a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the positive territory indicate that bulls have the upper hand.This positive view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and breaks below the triangle. Such a move could result in a drop to $488.134.Monero (XMR) completed an inverse head and shoulders pattern on Dec. 7 but the bears quickly dragged the price back below the neckline on Dec. 9. However, the bulls again purchased the dip to the 20-day EMA ($133) and propelled the price back above $135.50 on Dec. 11. This suggests aggressive buying at lower levels.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 66 suggest advantage to the bulls. The target objective of the breakout from the bullish setup is $167.However, the bears may have other plans. They are likely to defend the psychological level at $150. If the price turns down from this resistance but rebounds off the $135.50 support, it will suggest that bulls are accumulating at lower levels.On the contrary, if the price drops below the $135.50 support and the 50-day SMA ($124), it will suggest that the bears are back in the driver’s seat.The 4-hour chart shows the formation of an ascending triangle pattern that completed on a breakout and close above $142.50. However, the XMR/USD pair has not picked up momentum and the price is stuck inside the $142.50 to $150 range.If the bulls can thrust the price above $150, the uptrend could resume with the next target at $162.50. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside.NEM (XEM) soared on Dec. 12 and the price reached the $0.27688 overhead resistance today. The bears are currently attempting to stall the up-move at this resistance.However, if the bulls do not give up much ground from the current levels, it will suggest that traders are not booking profits in a hurry. That could keep the price range-bound near the overhead resistance.The upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.209) and the RSI near the overhead resistance suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the bulls can propel the price above $0.27688, the XEM/USD pair could move up to $0.3564607.The bears are aggressively defending the overhead resistance. If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, it will enhance the prospects of a breakout of $0.27688. The upsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the positive zone suggest bulls have the upper hand.Contrary to this assumption, if the price breaks below the moving averages, a drop to the trendline is possible. A break below this support will suggest that the bulls have lost their grip.AAVE is trading inside an ascending channel. The price turned down from the $95 overhead resistance on Dec. 8, but the positive sign is that the bulls have purchased the dip to the 20-day EMA ($77).The RSI has once again bounced off the midpoint and the 20-day EMA has started to turn up. This suggests that the correction may be over and the bulls are back in control. The first target on the upside is a retest of the $95.If the bulls can push the price above $95, the next leg of the up-move could begin. The $100 psychological level may act as a resistance but if the bulls can drive the price through it, the AAVE/USD pair could rise to the resistance line of the channel at $112.This bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels and plummets below the support line of the channel. Such a move will suggest that the trend has turned in favor of the bears.The price turned up from $70.564, just above the support line of the ascending channel but the bears are attempting to stall the relief rally at $86.14.If the bulls can push the price above this resistance, the pair could rise to $95. A break above $95 could start the next leg of the uptrend.On the other hand, if the price turns down from $86.14, the pair may form the right shoulder of a possible inverse head and shoulders pattern. This view will be negated if the price dips below the $70.50 support.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

275,"Humans, being only human, tend to hang on to their cherished beliefs — even in the face of overwhelming contradiction. That’s why recantations — that is, public acts of refuting a previously held opinion — are so rare. This year, however, has presented several notable changes of heart where Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies were concerned — abetted, perhaps, by BTC’s climb to record price levels. Here are eight of the year’s more memorable turnarounds. Crypto’s most ferocious critic recanted in 2020. Roubini, an NYU professor of economics who gained fame by predicting the 2007–2009 housing bubble, has in recent years heaped scorn on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in general.What he said in 2018: Part of Roubini’s testimony for the United States Senate went viral: “Crypto is the mother of all scams and (now busted) bubbles.” He also called blockchain “the most over-hyped technology ever, no better than a spreadsheet/database” — and this was just the title of his testimony.In his Senate visit, Roubini compared Bitcoin “to other famous historical bubbles and scams — like Tulip-mania, the Mississippi Bubble, the South Sea Bubble.” He noted that Bitcoin’s price increases had been two or three times larger than that of previous bubbles, followed by “ensuing collapse and bust as fast and furious and deeper.” At the time, Bitcoin was somewhat in the doldrums, selling at about $6,300.What he said recently: In a Nov. 6, 2020 interview, Roublini admitted that Bitcoin — selling at about $15,500 at the time — might qualify as a “partial store of value,” primarily because of its algorithm that limits supply to 21 million BTC. Of course, Roubini also declared that Bitcoin “is not scalable, it’s not secure, it’s not decentralized, it’s not a currency,” and that it would be made irrelevant or “crowded out” within three years by central bank digital currencies.Still, everything is relative. The professor’s partial pullback prompted economic historian Niall Ferguson to comment: “If I were as fond of hyperbole as he [Roubini] is, I would call this the biggest conversion since St. Paul.”Investor and hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller — the man who “broke the Bank of England” along with George Soros in 1992 by betting against the British pound — appeared to abandon his previous crypto skepticism in 2020.What he said then: “I look at Bitcoin as a solution in search of a problem,” Druckenmiller told the Economic Club of New York in June 2019. “I don’t understand why we need this thing. [...] I wouldn’t be short it, I wouldn’t be long it. [...] I don’t understand why it’s a store of value.”What he says now: In November 2020, worried about the United States Federal Reserve’s Covid-related stimulus efforts, Druckenmiller told CNBC that he now likes Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, perhaps even more than gold:“It has a lot of attraction as a store of value both to Millennials and the new West Coast money. [...] It’s been around for 13 years and with each passing day it picks up more of its stabilization as a brand. [...] Frankly, if the gold bet works, the Bitcoin bet will probably work better because it’s thinner, more illiquid and has a lot more beta to it.”More institutional investors began to notice crypto in 2020. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, told the Council on Foreign Relations in December regarding Bitcoin: “Many people are fascinated about it, many people are excited about it.” His remarks came less than two weeks after Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of fixed income, told CNBC that “Bitcoin is here to stay. [...] Bitcoin will take the place of gold to a large extent.”What he said in 2017: Speaking at a meeting of the Institute of International Finance shortly after BTC reached its all-time high above $5,800 in October 2017, Fink said: “Bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world. [...] That’s all it is. It’s an index of money laundering.”What he says now: In his dialog at the Council of Foreign Relations, Fink said, “We look at it as something that’s real,” adding that among three topics discussed recently on BlackRock’s website — COVID-19, monetary policy and Bitcoin — the hits for each topic were 3,000 on COVID, 3,000 on monetary policy, and 600,000 on Bitcoin. “What that tells you is that Bitcoin has caught the attention and the imagination of many people,” said Fink, adding that BTC was still untested and comprised a very small slice of overall asset markets.Ferguson, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, is one of the world’s best-known economic historians. Author of The Ascent of Money, he has been weighing in on crypto as far back as 2014 — and not always favorably.What he said in 2014: Digital currencies are a “complete delusion.”What he says now: “Bitcoin and China are winning the COVID-19 monetary revolution.” That, at least, was the headline he wrote in an opinion piece for Bloomberg in late 2020, which had as a subheading: “The virtual currency is scarce, sovereign and a great place for the rich to store their wealth.”To be fair, Ferguson backpedaled on his “Crypto is a delusion” remark in early 2019, and even joined a blockchain project, Ampleforth, that year. However, his recent screed suggests he has gone even further now — reconstituting himself as a fully fledged Bitcoin bull. “Bitcoin is gradually being adopted not so much as a means of payment but as a store of value,” he wrote.Two features were particularly attractive, in Ferguson’s view: Bitcoin’s limited supply (“Built-in scarcity in a virtual world characterized by boundless abundance”) and its sovereignty (“users can pay without going through intermediaries such as banks. They can transact without needing governments to enforce settlement”).When Bitcoin went on a tear back in December 2017, CNBC’s Jim Cramer was unimpressed. “Bitcoin’s not going to replace gold anytime soon,” he assured viewers. Three years later, Cramer has recalibrated. Maybe he was living too much in the past, he confided to Anthony Pompliano in a Sept. 15 podcast: “I have to start recognizing that maybe I am using a typewriter.”What he said: “Sooner or later, this thing [Bitcoin] is going to run out of steam,” Cramer predicted in a 2017 Mad Money segment titled, “Is Bitcoin the New Gold Alternative?” outlining five reasons he was suspicious of BTC: 1) No one knows who invented it; 2) No one knows how much the creator(s) kept for themselves; 3) The network lacks transparency; 4) It has no government support; and 5) It is based on nothing but software, which can be hacked.What he says now: “It’s perfectly logical to add crypto to the [inflation hedge] menu,” along with real estate, art masterpieces and gold, Cramer told Pompliano while voicing his concerns about recent COVID-related stimulus activity that might be inflating the United States dollar. What Cramer liked about Bitcoin “is the scarcity of it. [...] My kids when they get my inheritance won’t feel comfortable with gold [but they] will feel comfortable with crypto.”In late October, PayPal Holdings Inc. announced that it would allow users to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC), as well as use these cryptocurrencies for payment at its 28 million merchants globally. This marked a new leaf for the giant payments firm and its CEO, Dan Schulman.What he said in 2018: Crypto’s volatility “makes it unsuitable to be a real currency that retailers can accept,” Schulman told TheStreet in 2018. “I think you need to separate out the Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies as currencies and the underlying protocol called blockchain.”What he says now: “There’s no question that people are flocking to digital payments and digital forms of currency,” Schulman told CNBC.So, how can Schulman’s and PayPal’s new stance be explained? In 2020, PayPal was reportedly feeling some heat from another payments firm, Square, which for several years has allowed BTC purchases through its profitable Cash App unit.Indeed, only two weeks before PayPal’s Oct. 21 crypto announcement, Square declared that it had purchased $50 million in Bitcoin for its corporate treasury. By comparison, PayPal and Schulman had been more cautious regarding cryptocurrencies.With the COVID crisis, however, the use of cash has “declined precipitously — something like 40–70%,” the PayPal CEO told Squawk Box co-anchor Andrew Ross Sorkin in November. As noted, PayPal will allow customers to use crypto as a funding source for transactions in any of its merchant sites as of early 2021, but the firm will first convert the crypto into fiat currency before paying retailers. PayPal, not retailers, in other words, will be assuming the crypto’s price volatility risk.On the matter of Bitcoin, “financial journalists, too, are capitulating,” noted Ferguson. In late November, “the Financial Times’s Izabella Kaminska, a long-time cryptocurrency skeptic, conceded that Bitcoin had a valid use-case as a hedge against a dystopian future.”What she said in 2016: Writing in the Financial Times, which she joined in 2008 and for which she is the editor of FT Alphaville, Kaminska declared: “What is clear is that thus far the technology which was supposed to be revolutionizing finance and making it more secure (oddly, by skirting regulations) is looking awfully like the old technology which ran the system into the ground.”What she says now: “Was all the trouble of creating it [Bitcoin] really worth while? Surprisingly, for a long-term critic, I’m going to say yes,” Kaminska wrote in a Nov. 24, 2020 FT piece.What changed? Not Kaminska’s fundamental view of the cryptocurrency, at least. BTC remains “an intrinsically volatile and inelastic form of money” and is unlikely to ever become a widely used form of currency. “Yet there is one scenario that changes everything: a world in which no government is prepared to stand up for true civil liberties or free enterprise,” she wrote.Such a scenario seemed far-fetched only a year ago, but with the COVID-19 crisis, it’s now at least imaginable. For a future “in which the world slips towards authoritarianism and civil liberties cannot be taken for granted [...] Bitcoin’s anonymous security acts as a hedge against the worst of dystopian realities” — that is, as a sort of doomsday contingency system — and for that, “I am glad someone created Bitcoin.”Ray Dalio is the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund. Dalio surprised Reddit users recently when he acknowledged that over the past 10 years, Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies “have established themselves as interesting gold-like asset alternatives.” Until recently, Dalio was regarded as a staunch crypto skeptic.What he said in 2017: “Bitcoin is a bubble,” Dalio told CNBC. He claimed the token’s volatility makes it a poor store of value, and a holder would be hard-pressed to spend it anywhere. “Bitcoin is a highly speculative market.”What he says now: In his Dec. 8 Reddit “Ask Me Anything” session, Dalio opined that Bitcoin might now serve effectively as a “diversifier to gold,” given BTC’s limited supply and its mobility — unlike real estate, for example. Like some other investors who have reversed their positions on crypto recently, Dalio was worried about the “depreciating value of money” in the post-pandemic global economy.Indeed, if there is one thread running 2020’s recantations, it’s fear of inflation in the wake of economic stimulus measures taken by governments to avoid post-COVID economic collapse. Bitcoin may or may never become a useful medium of exchange, but it has clearly gained traction as a store of value, as its former critics now concede."
276,"Bitcoin (BTC) remains in the spotlight after MassMutual became the latest company to allocate $100 million of its portfolio into Bitcoin. This is adding to the impressive buy pressure at the moment, renewing hopes of Bitcoin breaking $20,000 in December. While a correction occurred in the past week, Bitcoin’s price bounced above the crucial level at $18,600 and is now targeting new all-time highs. However, since the breakout occurred during the weekend, one concern for the bulls is the relatively low volume of the bounce during the weekend.The 4-hour chart tells everything about the recent move of Bitcoin. Initially, Bitcoin’s price fell through the crucial support zone at $18,500 and dropped towards the next support at $17,600.This support zone held as support, resulting in a bullish divergence. Similarly, the bears couldn’t force a breakdown below $17,600 with buyers stepping in at this level.From there, the crucial resistance was $18,500, which was quickly broken in several hours. This move also saw a substantial rally toward the all-time high resistance zone at $19,500.This outlook gives an insight into the buildup of ranges after an impulse move to the upside. Bitcoin’s price has seen several during the year. The first impulse move occurred before the halving, the second one in August, and the last one over the past few months.However, every time such an impulse move occurs, a range is constructed as markets need to generate strength to continue the momentum. Nothing goes up in a straight line, and tests of previous resistance levels have to occur to continue the momentum.A rising wedge was established with a fake breakout above its recent high in every of the previous range constructions. The likelihood of this happening again is increasing given the current low-volume weekend move.From that perspective, a move towards $21,000 is back on the table, which should immediately see the $19,500 area flip for support. If that doesn’t happen, history will repeat itself, and Bitcoin most likely falls back into the range. Therefore, the levels to watch are $14,000 and $16,000 for higher timeframe support zones.The gaps in the CME futures chart have been the focus of many discussions and remain an important variable to keep an eye on.A new CME gap will be created as the recent closing price is $18,115. As such, this futures gap will likely become a significant point for entry or exit, which is why such gaps frequently become a self-fulfilling prophecy and get filled.There are two open CME gaps from recent price action. The first one didn’t fill completely as there's still open air at $17,015. The second one at $18,115 will be created due to the weekend's bullish price action.The crucial levels are easy to spot, as the chart shows. The resistance zone to break is $19,400-19,600. This is the all-time high resistance zone and the final one before BTC/USD goes into price discovery.However, a breakout doesn’t necessarily guarantee continuation. The resistance area must first flip for support for the rally to continue. Otherwise, a fakeout becomes the likely scenario as described in this article.On the downside, the $18,500-18,600 area has to hold to set the stage for testing new all-time highs. If that fails, the possible retests of $16,00 and even $14,000 remain on the table.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

277,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has started to rally once again on Dec. 13, rising above $19,200 after dropping to sub-$17,600 on Friday. The significant increase in buyer demand in that area indicates that BTC may have just seen a short-term bottom.When Bitcoin initially dropped to around $17,700, on-chain analysts, including Edward Morra and Nik Yaremchuk, pinpointed large buy orders on Bitfinex and Coinbase.As soon as the BTC price briefly dropped below $17,700, it started to rebound quickly, reclaiming $18,000 within three hours.Conventional technical analysis suggested that the logical Bitcoin bottom would likely be established at $17,000. It marked the top of a weekly candle in January 2018, and it is also a major support area on lower time frame charts.Morra noted that Bitcoin may have appeared to recover randomly at $17,600 if traders were not observing exchange heatmaps.Order books and heatmaps showed whales heavily bidding the $17,600 level, which likely marked a local bottom. Morra said:Yaremchuk, a cryptocurrency trader and an on-chain analyst, shared a similar sentiment when Bitcoin hit $17,600. On Dec. 11, the trader said:Bitcoin rebounding from $17,600 is highly optimistic because it printed a higher low formation on the 4-hour chart. This means that the bottom of the recent correction is higher than the previous bottom — a trend often spotted during rallies.The Bitcoin price also began to rally after it surpassed $18,800, which Cointelegraph identified as a potential whale cluster area and key resistance level.In the near term, there are two key factors to consider. First, as Cointelegraph consistently reported, Bitcoin sell-pressure remains relatively high. Second, this would mark the second retest of the all-time high since Nov. 30.There is an argument to be made that there is now less selling pressure in the near term since miners and whales sold-off heavily last week. In other words, this was the much-anticipated correction and the bullish U-turn has been confirmed. The probability of new all-time highs increases further if Bitcoin surpasses the $19,400 resistance next with low selling pressure.A pseudonymous trader known as “Beastlorion” said that the lack of sell pressure may trigger a big rally in the short term, saying:"
278,"Bitcoin mining started out as a small endeavor taken on by a few individuals repurposing home computers to mint virtual coins that were, at the time, almost worthless. Fast forward to 2020, and Bitcoin (BTC) mining has become a formidable industry of its own, constantly growing and evolving alongside Bitcoin itself.Today, the Bitcoin network’s hash rate is sitting at around 129 EH/s, acting in a similar way to the price of Bitcoin, even following the halving in October this year that saw the mining reward cut in half. James Bennett, CEO of ByteTree crypto data provider, told Cointelegraph that the trend is likely to continue: “The investment into Bitcoin’s network infrastructure is clear. You only need to look at the series of all-time-highs of network difficulty to see the rate new mining capacity is being added.” So, here’s how the mining industry is changing and maturing.There has been a trend of high-profile investors, both companies and individuals, investing in Bitcoin and other digital assets. This is also becoming true for Bitcoin mining as public corporations, including Nasdaq-listed Bit Digital and others, venture into the industry and related activities.As profits from Bitcoin mining rise back to their pre-halving levels, it makes sense why companies and individuals alike would want to invest in Bitcoin mining as an additional income stream, especially given that it proved to be fairly immune to the encumberments created by the coronavirus pandemic and widespread lockdowns. Whit Gibbs, host of the Hashr8 podcast, told Cointelegraph on the matter:With new participants joining the industry, access to capital is imperative, and many digital-asset liquidity companies — such as Blockfills, Nexo and others — now cater to Bitcoin miners. This allows miners to expand their operations and have some wiggle room when they don’t want to sell Bitcoin for a low price.Blockfills, for example, announced in May that it would be providing financial solutions to mining companies that wish to purchase new-generation ASIC mining equipment in North America. Since then, Blockfills has committed roughly $50 million in financial support to these miners. Neil Van Huis, partner and director at Blockfills, told Cointelegraph:In addition, miners have been subject to the volatility of Bitcoin. Hedging options were not previously available, and while Bitcoin derivatives now allow miners to hedge their bets, hash rate derivatives improve on these and give users a miner-specific product that they can leverage.Sam Chwarzynski, chief financial officer of Blockware Solutions and managing partner of Blockware Mining — a company providing hardware and services within the mining industry — explained that hash rate derivatives are still a new product, with two variations of it becoming popular. There are basic “cloud mining” contracts as well as “difficulty hedge” contracts that enable miners to lock in specific network difficulty rates for a certain time period, usually six to nine weeks. Chwarzynski further added:Bitcoin’s reputation has changed tremendously over time, and this has led governments to take either more relaxed or regulated stances toward the cryptocurrency industry. Countries like Portugal and others have cut taxes on activities such as cryptocurrency trading and mining as a means to incentive growth. Gibbs told Cointelegraph that “Aside from self-mining, many nations are actively supporting Bitcoin miners through energy subsidies and tax incentives. I think now they know it is imperative to ensure as much hashrate is within their borders as possible.”Other governments have started to invest in Bitcoin mining themselves, with Kazakhstan having set up 13 Bitcoin mining operations in the country, and is on track to open four more. However, not all governments have a positive stance toward cryptocurrencies, and mining is still illegal in some countries.Related: Jumping into the pool: How to earn a profit mining Bitcoin and EtherMason Jappa, CEO of Blockware Solutions and managing partner of Blockware Mining, told Cointelegraph that such scenarios create a lot of risk: “Many farms in China, Venezuela, and other countries face situations where the government may not support their operation. That is, farms operate illegally and if caught may have their operation shut down and miners seized.”On the other hand, other governments have taken a less-than-conventional approach to BTC mining. While Iran legalized the practice last year, it was recently announced that newly minted Bitcoin must be sold directly to the country’s central bank. Gibbs added:With all of the new tools, access to new resources, and collaboration and security provided by governments on several levels, it’s likely that mining will continue to be taken over by companies with large sums of capital to invest. However, it will also become more decentralized when it comes to the geographic distribution of mining farms, according to Gibbs.He added that Chinese miners are now diversifying some of their operations to other countries, but that would not mean that they are losing their dominant position: “As long as 100% of the Bitcoin mining ASICs originate in, or very close to China, they will continue to have an insurmountable edge on the rest of the world.”Related: How to build a crypto mining rig in 2020 to earn Bitcoin and EtherAs big plates come in with big money, mining is likely to continue to slip out of the reach of the community. What once started out as a few people using their personal computers for mining is now a gigantic industry where specific machines must be purchased along with hosting, maintenance and other expenses. For the time being, however, mining Bitcoin can still be profitable, especially as Bitcoin price continues to reach new levels."
279,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded strongly from sub-$17,600 to $18,400 in the past 24 hours. Now, two major technical indicators are signaling the likelihood for a larger relief rally.The 4-hour price chart of Bitcoin is showing a bullish divergence just as it prints a TD9 buy signal. Both indicators typically light up when an asset sees a strong sell-off and the selling pressure gets exhausted.The 4-hour bullish divergence and TD9 buy signal are conceptually similar in that they emerge after a steep correction.A bullish divergence is a technical pattern that revolves around the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RSI is a momentum indicator that gauges whether an asset is overbought or oversold.The RSI has a scale of 0 to 100; under 35 means an asset is oversold and over 75 means an asset is overbought. If the RSI drops below 35 and it begins to recover with an asset, a bullish divergence emerges.Scott Melker, a cryptocurrency trader, said that the 4-hour price chart of Bitcoin showed a bullish divergence as the price recovered above $18,150. He said:As Cointelegraph previously reported, Bitcoin has seen large selling pressure from whales and miners in the past week. Consequently, the BTC price dropped steeply over the past two days, causing it to be heavily oversold on lower time frames, e.g. the 4-hour chart.A pseudonymous trader known as “CryptoISO” emphasized that the TD9 buy signal is indicative of an overextended sell-off.TD9, short for Tom Demark 9, is an indicator that also measures whether an asset is overbought or oversold, similar to the RSI. A TD9 buy signal emerges when the past nine candles are all lower than the four candles prior.For example, let’s say that the price of Bitcoin has been below $19,000 throughout the past 36 hours. If the 4-hour candle that closed 52 hours ago was above $19,000, it would light up a TD9 buy signal.The combination of the 4-hour bullish divergence and the TD9 buy signal is indicative that Bitcoin has been heavily oversold in the past three days.As Cointelegraph reported, whale clusters show $17,170 and $17,700 as major support levels. Hence, as long as Bitcoin remains stable above those two levels, the chances of a continued rally remain high.Another bullish factor above the two whale cluster support levels is the growing supply of Tether (USDT), whose market capitalization now close to $20 billion.Across major Bitcoin exchanges, like Binance as an example, investors often store sidelined capital in USDT rather than cash, as it allows them to swiftly reenter into positions. The continuous increase in USDT supply is a positive sign of rising confidence toward Bitcoin."
280,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has started to recover on Dec. 12 after briefly dropping below $17,700 yesterday. Whale clusters show that the $18,600 level remains the biggest short-term roadblock for BTC.Whale clusters form at a price point where whales accumulate Bitcoin and do not move their holdings. Since whales are more likely to sell at a profit or breakeven rather a loss, clusters typically act as support or resistance levels.In the near term, whale clusters from Whalemap show $18,600 and $18,800 as the major resistance areas for the bulls.As Cointelegraph previously reported, Bitcoin initially faced a risk of a deeper correction without a strong reaction from buyers above $18,000.Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said the $16,000 level is the last major support area before $13,000. As such, the $17,600 support area is critical because a drop below it could leave BTC vulnerable to a prolonged downtrend with even lower supports getting tested.But, Bitcoin has started to recover and whale clusters suggest a relief rally to $18,600 to $18,800 is becoming likely. Based on technical support and resistance levels, pseudonymous trader Mayne, however, reaffirmed that $18,700 remains an area of interest for sellers. He said:Traders have also become more cautious in net shorting Bitcoin in the past several days. Although the momentum of BTC has dwindled since the beginning of the week, some believe that the inflow of large capital from institutional investors could offset the risk of a severe pullback.Another pseudonymous trader known as “Salsa Tekila” noted that “irrational FOMO shorting” likely caused Bitcoin to drop. After an intense drop, a relief rally becomes more probable. He wrote:Above $17,000, Whale clusters show two major support areas at $17,170 and $17,700. On Dec. 12, when the price of Bitcoin dropped to $17,572 on Binance, Bitcoin saw a quick reversal and recovered above $17,700 within three hours.Bitcoin’s rapid recovery from $17,600 to $18,400 within 24 hours shows that there is high buyer demand below $18,000. In the near term, the aggressive bidding at the whale cluster support from buyers would likely prevent a steep correction.However, one concern in the foreseeable future is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index. The latest reading still shows “extreme greed” at 90 out of 100, which suggests that the downside risk remains high."
281,"Throughout the past decade, a lot has been said about Bitcoin (BTC) and the future of cryptocurrencies. However, 2020 has so far been a defining year for the industry as current events bring to life what was predicted in the past. The world of cryptocurrency has historically been exclusive to Twitter battles and private chats on Telegram. Even when Bitcoin received its brief moment of fame on mainstream media, mentions of the token were mostly in dismissal of its potential, with some prominent individuals calling the entire industry a scam soon to burst.However, the tide of the turbulent relationship between traditional financial institutions and cryptocurrencies is changing. In 2020, former critics of cryptocurrencies such as JP Morgan have extended their banking services to Bitcoin exchanges as the predominant cryptocurrency’s impressive performance becomes undeniable.Granted, the opinions of influential leaders in the world of finance hold certain sway over market trends. In 2020, however, it appears that the crypto world has defied most of its critics. Below are the top quotes from 2020 that defined the year’s trend. Some are prophetic, while others highlight the current state of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies or opine on what will come next.All the way back in 2013 and 2014, Bill Gates, a philanthropist and the co-founder of Microsoft, was quoted saying that “Bitcoin is better than currency in that you don’t have to be physically in the same place and, of course, for large transactions, currency can get pretty inconvenient.”In 2020, the relevance of Gate’s statement is increasingly magnified as Bitcoin continues to play a larger role in the world’s cashless future. Granted, cold, hard cash is still king, but a glance at global financial trends reveals a change in the tides. According to reports, cash transactions in most countries are disappearing, with cash payments accounting for 20% of all Sweden’s payments and 14% for South Korea’s. Additionally, health concerns about COVID-19 are expected to push the world closer to a cashless society.However, it’s also evident that the end of cash might come at a cost. While cash is bulky and inconvenient in some ways, it offers the easiest way to transact anonymously. Digital cashless payment alternatives, on the other hand, require a middle man and do not maintain privacy. With more governments pushing for a move toward central bank digital currencies, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are emerging as the best private centric- and censorship-resistant alternative.Bill Gates’ statements about Bitcoin being better than cash is also seen in Bitcoin’s capped supply. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has impacted most of the world in 2020, governments across the globe moved to print more money to curb the economic crisis. Meanwhile, Bitcoin experienced a deflationary event in May. The halving of its mining rewards reduced the coin’s incoming supply by half. With this in mind, Robert Kiyosaki, a prominent investor and author of Rich Dad Poor Dad predicted that Bitcoin’s price will hit a high of $75,000 in the next three years.All in all, events throughout the year have proven that Bitcoin, altcoins and blockchain technology are, at the very least, viable alternatives to cash, as they can enable faster payment times at higher transaction volumes and lowest costs. As Nasim Taleb, a statistician and former risk analyst, put it many moons ago: “Bitcoin is the beginning of something great: a currency without a government, something necessary and imperative.”Despite Bitcoin’s price volatility in 2020, significant gains have been made, considering its current price is hovering around $18,000. However, Bitcoin’s success seems meager compared to the milestones Ethereum has achieved in 2020.Excitement about Bitcoin’s halving event caught the attention of many in the crypto space for the better part of the year. It was a defining moment in 2020, as the price of Bitcoin is historically known to spike after a halving event. However, that talk was soon cut short by a new wave of excitement around the booming decentralized finance sector.“DeFi” became the crypto space’s new favorite buzzword as developers created financial instruments and institutions that run autonomously on computers and freely accessible to anyone with a smartphone.DeFi startups such as Compound allow anyone to start earning an estimated interest of about 7% a year in less than 30 minutes. Users on such DeFi platforms can lend and loan money using stablecoins without going through the cumbersome Know Your Customer verification procedures common among traditional financial institutions.The runaway success of DeFi projects saw the amount of value locked in DeFi applications surpass $1 billion for the first time in 2020. Today, the total value locked in DeFi projects is over $14 billion.Even the Coinbase crypto exchange injected $2 million worth of liquidity into a couple of DeFi projects, remarking that DeFi is “an essential part of an open financial system. DeFi tools are censorship-resistant, unbiased, programmable, and available to anyone with a smartphone.”Despite drawbacks experienced by Ethereum’s network in the form of soaring fees resulting from increased demand for block space by DeFi apps, the network still managed to achieve major breakthroughs. In particular, Ethereum has begun Phase 0 of its transition from proof-of-work to a scalable proof-of-stake protocol.Various market experts agree that Ethereum will mount a challenge over the dominance across the crypto and blockchain sector. The reality of Ethereum as an emerging force to reckon with was best captured by Richard Branson, an entrepreneur and owner of the Virgin empire, who said in 2014 that despite Bitcoin’s dominance, “there may be other currencies like it that may be even better.”In a quote, Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO, once said, “The ability to create something which is not duplicable in the digital world has enormous value,” and that “lots of people will build businesses on top of that.” So far, the reality of this quote has materialized in 2020, with reports of an upsurge in the adoption of blockchain- and DLT-based business solutions.As the COVID-19 pandemic pushed more institutions and organizations to look for digital workflow alternatives, digitalization across the globe has been particularly accelerated in international trade and other sectors hindered by intensive and inefficient paper workflows.A report released by Trade Finance Global and World Trade Organization shows an increase in the number of DLT and blockchain-based projects with real-world use cases. According to the report, the push toward DLT and blockchain-based solutions was started in order to achieve increased workflow efficiency, reduce transaction costs and improve collaboration.The unfortunate events of 2020 have brought out blockchain’s potential as a technology that facilitates collaboration in a digital world, automating trust and enabling digital scarcity for the creation of digital assets.Another of Richard Branson’s quotes rings true in 2020: “People have made fortunes off Bitcoin, some have lost money.” This year will go down in history as the year of a revival for scammers and thieves in the crypto space. In the first 10 months of 2020 alone, crypto scammers stole over $1.8 billion. A blockchain forensics company reported that the value lost in 2020 as a result of crypto crimes surged by 160%.In most cases, scammers took advantage of the booming DeFi sector, contributing about 21% of the total crypto value lost in 2020.Combined with the lack of sufficient crypto education among the masses, increasingly sophisticated and aggressive schemes by scammers and thieves have made easy pickings of even more people. In addition, the frenzied profit-chasing that took place during the DeFi boom has provided crypto con-artists with a much larger capacity to cart away huge sums of value.In July, the Twitter accounts of prominent public figures like Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos were hacked to promote a Bitcoin giveaway scam. Other scammers used YouTube live streams with videos of unconsenting individuals such as Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak to scam people out of their Bitcoin. A whale alert report estimates that the scam market has increased by 2,000% since 2017.Mike Novogratz, CEO and founder of Galaxy digital holdings, said back in 2018 that he believes Bitcoin is digital gold, adding: “That means it’s the only one of the coins out there that gets to be a legal pyramid scheme. Just like gold is.”Bitcoin has gone as far as outperforming gold in 2020. Returns from global stocks, bonds and gold commodities are up by 20%, while the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index of digital coins has rallied by 65%.Although one of the main reasons for this surge is attributed to the DeFi boom, market analysts believe crypto markets have also performed well thanks to the strengthening of the narrative that Bitcoin can act as a hedge in times of economic uncertainty.While skeptics opine that the current surge is nothing more than a wild swing on a tide of DeFi liquidity, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, co-founders of the Gemini crypto exchange, have doubled down on their belief that Bitcoin is superior to gold. “Our basic thesis for Bitcoin is that it is better than gold,” said Tyler while speaking to the Financial Times back in 2016.Even though Bitcoin gets its value from mimicking gold’s natural scarcity, durability and portability, the twin brothers believe that the emergence of asteroid mining technology could potentially reduce the scarcity of gold and dilute its value in the long run. In such a case, the capped supply of Bitcoin will lead to an increase in its value above gold. “Bitcoins are like gold bars with wings, That is why I and so many others, view Bitcoin and its network as gold 2.0,” added Tyler Winklevoss.As it seems, 2020 will go down as the year that saw Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry emerge from operating in strange and obscure lanes to a fully fledged mainstream financial instrument. The willingness of Paypal and Microstrategy in becoming affiliated with crypto is a testament to this.According to a Harvard Business Review article, the global healthcare upheaval of 2020 has “revealed the weaknesses in our inability to deploy resources where they are mostly needed,” and that “blockchain solutions have been unleashed to address these challenges.”Even before the pandemic, the world was moving toward a decentralized economic structure with a decline in the stigma attached to remote working. Even though there are inherent limitations in the current state of blockchain technology, development in the DeFi space and around projects like Ethereum are increasingly preparing the sector for a new financial future.Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto once highlighted the superiority of decentralization over centralization, and how central banking is part of the problem: “The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work.” Well said, Satoshi."
282,"Throughout 2020, more than a handful of traditional financial giants have picked up stacks of Bitcoin (BTC), including the likes of billionaire Paul Tudor Jones and business intelligence firm MicroStrategy. These investments are part of a flow of big money entrances into BTC, Gemini crypto exchange co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss recently said. “This is the most sophisticated investors, the smartest people in the room, buying the Bitcoin quietly, so it’s not a FOMO [fear of missing out] thing,” Tyler said in a CNBC interview, published on Friday. Major institutions are here for this go-round, as opposed to Bitcoin’s retail-led bull run in 2017, Tyler explained.Over the course of this year, in addition to Tudor Jones and Microstrategy, Stanley Druckenmiller, Jack Dorsey’s Square, MassMutual, and Guggenheim Partners have all gained exposure to Bitcoin. Their crypto plays come in line with an unstable global economic atmosphere rife with money printing efforts.Bitcoin is often compared to gold as a store of value and inflation hedge. Druckenmiller and Tudor Jones align themselves with such a narrative.Tyler Winklevoss added:When asked about Bitcoin’s volatility as an asset for transactions, the brothers called Bitcoin a “buy and hold” strategy comparative to gold. “We see Bitcoin right now as an emergent store of value that will disrupt gold, and that gets us to a $9 trillion market cap for Bitcoin,” Tyler said. “So it actually doesn’t have to be used as a currency, and the volatility doesn’t matter if it’s actually a store of value,” he added. The billionaire also expects some level of dwindling volatility for the asset over time.At time of publication, Bitcoin’s market cap sits at about $335 billion — a far cry from $9 trillion, although the asset recently broke its all-time price high, set in 2017."
283,"In an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, Pomp reaffirmed the Bitcoin price prediction he made back in 2019. “It’s going to be pretty aggressive. I am pretty confident in Bitcoin to $100K by the end of 2021.""Together with favorable macroeconomic conditions, Pompliano sees the after-halving effect as one of the main catalysts that could drive Bitcoin toward that potential target.Pomp believes that Bitcoin’s diminishing supply coupled with increased demand from institutional investors will drive Bitcoin’s price to new highs.Even though there are around 18.5 million Bitcoin currently in circulation, he acknowledged that this number does not take into account a large portion of Bitcoin that have not moved for a long time. This means the real available supply is actually smaller.“Bitcoiners are not selling their Bitcoin”, he said.When asked about the best strategy to approach a Bitcoin investment, Pomp dissuaded newbies from “timing the market”. Instead, he recommended dollar cost averaging as the most prudent and rewarding way to invest in Bitcoin.“Dollar cost averaging is a very popular, timeless financial kind of approach because it works”, he said.Check out the full interview on our Youtube channel and don’t forget to subscribe!"
284,"Bitcoin (BTC) price has been gradually giving up ground for the past few days and that has a few investors afraid that a sharp correction or a bear market similar to the one in 2018 could occur again. However, there are major differences between the previous bull market and the current one.The most notable difference is the arrival of institutional investors. The latest institution to have taken a position in Bitcoin is Massachusetts-based insurance firm MassMutual, which recently purchased 5,470 BTC for roughly $100 million.To date, a variety of institutional players ranging from hedge fund managers to publicly listed companies and now a 169-year old insurance company have purchased Bitcoin.Usually, institutional investors do not dump their holdings with every correction because they buy only after considering the long-term fundamentals. Hence, most price drops are viewed as an opportunity to add to their holdings.Ruchir Sharma, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, has said that the dollar’s reign as the world’s reserve currency could be coming to an end and Bitcoin could be the beneficiary due to the “widening distrust in the traditional alternatives.”With several institutional investors echoing a bullish view on Bitcoin, any correction is likely to attract more institutions who may take advantage of the fall to buy.Let’s analyze the top-10 cryptocurrencies and spot the critical support levels where buyers may step in.The long tail on Dec. 9 candlestick shows that the bulls purchased the dip below the 20-day exponential moving average ($18,283) but they could not sustain the momentum on Dec. 10. Bitcoin (BTC) again succumbed to selling pressure and closed below the 20-day EMA.Today, the bulls are again buying on dips as seen from the long tail on the candlestick. This shows that lower levels continue to attract buyers. The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the relative strength index (RSI) is close to the midpoint, which suggests a short-term consolidation.The BTC/USD pair is currently trading inside a descending channel. If the bears sink the price below the uptrend line, the next support is at the lower trendline of the descending channel. If this support also cracks, the decline could extend to the 50-day simple moving average at $16,525.The bulls are likely to defend the $16,191.02 level aggressively. If the price rebounds off this support, it will indicate a possible consolidation in a large range. On the other hand, if the bulls can sustain the recovery and push the price back above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rise to the upper trend line of the channel.A breakout of the channel could again result in a retest of the $19,500 to $20,000 overhead resistance zone.Ether (ETH) is currently trading inside a descending channel. The bulls could not build on the Dec. 9 rebound and the price turned down once again on Dec. 10. This shows that traders are selling on relief rallies.The bears are currently attempting to sustain the price below the 20-day EMA ($558). If they succeed, the ETH/USD pair could decline to the next major support at $488.134, just below the 50-day SMA at $491. The bulls are likely to defend this zone aggressively.If the pair rebounds sharply from this zone, it will suggest a large trading range between $488.134 and $622.807.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up from the current levels and breaks above the channel, then it will indicate that the correction could be over. The bulls will then try to push the price to the overhead resistance at $622.807.Both possibilities have an equal likelihood of occurring because the flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a balance between the bulls and the bears.XRP rebounded off the $0.50 support and closed above the 20-day EMA ($0.54) on Dec. 9. The price again turned down today but the bulls are attempting to defend the 20-day EMA.If the price sustains above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bears are losing their grip. The flat 20-day EMA and the RSI above 52 suggest a balance between supply and demand.If the bulls push the price above $0.60, the XRP/USD pair could remain range-bound between $0.50 and $0.679 for a few days.This view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below $0.50. If that happens, the pair could drop to the 50-day SMA at $0.39.Litecoin’s (LTC) rebound on Dec. 9 only lasted for a day and the price again turned down on Dec. 10. This shows that bears are selling on every minor rally.The bulls are currently attempting to defend the 50-day SMA ($69.73), which is just above the $68.9008 horizontal support. If the price rebounds off this support and rises above the 20-day EMA ($78), the LTC/USD pair could consolidate in a large range for a few days.On the other contrary, if the rebound again turns down from the 20-day EMA, the pair may decline to the $64.4482 support. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI below 45 suggest bears have the upper hand.The moving averages act as support in an uptrend but behave as resistance when the sentiment turns bearish. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) attempted a recovery on Dec. 9 but could not rise above the 50-day SMA ($271).This shows that traders sold on pullback to the 50-day SMA and the price has resumed its down move today. There is minor support in the $254.82 to $246.85 zone. A break below this zone could sink the price to $231.If the price rebounds off this support, the BCH/USD pair could remain range-bound between $231 and $280 for a few days. But if the $231 support cracks, the pair may plummet to $200.The downsloping 20-day EMA ($278) and the RSI in the negative zone suggest advantage to the bears. This bearish view will be invalidated if the price breaks and sustains above the $280 resistance.Chainlink’s (LINK) bounce off the uptrend line turned down from the 50-day SMA ($12.69) on Dec. 10. The failure to rise above the downtrend line has attracted further selling that has pulled the price below the uptrend line.The moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover and the RSI has dipped below 41, which suggests that bears are in control. If the LINK/USD pair closes below the uptrend line, the drop could extend to $9.75.This negative view will be invalidated if the price turns around and breaks above the moving averages. Such a move will suggest strong buying at lower levels.The bulls could not build up on the sharp rebound in Cardano (ADA) on Dec. 9. This shows that the sentiment has turned negative and the traders are now selling on rallies to the 20-day EMA ($0.145).The ADA/USD pair has a strong support at $0.13. If the price rebounds off this level and rises above the downtrend line, it will suggest that the short-term correction could be over. The next move on the upside could be to $0.155.Both moving averages are flattening out and the RSI just is below the midpoint, which suggests a few days of range-bound action.This view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the $0.13 support and the 50-day SMA ($0.123). If that happens, the pair may slide to $0.117 and then to the $1 support.Polkadot (DOT) rebounded off the 50-day SMA ($4.73) on Dec. 9 but the bulls could not even extend the recovery to the 20-day EMA ($4.97). This shows that traders are selling on every minor rally.The price turned down on Dec. 10 and has broken the 50-day SMA today. There is a minor support at $4.4342 but if the bulls fail to hold this level, the DOT/USD pair could drop to the $3.80 to $3.5321 support zone.The falling 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative territory suggest that bears have the upper hand. This negative view will be invalidated if the pair turns around from the current levels and breaks above the downtrend line.The recovery attempt on Dec. 9 fizzled out at $28.3853 and Binance Coin (BNB) has again resumed its journey towards the critical support at $25.6652. This level could attract buyers as it has held twice before.A strong rebound off the critical support could keep the BNB/USD pair range-bound between $25.6652 and $32 for a few more days.On the other hand, if the bears sink and sustain the price below $25.6652, the pair could drop to $22 and then to $18. The gradually downsloping 20-day EMA ($29) and the RSI below 41 suggest that bears have the upper hand at the moment.Stellar Lumens (XLM) rebounded sharply on Dec. 9 and recovered to the downtrend line but the bulls could not push the price above the $0.18 resistance. This again attracted selling and the price has dipped below the 20-day EMA ($0.159).The flat 20-day EMA and the RSI close to the midpoint suggest a few days of range-bound action between $0.14 and $0.18. A break above $0.18 will signal advantage to the bulls and could result in a move to $0.21.Conversely, if the XLM/USD pair breaks below $0.14, the selling may intensify and the decline could extend to the 50-day SMA ($0.118).The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

285,"Throughout the past few days, the sell-side pressure from all sides has intensified. Bitcoin miners have sold their holdings at a scale unseen for over three years. On top of this, the inflow of whale-associated BTC into exchanges has substantially spiked. The combination of the two data points indicates that miners and whales have been selling in tandem.Bitcoin continues to trade under $18,000 following a week of aggressive selling from whales, miners and, possibly, institutions. Analysts generally believe that the $19,000 region was a logical area for investors to take profit, and as such, a pullback was healthy. Heading into the latter part of December, price analysts expect the downside of Bitcoin (BTC) to be limited and a gradual uptrend to follow.The recovery of the U.S. dollar has been another potential catalyst that could have contributed to Bitcoin’s short-term correction. After a multimonth pullback, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) rebounded. The dollar’s recovery could have been propelled by the news of Pfizer’s impending vaccine distribution and the prospect of a widespread economic rebound in 2021. When the value of the U.S. dollar increases, alternative stores of value such as Bitcoin and gold drop.Although the confluence of the rising dollar, whale inflows and a heightened level of selling from miners likely caused the Bitcoin price drop, some believe that the probability of a stable Bitcoin uptrend still remains high.Speaking to Cointelegraph, Denis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto exchange and broker BeQuant, said that the selling pressure on Bitcoin might have derived from two additional sources. First, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) was burned throughout this week, which meant that BTC used in the decentralized finance ecosystem was sold. Second, hedging flow in the options market added more short-term sell-side pressure.Considering that unexpected external factors likely pushed the price of Bitcoin lower, Vinokourov expects the downside to be limited in the near term. He also emphasized that the uncertainty around Brexit and the U.S. stimulus would eventually affect Bitcoin in a positive way, as the appetite for risk-on assets and alternative stores of value may be restored:Guy Hirsch, managing director of the United States at eToro, told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin has seen a sell-off from all sides throughout the past several days. But with Bitcoin performing strongly in December, based on historical bull cycles, he anticipates buyers to accumulate BTC during major dips.In 2017, for instance, Bitcoin saw high volatility and turbulence approaching the year’s end. But in late December, the dominant cryptocurrency saw an explosive move upward, reaching an all-time high near $20,000. Bitcoin has since topped that figure but has failed to stay above it. If the selling pressure on BTC decreases in the upcoming weeks, BTC could be on track to close the year on a high note, according to Hirsch:In recent months, institutions have accumulated large amounts of Bitcoin. Most recently, MassMutual, the life insurance giant, purchased $100 million worth of BTC. These purchases from institutional investors represent direct buyer demand for Bitcoin. But more important than that, they create a precedent and encourages other institutions to follow suit.Based on the ongoing trend of institutions allocating a fraction of their portfolios to Bitcoin, this implies that such accumulation may continue throughout the medium term. If so, Hirsch further noted that institutions would likely look to buy the Bitcoin dip in the near term. According to him, the firms are “taking advantage of this temporary stagnation to stockpile an asset that many see trading at a discount,” and when that happens, the price of BTC could respond positively:Some technical analysts say that the price of Bitcoin is in a relatively straightforward price range between $17,800 and $18,500. A break above $18,500 would signify a bullish short-term breakout and set up BTC for a continued rally. However, another drop to below $17,800 would indicate that a short-term bearish trend could emerge.In the near term, Bitcoin generally faces five crucial technical levels: $17,000, $17,800, $18,500, $19,400 and $20,000. For BTC to avoid a drop to the $16,000 region, staying above $17,800 with a relatively high trading volume is critical. If BTC aims to set a new all-time high entering January 2021, consolidating above the $19,400 resistance level will be key.Bitcoin also faces a short-term risk as the U.S. stock market began to pull back in a minor profit-taking correction. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has continuously rallied since late October due to favorable financial conditions and liquidity injections from the central bank. If the risk-on appetite of investors declines, Bitcoin could stagnate for as long as the U.S. stock market struggles.Whether Bitcoin could see a parabolic uptrend in the foreseeable future, so soon after a powerful four-fold rally from March to December, remains unclear. However, Hirsch believes that it makes sense for Bitcoin to be “significantly higher” than now within the next 12 months. He pinpointed the rapid increase in institutional adoption and the possibility of Bitcoin price following, stating: “All one needs to do is look at a classic adoption curve to see where we are now and, should adoption continue as expected, we still have a long way to go before reaching saturation — and Bitcoin’s fair value.”"
286,"The latest findings from Santiment, published in Cointelegraph Consulting’s biweekly newsletter, indicate that the combined balance of wallets holding small amounts of Bitcoin (BTC) continues to decline. This shows a downward trend in retail holders, which is in sharp contrast to the aggressive accumulation strategies of large holders.Social media metrics reinforce what is being seen on-chain. The average mood toward Bitcoin has been declining consistently during the past two weeks, pointing to growing crowd weariness regarding the top coin’s near-term potential.Another declining figure has been trading volume. Since its peak of $60 billion in November, Bitcoin trading volume has been decreasing, reaching just $29 billion on Dec. 9. With a decline in sentiment, retail interest and trading volume, many are skeptical that the new all-time high can be broken through.However, it’s worth mentioning that bearish sentiment and lower retail interest are buy signals for those looking for evidence of room for growth. Both of Bitcoin’s major breakouts this year, in July and October, originated from a predominantly bearish sentiment.Read the full newsletter for more news and signals, complete with detailed charts and images.Cointelegraph’s Market Insights Newsletter shares our knowledge on the fundamentals that move the digital-asset market.

287,"Bitcoin (BTC) continues to be in correction mode with BTC price dropping below $17,600 on Dec. 11, the lowest level since November. Every beautiful rally comes to an end and gets followed by a corrective period. This correction seems to have started with the price currently down more than 10% since touching a new all-time high ten days ago. Meanwhile, some recent news namely the proposed crypto regulation in the United States is bringing fear to the otherwise euphoric market. However, other markets have also suffered this week with equities also cooling off.The 4-hour chart is implying a clear downtrend. Such a downward trend is confirmed by lower highs and lower lows, as shown in the chart.First, Bitcoin’s price couldn’t break through the all-time high region, after which $18,500-18,700 acted as a strong support area for a week.Every bounce from this region (as the arrows show) marked a weaker bounce, as lower highs were constantly formed. After three tests, the support failed, and Bitcoin’s price fell through to the next support level between $17,600-17,800.This support zone initiated a slight bounce to $18,500-18,700. To become bullish, this zone had to flip for support, which it failed to do. This rejection confirmed the bearish support/resistance flip, after which the downtrend resumed.Overall, the downtrend will post lower highs and lower lows always until a clear bottom is found. It doesn't seem like the market will discover it shortly, however, as higher timeframes are also eager to turn south.The daily chart indicates a potential bearish divergence ready to be played out. This bearish divergence will be confirmed when the price of Bitcoin falls to break through $18,600-18,800.In that sense, a previous resistance becomes resistance again, confirming the markets’ overall weakness and more downside becoming likely.Based on the daily chart, the support zone is at $16,000, as Bitcoin’s price bounced strongly from that region last month. It’s the first massive support zone on the daily timeframe as well.To become bullish in the short term, Bitcoin’s price has to reclaim the $18,600-18,800 area for support. That would invalidate the bearish divergence and any bearish outlook for the meantime.The total market capitalization chart of cryptocurrencies showed a massive rally toward $600 billion. This marker was also the 1.618 Fibonacci level, which is one of the most vital Fibonacci levels.More importantly, the total market capitalization chart showed a higher high at $600 billion. This higher high means that the market is in bull territory and will be looking for a new higher low to confirm this uptrend.The levels to watch on the total market capitalization chart are around $470 billion and most likely the area around $400 billion. The latter is the previous resistance zone and should be watched for a potentially beautiful support/resistance flip.More downside for BTC will not benefit altcoins. Correlations are still very high in the cryptocurrency markets, which means that altcoins will most likely suffer from any Bitcoin correction.However, once Bitcoin finds its next bottom, altcoins will likely be well-positioned to outperform Bitcoin on shorter time frames once again.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

288,"Russia is the latest country to officially require its government officials to report their cryptocurrency holdings.President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree obliging Russian officials to disclose their crypto investments by June 30, 2021, local news agency TASS reported on Dec. 10.Officially released on Thursday, the decree stipulates new measures related to Russia’s federal crypto law “On Digital and Financial Assets,” or DFA.The form requires officials to disclose data like the name of the digital asset, the date of acquisition, the total amount of held assets, as well as information about the issuer of an asset like the country of registration.Declarations must include information about cryptocurrency and tokens belonging to officials as well as their spouses and minor children. The disclosure process starts on Jan. 1, 2021, the decree reads.The new regulatory initiative will have a positive effect on the Russian crypto ecosystem, according to some local crypto players.Maria Stankevich, head of business development at crypto exchange EXMO, told Cointelegraph that the decree demonstrates that the “official establishment will be as compliant as common citizens with no exceptions.”Stankevich noted the wave of negative feedback on proposed crypto regulations, which included criminal liability for crypto tax reporting failures:The new regulatory initiative comes ahead of Russia imposing the DFA on Jan. 1, 2021. As previously reported, the law finally provides legal status to crypto in Russia, but will prohibit cryptos use as a payment instrument."
289,"The chief technical officer of crypto market data aggregator Glassnode, Rafael Schultze-Kraft, has described a slew of Bitcoin (BTC) market indicators as “insanely bullish,” and predicted prices are set to increase by more than 10 times.On Dec. 9, Schulze-Kraft tweeted a thread providing the basis for his ultra-optimistic prediction, presenting six of “the most important on-chain market indicators that are currently hovering at the same levels they were at the start of 2017.”Each of Schulze-Kraft’s predictions (or estimates) see Bitcoin breaking into six figures, with all but one suggesting that BTC will exceed $200,000.For each of the indicators, Schultze-Kraft measured the gains produced when the metric moved from a similar position in 2017 until it posted an all-time high later that year. He then multiplied Bitcoin’s current price by the same percentage increase.Schultze-Kraft noted that Bitcoin’s Net Unrealized Profit/Loss, or NUPL — “the difference between unrealized gains and losses based on when coins last moved on chain” — has climbed back up to 78% of its 2017 ATH.Bitcoin’s price gained 1,400% to its peak, as NUPL ascended from its current level to all-time highs in 201. If the same scenario played out, Kraft estimates that Bitcoin’s price could reach $286,000 this cycle.BTC’s Market Cap to Thermocap ratio — which assesses Bitcoin’s price premium relative to miner expenditure — is currently sitting at just one-quarter of its 2017 high. In 2017, Bitcoin’s price gained 625% as the metric rose to its all-time highs, suggesting BTC could tag $138,000 in future.Bitcoin’s MVRV Z-Score — which seeks to identify when Bitcoin is “over/undervalued relative to its ""fair value’” — currently sits at 34% of its 2017 top, the ascent to which accompanied a 1,150% price gain. Should BTC rally with the same strength as in 2017, Kraft-Schulze estimates Bitcoin will be worth $240,000 each.Kraft-Shulze identified that metrics looking at longer-term hodler behavior suggested even higher price targets.Long-Term Holder MVRV, which is the average profit or loss of all BTC currently circulating, and Long-Term Holder SOPR — which is Bitcoin’s overall profit and loss according to when each coin last moved on-chain — are each sitting at just 13% of their record highs. With the price of Bitcoin having gained 1,340% and 1,620% alongside these metrics in 2017, Kraft-Schulze predicts crypto could tag $274,000 or $328,000 in future.Reverse risk — which is used to “assess the confidence of long-term holders relative to [Bitcoin’s] price” — also suggests coming price highs of $240,000, with the metric currently at only 11% of its former high.However, Kraft-Schulze urged his followers to “take these numbers with a grain of salt.”Glassnode’s Dec. 8 weekly on-chain data report found that Bitcoin is likely to retrace before rallying into new all-time highs as investors look to realize profits made during the run-up to the recent retest of $20,000, stating:Despite warning of bearish pressure from short-term profit-takers, the report concludes that Bitcoin’s long-term outlook is bullish."
290,"Millennials, a generation beleaguered by student debt, low pay and a lack of savings, can rewrite their financial narratives using Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency according to a panel discussion at this year's BlockShow summit in Singapore.That was the key takeaway from the “Millennial investment trends — new wave of personal finance” panel featuring Aya Kantorovich of FalconX, Zac Prince of BlockFi and Grayscale’s Michael Sonnenshein. The panel delved into Millennials’ impact on the future of digital assets.During the discussion, Prince identified three major Bitcoin adoption trends that are inextricably linked to Millennials and younger investors: The ongoing wealth transfer from Baby Boomers to the young via inheritances, the growth of alternative assets and shifting preference for everything digital. Alternative assets under management topped $10 trillion globally in June, up more than 55% from 2013, according to data provider Preqin. Although much of that shift has occurred at the institutional level, Millennials will play an increasingly vital role in this market.Prince said he expects crypto to “grow as a share of that alternatives bucket.”In Prince’s view, it’s only a matter of time before more financial institutions create onramps to serve these demographics.“It’s really a question of accessibility,” Aya Kantorovich, head of institutional coverage at FalconX, added. While less bullish on current Millennial trends, Kantorovich said that her firm has seen a large influx of retail-facing aggregators and payment providers that “need good liquidity,” which is a clear indicator of growing adoption at the consumer level.Michael Sonnenshein, Grayscale’s managing director, also identified an important shift in how people, especially younger generations, view crypto diversification.Although many believe that diversifying into crypto is an important decision, diversification within crypto is also growing in importance, he said. Investors are starting to look beyond Bitcoin and into other assets with “staying power,” such as Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC).Sonnenshein talked about the growth of “Ethereum first, or in some instances, Ethereum only investors,” an insight he also shared with Bloomberg last week."
291,"As we find ourselves already knee-deep into December, it has become increasingly difficult to ignore that certain festive je ne sais quoi that always seems to permeate the air during this time of year — yes, even in this globally most horribilis of annuses, (whisper it) 2020.The shops — well, those of them that haven’t been permanently shuttered, or at least forcibly quarantined, by the coronavirus pandemic that has defined much of our lives for the past 12 months — have been pumping out seasonal tunes for what already seems like an eternity.However, take heart in the fact that it is only the sickeningly well-prepared and the terminally short-of-things-to-do who have directed more than a cursory thought toward what to actually buy anybody as a gift so far.And fear not, because if your loved ones like a bit of Christmas with their crypto, then Cointelegraph has a whole heap of inspiring gift ideas to help you seem just as thoughtful as our overeager, underworked compatriots.The wallet has been a Christmas staple since the days of Charles Dickens when Ebenezer Scrooge famously received one from Tiny Tim in order to keep all his money in order — possibly.In the crypto world, the go-to standard for keeping your tokens secure is a hardware wallet, and there are plenty to choose from. Besides, software wallets are generally free and not suitable for making you look like a generous gift-giver.The Ledger Nano X needs no introduction and is still one of the very best hardware wallets out there. And for Christmas, Ledger is offering a free $25 crypto voucher with every Nano X sold. There are also family packs (of three wallets) on sale, and the earlier Nano S model is still available for those on a more modest budget.Alternatively, the 29 euro ($35) Status Keycard adds a physical layer of security to the Status app and cryptocurrency wallet, which runs on Android and iOS cellphones. We first came across the Keycard in June, and the simplicity of the system is a big draw.Transactions initiated through the app require a tap of the near-field-communication-enabled card on a smartphone in order to go through. Without the physical keycard, money simply cannot be transferred.If you have been patiently waiting for this year's most hyped and, reputedly, most secure hardware wallet, the Ngrave Zero, I'm afraid you are out of luck, however — at least for Christmas.Ngrave CEO Ruben Merre confirmed that devices purchased during the project's crowdfunding campaign are expected to ship at the end of December, with the remainder being delivered throughout January 2021. Of course, if you have a birthday coming up...The humble Christmas sweater has undergone something of a renaissance in recent years.Originally a piece of knitwear — usually bestowed by an elderly, but well-meaning, relative — so ugly that it is destined to only be worn on Christmas day itself — while said elderly relative is around to see it — it has since been embraced by certain elements of society as an ironic statement.Talk about post-modernism gone mad.Anyway, Hodlmoon has a range of particularly ugly sweaters for sale, combining traditional nordic elements with bold crypto logos in outlandish color schemes. Firm family favorites Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC) are all represented, along with a few more esoteric choices.Got a sibling who you can picture pledging their allegiance to Kyber Network or Polymath in knitted form? Anyone? And although emblazoned with the logos of the privacy-focused browser, the Brave sweater could equally refer to the personal qualities required of the wearer.Be aware that these won’t appeal to all of your loved ones, but the right giftee will be over the (Bitcoin) moon with one of these. I’m even starting to soften toward the Monero sweater myself. Ahem, moving on quickly.If Christmas sweaters are a bit in your face (on your torso?) for your chosen recipient, then perhaps they would be better disposed toward a pair of cryptocurrency socks?Socks are ideal for those who want to identify themselves as a crypto believer while proving that they still enjoy a bit of fun as much as the next person — but only when they sit down and their pants ride up.Also, socks make for a much cheaper novelty gift than a jumper.Etsy seller Dytanik has a full 29 different designs available, each dedicated to a different token.With so many for sale, it doesn’t matter if your intended beneficiary is a fully paid-up member of the XRP army, an Aave staker, a Binance Coin (BNB) trader, a Cardano (ADA) hodler, or even a Tetherer (yes, really). Whichever way one’s crypto kink lies, there is a pair of socks with which to pledge one’s allegiance — unless one happens to believe that Craig Wright actually is Satoshi Nakamoto, that is.A bonus item for XRP heads (pun very much intended): On a much subtler level, this logoed beanie allows the wearer to express their ""XRPride"" while leaving the vast majority of those who see it convinced that they are simply a fan of The X Files.Over the past year, I have had the dubious honor of reviewing a whole host of cryptocurrency- and blockchain-related books, ranging from the excellent, like Blockland, to the laughably bad, like The Little Book of Crypto. So, you’d expect me to be able to recommend a decent bit of Christmas reading for the crypto convert — or perhaps, soon to be crypto convert — in your life, right?But the problem with Blockland is that it was, and still is, only available as a “limited edition” hardcover preorder for $59. And although your parents may have brought you into this world and nurtured you through the best part of the first 18 years of life, $59 is a bit steep. And even then, a claimed shipping date of December gives no guarantee of a Christmas delivery.There are planned paperback and Kindle versions on the way, and the website does state that the book is “Coming January 3rd, 2021.” So, if by some slim chance that is referring to one of the cheaper options and you celebrate Orthodox Christmas on Jan. 7, then you might be in luck.But it’s a long shot.The problem with The Little Book of Crypto, of course, is that you probably want to remain on speaking terms with the recipient once the gift is bestowed.So, instead, I’m going to recommend a book I haven’t yet reviewed, as I still haven't quite finished reading it. Cowries to Crypto is not purely about cryptocurrency but rather gives a history of money, currency and wealth throughout history, from the time when people used cowrie shells as a medium of exchange — hence the title — right up to the present day.It is a collaboration between internationally acclaimed political cartoonist Harry Harrison and award-winning financial journalist Jame DiBiasio.This means it has lots of nice pictures, which is somewhat of a rarity in this sort of book. It is also a very well-written, in-depth, unbiased exploration of its subject matter and will reaffirm your faith that crypto is most definitely the future of money.However, books on crypto generally cater to those who are just beginning to take an interest in the subject. What if your better half is already a card-carrying crypto convert?Citadel 21 is a Bitcoin culture fanzine. It is fresh, current and edgy enough to satisfy even the most hardcore crypto acolyte. It contains a curated selection of voices and opinions on the subject, with a focus on the good, the cool and the weird.And it includes the serialized webcomic ""Bulltardia,"" which is hiding the 12 words of a seed phrase for a wallet containing 0.1 BTC, as if you needed any other excuse to read it.Sure, you could read the online versions for free, but there are also some rather smart-looking limited-edition physical copies available, along with six- and 12-volume subscriptions.In years gone by, Cointelegraph might have recommended gifting your nearest and dearest with cold, hard, actual cryptocurrency. Well, not anymore.The problem is that crypto now comes in so many flavors that picking out the right variety comes with a veritable minefield of potential pitfalls.Imagine buying your eccentric Uncle Derek ""the wrong type of Bitcoin,"" or Polkadot's DOT for your secretly Ethereum-loving aunt — or Tron's Tronix (TRX) token for basically anyone.These days, it is perhaps safer to venture into the world of nonfungible tokens when looking for gifts that reside on a blockchain. If nothing else, it will make it look like you've made more of an effort.When it comes to NFTs, you might want to look to the Axies of the game Axie Infinity. Not only can these cute creatures be reared, battled and bred, but with some decidedly average skill, they can even become a source of income, as I found out when writing my recent review of the game.Just remember that you need three of them to make any money.If only the freshest of NFTs will do, then look no further, as the BBC recently launched a collection of Doctor Who trading cards. You can buy in for under $5, and the cards will be usable in a card-battling game later next year, as Cointelegraph reported earlier.Finally, you could always treat a work colleague to one of Cointelegraph's very own festive NFTs. Our artists have put together a poster-sized artwork that collects all of the major cryptocurrency-related events of the year into one image.From the coronavirus crash through the halving to the rise of decentralized finance and PayPal entering the crypto space, it's all in there, with a little space reserved for anything that happens between now and the end of the year.Crypto has provided a bountiful range of gifts for the Christmas lover in your life this year, so you don't have to let all the jollity get you down. Just keep your cellphone close at hand so you can check for a Dogecoin (DOGE) pump before serving the turkey."
292,"On Dec. 11, a total of $540 million in Bitcoin (BTC) options open interest is set to expire. This number mimics the past month's $525 million options expiry, as monthly and quarterly options typically concentrate the most volume. Although both dates present somewhat unusual activity, this time around, bears seem in control. Data also shows that the Bitcoin bulls appear to have become too optimistic.Currently, the exchange Deribit holds 85% market share for Friday's expiry, with $189 million worth of call (buy) options stacked against $282 million put (sell) options. Even though the 1.44 put-to-call ratio is favoring the more bearish options, a more granular view is needed.Traders tend to have a short memory, but BTC was trading below $16,000 less than four weeks ago. Thus, many put options were bought around that level. That has led to a $120 million put options open interest between $15,000 and $17,000.Notice how the above chart shows Deribit holding a considerable open interest in a range that no longer makes sense after the most recent BTC price appreciation. Some of these options previously traded for $365 apiece, such as the $16,500 put on Nov. 28.They are currently worth less than $25 each and will lose all their value as we approach Friday's expiry. Still, this does not mean that bulls got the better end of the deal.This time around, a decent volume of call options above $19,500 has been traded. After failing to break the $19,800 resistance and later facing a plunge below $18,000, overly optimistic bulls ended up being the ones getting hurt.To understand the result of this volatility, one needs to exclude the options with dim odds. By excluding put options below $17,500 and call options above $19,500, traders can attain a more realistic view of the current market conditions.Deribit holds 2,420 BTC call options ranging from $17,000 to $19,000. Bit.com has 320 BTC, and OKEx currently holds 140 BTC. Therefore, there's an immediate $52 million in open interest supporting current levels.Meanwhile, the put options ranging from $17,500 to $19,500 amount to 6,870 BTC at Deribit, followed by 800 BTC at Bit.com — plus, there is another 290 BTC at OKEx. Thus, the immediate sell-side pressure amounts to $145 million open interest from put options.The reason behind this difference is that call options above $19,500 have been depreciated and have no market value. This movement excludes 70% of the aggregate $225 million call options open interest.The data above shows just how extremely optimistic bulls became as they bought call options up to $22,500. Most of those options are now deemed worthless, as signaled by their delta below 5%.Therefore, when analyzing just the option strikes closer to market levels, there is a sizable $93 million imbalance favoring the sell-side.Despite having quickly bounced from Tuesday's $17,640 low, these short-term options are currently favoring bears.OKEx, Bit.com and Deribit weekly contracts mature on Dec. 11 at 8:00 am UTC.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

293,"Investing app Acorns aims to help people grow their savings and wealth, but how does inherent market risk factor into the equation? CEO Noah Kerner gave his thoughts on that question at a recent BlockShow panel.""We send this message to our customers: that every downturn in history has ended in an upturn,” Kerner said on Wednesday. Following a particularly difficult period in the markets roughly two years ago, Acorns sent out the same sentiment. Acorns does not offer crypto trading, but Kerner's comments should be of interest to the industry. A chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a common mainstream market barometer, validates this comment to a degree, showing an overall upward price journey since the late 1800s.Although the current representation of the stock market has continually bounced back over the past hundred years or so, not everything recovers all the time. Kerner’s comment does not take into account the many individual assets and companies that have died throughout history. On a relatively shorter time scale, most crypto projects have died out.Established markets, in general, have proved a level of resilience, however. Bitcoin (BTC) is a current example. The asset has refused to die, ultimately growing after all its downturns.Crypto and mainstream markets suffered a major decline back in March when COVID-19 news took over headlines. Both have since rebounded, showing resilience.“As usual, the world was coming to an end again,” Kerner said referencing people’s mindset at the time. He remembers March 18 as particularly difficult for mainstream finance, occurring after a number of red days for the Dow. He picked that time to invest heavily into mainstream traditional markets.Looking at the past can sometimes help spur insights on the future. Kerner explained:Acorns serves as a mainstream financial platform hosting a capability that rounds up each user's everyday commercial purchases to the nearest dollar, setting aside the rounded portion for investment purposes. The platform only offers mainstream investments, although a similar crypto-specific service, called RoundlyX, also exists."
294,"A new book on Bitcoin (BTC) has catapulted into the top three on Amazon’s macroeconomics bestseller list, offering more evidence that digital assets are piquing people's interest. Released on Dec. 2, Bitcoin: Hard Money You Can't F*ck With: Why bitcoin will be the next global reserve currency is currently the third-most-bought title in the Kindle macroeconomics category.In terms of new releases in the category, the book takes the top spot:The book is authored by Bitcoin evangelist Jason Williams, entrepreneur and co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital Assets — the crypto-focused investment arm of Morgan Creek Capital. As Cointelegraph reported, Williams recently sold his 2007 Chevrolet Suburban for 0.4 BTC. If his Twitter feed is any indication, Williams has been scooping up a lot of Bitcoin for his personal stash this year.Williams’ book offers a primer on Bitcoin for those who’ve had little exposure to the asset class. The Amazon sales page describes the book as follows:The book is broken down into three main sections that include why Bitcoin matters now, a brief history of money, and how BTC can become the next global reserve currency.It appears that retail interest in Bitcoin is ramping up again, likely as a result of BTC’s massive upsurge in recent months. Google searches for the term “Bitcoin” spiked in late September, then again in November.Retail FOMO, or fear of missing out, was the main catalyst of the 2017 bull market, but it has been largely absent from this year’s rally. Google search trends and the performance of Williams’ book could be viewed as a proxy for layperson interest in the digital asset."
295,"French financial authorities are strengthening the country’s cryptocurrency regulations in a move to prevent illicit activities like money laundering and terrorism financing.On Dec. 9, several ministries in France jointly introduced an order aiming to prevent anonymous digital asset transactions by banning anonymous crypto accounts.The new regulatory effort is backed by French finance minister Bruno Le Maire, overseas minister Sébastien Lecornu and junior economy minister Olivier Dussopt. The order is pursuant to Article 203 of France’s PACTE law, which stands for the Action Plan for Business Growth and Transformation.In the document, the ministries have admitted that digital assets or cryptocurrencies provide “significant opportunities for the economy,” noting that the French government is fully aware of its importance.Despite promising opportunities, crypto also comes with significant risks related to illicit financial activity, the authorities noted.The ministers specifically referred to September 2020 arrests involving a terrorist financing network using digital assets to cover their tracks. Major global authorities and organizations like the Financial Action Task Force, the G7 and the G20 have called for measures to prevent illicit activity using crypto, the ministers said, noting:As such, the French government is preparing to introduce new regulatory provisions in order to apply new digital identification tools for crypto transactions and virtual asset service providers. “This request, which emanates from actors in the ecosystem, will make it possible to fight against anonymous transactions in digital assets while facilitating user identification,” the document reads.French authorities have been vocally concerned over the financing of illicit activities with cryptocurrency. In October 2020, French finance minister Le Maire criticized crypto for providing additional tools for illicit activities like purchasing drugs and weapons as well as money laundering."
296,"Bitcoin (BTC) miners appear to be selling large amounts of BTC once again. Data from CryptoQuant shows that the BTC Miners’ Position Index  — a metric tracking the ratio of BTC leaving miners’ wallets — achieved a three-year high. This trend indicates that miners are likely selling BTC on over-the-counter or spot exchanges.On Dec. 10, two large miner-linked Bitcoin transactions were spotted right as the Miner’s Position Index abruptly spiked to levels unseen since 2017, according to data from CryptoQuant.First, around 800 BTC, worth $14.5 million, moved to Binance. Second, 11,852 BTC, equivalent to $215.9 million, moved to an unknown cold wallet.Miners typically sell Bitcoin through spot or OTC exchanges. When a sell-off occurs on spot exchanges, it could intensify the near-term selling pressure on BTC. The impact on the BTC price is not as immediately felt when miners sell on OTC exchanges, since they are directly selling to buyers.According to Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, miners sold “a lot” of Bitcoin on Dec. 10. Although Ki remains optimistic about the price of BTC heading into January, he explained that this is a potentially worrying trend in the foreseeable future. He said:Other analysts asked Ki whether miners are selling enough Bitcoin to have a considerable effect on the near-term price trend of BTC. In response, Ki noted that although the total outflow is not significantly large, the miner outflow is still relatively high compared to the last few days. He added:Miners can place significant selling pressure on Bitcoin, especially if large amounts are collectively sold on exchanges. However, in the medium to long term, the accumulation of BTC by institutions could offset the sell-off.In May, Cointelegraph reported that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) had been accumulating more Bitcoin than was being mined.In recent months, Grayscale has continued adding to its reserves to pass $10 billion in assets under management. If this trend remains intact, it can help offset the selling pressure from miners and whales in the short to medium term.In October, Dan Tapiero, the co-founder of 10T Holdings, said Bitcoin could also face a potential supply crisis as a result.SHORTAGES of #Bitcoin possible.

Barry's @Grayscale trust is eating up btc like there is no tomorrow.

If 77% of all newly mined turns into 110%, it's lights out.

Non-miner supply will get held off mkt in squeeze.

Shorts will be dead. Price can go to any number. pic.twitter.com/4S4TrLNH8JMiners could cause a short-term Bitcoin pullback, but BTC repeatedly failed to surpass the $19,600 resistance level. Hence, an argument could be made that the sell-off from miners comes during a period when investors already anticipated a sharp correction.Moreover, on-chain indicators such as the low exchange inflows and Bitcoin exchange reserves at the lowest level since August 2018 could also offset near-term bearishness, preventing BTC from dropping further to $16,000 or possibly lower."
297,"Jeremy Allaire, CEO and co-founder of peer-to-peer payments firm Circle, sent a letter to senior staff of the United States Department of the Treasury on Dec. 9, appealing for regulators to collaborate with the industry in adopting crypto regulations.Allaire warned U.S. regulators that some of its proposed rules pose a direct risk to the country’s competitiveness and could potentially trigger unintended consequences around crypto and blockchain-related use cases.The exec specifically referred to a new proposal to prohibit so-called unhosted or self-hosted wallets. Allaire argued that the proposal does not address actual risks in the industry:Allaire also said that both the industry and regulators need some time to sort out best practices in regulating emerging technology together.“The industry needs time, probably 1-2 years, to put these kinds of technologies in place,"" he said, “Not only does the industry need this time, but this will allow the industry and financial regulators to collaborate together on building the rule sets and supervisory schemes that make sense in this new world.”Allaire joins several members of Congress including representatives Warren Davidson and Tom Emmer, who opposed the rumored ban on self-hosted crypto wallets in an official letter to the Treasury on Dec. 9.Some crypto advocates have stated that they are not sure what a “self-hosted wallet” means. “I don't even know what a self-hosted wallet is. I only know ‘not my keys,’ and ‘my keys,’” Blockstream chief strategy officer Samson Mow said on Dec. 9."
298,"Bitcoin (BTC) investors have “not long” to accumulate before a continuation of the bull run past $20,000, a new report says.Released on Dec. 10, the Weekly Report from Asian crypto fund provider Stack Funds predicts that one indicator in particular will follow historical precedent and propel Bitcoin higher.According to Slack, the market cap to thermo cap ratio (MCTC) is showing signs of repeating its performance in 2017, the year in which BTC/USD went from under $1,000 to $19,866 on Coinbase.MCTC takes a snapshot of Bitcoin’s market cap, then divides it by miners’ total revenue since mining began — the thermocap.As of this week, MCTC is around 17, mimicking mid-2017 and lingering in a position from which it has twice heralded the start of a bull market.“The ratio is currently sitting at the 17 level, which coincides with its 2019 peak. In addition, the value is adjacent to its 2017 breakout, where it whipsawed around the 20 handle before Bitcoin's rally materialized,” the report commented.In its current position, there is thus considerable room for maneuver upwards, which leads Stack to assume that bullish progress will soon continue.“Given that the ratio is still at its lower band, we are skewed to believe accumulation opportunities persists, but not for long before the $20,000 price breakout materializes,” it summarized.Bitcoin has rebounded over the past 24 hours after sudden weakness ended a period of price consolidation to rekindle lows under $18,000.At press time, BTC/USD circled $18,300, with traders watching for signs of definitive support returning.As Cointelegraph reported, however, little sign of definitive buyer support above $16,200 is evident from exchange orderbooks, with $20,000 still remaining a make-or-break resistance level.For Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe, $19,400 is the high water mark to watch for real confirmation that the current bearish scenario is over.“If we want to get this bullishness and attack the all-time high again, I’d want to see a break above this block,” he summarized in an update on Thursday."
299,"Bitcoin (BTC) poses a significant threat to the world’s reserve currency, the United States dollar, according to a strategist at major American investment bank Morgan Stanley.Ruchir Sharma, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, believes that the dollar’s reign is likely to end due to global distrust in traditional finance, while Bitcoin is likely to capitalize on that lack of confidence.In a Dec. 9 article in The Financial Times, Sharma provided a brief outline on the history of the world’s reserve currencies, noting that the dollar’s run had lasted 100 years at the start of 2020. According to the strategist, other major global fiat currencies like the euro or China’s yuan have failed to gain the world’s trust, underlining the lack of a successor for the dollar. Sharma said that a new class of decentralized contenders — cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin — are likely to threaten the dollar’s supremacy. Bitcoin has already established itself as one of the hottest investments of 2020 by quadrupling in price since March amid the pandemic and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s continued money printing, he noted:Sharma also pointed out that Bitcoin is beginning to make “progress on its ambition to replace the dollar as a medium of exchange.” The strategist said that Bitcoin’s adoption is steadily growing from investment to international trade and other use cases. “In recent weeks PayPal and its Venmo subsidiary have started storing Bitcoin with an eye towards accepting it as payment next year,” he added.The strategist warned central banks to pay more attention to their monetary policies if they want to maintain their position of power:"
300,"According to an investigative report from RunRun.es, Venezuela intends to increase its use of Bitcoin to pay for imports to bypass financial sanctions imposed by the United States.RunRun.es, which was founded by Venezuelan investigative journalist Nelson Bocaranda, cited anonymous sources from the country’s central bank who claim that “payments to companies from allied countries such as Iran and Turkey have been made using Bitcoin.”It is unclear, what these imports consist of, however, Turkey and Iran currently provide the country food and fuel in exchange for gold.Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro's government has promoted its state-issued, purportedly oil-backed ‘Petro’ cryptocurrency as a means of exchange both internationally and domestically since launching the token in 2018. However poor adoption of the Petro has forced the regime to explore other crypto assets including Bitcoin and Ethereum.Maduro began to publicly threaten the use of Bitcoin and other crypto assets as a means to bypass sanctions in September, proclaiming his administration would soon “use all the cryptocurrencies in the world, public, state, or private, for internal and external trade.”On Oct. 8, Venezuela’s National Assembly passed the Anti-Blockade Law, granting further executive powers to circumvent sanctions imposed on the country, including to authorize the creation or use of any crypto asset as a monetary instrument.The Venezuelan government established its “Digital Assets Production Center”, a Bitcoin mining warehouse in November, as the country increased its reliance on cryptocurrencies.Last week the Venezuelan government launched its cryptocurrency exchange, backed by the National Cryptoactive Superintendency, to allow citizens to exchange Bolivars for Bitcoin.Iran has also put into action a law to use Bitcoin to pay for imports, in an effort to reduce pressure on the country’s already fragile economy."
301,"Bitcoin's (BTC) sharp correction to $17,650 came as no surprise to investors and many expected the digital asset to fall as low as $16,000. Thus, the quick recovery back to $18,600 is intriguing and it bolsters the popular belief that retail and institutional investors are keen to purchase every BTC dip.Although the possibility of another drop remains, three factors point toward a Bitcoin bottom at $17,650. The factors are, whale deposits hitting a peak, BTC posting a quick recovery, and trading volume picking up again.According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, whale deposits hit a peak earlier this week. Typically, when the All Exchanges Inflow Mean indicator reaches a top, a rally follows afterward.Whales pose the biggest threat to Bitcoin’s short-term performance because they can place immense selling pressure on the asset in a short period. Hence, when fewer whales are able to sell, it is bullish for BTC. Ki wrote:Based on various factors, Ki said that Bitcoin could drop lower, but buying BTC at the current level is more attractive. He said:After a noticeable spike in buy volume, Bitcoin posted a quick turnaround and rallied toward the 20-day moving average.BTC first claimed $18,000 as a support level, then made its way toward $18,2600 before pulling back to the $18,500 range. The continued recovery of BTC without major corrections indicates the market remains resilient and in favor of bulls.Initially, Cointelegraph reported that altcoins took the biggest hit as the price of Bitcoin abruptly dropped below $18,000. But the BTC recovery has been aided by the strong rebound of altcoins like Ether and XRP.This trend suggests that investors are seeking higher-risk plays, which is indicative of the growing certainty in the market.Analysts at Santiment, an on-chain analysis firm, found that the volume of Bitcoin sharply rose after the recent pullback.When Bitcoin recovers with a significant increase in volume, it signifies growing confidence from traders in the near term. The analysts explained:"
302,"Bitcoin’s Dec.8 breakdown to $17,650 weighed heavily on most altcoins and Ether was not spared from the carnage. As the price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropped precariously close to a large CME gap at $17,000, Ether (ETH) price fell below the 20-MA to $529. At this level, Ether became oversold on RSI and the bounce from that region was strong enough to bring the price back to the 20-MA.At the time of writing the 20-MA is functioning as a short-term resistance and above it, at $582 there is a high volume node on the volume profile visible range.Even if Ether is able to flip the 20-MA back to support, it’s expected that the zone from $583 to $600 will function as resistance, unless Bitcoin price surges through the $19,500 level. Although, this seems unlikely as BTC may have its own battle pushing through $18,800 to $19,150.A few positives for Ether are the 4-hour RSI is on the verge of pushing through the midline and the MACD is en-route to converge with the signal line. The MACD histogram also shows a reduction in sell pressure but traders will note that buy volume is tapering off as the price approaches the 20-MA.Given the relationship between Bitcoin’s price action and that of altcoins, today’s daily close for BTC will be something to watch. Currently, BTC price is attempting to recapture the $18,500 level but a close above the 100-MA at $18,600 would be preferable.A close above the 100-MA would give hope to traders looking for the price to retest the 20-MA at $18,800 and set the stage for the digital asset to push through the $18,800 to $19,150 area.For the short-term, traders can at least breathe a sigh of relief since Ether held above the $521 support which prevented the price from breaking down to $475.Aside from needing to recapture the 20-MA, there is minimal overhead resistance until the price reaches the descending trendline which is aligned with the $583 to $600 resistance cluster.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

303,"In a recent Reddit “Ask Me Anything” session, billionaire Ray Dalio warned investors that the current astronomical pace of money printing is unlikely to stop in the near future and holding wealth in cash could lead to losses. Dalio said that Bitcoin (BTC) “could serve as a diversifier to gold and other such storehold of wealth assets.”A new report from CoinShares shows that the transition from gold to crypto products may have already started. The report highlights outflows of $9.2 billion from gold investment products and inflows of $1.4 billion into crypto products during the same period. Interestingly, along with Bitcoin, Ethereum funds are also attracting investments.While institutions are increasing their investments into the crypto space, Galaxy Digital founder and CEO Mike Novogratz recently told CNN that people should invest about 5% of their net worth in Bitcoin and some in Ether (ETH). Novogratz did not rule out a 30-40% correction but asserted that Bitcoin will not go to zero.On similar lines, the Winklevoss twins advised participants at the Singapore Fintech Festival to educate themselves about Bitcoin because they believe Bitcoin’s price will reach $500,000 in the future.While the long-term picture looks bullish, smaller-sized traders may find it difficult to HODL in the event of a sharp fall like the one seen in the last 24-hours.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies in order to spot the critical levels to keep an eye on.Bitcoin (BTC) once again failed to rise above the $19,500 resistance on Dec. 6 and 7. This may have attracted profit booking from short-term traders and the downside move also pulled the price below the 20-day exponential moving average $18,314.However, the fall did not create panic among traders and the bulls continue to purchase the BTC/USD pair on dips. This is a positive sign as it shows that the sentiment remains bullish. The bulls will now try to push the price to the $19,500 resistance.If the price fails to sustain above the 20-day EMA or rise above the $19,500 resistance, then another round of selling is likely. If the bears sink the price below $17,650, the pair could drop to the 50-day simple moving average at $16,314.The flat 20-day EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) just above the midpoint suggest a few days of range-bound action.A break below $16,191.02 will signal that bears have the upper hand, while a break above $19,500 will tilt the advantage in favor of the bulls. Until then, the pair may remain volatile between the two levels.Ether (ETH) broke below the trendline of the ascending triangle pattern and the 20-day EMA ($559) on Dec. 8. This move invalidates the bullish setup, but the positive thing is that the bulls have purchased the dip and pushed the price back above the 20-day EMA.If the bulls can sustain the demand at higher levels, then the ETH/USD pair could again rally to the $622.807 to $635.456 resistance zone.On the contrary, the trendline may now act as a resistance. If the price turns down from this resistance, the bears will try to sink the pair below $530.487. If they succeed, the pair could drop to $488.134.While these are the bullish and bearish possibilities, the flat 20-day EMA and the RSI above 54 do not indicate an advantage either to the bulls or the bears. Therefore, the possibility of a few days of range-bound action is high.Although the bulls pushed XRP above the downtrend line on Dec. 6, the demand dried up at higher levels. This pulled the price back below the downtrend line on Dec. 8 and the 20-day EMA ($0.543) today.The bulls purchased the dip to the $0.50 support today and are currently attempting to sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the XRP/USD pair could remain range-bound for a few days.The flat 20-day EMA and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. A break above $0.6794 will tilt the advantage in favor of the bulls and a break below $0.50 will signal that bears have the upper hand.The Dec. 7 Doji candlestick pattern showed indecision among the bulls and the bears about the next move. That uncertainty was resolved to the downside when Litecoin (LTC) turned down and broke below the 20-day EMA ($79) on Dec. 8.The LTC/USD pair dropped to $71.9801 today, but the long tail on the candlestick shows strong buying at lower levels. The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint suggests a balance between supply and demand.This could keep the pair range-bound between $68.9008 and $84.3374 for a few days. A break below the $68.9009 to $64 support zone will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears while a break above $84.3374 will indicate that the bulls are back in the game.After staying above the $280 levels for the past few days, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) plunged below it and the 50-day SMA ($271) on Dec. 8. The 20-day EMA ($281) has started to turn down and the RSI has dipped into the negative zone, which suggests that bears have the upper hand.The current rebound is likely to face stiff resistance at $280. If the price turns down from this resistance, the BCH/USD pair could consolidate between $231 and $280 for a few days.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push the price above $280, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels and that could result in an up-move to $300. If the bulls can sustain the price above this level, the momentum could pick up.Chainlink (LINK) turned down from the downtrend line on Dec. 7 and broke below the 50-day SMA ($12.67) on Dec. 8. The bulls are currently attempting to defend the ascending trendline.The bulls are likely to again face stiff resistance at the downtrend line. If the price turns down from this resistance, then a drop to $10 will be on the cards. Such a move will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.The 20-day EMA ($13.17) has started to turn down and the RSI has slipped into the negative territory, which suggests that bears have the upper hand.This negative view will be invalidated if the LINK/USD pair breaks above the downtrend line and the $13.28 overhead resistance.Polkadot (DOT) broke below the 20-day EMA ($5) on Dec. 7 and the selling intensified on Dec. 8, which pulled the price down to the 50-day SMA ($4.7). The bulls purchased the dip to the 50-day SMA and are currently attempting to push the price back above the 20-day EMA.However, the bears are unlikely to give up their advantage easily. They will try to defend the 20-day EMA and the downtrend line. If the price turns down from either resistance, it will increase the possibility of a break below the 50-day SMA.If that happens, the DOT/USD pair could drop to the $3.80 to $3.5321 support zone. The bulls are likely to buy a dip to this support and that could keep the DOT/USD pair range-bound for a few days.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, the pair will make one more attempt to rise above the $5.5899 resistance.The failure of the bulls to sustain the price above the $0.155 level attracted selling and Cardano (ADA) plummeted below the 20-day EMA ($0.146) on Dec. 8. However, a minor positive is that the price has rebounded off the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.1312.The relief rally will now face resistance at the 20-day EMA and again at $0.155. If the price turns down from either level, the bears will attempt to sink the price below $0.13 and the 50-day SMA ($0.122).Another possibility is that the ADA/USD pair remains stuck between $0.13 and $0.155 for a few days. The flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint also suggest a few days of range-bound action.Binance Coin (BNB) broke below the 50-day SMA ($29.21) and plunged to $26.9244 today. The altcoin is currently attempting a rebound, which is likely to face resistance at the moving averages.If the price turns down from the current levels or the moving averages, the bears will try to sink the BNB/USD pair below the $25.6652 support. If they succeed, the pair could drop to $22 and then to $18.However, if the price breaks above the moving averages or if the bulls defend the $25.6652 support, the pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.Stellar Lumens (XLM) turned down from close to the downtrend line on Dec. 7 and plunged below the 20-day EMA ($0.158) on Dec. 8. However, today’s sharp rebound off the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.140209 shows buying on dips.The current rally is again likely to face resistance at the downtrend line. If the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, it will suggest that the correction is over.The XLM/USD pair may then rise to $0.18 and then to $0.19 and then consolidate in a range for a few days before attempting to resume the uptrend.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the downtrend line and plummets below $0.139, the pair could drop to the 50-day SMA at $0.115.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

304,"With the crypto sector currently riding a wave of bullish sentiment, as demonstrated by Bitcoin (BTC) passing its all-time high value of $19,892 at the start of the month, causal as well as institutional investors all over the world are now becoming more interested in the growing sector. For example, on Dec. 3, S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that it’s set to launch several crypto indexes, with a reported 550 coins to appear starting next year.The aforementioned offerings will be facilitated by S&P Global in conjunction with the CME Group and News Corp. As part of the press release announcing the launch, a spokesperson for S&P DJI alluded to Bitcoin and other prominent altcoins like Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as being part of an attractive “emerging asset class.”S&P DJI also reported that it will join hands with blockchain data provider Lukka to launch the aforementioned indexes. As a result, some in the crypto community are of the opinion that the industry has finally made permanent inroads into the financial mainstream. Stephen Stonberg, chief financial and operating officer at Bittrex Global, told Cointelegraph that while the announcement has definitely been a welcome one, mainstream adoption has been looming:However, Douglas Borthwick, chief marketing officer of cryptocurrency exchange INX, provided an alternative view that while crypto is certainly making a mark on the financial mainstream, it still has a long way to go. He added that “crypto” is not just about “Bitcoin” but offers so much more: “There are so many categories these days that fit under the ‘crypto’ umbrella. For sure a permanent impression has been made. But that impression remains one of skepticism as opposed to one related to the future.”That being said, S&P DJI’s above-stated move showcases a clear commitment from mainstream players to embrace Bitcoin and other digital currencies. For example, earlier this month, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust increased in tandem with its premium, which surpassed the 30% mark on Dec. 3, serving as a clear indicator of increasing institutional demand for crypto.According to Stonberg, S&P DJI’s latest move essentially entails the trading of digital/tokenized assets in the format of a traditional equity product that trades during standard trading hours. To put it simply, it’s a way to get institutional equity money indirectly into the crypto space — a process of convergence between traditional and crypto financial markets, which will most likely take a few years to play out.On the subject, Anton Churyumov, founder of Obyte — a distributed ledger based on directed acyclic graph technology — told Cointelegraph that institutions will always chase everything that makes money for them and their clients, adding:Jack Tao, CEO of Phemex — a cryptocurrency exchange headed by former Morgan Stanley executives — believes that soon, it will not be surprising to see an explosion of new services and products, making this domain even more appealing to members of the traditional finance sector: “I’m quite confident that these giants will not want to miss the crypto train. This is just the beginning, I expect to see a lot more funds and investment flow in soon.”As crypto continues its long-term price ascent, it’s worth investigating if institutional investors will catch crypto FOMO — the fear of missing out. In this regard, Sarah Austin, head of content for Kava Labs — a decentralized finance firm — told Cointelegraph that according to her sources, over-the-counter desks have seen large inflows from financial institutions.Related: PayPal’s baby steps into crypto aren't dampening the hype for adoptionNot only that, as regulation becomes more favorable for the crypto market and as more large players like PayPal, Square and MicroStrategy broadcast their adoption of the asset class, it lends to the argument that the increase in interest has a sound basis. Chris Norris, head of corporate relations for Electroneum, told Cointelegraph:Lastly, as the use of Ethereum and its associated smart contracts continue to gain traction, it will most likely spur the value of most premier cryptocurrencies in an upward direction, with Austin stating: “With more institutional players in crypto other digital assets could fare better as the crypto space and traditional finance become more aligned.”Tao believes that in the long term, the value of most crypto assets will continue to soar higher, likely reaching new all-time highs. However, in his view, the price of a digital currency alone cannot be used as an indicator of things to come, adding: “Ultimately what drives things forward is the technology and innovation behind each project. That is what attracts new users and moves the market.”Churyumov believes that while prices may rise significantly in the near term, he isn’t entirely sure of whether or not this trend will continue after the “money printing slows down on the other side of the pandemic.”Lastly, Norris pointed out that there have been clear indications that most major institutional investors are currently buying BTC and ETH every time the prices dip, which serves as another indicator that they have decided to invest in the crypto market as a long-term strategy."
305,"Fidelity Digital Assets, the crypto arm of the asset management conglomerate, will allow institutional customers to pledge their Bitcoin (BTC) as collateral for cash loans.As reported Wednesday by Bloomberg, the firm partnered with crypto lender BlockFi to disburse the loans. Institutional clients of Fidelity’s custodial solution will be able to draw cash loans from their stored Bitcoin without having to move it, provided they have an account with BlockFi.The target customers of this feature are primarily hedge funds, miners and over-the-counter trading desks. Overcollateralized lending is generally used to access liquidity without losing a long position on the asset used as collateral. The cash can be used to enter leveraged positions and build hedged strategies or to pay for business expenses.In a conversation with Cointelegraph, a Fidelity spokesperson said that the offering comes as part of a ""demand for increased capital efficiency"" among its customers. ""Our full-service offering that includes custody and trading will continue to help institutions enable capital efficiency, while prioritizing asset safety and stillness,"" they saidThe loan-to-value ratio will be set to 60%, meaning that each $1,000 in collateral can back at most $600 in borrowed money. Nonetheless, that parameter could change according to the specific customer's needs. Fidelity clarified that it does not play any role in setting loan terms, limiting its contribution in the tri-party agreement to the safekeeping of the Bitcoin.Fidelity Digital Assets has provided Bitcoin custodial services since October 2019. More recently, it also began offering its services to the Asian market.BlockFi is a major cryptocurrency lender, offering interest on deposits sent to the platform. While it is a retail-centric company when it comes to collecting deposits, that money is primarily lent out to other institutions. The company recently launched a Visa debit card with Bitcoin rewards.Update, 16:30 UTC: Added commentary from a Fidelity spokesperson."
306,"The price of several big-name alternative cryptocurrencies fell especially hard following a Bitcoin pullback to $17,650 on Dec. 9.Namely, XRP and top decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens YFI and AAVE dropped by as much as 10% to 20% in the past 18 hours, with Bitcoin (BTC) losing up to 7%.The two main reasons behind the short-term correction of altcoins are likely the current high level of uncertainty among traders and low overall volume.Altcoins often reflect the price trend of Bitcoin, with steeper price movements to both the upside and downside. As such, when BTC price moves up, altcoins tend to see even larger rallies.For instance, Cointelegraph reported that XRP surged 91% in a single month when Bitcoin began to rally toward its all-time high on Nov. 23. The bullish market sentiment around BTC caused large-market-cap altcoins, including XRP and Stellar Lumens (XLM), to spike significantly.However, when Bitcoin begins to pull back or there is uncertainty in the market, altcoins often see sharp corrections.In the last 24 hours, as an example, Bitcoin dropped by around 7% from the day’s peak to the lowest point. In contrast, XRP plunged by 15% in the same period, recording a substantially larger price drop compared with BTC.Altcoins see intense corrections because of their relatively lower volume. Bitcoin remains the most liquid cryptocurrency in the market by a large margin.On Binance, the BTC/USDT pair has a $1.5 billion daily volume as of Dec. 9. Ether (ETH) and XRP, in comparison, have daily trading volumes of $600 million and $433 million, respectively.Hence, cryptocurrencies with lower volumes face way more downside risk in the short term when BTC is dropping.Altcoins could begin to recover in the near term if Bitcoin starts to rally convincingly. There are some signs that BTC could lead the altcoin market to a strong recovery in the near term.Scott Melker, a cryptocurrency trader, said that the latest 4-hour Bitcoin candle had more buying volume than “any of the red candles on the way down.” If the aggressive dip-buying continues, the probability of an altcoin rally increases.Another catalyst for an altcoin market recovery could be the ongoing short squeeze in the Bitcoin futures market.Rafael Schultze-Kraft, chief technical officer at Glassnode, noted that daily long liquidations on Binance crossed $130 million. Consequently, the price fell, resulting in a long squeeze. He said:Considering that a major long squeeze caused BTC to drop, a short squeeze in the near future is possible, with $18,600 being a short-term resistance level.Still, one concerning metric to consider in the near term for altcoins is the Bitcoin dominance index. After initially dipping in late November, the index has started to recover slightly, which may spell bad news for altcoins like XRP and XLM in the short term."
307,"The liquidator of now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Cryptopia has launched the claims process to reimburse creditors following a 2019 hack.Professional services firm Grant Thornton, Cryptopia’s assigned liquidator, officially announced on Dec. 9 that creditors can now start the claims process on the Cryptopia claims portal.The claims process requires creditors to register on the Cryptopia claims portal and confirm details regarding their Cryptopia account. “Only verified account holders can register in the claims process,” Grant Thornton noted in the statement.Based in New Zealand, Cryptopia became the victim of a major hacking incident in early 2019, reportedly resulting in losses amounting to $16 million. The exchange subsequently suspended their services and appointed audit firm network Grant Thornton as a liquidator. In May 2019, Grant Thornton released an estimation statement of the financial state of the firm, reporting that the hacked exchange owes a total of $4.2 million to its creditors.In July 2020, a major victim of the Cryptopia hack filed a notice of liquidators’ failure to comply with duties and was preparing to launch a lawsuit.Graham Thorton stated today that it will be sending out emails regarding the claims process throughout the week due to the sheer volume of claims."
308,"A blockchain, in its essence, provides a digital record of transactions. At present, this most often pertains to transaction records for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). The database of records, called blocks, is often touted for its transparency and immutability. But what do these features really mean? If you want to analyze a blockchain transaction, you first need to know how to use a block explorer.A block explorer is a crucial instrument in the toolbox of a cryptocurrency and blockchain user. Similar to web browsers that allow users to surf web pages, blockchain or block explorers enable users to navigate a blockchain.Sometimes referred to as the “Google of crypto and blockchain” in the crypto community, a block explorer lets users extract important data about crypto transactions such as addresses and fees.A block explorer is a web application, usually available online via a web browser, that provides various data from a specific blockchain. There are a lot of block explorers out there, as each cryptocurrency or blockchain has its own. This means that you cannot track Ether (ETH) transactions with a Bitcoin block explorer.Some popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether also have a wide number of block explorer offerings. For example, there are dozens of Bitcoin explorers, with some of the most popular including Blockchain.com, Blockchair, BlockCypher and Tokenview. Similarly, there are a bunch of Ethereum explorers including Etherscan and Ethplorer.In order to find a block explorer for a certain cryptocurrency, Google “block explorer” and a certain crypto, or simply check for the “explorers” section for the desired crypto on a major website like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko.It’s worth noting that there are private and public blockchain explorers, based on the type of blockchain used. In public or permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum, anyone can read and write on the ledger. But on a private or permissioned blockchain, only selected entities can read and write on the ledger.There are a zillion things you can do with block explorer, including tracking information about recently mined blocks, transaction history, network capacity, as well as finding the first block on a certain blockchain, or the so-called genesis block.It’s always easier when there is a concrete reason you would be using a block explorer, so let’s look at a couple of simple examples of how a block explorer can be used.Transaction history is probably one of the most exciting opportunities unlocked by block explorers. While traditional payment services only allow users to track their own transactions, a public blockchain enables users to track virtually any wallet.To investigate your Bitcoin address, just copy and paste your BTC address into a search bar on a block explorer like Blockchain.com. Then you will get to a page containing all the information associated with your Bitcoin address, including a total number of incoming and outcoming transactions, total BTC received and sent, as well as a final balance in dollars.Scroll down to check for a log of all transactions associated with your BTC address and you will get more information about each transaction, including a transaction ID or hash, amount, as well as the sender and the recipient. Click on the sender’s address to learn more info about an address where your crypto came from.A block explorer can be used to check the status of pending and completed transactions, indicating the number of network confirmations. Confirmation means that the transaction has been processed by the network and is highly unlikely to be reversed.In order to check your transaction status, simply type the transaction ID in the search field and see how many transactions there are.Each cryptocurrency has its own number of required confirmations to complete a transaction, which may vary. For example, major U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase requires a minimum of three confirmations to complete a BTC transaction, and at least 35 confirmations to complete an ETH transaction.Using block explorers, you can also see the number of unconfirmed transactions on any blockchain by checking the “unconfirmed transactions” section on Blockchain.com’s explorer, or “pending transactions” section on Etherscan.Block explorers provide all necessary data about not only transactions and addresses, but also about the status of a certain blockchain in general. As such, block explorers also include some useful charts related to network difficulty, mempool size, average block size, as well as total cryptocurrency in circulation.To check how much Bitcoin is now in circulation, check the “Total Circulating Bitcoin” chart on Blockchain.com. At publishing time, there is 18.556 million Bitcoin in circulation or about 88% of the total 21 million Bitcoin that will ever be mined.BTC and ETH network fees are not capped, and may become expensive due to increased network congestion. For example, Bitcoin transaction fees spiked to as much as $50 back in 2017 when Bitcoin hit its all-time high of $20,000. When you attach too low of a transaction fee to your transaction, the transaction may eventually be returned to the sender.In order to avoid such situations, always check crypto fee charts using major block explorers. Bitcoin’s average fees in USD are available at Blockchain.com’s section “Fees Per Transaction.”For Ether fees, check the “Ethereum Gas Tracker” page on Etherscan, and learn how much is required to pay to proceed with an ETH transaction. “Gas” refers to the fee required to successfully conduct a transaction on Ethereum, with gas prices denoted in Gwei — a denomination of ETH that is equal to 0.000000001 ETH."
309,"Standard Chartered, one of the biggest banks in the United Kingdom, has officially announced plans to provide institutional custody for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC).According to a Dec. 9 announcement, Standard Chartered’s innovation arm SC Ventures has partnered with United States-based investment management firm Northern Trust to launch cryptocurrency custodian for institutional investors.Called “Zodia,” Standard Chartered’s crypto custody platform is subject to registration with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, and is expected to begin operations in London in 2021. The platform is now in the process of registering with the FCA under U.K. money laundering regulations and will apply standards equivalent to the custody of traditional securities.Zodia will initially support Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), XRP, Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as they account for “approximately 80% of the total assets” in crypto, the announcement notes.Alex Manson, an executive at SC Ventures, said that the launch of Zodia custody demonstrates Standard Chartered’s commitment to “rewiring the DNA in banking.” Manson previously announced Standard Chartered’s plans to build a cryptocurrency custody solution in July 2020. The news coincided with the company’s participation in a $17 million Series A funding round in Swiss digital asset custody startup Metaco.Standard Chartered is also actively involved in blockchain-based ventures. On Dec. 7, Standard Chartered completed a proof-of-concept implementing blockchain technology for bond tokenization in partnership with the Union Bank of the Philippines. In September 2020, the bank successfully completed a cross-bank letter of credit transaction between Vietnam and Thailand using blockchain tech."
310,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $18,000 on Dec. 9 in the latest continuation of its bearish comedown from all-time highs.Data from Cointelegraph Markets, Coin360 and TradingView showed BTC/USD losing $18,000 support during trading, hours after a critical moving average level also gave way.At press time, new lows near $17,600 were appearing, with 24-hour losses totaling more than 7%.The situation was tenuous for Bitcoin after support was lost higher up, with exchange data showing buyer interest only lined up in significant amounts at $16,200. Converse selling pressure had provided an instant rejection at close to $20,000 last week.“Third test of support and breakdown,” summarized Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe to his Twitter followers on Wednesday.The press-time range had already formed a topic of interest among traders, who were wary about a $1,300 CME futures gap remaining unfilled. With the bottom level just below $17,000, there was additional impetus for Bitcoin to fall further in the short term.Both Van de Poppe and others were broadly optimistic, however, noting that lower levels would provide a buying opportunity for large-volume clients.“Watch how traders, shitcoiners and weak hands transfer their #bitcoin to strong hands like Grayscale, Paypal, Square, MicroStrategy etc.,” quantitative analyst PlanB argued on Tuesday as Bitcoin’s performance began to slip."
311,"Bitcoin (BTC) can offer protection against the “depreciating value of money,” newly bullish investor Ray Dalio says.In a Reddit “Ask Me Anything” session on Dec. 8, Dalio, who last month abandoned his skepticism of Bitcoin, said that the cryptocurrency could complement gold as an investment.“I think that bitcoin (and some other digital currencies) have over the last ten years established themselves as interesting gold-like asset alternatives, with similarities and differences to gold and other limited-supply, mobile (unlike real estate) storeholds of wealth,” he wrote.Dalio shed light on his opinion of various aspects of the global economy, including the United States’ current position, China and the state of fiat currency.Continuing, he argued that money printing would spur asset inflation, implying that simply holding wealth in cash would lead to losses.“We are in a flood of money and credit that is lifting most asset prices and distributing wealth in a way that the system that we’ve come to believe is normal is unable to, and that is threatening to the value of our money and credit,” he warned.His perspective conspicuously mimics that of Bitcoin proponents, notably Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, who is guiding the company toward BTC reserves of nearly $1 billion.Saylor, in an interview with The Bitcoin Standard author Saifedean Ammous in September, stressed that asset inflation was far outstripping that of cash, and that large paper money holdings were thus akin to a “melting ice cube.”Dalio thus departs further and further from the Bitcoin-skeptic position he held just weeks ago, which began to thaw when he admitted that he “may be missing something” about its true nature. Nonetheless, he stopped short of advocating a “full Bitcoin” portfolio.“The main thing is to have some of these type of assets (with limited supply, that are mobile, and that are storeholds of wealth), including stocks, in one’s portfolio and to diversify among them. Not enough people do that,” he reasoned.On the topic of gold, Dalio was more opaque. Choosing between the precious metal and Bitcoin would depend on central banks’ behavior.“As far bitcoin relative to gold, I have a strong preference for holding those things which central banks are going to want to hold and exchange value in when they are trying to transact,” he concluded."
312,"A new report from market data aggregator CoinShares has revealed recent surging crypto inflows amid record gold outflows.The report, published Dec. 7, notes that gold investment products have seen record outflows of $9.2 billion over the past four weeks, while BTC products saw inflows of $1.4 billion.The combined crypto fund sector saw record inflows of $429 million over the past two weeks, with Ethereum funds attracting significant investment following the completion of Eth2’s Phase 0 with the launch of the Beacon Chain on Dec. 1.Despite representing 14% of the capital locked in crypto investment products, 20% or $87 million of the past week’s capital flows were invested into funds offering exposure to Ethereum.The report estimates that a total of $14.9 billion is currently being managed across crypto investment products, of which Grayscale Investments represents more than 83%.CoinShares estimates that Grayscale received more than $336 million in investments during the last week. ETC Issuance ranked second-among crypto providers with inflows of $19 million, followed by 21Shares with $13 million.Recent price action has seen the percentage of the sector’s combined assets under management represented by monthly inflows spike to its second-highest level ever, beaten out only by the surging inflows identified in the run-up to Bitcoin’s 2020 halving. The past month’s inflows represent roughly 0.4% of the sector’s combined AUM.While more than $4.8 billion has flowed into crypto funds this year, the figure is equal to just 10.5% of the $45.7 billion that has moved into gold investment products this year."
313,"Mexican authorities report an increase in the use of crypto assets to launder funds by criminal syndicates in Latin America.In a Dec. 8 report from Reuters, the head of Mexico’s finance ministry’s financial intelligence unit, Santiago Nieto, described how cartels use crypto to launder money obtained in illicit activities.Neito asserts Latin cartels will typically deposit their ill-gotten gains into various bank accounts as sums of less than $7,500 — the threshold that would prompt banks to flag a transaction. The funds are then used to make a myriad of small quantities of Bitcoin (BTC), which can then be transferred frictionlessly across borders.A 2018 law mandated that registered crypto trading platforms report transfers exceeding 56,000 Mexican pesos (approximately $2,800). Local authorities hope this can assist them in responding to the use of digital assets in organized crime.The April 2019 arrest of human trafficker Ignacio Santoyo has been attributed to the law, with the authorities identifying that Santoyo and his sister had acquired more than $22,000 worth of BTC on the local exchange Bitso.Hector Ortiz, the accused leader of Mexican cyber-hacking syndicate Bandidos Revolution Team, was similarly arrested after law enforcement identified he had spent “tens of thousands of dollars” worth of BTC — this gave investigators cause to trace his locations using cell phone data.However, Rolando Rosas, the head of the Mexican attorney general’s office’s Cyber Investigations Unit, told Reuters law enforcement lacks the resources needed to tackle cryptocurrency-fueled money laundering. He said the unit has 120 staff — about a quarter of what is required — and it struggled to keep up with the 1,033 Bitcoin threshold alerts that were triggered on registered trading platforms this year.Approximately 98% of the transactions were reported by Volabit — an exchange operating in the Jalisco New Generation Cartel’s home state of Jalisco. Volabit’s general director Tomas Alvarez told Reuters:In January, a United State Drug Enforcement Agency report noted a decline in hard currency seizures from $741 million in 2011 to $234 million in 2019, suggested that organized crime gangs are now using crypto assets to power much of their money-laundering activities."
314,"After spending the last few days trading in a tightening range, Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped from its pennant structure and closed below the 20-day moving average ($18,600). Since topping out at $19,888 a number of analysts cautioned that Bitcoin price was at risk of a strong pullback if it failed to either secure a daily close above $19,500 or at least hold $19,000 as support.During Bitcoin’s most recent bull phases the price has held above the 20-MA so a daily close below this metric could be a signal that a short-term trend change is in order. In this instance, it also appears that bulls are yet to purchase the current dip.As the price dropped and the daily close approached crypto analyst Alex Saunders said, “Unless $18,700 holds, the descending triangle likely takes us lower short term.”On the other hand, Cointelegraph analyst Micheal van de Poppe tweeted that despite the drop Bitcoin price is:Van de Poppe further explained that the “BTC price level below $20,000 has been accompanied by diminishing volatility and volume, making it increasingly difficult to predict the direction of the next move.”Now that BTC appears to be trading in a descending triangle, traders will watch $18,013 to see if the price can form a double bottom at the triangle support. Below this level, the volume profile visible range and market structure suggest that there is also support at $17,800.The RSI on the 4-hour timeframe is also entering oversold territory, meaning an oversold bounce could occur, but this move will require significant buy volume to push the price back to the 20-MA where there is likely to be resistance.A bullish turn of events would involve BTC making the double bottom mentioned above, then flipping the 20-MA and $19,000 level back to support for at least a 4-hour close.On the other hand, if $17,800 fails to hold as support, Bitcoin price could drop to $17,200 then $16,400 which is near the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement.In a previously published analysis, Micheal van de Poppe also pinpointed a large CME gap from $18,275 to $16,995.According to van de Poppe:This suggests that failure to hold the aforementioned levels as support heightens the chance that Bitcoin price snatches the liquidity below and re-visits the $17,000 level."
315,"Although a number of big players have picked up bags of Bitcoin (BTC) in 2020, multiple aspects still avert institutions from investing on a wide scale, according to Robert Li, an analyst for Draper Dragon, a Draper Venture Network fund.“I think there are a few issues that are still holding back the majority of institutional investors from allocating capital freely toward Bitcoin,” Li said during a segment of the Latin America Bitcoin Conference on Tuesday.Silk Road, a former online black market, was once one standout example of nefarious activity facilitated by Bitcoin transactions. Li said he believes the scene is different now, however, based on government actions and help from analytics firms.In 2020, Bitcoin has become increasingly legitimized across the mainstream for legal usage. PayPal recently added Bitcoin and other crypto assets to its platform, and traditional financial participants, such as Microstrategy, have begun to purchase significant sums of the coin. The flood gates have not yet opened in terms of large player entrances to the space, however, and Bitcoin’s reputation may not be the only aspect intimidating mainstream money.Regulation appears to stand in the way as well, although laws are region-specific, with certain nations leading in the space, Li said. “In many ways, crypto regulation, here, in the U.S., is not mature,” he noted.“Spot crypto exchanges in the U.S. are not regulated in the same way that national securities exchanges like NYSE or NASDAQ are,” he said. “As you can imagine, they’re not held to the same kinds of standards of investor protection.”Li also mentioned that big players are wary of market manipulation in Bitcoin, which he noted as a logical fear according to past price action that has stemmed from relatively unregulated exchanges. Volatility may also ward off new institutional Bitcoiners, as well as a “broad lack of institutional services and tool sets” for such players, although that aspect has improved over the last number of years, according to Li.Seemingly leading the charge in terms of big money early adopters, Microstrategy recently expressed interest in buying even more BTC than it already owns."
316,"Ryan Selkis, co-founder of data and research company Messari, recently released his 2021 crypto sector thesis, examining the state of the industry as well as forecasting what lies ahead. Selkis explains in this report that the U.S. government is one remaining adversary he feels BTC must win over. “The ‘final boss’ to beat is the state,” Selkis wrote in his report, released on Tuesday. “For the U.S., bitcoin presents a tool to undermine international sanctions, and 80% of mining capacity now sits behind enemy lines in China, Russia, and Iran,” he noted. “Will a Biden administration like BTC? TBD.”Bitcoin has trudged through its fair share of governmental adversity in the 12 years since its inception. With its status as a commodity, Bitcoin’s reputation is somewhat solidified. Concerns of a U.S. government ban have still arisen, but the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s acting leader, Brian Brooks, recently explained that his unit views Bitcoin favorably.Still, the government changed its tune on gold in 1933, confiscating the precious metal from citizens en masse. Even though the U.S. government may find it difficult to confiscate Bitcoin functionally, banning the asset could still hurt its price and associated cash on-ramps. On the bullish side of the table, Selkis gave a nod to Bitcoin’s resilience. “Bitcoin is an unseizable form of private money that’s proven very hard to kill,” he wrote. “It’s outperformed every major asset class over every relevant time period in its history, and it’s got perfect macro tailwinds and momentum,” he said, adding:Bitcoin’s price has flourished in 2020 amid massive U.S. money printing efforts and economic uncertainties. A number of large mainstream players, such as Microstrategy and Paul Tudor Jones, have allocated large sums of money to Bitcoin this year as well, padding the asset’s credibility.Bitcoin topped near $20,000 in December 2017, only to fall below $5,000 multiple times in the years following. This year, Bitcoin broke its previous all-time high, showing a refusal to die, something big mainstream players like, according to Selkis’ interview with Anthony Pompliano, published on Tuesday.“Smart money investors knew about Bitcoin back in 2017,” Selkis said, subsequently explaining Bitcoin’s mainstream attention back then, as well as its boom, bust, and boom again over the past three years. “I think a lot of them have appreciation for things that don’t die,” he explained.Mainstream giants, such as Amazon and eBay, have also shown great resilience through the years, rising from the ashes after the dot-com bubble popped in the early 2000s."
317,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is now stagnating below $19,000 after four failed attempts to break out of the $19,600 resistance level. In the near term, four factors suggest that a pullback is more likely than a clean breach of the all-time-high price near $20,000. Traders and technical analysts are mostly cautious regarding the near-term price trend of Bitcoin, seemingly waiting for BTC to establish a clear support level or break past its record high.There are four factors that make a correction likely, and all of these factors could amplify the selling pressure on BTC while decreasing buyer demand for Bitcoin in the foreseeable future. The price of BTC falling in tandem with the stock market could further amplify the nervousness around risk-on assets, including Bitcoin.On Dec. 8, the price of Bitcoin fell particularly hard within a short period. On Binance, Bitcoin declined from $19,294 to $18,610 within merely 12 hours. A pseudonymous trader known as “Byzantine General” pinpointed an 857 BTC buy order at $18,750 on Bitfinex, which is equivalent to $15.94 million. However, the order disappeared as the price neared $18,750, suggesting it was a spoof order.As the $18,750 buy order faded, the support level thinned out, and Bitcoin eventually fell to $18,610 across major exchanges. For nearly two weeks, the $18,500–$18,600 range has acted as a strong support area for BTC. If Bitcoin continues to drop below $18,500, traders say that the $16,000 support level could be tested before BTC’s next rally. Another pseudonymous trader known as “Crypto Capo” said that below $18,500, a short-term bearish move could materialize, possibly reaching $16,750.For traders, Bitcoin is currently in an unfavorable position because it’s both far from its resistance level and the major support area. So far, throughout the past week, BTC has remained relatively comfortable above the $18,500 support level, following three successful recoveries. But with continued retests of the same support area, buying or longing BTC at $18,500 has become less compelling.As such, a trader known as “Salsa Tekila” said that the ideal trade is to either buy Bitcoin at the low support, such as $16,000s or $17,000s, or above $20,000. The trader said that it makes more sense to short-term trade the current price range until BTC decisively rises above its all-time high or sees a deep correction.Similarly, Koroush AK, a cryptocurrency trader, said that a “decent dip buying opportunity” would arise at a lower support level, emphasizing the $18,300–$18,400 range as a potential support area. Still, the trader noted that some lower time frame candles would have to close, such as the four-hour candle, to establish more clarity on the price cycle of Bitcoin, adding: “Still waiting on the 4H close but it’s looking like we’re heading lower, which would provide a decent dip buying opportunity.”According to data from CryptoQuant, miners that were previously inactive began to sell Bitcoin once again. In a private note to its clients, analysts said that the “Miner’s Position Index” reached a new yearly high. This is indicative of miners applying selling pressure on Bitcoin, which raises the probability of further consolidation or a larger price drop.In the cryptocurrency market, there are two major sources of external selling pressure: miners and exchanges. On-chain analyst Willy Woo previously explained that miners selling BTC and exchanges selling their earnings from fees are two of the biggest unmatched selling pressures in the market. Considering this, miners continuing to sell BTC while Bitcoin struggles under a major resistance level makes a breakout challenging in the near term. The note from CryptoQuant read:Long-time Bitcoin holders who hoard large amounts of BTC have also stopped buying BTC in the past several days. CryptoQuant analysts noted that old whales “are wanting the price to drop, or at least are expecting it to do so,” based on on-chain data points.Whale clusters on Whalemap, an on-chain analysis platform that tracks Bitcoin whale activity, show a similar trend. On Dec. 7, Whalemap analysts said that the whale clusters show three near-term support areas at $18,979, $17,651 and $17,170.Whale clusters form when whales accumulate or buy Bitcoin at a certain level and do not move the BTC. It essentially shows where whales last bought BTC and at which price level they are willing to hold BTC. Since BTC dropped below $18,979 on Dec. 8, whales could try to bid or buy into the latter two support areas.Throughout the pre-market trading session on Dec. 8, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 posted a minor pullback. The stagnancy of major United States stock market indices comes after weeks of rallying. JPMorgan Chase said that the U.S. stock market could face a pullback in January if longing U.S. equities becomes an overcrowded trade.As the stock market starts to show signs of a short-term slump, the “smart money index” reached a yearly low. The index gauges the sentiment of money managers and institutional investors, who appear to be skeptical during the ongoing rally. It indicates that the stock market rally has been fueled by retail investors, which could be a concerning trend if a correction occurs in January.Based on various factors, including the inactivity of whales, the sell-off of miners and the uncertainty in the risk-on market, analysts remain cautious in the near term. CryptoQuant noted that retail investors are active, yet the cautiousness of whales remains a negative variable for Bitcoin: “In the short term, it looks like there is a high chance that Bitcoin will continue to consolidate or have one more correction. Retail investors are very active, but the whales are moving in ways that aren’t helpful to keep Bitcoin rising.”But the bullish momentum may sustain, with Rafael Schultze-Kraft — chief technical officer at Glassnode — outlining $18,640, $18,450 and $17,655 as important short-term support levels based on on-chain data. As long as the price of Bitcoin remains above these three levels and the abovementioned whale clusters, the dominant cryptocurrency could avoid a deep correction to the $14,000–$16,000 range."
318,"Bitcoin sidechain RSK launched a new bridge protocol called Powpeg, which will facilitate a trustless connection between Bitcoin (BTC) and RSK’s wrapped version of it, called Smart Bitcoin (RBTC).The system marks the first time that a Bitcoin sidechain has featured a trustless peg where the funds allocated to the chain are not controlled by a group of well-defined entities, often called a federation.Powpeg achieves this by combining the security features of a Hardware Security Module, or HSM, with RSK’s consensus layer based on merge-mining with Bitcoin. Sergio Lerner, co-founder of RSK, explained the concept to Cointelegraph:The mechanism comes as part of RSK’s strategy of “defense in-depth” to provide multiple layers of security and protect the system from different types of attack.Most notably, federated systems where concrete legal entities have the power and the responsibility to maintain the bridge’s operation are “prone to government takeover,” said Lerner. With Powpeg, that is no longer an option, as the “pegnatories” cannot control the funds in the bridge multisignature contract. Creating a transaction to move those funds away would require a majority of the RSK hash rate, which is itself more than 50% of the total Bitcoin mining power.With the eventual introduction of Taproot, the system could also be expanded to incorporate an arbitrary number of bridge maintainers, including individuals. This would further reduce weakness to attempts at government takeover, Lerner noted. Selective censoring is also impossible because all outgoing transactions are automatically linked with each other, he explained.As part of the “defense in-depth” doctrine, Lerner alluded to further peg mechanisms to improve resilience. Some possible methods include the introduction of additional federations, vastly increasing the number of signers, and a failsafe multisig system that activates if the Powpeg stops functioning.The creation of a trustless bridging mechanism could allow Bitcoin holders to benefit from RSK’s smart contract platform. The project has been working to expand its DeFi ecosystem, which now features basic building blocks like a collateralized lending protocol and several forms of decentralized exchanges."
319,"While Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a parabolic rally since September, the momentum has stagnated, with BTC/USD unable to break through the all-time high region.This BTC price level below $20,000 has been accompanied by diminishing volatility and volume, making it increasingly difficult to predict the direction of the next move. Let's take a look at the crucial levels where volatility could be expected on the lower time frames.The lower time frame charts show an apparent range-bound construction that has led the volume and volatility to subside.The established ranges are now $19,400 to $19,600 and $18,400 to $18,600. The $19,400–$19,600 range is the resistance zone, as the price is having a difficult time clearing this hurdle. On the other hand, buyers are stepping in at the $18,400–$18,600 area, which is serving as the lower bound of the current range.Bulls can argue that there’s a stable structure of higher highs in progress. At the same time, bears can argue that there are constant lower highs being established on the lower time frames.Such arguments are the reason why traders are ambivalent about where the price is going in the short term. But what can be expected is heavy volatility once either of these levels is broken.The daily time frame shows a possible bearish divergence, which would be confirmed once Bitcoin’s price drops below $18,500.Moreover, if such a drop occurs, the 21-day moving average (MA) will be lost as crucial support that has been intact throughout the current uptrend, as the chart shows.More downside is likely if Bitcoin’s price drops below the 21-day MA, with $16,000 as the next logical support zone. This is a significant daily area, which has already been tested once as support.In fact, this area can become very significant in the coming months as BTC grinds its way up to the all-time high. This is because such a move would be very similar to the bull market cycle in 2016.The CME chart shows a large futures gap, which is still ready to be filled. Generally, 95% of the CME gaps get filled, which raises the probability of price dropping back to these levels in the short term.Traders and investors should be aware that such a correction might be correlated with a bounce in the dollar currency index (DXY). If this occurs, altcoins will likely show even more weakness as the price of BTC corrects further. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk.

320,"On Tuesday, payments giant Square announced a major push to go carbon neutral by 2030.As part of the initiative, Square will be dedicating $10 million to its Bitcoin Clean Energy Investment Initiative, which aims to “support companies that help drive adoption and efficiency of renewables within the Bitcoin ecosystem.”Square is the firm behind CashApp — a major force in bringing crypto to regular users. In today’s announcement, Square identified Bitcoin as “a unique part of Square’s footprint.” Jack Dorsey, CEO of both Square and Twitter, said: The carbon footprint of the Bitcoin network has been the subject of a great deal of controversy over the years. A 2019 study estimated BTC’s total carbon output as comparable to that of some small countries. Research from last week calls those numbers into question. Complicating the controversy are the particular sources of power for BTC mining. As the network's mining industry has gotten more competitive, major miners flock to areas already producing surplus energy to maximize profit margins. Hydro and nuclear plants are popular destinations. Recent estimates say that a large majority of miners depend on renewable sources of energy as part of their mix. Among other recent initiatives, Square is also assembling a patent group for crypto, which Coinbase joined just days ago. "
321,"Bitcoin (BTC) may see a fresh “bearish signal” in the coming days as the Mt. Gox saga enters its final and possibly expensive phase.As noted by on-chain analytics resource CryptoQuant on Dec. 8, defunct exchange Mt. Gox’s payout deadline is just one week away.After multiple delays, creditors of Mt. Gox who lost money in its implosion in 2014 are set to know when they will receive BTC on Dec. 15 — and the temptation to sell for profit may prove to be too great to avert a mass run on exchanges.“Set Mt.Gox outflow alert. Manage your risk,” CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju warned Twitter followers.Mt. Gox was the best-known cryptocurrency exchange until it was hacked for funds that included 860,000 BTC. After years of legal tussles, a rehabilitation scheme will see roughly 140,000 BTC distributed to creditors.Since Mt. Gox’s website went offline in February 2014, Bitcoin has mushroomed in value, meaning that the funds from the rehabilitation scheme are now worth $2.63 billion.As CryptoQuant notes, that translates into a lot of potential selling pressure. With roughly 28,000 BTC mined each month, the haul equals around five months’ supply.“It could be a $BTC bearish signal as supplying 150,000 BTC to the market…” part of another tweet reads.The past week has been characterized by low activity on Bitcoin markets as BTC/USD enters a period of consolidation after rampant volatility.Proponents are using the respite to double down on their positions, with MicroStrategy announcing a fundraising round for $400 million more BTC in its next purchase.Other corporate buyers, including investment giant Grayscale, also continue amassing funds.As Cointelegraph reported, aside from Mt. Gox, macro events are also set to influence Bitcoin price action this week."
322,"U.S. stocks have started to correct as worries surrounding the pandemic are mounting. Meanwhile, theBitcoin (BTC) price has pulled back below $18,800 on Dec. 8 after struggling to break resistance at $19,500.COVID-19 cases in the United States and Europe are continuously surging despite strict restrictions. Sweden, for instance, which has thus far relied on voluntary measures, has implemented a new set of restrictions.Since Oct. 30, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 13.46% within six weeks. Other major U.S. stock market indices, such as the S&P 500, similarly rose by around 13%.Following a strong six-week rally, the calls for a stock market correction are emerging. Some technical indicators pinpoint an overheating equities market, which could negatively affect alternative assets like Bitcoin in the short term.Market analysts say that Bitcoin is currently battling a critical level that could dictate its short-term price direction.Generally, analysts point toward the $19,500 to $19,600 range as the important resistance area in the foreseeable future. Above it, BTC has the potential to break through a new all-time high and continue the rally.If Bitcoin convincingly breaks down below it, traders expect anywhere between $14,000 to $18,000 as the support range.#Bitcoin price is near a critical technical level pic.twitter.com/wrr2IcUVqvThe timing of the growing uncertainty in the Bitcoin market is noteworthy because it coincides with an ambivalent U.S. stock market. For the past few weeks, U.S. stocks have rallied, buoying the sentiment for risk-on assets. But the recent pullback of the S&P 500 in the after-hours trading session indicates investors are turning cautious. Holger Zschaepitz, a market analyst at Welt, said:The primary source of fear and uncertainty stems from whether an additional monetary stimulus package is coming in the near term. Despite the optimism around vaccines, the second wave of lockdowns and economic restrictions in both the U.S. and Europe is putting pressure on market sentiment.Bitcoin's correlation with the S&P 500 and gold has been decreasing since October. Nevertheless, a drop in equity markets will likely also see a pullback in BTC and gold prices, at least initially, as was seen in March. As Cointelegraph reported, another variable to consider is the lackluster volume in the Bitcoin market amid record levels of ""extreme greed,"" based on the Crypto Fear and Greed Index. The daily trading volume of BTC has been in a downtrend compared to previous weeks, which also demonstrates an elevated level of caution in the market.Although the short-term sentiment around risk-on assets is dwindling, JPMorgan says the market is still in the middle of a bull trend.According to Business Insider, JPMorgan strategists explained that the “long equities” trade is overcrowded and the possibility of a January correction exists. However, the strategists emphasized that any correction in the stock market would be an opportunity to buy. They said:"
323,"Speaking during the Singapore Fintech Festival 2020 on Dec. 7, pioneering Bitcoin (BTC) investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss reaffirmed previous forecasts that Bitcoin’s price will eventually exceed prices of $500,000 per Bitcoin.The twins noted that their $500,000 prediction is predicated on the assumption that Bitcoin’s market cap will increase by 40 times to surpass gold’s roughly $9 trillion market cap in the future.Cameron pointed to the “tremendous amount of money-printing going on” in debt and fiat regimes, and concerns surrounding inflation as driving up demand for “hard assets” like gold and Bitcoin.Cameron states that Bitcoin offers significant advantages over gold as a monetary commodity, such as its ease of transfer and immunity to external forces influencing the rate of its production.Despite their bullish outlook, the twins noted that the crypto sector has seen starkly uneven geographical advancement, with a lack of regulatory clarity hindering the growth of business and services around the technology in many emerging economies.However, they noted the technology’s promise of banking the world’s unbanked, noting a plan to expand their exchange Gemini into emerging regions.The pair advocated that lawmakers utilize regulatory sandboxes to reduce the barriers faced by startups working with crypto, warning that heavy-handed regulatory requirements could stifle innovation. Cameron stated:Tyler also dismissed the crypto community’s “provocative rhetoric” regarding Bitcoin’s potential to render the legacy sector obsolete, asserting that the crypto industry’s growth is contingent on collaboration with banks:Despite Bitcoin’s tremendous year, Cameron predicts the sector “is still just beginning.” Tyler urged people to educate themselves regarding Bitcoin, stating:"
324,"The world’s largest publicly traded business intelligence firm, MicroStrategy has announced plans to invest the proceeds from a $400 million securities offering into Bitcoin.On Dec. 7, the firm revealed plans to issue $400 million in convertible senior notes — a debt security that can be converted into the issuing company’s shares. The announcement stated:At current prices, the $400 million would increase the company’s holdings by 20,833, which would bring the firm's total crypto stash to almost 62,000 BTC.Microstrategy will pay semi-annual interest to the note-holders until December 2025. The firm also reserves the right to redeem the notes for cash from Dec. 20, 2023.The announcement states that MicroStrategy may also offer up to an additional $60 million worth of notes to its initial purchasers within 13 days of commencing the offering.The securities will be issued under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, and will be available to qualified institutional investors only.In response to MicroStrategy’s announcement, Gabor Gurbacs, the CEO of New York-based investment firm VanEck, suggested the offering is more indicative of a digital asset fund than a publicly listed company:At what point does a securities offering that raises dollars with the purpose of investing in Bitcoin make a publicly listed company to be a listed fund/investment company?MicroStrategy made waves in the crypto world during August, when the firm revealed it had adopted Bitcoin as its primary reserve asset after purchasing 21,454 BTC for $250 million. It then purchased a further 16,796 BTC for $175 million the following month. The purchases were made through Coinbase’s OTC and brokerage platform.Just a few days ago on Dec. 5, MicroStrategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor, announced the firm had purchased a further 2,574 BTC priced at approximately $19,427 each for $50 million, bringing its total crypto holdings up to roughly 40,824 BTC.At current market value, MicroStrategy’s BTC stash is worth nearly $784 million, meaning the firm is currently up 65% on its $475 million investment."
325,"Today was a relatively uneventful day for Bitcoin (BTC) as the price continues to consolidate into a tighter range. As mentioned by Cointelegraph contributor Rakesh Upadhyay, Bitcoin price spent the weekend consolidating within a bull pennant and the breakout to $19,418 was quickly stamped out by overhead resistance.After retouching the pennant trendline, the price gave way, falling below the 20-MA on the four-hour time frame and briefly losing the $19,000 mark.Generally, most traders seem to agree that after a raging 93% rally from $10,300 to $19,888, a period of consolidation is necessary. Cointelegraph analyst Michaël van de Poppe said:On the daily and four-hour timeframe, traders will note that the price is still notching lower highs and higher lows, a sign that the price range is beginning to narrow.Currently, the price is still holding within the pennant trendline as support, but a breakthrough in the structure will require a high volume move as there is persistent overhead resistance at $19,500.As mentioned in previous analysis, a drop below the $18,800 level will see BTC search for support at $17,900, and below that the $16,000 to $15,750 range.For the short term, risk-averse traders are likely to keep a close eye on the four-hour chart to see if the price can again find support above the 20-MA in order to burst through the pennant. It is important to note that this move will require significant volume to avoid rejection in the $19,400–$19,500 resistance zone.Typically, altcoins pump higher during Bitcoin’s consolidation phases, but that has not been the case this time.While a selection of DeFi tokens and other obscure altcoins have moved higher, the majority of the top 20 coins are in the red today.This is possibly due to the fact that investors are reluctant to shift funds into altcoins while the Bitcoin price is in such an indecisive position.Experienced crypto investors know that a strong bullish breakout from BTC could result in altcoin-to-BTC pairs being crushed, whereas a bearish breakdown in BTC price tends to result in BTC and USD altcoin pairs receiving an equally catastrophic pummeling.A few standouts of the day are AAVE with a 8.54% gain, Monero (XMR) moving 5.19% higher and Waves’ rally of 6.23%.According to CoinMarketCap, the overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $566.5 billion and Bitcoin’s dominance index currently at 62.6%."
326,"2021 is shaping up to be a tremendous year not only for gold but for cryptocurrencies as well, according to Frank Holmes, CEO of U.S. Global Investors. In a Monday interview with Kitco News, Holmes said he expects digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to perform exceptionally well alongside gold. He believes that these digital assets are enjoying higher adoption because of their underlying value drivers. Regarding Bitcoin, Holmes felt that more people are embracing the digital asset in a continuation of a multi-year trend:Although many in the crypto industry liken Bitcoin to gold, Holmes said BTC isn’t being fueled by the same macro drivers as bullion. Rather, Bitcoin’s rocket fuel is coming from this past May’s deflationary halving event.He explained:“It’s a supply-demand function,” Holmes concluded. Following the May halving, the number of newly mined BTC entering the market fell to around 900 per day — a supply that has been quickly absorbed by institutions and mega-corporations. Ethereum, meanwhile, continues to benefit from the latest developments in decentralized finance. In terms of total value locked, the DeFi ecosystem is worth over $14.6 billion, with Ethereum as the building block for much of that activity. The market capitalization of DeFi coins is currently $18.2 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.In terms of gold, Holmes expects a “two-standard deviation” move for precious commodity — a move that could send prices between $400 and $800 higher in the next 12 months.“That would take us from $2,200 to $2,600,” he said.Gold futures broke out on Monday, climbing $26.40 to $1,866.40 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange."
327,"Apart from a brief $18,100 test on Dec. 1, Bitcoin (BTC) markets remained relatively calm over the week. This suggests that investors are beginning to realize that a more extended period of consolidation could be possible after a 77% hike since October.Whenever the Bitcoin price stabilizes, there is always an increased expectation of an altcoin rally. That hasn't been the case recently, as BTC dominance increased by 0.8% to 63.6% this week.This move signals that investors are either waiting for a $20,000 resistance break or fearing a potential negative price swing. Thus, such a movement indicates that their confidence in altcoins has diminished.The above chart shows how Bitcoin has managed to gain market share this week. Apart from Nem (XEM), the remaining altcoins moved up 0.5%. Volumes have been disappointing overall, although this can partially be explained by BTC accumulation at the $19,200 level.Whenever traders are undecided, they reduce positions and wait for better entry points. Therefore, this week's volume drop has been an adjustment rather than a lack of interest.Crypto fund manager Grayscale Investments continued to aggressively add BTC to their portfolio, surpassing the $10 billion mark.Over the past week, almost 13,000 BTC have been added, totaling 547,000. Therefore, it was another great week for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Similar excitement can be seen by analyzing its premium over the effective BTC held by each share, currently at 0.00095153 BTC.As depicted above, the premium increased to 22% from 11% the previous week. The indicator maintained a 14% premium average over the past ninety days. Therefore it reflects positive momentum as it recently marked a 6-month high.Perpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate usually charged every eight hours. Funding rates ensure there are no exchange risk imbalances. Even though both buyers and sellers' open interest is matched at all times, the leverage can vary.When buyers (longs) are the ones demanding more leverage, the funding rate turns positive. Therefore, the buyers will be the ones paying up the fees. This issue holds especially true during bull runs, when there is usually more demand for longs.Sustainable rates above 2% per week translate to extreme optimism. This level is acceptable during market rallies but problematic if the BTC price is sideways or in a downtrend.In situations like these, high leverage from buyers increases the potential for large liquidations during surprise price drops.Take notice how, despite Bitcon's stagnate price, the weekly funding rate managed to sustain a healthy level. This data indicates that traders remain optimistic, although they are far from being overleveraged.A brief moment of excitement was also seen in the early hours of Dec. 1 when BTC tested the $19,900 level.The funding rate might bring some distortions as it's the preferred instrument of retail traders and, as a result, is impacted by excessive leverage. On the other hand, professional traders tend to dominate longer-term futures contracts with set expiry dates.By measuring how much more expensive futures are versus the regular spot market, a trader can gauge their bullishness level. The fixed-calendar futures should usually trade with a 0.5% or higher premium versus regular spot exchanges.Whenever this indicator fades or turns negative, this is an alarming red flag. Such a situation, also known as backwardation, indicates that the market is turning bearish.The above chart shows that the indicator briefly touched 2% on Dec. 1 but later adjusted to 0.9% as Bitcoin failed to break the $20,000 resistance. Regardless of the drop, it has held above the minimum 0.5% threshold, indicating optimism from professional traders.By measuring whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options, one can gauge the overall market sentiment. Generally speaking, call options are used for bullish strategies, whereas put options for bearish ones.A 0.70 put-to-call ratio indicates that put options open interest lag the more bullish calls by 30% and is therefore bullish.In contrast, a 1.20 indicator favors put options by 20%, which can be deemed bearish. One thing to note is that the metric aggregates the entire BTC options market, including all calendar months.As Bitcoin price approaches $20,000, it's only natural for investors to seek downside protection. As a result, the put-to-call ratio peaked at 0.70 on Dec. 2. Albeit the increase, it was still favoring the more bullish call options by 30%.After this excitement period, the indicator has moved back to a healthy 0.63. Considering that 0.67 has been the average for the past 3 months, it should be deemed bullish as fewer investors are buying protective put options.Overall, each of the key indicators discussed above have held steady within their expected range, especially considering the market recently pulled back to $18,100.As BTC holds above $19,000, investors may begin to second-guess the odds of creating a new all-time high, and some will probably rush to take profits.At the moment, there has not been an indicator that is ringing the alarm bell. The overall bullishness remains, although the absence of an altcoin rally during BTC’s period of consolidation may damper investors' mood.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

328,"A number of TV shows have mentioned Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies over the years, including Big Bang Theory in 2017 and The Simpsons in 2020. One of the latest crypto mentions occurred during the premiere of the 11th season of Shameless, in an episode called “This is Chicago.” “It’s my crypto,” character Dash says, elaborating, “My Bitcoin. It’s down 30 and I was using it to leverage my Tether and my Ethereum.” Another character responded: “I have no idea what you just said.”Dash continued:Dash’s comments are unlikely to make much sense to real-world participants in the blockchain space, as the dialogue seemed to be little more than a low-fidelity combination of buzzwords and technobabble. One might use Tether in a leveraged Bitcoin trade, for instance, but the other way around appears illogical. It is additionally unclear what exactly being “down 30” means for Bitcoin. If he is simply referring to dollars, then he might want to buckle up, as a $30 swing for Bitcoin is miniscule price action.Oil prices did indeed suffer a tough spring this year, however, so at least his oil comment lines up adequately. Covering a margin call means Dash must deposit more collateral to maintain his current trading positions if prices drop past a certain point.On Monday, the Twitter account belonging to asset wallet platform MyCrypto flagged the quotes from the episode, saying: “Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether got a mention in this evening’s season premiere of Shameless!”Even though the dialogue made little sense, the episode's crypto inclusion still marked the mainstream's growing awareness for digital currencies. Bitcoin and others have seen significant adoption in 2020, including PayPal’s recent launch of digital assets on its platform."
329,"Institutional investors will play an important role in securing the future of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), according to Erik Voorhees, CEO and founder of ShapeShift.In a panel discussion at this year’s LaBitConf, Voorhees said Bitcoin’s adoption curve will grow substantially over the next five to 10 years. In that time, Voorhees estimated that half the world could have exposure to BTC. He believes that mass adoption will occur much later, however, once Bitcoin becomes the global monetary standard.The panel was virtually unanimous in the view that Bitcoin is better served with entities of different persuasions buying and holding BTC. In this vein, institutional adoption is a net positive for the ecosystem because it ensures that the rules of the game never change and that governments don’t try to interfere.Voorhees said governments have a greater incentive to censor Bitcoin if it’s used primarily by retail investors. With large institutions in play, there may be a natural “bulwark” against government overreach.Regarding Bitcoin, Voorhees noted his belief that “The greater the mix and diversity of holders, the better,” before continuing, “Democratization of control over money is the essence of Bitcoin.”Although Voorhees says we are still in the very early stages of institutional adoption, 2020 has been a watershed year for the digital asset in terms of orthodox acceptance. Major investors like Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller have confirmed their stake in Bitcoin, while PayPal and Cash App are buying up most newly mined BTC.Meanwhile, digital asset manager Grayscale continues to amass Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) amid record inflows into its funds.Bitcoin is experiencing a supply shortage occurring almost in lockstep with the latest deflationary halving event. With supplies capped at around 900 BTC per day, institutional adoption appears to be having a positive impact on price discovery. In Voorhees’ view, the real surge in institutional interest will occur near the peak of the next bull market when not owning Bitcoin will inflict reputational damage.Higher prices are no issue for major institutions, many of which are waiting for Bitcoin to “catch up to their liquidity,” according to Voorhees."
330,"Although he is based in the North Pole, Santa Claus spends much of his December touring the globe, making appearances at countless holiday-themed engagements in the run up to Christmas Eve. In payment for these rendezvous, Santa has long been known to accept tips in a variety of different currencies, assets and edible treats. This year, Santa adds Bitcoin (BTC) to his list of accepted payment methods.A global service called HireSanta now lets people book a Santa performer in exchange for Bitcoin, according to a post from the company’s website:Almost a year has passed since the generous man with a belly like a bowl full of jelly put out his latest naughty and nice list. John McAfee topped the naughty list last year due to his tactical avoidance of United States authorities. Craig Wright also showed up on the list as a likely coal recipient. Wright, who has persistently claimed to be Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, brought several libel suits against well-known industry folks, including Peter McCormack, host of the What Bitcoin Did podcast. 2019’s nice list yielded a number of good boys and girls, including Keith Mali Chung, who returned roughly $80,000 in Bitcoin to its owner after an accidental transaction. Also making an appearance on the nice list were school-goers in Uganda who received food funded by Binance as part of an initiative from its charity wing.With the Christmas season in full swing, crypto broker Bitcoin Suisse recently installed two holiday-themed BTC advertisements in the Zurich Main train station in Zurich, Switzerland."
331,"Recent news reports suggest that U.S. lawmakers may announce a new round of economic stimulus worth about $908 billion before the end of today. This second package, if announced, will add to the existing debt pile and may send the U.S. dollar index (DXY) lower. The index is already trading near its lowest level since April 2018.The slow economic recovery, expansionary monetary policy, overvalued stocks and negative bond yields are some of the reasons that have forced investors to search for alternative assets to safeguard their portfolios.Gold has been one of the favorite safe-haven assets of investors for many decades. However, in 2020, a few institutional investors diversified into Bitcoin (BTC) because they believed it would outperform gold.Investors who made this choice have benefitted from the sharp Bitcoin rally of the past few weeks and many are likely to hold their position given that most investors expect BTC price to rise higher.Bitcoin's recent stellar performance is no secret and the number of institutional investors attracted to the digital asset is likely to increase because few will want to be left behind in the race to buy the deflationary cryptocurrency.Henri Arslanian, Global Crypto Leader at PwC, recently told Bloomberg that one day investors will question the wisdom of fund managers who decided not to invest in BitcoinWhile the increased institutional inflow of money looks to be a certainty, the question one needs to ask is to what level will the institutions keep buying. There is not an exact answer to this question but investors should refrain from getting swept up in FOMO and buying Bitcoin just because everyone else is. Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine which may offer lucrative opportunities.The bulls are attempting to propel Bitcoin (BTC) above the pennant formation and the $19,500 resistance, but they are facing stiff resistance from the bears. To date, the $19,500 resistance is still acting as a major roadblock.However, the bears will have to sink the price below the 20-day exponential moving average ($18,305) to dampen the bullish sentiment.If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, some short-term momentum traders may dump their long positions and that could drag the price down to the $17,200 support. A break below this support could result in a drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($16,053).On the other hand, if the bulls do not give up much ground, it could create FOMO among traders and that could boost momentum and drive the price above the overhead resistance zone.In a strong uptrend, the path of least resistance is to the upside until proven otherwise. Above $20,000 the BTC/USD pair could rally to $21,140 and then to $23,043.The bears attempted to sink Ether (ETH) below the 20-day EMA ($559) but failed. The strong rebound on Dec. 5 shows that the sentiment remains bullish as traders are buying on dips to the 20-day EMA.If bulls can push the price above the $622.807 to $635.456 resistance zone, the ETH/USD pair will complete an ascending triangle pattern that has a target objective of $763.61.The upsloping moving averages suggest that bulls have the upper hand but the relative strength index (RSI) has formed a negative divergence, which warrants caution. If the RSI rises above the downtrend line, it will indicate that the momentum is favoring the bulls.This bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and plummets below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will invalidate the bearish setup and may pull the pair down to the $488.134 support.XRP bounced off $0.543 and rose above the downtrend line. This is a positive sign as it suggests that the correction could be over. However, this does not mean that a new uptrend will start immediately.The bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to stall the up-move at $0.6794. If they succeed, the XRP/USD pair could remain range-bound between $0.6794 and $0.543 for a few days.The next directional move could start after the price breaks above or below the range. If the bulls can push the price above $0.6794, a retest of $0.780574 will be on the cards.Conversely, if the price turns down and breaks below $0.543, selling could intensify and pull the price down to $0.4365.Litecoin (LTC) rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($79.79) on Dec. 5 and the price had risen above the overhead resistance at $84.3374. If the bulls can sustain the altcoin above this level, the up-move could reach $93.9282.The moving averages are sloping up and if the RSI can break above the downtrend line, it will suggest that the bulls have the upper hand.On the contrary, if the LTC/USD pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that traders are covering their long positions on minor rallies.The next support on the downside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $75.943 and if this level also gives way, the pair could drop to the critical support at $68.9008.The bulls are buying the dips to the $280 support but they are struggling to push the price to $300. This suggests that buying dries up at higher levels. The bears will now try to sink Bitcoin Cash (BCH) below $280.If they succeed, the BCH/USD pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($270) and then to $246.85. The flattish moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest that the bulls are losing their grip.This negative view will be invalidated if the pair rises from the current levels or the $280 support and rallies above $300. Such a move will indicate that the bulls are back in action. Above $300, the rally could extend to $320 and then to $338.Chainlink (LINK) bounced off the 50-day SMA ($12.60) on Dec. 5, which shows that traders bought this dip. However, the bulls are facing stiff resistance near the downtrend line.The flat 20-day EMA ($13.40) and the RSI near the midpoint do not indicate an advantage either to the bulls or the bears.If the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 50-day SMA, a drop to the uptrend line is possible. If this support also cracks, the LINK/USD pair could start a deeper correction to $10.This negative view will be invalidated if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the downtrend line. If they can do that, the pair may rise to $14.80.The bulls are attempting to keep Polkadot (DOT) above the 20-day EMA ($5.09). However, the lack of a strong rebound suggests a lack of urgency among traders to buy at this level.If the price does not pick up momentum and rally to $5.5899, the bears will try to sink the price to the 50-day SMA ($4.67). Such a move could keep the DOT/USD pair range-bound for a few more days.Conversely, if the pair rises from the current levels and breaks above the overhead resistance, it will suggest the possible start of a new uptrend. The levels to watch on the upside are $6.0857 and then $6.8619.Cardano (ADA) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($0.147) on Dec. 5 and rose above the $0.155 resistance. However, the bulls are struggling to sustain the price above $0.155, which suggests that bears are selling on minor rallies.If the bears again sink the price below $0.155, it will increase the possibility of a break below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that the bulls are no longer buying on dips, which indicates a change in sentiment.Below the 20-day EMA, the ADA/USD pair could drop to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at ($0.141) and then to the 61.8% retracement level at $0.1312.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls defend the $0.155 support, the pair may rise to the downtrend line. A break above this resistance could suggest that the bulls are back in action.Binance Coin (BNB) slipped below the moving averages on Dec. 04. The bulls attempted to push the price back above the moving averages in the past two days but they have not been able to sustain the altcoin above the 20-day EMA (29). This suggests selling by bears on rallies.If the bears sink the price below $28.6588, the BNB/USD pair could start its journey southward towards the $25.6652 support. The flat moving averages and the RSI close to 50 suggest range-bound action may continue for a few more days.Trading in a range can be volatile and directionless. Hence, it is better to wait patiently until the price breaks above or below the range and starts a trending move.Stellar Lumens (XLM) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($0.159) on Dec. 5, but the rebound has once again fizzled out near the downtrend line. This suggests that the bears are selling on every pullback to the downtrend line.The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI has dropped below 58, which suggests that bulls are losing their grip.If the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the decline could extend to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.140209. This is an important support to watch because if it cracks, panic selling may set in.Contrary to this assumption, if the price once again rebounds off the 20-day EMA and rises above the downtrend line, the XLM/USD pair could rise to $0.20 and consolidate for a few days before starting a trending move.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

332,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has quadrupled in the past nine months, which means another similar rally would put $100,000 on the table in the foreseeable future.Dan Tapiero, co-founder of 10T Holdings, does not expect Bitcoin to hit $100,000 in the next nine months. But, he said that it shows how fast the asset is growing and its long-term potential. He wrote:Bitcoin has evolved rapidly throughout 2020 due to three factors. First, the reduction in new supply after the halving in May has evidently reduced sell pressure.Second, the increase in institutional demand has caused the buy-side pressure for BTC to rise considerably.Third, long-time BTC holders have continued to express confidence, boosting market sentiment.For institutions, the sudden drop of Bitcoin to sub-$4,000 in early 2020 was also a compelling entry point. It was one of the worst-performing assets during the pandemic-induced crash in March, dropping by around 50% to as low as $3,596 on BitMEX.Since then, Bitcoin has shown resilience and staying power, eventually recovering back to its all-time high and reaching a new record high above $19,982 on Coinbase on Dec. 1.#bitcoin 200WMA $7500 (monthly increase 5.5%), looks like late 2016 / early 2017. pic.twitter.com/Z83ALEBm4JAt the same time, investors such as MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor believe BTC is in a much stronger position now compared with the previous bull cycle. For one, today's retail interest is only a fraction of what it was during peak euphoria in December 2017.Moreover, the increasing perception of Bitcoin as a digital store of value and a must-have in every portfolio has boosted its brand image among big investors alongside record institutional inflows. All of this raises the possibility of a six-figure price tag as early as next year. Some analysts have even predicted $200,000 and higher by December 2021.Since it's often dubbed as ""digital gold,"" one of the strong bull cases for Bitcoin is closing its valuation gap with the precious metal. At $9 trillion, Bitcoin's $300 billion market cap is just 3% of gold. BTC hitting $100,000 would reduce this gap to 23%.The value of Bitcoin has risen 100% against gold since September, with 1 BTC now buying over 10 ounces of gold. At the same time, analysts have noted record outflows from the gold market in recent months, some of which have ended up in Bitcoin. As Cointelegraph reported, the U.S. dollar may weaken further in 2021, something that has traditionally buoyed both Bitcoin and gold. "
333,"After years of extradition debates, Bitcoin (BTC) launderer Alexander Vinnik has finally been sentenced by a French court.According to a report on Monday by Novaya Gazeta, Vinnik has been sentenced to five years in prison for ""money laundering as part of an organized criminal group and providing false information about the origin of the proceeds"" in addition to a fine of 100,000 euro ($121,000).According to the BBC, the court partially dropped charges related to the ransomware known as Locky. As of publishing time, online reports do not specify whether Vinnik’s sentence is related to his alleged senior role at now-defunct crypto exchange BTC-e.Vinnik previously denied his involvement at BTC-e, reportedly claiming that he was just an employee. He said that his monthly salary at BTC-e amounted to 10,000 euro.As previously reported, Vinnik is allegedly the mastermind behind an international money-laundering scheme that processed over $4 billion worth of capital flows through BTC-e.Colloquially known as “Mr. Bitcoin,” Vinnik was first arrested in Greece in July 2017 for allegedly taking part in the operations of BTC-e. Since the arrest, a number of jurisdictions have sought Vinnik’s extradition, including the United States and Russia, where Vinnik is a citizen. Vinnik was extradited to France in 2018 on charges of fraud and money laundering.In June, the New Zealand police reportedly recovered $90 million connected to the case against Vinnik."
334,"Bitcoin (BTC) starts another week aiming for $19,500 and beyond as crunch time for Brexit meets mass U.S. money printing.Cointelegraph takes a look at the price factors at stake for Bitcoin this week as shaky $19,000 support remains in play.The more controversial elements of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden’s future tenure are already becoming clearer — and it’s good news for Bitcoin.As his inauguration edges closer, Biden has already said that he plans a $7 trillion recovery package to tackle the impact of coronavirus. This would add a huge new chunk of debt to the already huge mountain that the U.S. has accrued this year.Against the backdrop of an already weakening dollar, the U.S. could thus face a potent cocktail of dangerous economic factors driving down wealth. The appeal of a safe haven has thus never been so real.“We had a horrible time in 2008 because of too much debt, and since 2008, the debt everywhere has skyrocketed. We can’t even count how much the debt is up,” Jim Rogers, co-founder of the Quantum Fund with George Soros, said at an investment summit last week quoted by Reuters.As Cointelegraph reported, the strength of the dollar is predicted to fall further in 2021, something that has traditionally buoyed Bitcoin. The greenback is already at its weakest against a basket of trading partner currencies since April 2018.As an indication of the direction the U.S. is headed, meanwhile, Preston Pysh noted the opposing direction of U.S. debt versus M2 money velocity.“Check out the disparity on these two charts -just in 2020 alone,” he mentioned to Twitter followers.New debt may come a lot sooner than even Biden can summon. As Senators began hinting on Sunday, a new coronavirus stimulus package could appear as soon as Monday.Subject to voting, the bill would come with a price tag of almost $1 trillion and provide “targeted relief,” Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia told CNN.“I think we have got the top line numbers done. We are working right now on language so that we can have — as early as tomorrow — a piece of legislation,” he claimed.The new stimulus bill has seen little progress despite promises from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin months before. A second stimulus check of $1,200 for eligible Americans, however, no longer features in the latest proposals.The first $1,200 stimulus check from mid April would be worth almost $4,000 if invested in Bitcoin at the time.It’s make or break for the United Kingdom and the Euopean Union agreeing a Brexit trade deal.After many a delayed deadline and last-ditch efforts to resolve their differences, the two sides now accept that time has run out and that only a matter of days — or less — stands between the U.K. leaving with a deal or crashing out of the E.U.“We keep calm as always and if there is still a way, we will see,” the E.U.’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier told reporters over the weekend.The pound was suppressed on Monday as uncertainty took hold, and a surprise lack of a trade deal would automatically shave off more of its value, analysts said last week.As with any major geopolitical event, the potential for Bitcoin to profit briefly from the shockwave remains, this likely to come later on Monday.As Cointelegraph reported last week, Nigel Farage, formerly the head of the pro-Brexit U.K. Independence Party, described Bitcoin as the “ultimate anti-lockdown investment” in reference to London’s harsh restriction of individual freedoms over the coronavirus.Within Bitcoin, attention remains fixed on whether more “fear of missing out,” or “FOMO,” from institutional investors will see more mass buy-ins and a squeeze on the supply.Even mainstream media is entertaining the idea of a price transformation thanks to large-volume players entering, something which is all the more possible thanks to the Federal Reserve propping up equities markets and creating artificial competition.Grayscale, the investment giant with over $10 billion in Bitcoin assets under management alone, would be the first industry heavyweight to benefit under such circumstances.“Institutional investors are keen on portfolio construction in the wake of Covid, and the ways they need to reposition themselves given how governments have injected stimulus into the system,” managing director Michael Sonnenshein told Bloomberg.Signs that more cash is coming to Bitcoin already abound. Just last week, Guggenheim revealed that it had reserved the right to buy into Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust via its $5.3 billion Macro Opportunities Fund.Regardless of who and how, institutional FOMO places more pressure on the dwindling Bitcoin supply, with price rises versus other assets the only logical outcome.Henri Arslanian, Global Crypto Leader at PwC, summarized the situation to to Bloomberg:Focusing on short-term price action, meanwhile, Bitcoin is at a crossroads, Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe says.In his latest market update on Monday, Van de Poppe noted that at $19,200, BTC/USD could either retest $19,500 or try to break lower during trading.Both levels are significant. A shot above $19,500 would open up a clear move to expand on last week’s all-time highs, possibly with a top as high as $21,000.Conversely, break below $18,600 again and real support may only emerge much lower — possibly beneath $17,000.“Overall… we are in range resistance, which means no entries until the gain of the level,” he summarized while waiting for $19,500 to appear.Van de Poppe also noted that CME futures gaps, including a giant $1,300 void from last weekend, remain a major nearby chart feature. A drop to just below $17,000 would fully ""fill"" the larger gap."
335,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has been hovering near the $19,000 level for the past few days. Whenever the price consolidates near the all-time high, it is an indication of strength.However, the question troubling investors is whether Bitcoin will source enough momentum to pull above $20,000 or will it witness a sharp correction in the short term. At the moment, analysts are divided on their expectations about the next move.While the near-term remains uncertain, on-chain analyst Willy Woo believes that the long-term picture is more bullish than ever. According to Woo, Bitcoin is going through a re-accumulation phase, which is one of the main reasons why the price has not seen volatile corrections during its current up-move to the all-time high. Woo expects Bitcoin to reach $200,000 by the end of 2021.Man famous investors have been vocal about their expectations of higher prices in Bitcoin. However, it is by no means the only cryptocurrency on the institutional investors’ radar. Grayscale managing director Michael Sonnenshein in a recent interview with Bloomberg said that “Ethereum first and in some cases Ethereum only” investors are on the rise.The inflow of funds into Ether (ETH) shows that institutional investors are adding more cryptocurrencies to their portfolio. This is a positive sign as it shows increased confidence of the investors in the crypto space.As the sentiment remains bullish, let’s study the charts of the top-five cryptocurrencies that could start a trending move this week.The bears are aggressively defending the $19,500 to $20,000 zone for the past few days, but they haven’t been able to sink Bitcoin below the 20-day exponential moving average ($18,188). This suggests that the bulls are buying on every minor dip.The BTC/USD pair has formed a pennant near the overhead resistance zone. Both the moving averages are sloping up, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand and the path of least resistance is to the upside.If the bulls can push and sustain the price above the pennant, the next leg of the uptrend could begin. The first target objective on the upside is $21,140 and then $23,043.This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the pennant. In that case, there is a minor support at the 20-day EMA and if that breaks, the pair could drop to $17,200.The negative divergence on the RSI is the only bearish development, which suggests that the momentum may be weakening. However, until the price dips below the 20-day EMA, the advantage will not shift in favor of the bears.The 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart has flattened out and the RSI has dipped to the midpoint. This suggests a balance between supply and demand.The bulls are buying the dips to the support line of the pennant while the bears are selling the rallies to the resistance line of the pennant.As neither the bulls nor the bears have a clear advantage, it is better to wait for the price to break above or below the pennant before considering a fresh position.Ether strongly rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($555) on Dec. 5, which shows accumulation by the bulls at lower levels. The buyers will now try to push the price above the $622.807 to $635.456 overhead resistance zone.If they succeed, the ETH/USD pair could resume the next leg of the uptrend that can reach $800. The upsloping moving averages suggest that the bulls have the upper hand.However, the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight. They have aggressively defended the $622.807 resistance since Nov. 24, and will again try to turn the price down from this resistance.If the sellers can sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair could drop to $488.134. The RSI has formed a bearish divergence, which suggests that the momentum has weakened.The 4-hour chart shows the formation of a bullish ascending triangle pattern that will complete on a breakout and close above $622.807. This setup has a target objective of $763.61.The bears are currently attempting to sink the price to the trendline of the triangle. If this support cracks, it will invalidate the bullish setup.However, if the price rebounds off the trendline, the bulls will once again try to propel the price above the overhead resistance. If they succeed, the next leg of the up-move could begin.Monero (XMR) has been trading near the $135.50 overhead resistance for the past four days. The altcoin has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which will complete on a breakout and close above $135.50. This bullish setup has a target objective of $167.While the 20-day EMA ($126) is rising, the 50-day simple moving average ($122) is flat and the RSI is just above the midpoint suggesting a balance between supply and demand.The bulls will gain the upper hand after the price sustains above $135.50 and the bears will be at an advantage if the price dips below the 50-day SMA.On the downside, the first support is at $110 and below that $105. A break below this support could start a new downtrend.The 4-hour chart shows that the bears continue to sell near the $135.50 overhead resistance. If the bears sink the price below the 50-SMA, a drop to $123.73 is possible. A break below this support could extend the drop to $120 and then to $112.50.Conversely, if the price rebounds off the 50-SMA, the bulls will once again try to push the price above the $135.50 to $142.80 resistance zone. If they succeed, the next leg of the uptrend could begin.The bulls are currently attempting to push VeChain (VET) above the $0.01755 overhead resistance. If they manage to sustain the price above the resistance, the altcoin will complete a rounding bottom pattern.The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that bulls are in command. On a close above the overhead resistance, the rally may reach $0.02292 and then the pattern target of $0.02618.However, the bears may have other plans. If they can sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.0150), the VET/USD pair could drop to $0.014 and then to the 50-day SMA ($0.0125).On the contrary, if the pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make another attempt to push the price above the overhead resistance.The 4-hour chart shows that the bears are aggressively defending the $0.01755 resistance and are trying to sustain the price below the 20-EMA. If that happens, a drop to the trend line is possible.If the pair rebounds off the trendline, the bulls will again try to propel the price above the $0.01755 to $0.01861963 overhead resistance zone. If they do that, the next leg of the up-move could begin.Conversely, if the bears sink and sustain the price below the trendline, a deeper correction to $0.0145 and then to $0.0125 may be on the cards.AAVE is currently in an uptrend as it has been making a higher high and a higher low pattern. The rising 20-day EMA ($74) and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls are in control. If they can push the price above $94.875, the altcoin could rally to $124.075.However, the bears have been defending the $94.875 resistance for the past three days. If they can sink the price below $79.20, the AAVE/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off this support, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend.Conversely, if the price dips below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest advantage to the bears. The next support on the downside is at $69 and if this level also cracks, the decline could extend to $50.The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls are buying the dips to the uptrend line while the bears are selling on rallies to the downtrend line.If the bears sink the price below the uptrend line, the pair may drop to the 50-SMA and below it to $72. A break below this support could start a deeper correction.On the contrary, if the price rebounds off the uptrend line, the bulls will try to push the pair above the downtrend line and the $94.875 resistance. If they succeed, the pair may resume the uptrend.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

336,"According to on-chain analyst Willy Woo, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) could achieve a ""conservative"" target of $200,000 in 2021. The prediction revolves around the fact that long-time investors seem more confident in the recent rally.There are two key data points that suggest Bitcoin’s ongoing rally could explode higher. First, “HODLers,” or long-time BTC holders, aren't moving their funds for longer than in previous rallies. Second, BTC held on exchanges continues to decrease, which reduces selling pressure.The re-accumulation of Bitcoin has remained a consistently bullish trend throughout 2020. It has continuously decreased the selling pressure on BTC, allowing a more stable rally without major 30%-40% corrections as frequently seen in 2017.Woo noted that he is bullish for 2021 because Bitcoin’s re-accumulation phase means the amount of BTC that could be sold is much lower compared to the previous bull cycle. He said:Atop the declining Bitcoin reserve on exchanges, Woo found that HODLers are “holding stronger.” In 2017, the amount of gain per the amount of capital invested in Bitcoin hovered at around $0.25. This figure increased to $0.35 in 2020, which means more investors expect event bigger profits in the future.Based on the combination of the two optimistic on-chain trends, Woo said that Bitcoin could achieve a  ""conservative price"" of $200,000 by the end of 2021. He explained:As reported in May, Bitcoin HODL wave data also supports the argument the HODLers from the 2017-2018 bull cycle aren't selling at these relatively high prices, including high-net worth individuals or ""whales.""However, this data also suggests that some earlier HODLers from three to seven years ago are taking profit after a prolonged BTC rally, heightening the chances of a correction in the short term.As Cointelegraph previously reported, Woo has been calling for an extended Bitcoin bull run since March 2020.On Mar. 4, Woo told Max Keiser, the host of RT’s Keiser Report, that Bitcoin could hit $135,000 in the bull run. He said at the time:Although the price of Bitcoin fell to sub-$4,000 on Mar. 12 in a “Black Thursday” crash that shocked the market, it has swiftly recovered since.The bull trend that was bound to happen in March before the crash appears to be in full swing now following BTC’s strong nine-month recovery.But in the near term, analysts believe that the likelihood of the recovery in the U.S. dollar could cause Bitcoin to see a minor pullback. Following the biggest three-week liquidation in the gold market, analysts also see the precious metal rebounding, which could stall BTC’s momentum in the short term."
337,"For the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) price has been flirting with the $20,000 mark, which has led some traders to lose their patience. In the eyes of some traders, the lack of bullish momentum is problematic, especially considering that BTC tested the $16,200 level roughly a week ago.Experienced traders know that there are key indicators that serve as telling signs of a trend reversal. These are volumes, the futures premium, and top traders' positions at major exchanges.A handful of negative indicators will not precede every dip, but there are some signs of weakness more often than not. Every trader has their own system, and some will only act if three or more bearish conditions are met, but there is no set rule for knowing when to buy or sell.Some websites host trading indicators that claim to show the long-to-short ratio for various assets, but in reality, they are simply comparing the volume of the bids and offers stacked.Others will refer to the leaderboard data, therefore monitoring accounts that did not opt-out from the ranking, but this is not accurate.A better method is to monitor the perpetual futures (inverse swap) funding rate.The open interest of buyers and sellers of perpetual contracts is matched at all times in any futures contract. There is simply no way an imbalance can happen, as every trade requires a buyer (long) and a seller (short).Funding rates ensure there are no exchange risk imbalances. When sellers (shorts) are the ones demanding more leverage, the funding rate goes negative. Therefore, those traders will be the ones paying up the fees.Sudden shifts to the negative range indicate a strong willingness to keep short positions open. Ideally, investors will monitor a couple of exchanges simultaneously to avoid eventual anomalies.The funding rate might bring some distortions as it's the preferred instrument of retail traders and, as a result, is impacted by excessive leverage. Professional traders tend to dominate longer-term futures contracts with set expiry dates.By measuring how much more expensive futures are versus the regular spot market, a trader can gauge their bullishness level.Take notice of how the fixed-calendar futures should usually trade with a 0.5% or higher premium versus regular spot exchanges. Whenever this premium fades or turns negative, this is an alarming red flag. Such a situation, also known as backwardation, indicates strong bearishness.In addition to monitoring futures contracts, good traders also track volume in the spot market. Breaking important resistance levels on low volumes is somehow intriguing. Typically, low volumes indicate a lack of confidence. Therefore significant price changes should be accompanied by robust trading volume.Although the recent volumes have been above average, traders should remain skeptical of significant price swings below $3 billion in daily volume, especially considering the past 30 days.Based on the past month of data, the volume will be a fundamental metric to watch as traders attempt to push Bitcoin price through the $20,000 level.Another key metric savvy investors monitor is the top traders' long-to-short ratio that can be found at leading crypto exchanges.There are often discrepancies between exchanges' methodology, so readers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.A sudden move below the 1.00 long-to-short ratio would be a troubling signal in the above example. This is because historical 30-day data and the current 1.23 figure favor longs.As previously mentioned, the ratio can differ significantly between exchanges, but this effect can be neutralized by avoiding direct comparisons.Unlike Binance, it is common for OKEx top traders to hold levels below 1.00, albeit not necessarily indicating bearishness. According to its 30-day data, numbers below 0.75 should be considered worrisome.There is no set rule or method for predicting large dips as some traders require that multiple indicators turn bearish before they enter short positions or close their long positions.With that said, monitoring the funding rate, spot volumes, and the top traders’ long-to-short ratio provides a much clearer view of the market than simply reading candlestick patterns and general oscillators like the Relative Strength Index and Moving Average Convergence Divergence.This is because the metrics discussed provide a direct gauge of professional traders' sentiment, and it is crucial to have a clear view of this as BTC tries to break $20,000.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
338,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) was rejected by the $19,500 resistance level yet again on Dec. 4, with traders becoming increasingly uncertain about what's next for BTC/USD.Some foresee the dominant cryptocurrency undergoing a consolidation phase or another minor correction in the near term, particularly as the U.S. dollar is showing signs of a possible recovery.Others, however, expect the crucial $18,500 support level to hold, which would likely set up BTC to retest the key $20,000 level and a new all-time high in the near future.In the short term, traders generally foresee two important support and resistance levels for Bitcoin. First, the $18,500 area is critical to ensure that the bullish market structure of BTC holds. Second, The $19,500 level is a massive resistance level for BTC. If BTC surpasses $19,500, traders expect a new run-up toward the all-time high that's currently just under $20,000.Meanwhile, Bitcoin is becoming more difficult to trade because of the volatility at the $19,500 resistance level. BTC saw a severe sell-off every time this area was tested in the past week.A pseudonymous trader known as “CryptoGainz” believes that the ideal entry point for Bitcoin traders is now above the $19,500 resistance level. However, this may not be the case for two reasons: it puts traders at risk of a steep sell-off at the record high once again as $20,000 remains a high-risk sell wall for the bulls. He said:Whales selling below the all-time high is the one key reason Bitcoin is experiencing massive volatility each time it nears $19,500.CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju told Cointelegraph explained that whale inflows hit an eight-month high when BTC got close to $20,000. The combination of whales and miners selling heavily puts BTC at risk of a correction, Ju noted.In the near term, this could mean that Bitcoin could face weeks of sideways consolidation or a deeper correction, according to Ki. Moreover, he added that exchange reserves are not declining as they did throughout mid-2020. It shows that whales might be leaving BTC on exchanges to sell if the price of Bitcoin rises. He explained:If Bitcoin rises above the heavily-shorted $19,500 resistance level, buyers have a chance to regain control over the market.A pseudonymous trader known as “CryptoCapo” said that “bears don't want to see price above $19,500,” while bulls do not want the price to go below $18,500.Nevertheless, if the bulls prevail here, the $20,000 level would be the next — and perhaps the more psychologically important — area to defend for the bears, in the near term. Other traders, like CryptoGainz, similarly said that $19,650 is the level that may trigger a new breakout for Bitcoin in the near future.Meanwhile, MicroStrategy, the $3 billion business intelligence conglomerate, has just bought an additional $50 million in Bitcoin at the current price level, which yet another optimistic factor for Bitcoin. MicroStrategy has purchased approximately 2,574 bitcoins for $50.0 million in cash in accordance with its Treasury Reserve Policy, at an average price of approximately $19,427 per bitcoin. We now hold approximately 40,824 bitcoins.https://t.co/nwZcM9zAXZThe public company first announced its purchase of $250 million worth of BTC on Aug. 11, as Cointelegraph reported. In September, the firm bought another $175 million worth of BTC, bringing its BTC holdings to about 38,000 BTC. MicroStrategy doubling down on its purchase shows that the firm believes $19,000 could be a launchpad for Bitcoin’s next rally.This news also comes as Grayscale has already added thousands of Bitcoin to its holdings in December alone. As Cointelegraph reported earlier this week, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust bought 55,000 BTC in November, or double the amount of the total BTC mined that month. Therefore, it remains to be seen if this institutional buying could offset the bearish selling by whales and miners in the month ahead. Technically, the bearish scenario for Bitcoin in the upcoming days revolves around the $18,500 support level. If BTC loses the support and falls below $18,500, technical analysts say that a larger drop could occur. Below $18,500, the next major macro support area is the $16,000 to $16,500 range, which BTC tested on Nov. 26.Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, noted that Bitcoin falling under $18,500 would likely mean retesting the $16,000 support area. If BTC keeps getting rejected by the $19,150 and $19,400 resistance levels, the probability of a drop will continue to rise.Van de Poppe explained:As a result, the futures market has been showing uncertainty from traders in the past several days. Data from CryptoQuant show that Bitcoin futures traders have been using lower leverage as of late. This indicates that traders anticipate large price swings and potentially steep sell-offs to occur.Analysts at CryptoQuant found that open interest on Binance Futures is rising while the estimated leverage ratio is declining, which suggests that traders are becoming increasingly cautious and uncertain about Bitcoin's next move. The calls for a Bitcoin correction have been increasing, even from several permabulls. Raoul Pal, the CEO of Real Vision Group, for example, pointed out that technicals suggest BTC is at risk of seeing a correction. The DeMark system shows the daily chart of Bitcoin is on track for a record 13 consecutive positive candles.Bitcoin is potentially facing some serious technical headways... the daily DeMark is showing a cluster on 2 13's and a 9 and tomorrow might put in ANOTHER 13! pic.twitter.com/TNPpLfR2nHBut, one variable that may allow Bitcoin to continue grinding upward is the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the yearly chart. Currently, the RSI of Bitcoin is hovering at 75, which means that it is not yet in overbought territory.An asset is considered to be extremely bought when the RSI rises above 90. Considering the general momentum of BTC, alongside increasing institutional interest, BTC bulls still have a good chance of breaking through the key $19,500 and $20,000 resistances."
339,"Dan Tapiero, the co-founder of 10T Holdings, said weak hands have been shaken out in the gold market. This raises the probability of a gold rally in the near term, especially as it comes off of an 80-day pullback period.Bitcoin has seen strong momentum in the past three months, as it achieved an all-time high on Coinbase and a number of other major exchanges.Despite this, the threat of a correction for Bitcoin is a real possibility if gold begins to rebound in tandem with the U.S. dollar.According to Tapiero, the largest ever three-week liquidation in the gold market increases the probability of an uptrend. He wrote:Some might consider the recovery of gold a positive factor for Bitcoin in the medium term. Since more investors are starting to acknowledge BTC as a store of value, the uptrend of gold could benefit the cryptocurrency.Still, there is a stronger case to be made that the rally of Bitcoin coincided with large gold outflows, as Cointelegraph reported. That means a major gold rally could impact the near-term momentum of BTC.The U.S. stock market is continuing to rally due to unprecedented liquidity from the central bank. The combination of average inflation and relaxed financial conditions have been pushing stocks to all-time highs.Best month since 1987 for stocks. #DowJones pic.twitter.com/SMslJLXwHSAs a result, Jan Nieuwenhuijs, an independent financial researcher at The Gold Observer, reported that U.S. stocks had their best month since 1987.There is a possibility that the continuous uptrend of U.S. stocks makes other risk-on and risk-off assets less compelling in the near term. It could also make BTC a less urgent trade for both retail and institutional investors in the foreseeable future.At the moment, many traders believe that Bitcoin is at risk of seeing a deeper pullback to $18,600 following its recent rejection.Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said that BTC’s fall from $19,100 with a strong reaction from sellers makes a larger drop likely.

The precious metal has underperformed against BTC in recent weeks as the dominant cryptocurrency saw an institution-led rally."
340,"A few years back, Bitcoin’s (BTC) price was controlled by whales as the crypto market lacked depth and was relatively illiquid. If whales were selling in unison, no one wanted to venture out and buy. Similarly, the whale’s concerted buying easily boosted prices higher.However, that is not the case anymore. With the arrival of institutional investors, it appears that the whales are gradually losing their ability to influence BT price.According to on-chain data, Grayscale Investments purchased about twice the number of Bitcoin mined in November. The steady inflow of institutional funds has boosted Grayscale’s Bitcoin Assets Under Management to over $10.5 billion.Some investors will wonder why institutions are buying Bitcoin when the price is near record highs but it should be noted that institutional investors usually buy with the long-term in mind. The fact that they are buying near record highs shows they believe Bitcoin’s price will be considerably higher in a few years.Legendary investor Paul Tudor Jones said that the current crypto market capitalization of about $560 billion is minuscule compared to the $90 trillion equity market cap and “God knows how many trillions of fiat currency.” In the next two decades, Jones anticipates every one to be using “some type of digital currency.”With such huge future potential, it's easy to believe that crypto prices will only move higher but this is a common misconception. Every bull phase witnesses violent corrections, and eventually crypto prices will pullback. These are the opportunities that savvy retail and institutional investors will be watching for. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the critical support levels from where the price may rebound.Bitcoin (BTC) is in an uptrend and it is currently consolidating near the overhead resistance zone of $19,500 to $20,000. The bears are aggressively defending this zone but the positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground.This shows that bulls are not closing their positions in a hurry and are buying on every minor dip. The upsloping moving averages suggest that bulls are in control.The only bearish development on the chart is the negative divergence on the relative strength index (RSI). While this setup warrants caution, it gets invalidated in strong uptrends, hence a trade should not be taken on this setup alone.If the bulls can push the price above $20,000, the next level to watch on the upside is $22,727 and then $25,000.The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day exponential moving average ($18,013) and the BTC/USD pair could start a deeper correction if the support at $17,200 cracks.Ether (ETH) has been consolidating near the $622.807 overhead resistance for the past few days. Usually, a tight consolidation near the resistance is a positive sign because it shows that the bulls are not booking profits aggressively as they expect the up-move to resume.If bulls keep the price above $560, the possibility of a break above the $622.807 to $635.456 resistance zone increases. Above this level, the ETH/USD pair could resume the uptrend and rally to $800.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls fail to achieve the breakout even after repeated attempts, that may attract profit-booking by short-term traders and shorting by aggressive bears.If the price dips below the 20-day EMA ($548), it will suggest that the bullish momentum has weakened. Below this level, the pair may plummet to $488.134.XRP is currently witnessing a correction in an uptrend. The altcoin has turned down from the downtrend line and if the bears sink the price below $0.574, the altcoin could drop to the 20-day EMA at $0.521.In an uptrend, the bulls usually buy the dip to the 20-day EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment remains bullish. The buyers will then try to propel the price above the downtrend line.If they succeed, the XRP/USD pair could rally to $0.6794 and then to $0.780574. On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, a deeper correction to $0.4365 is possible.Litecoin (LTC) is consolidating in an uptrend. The price had been stuck between the $84.3374 support and the $93.9282 resistance for the past two days, but the bears are currently attempting to sustain the price below the support.If the bears manage to do that, the LTC/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($78). If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will again try to propel the pair above $93.9282 and resume the uptrend.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair could slide to the next support at $68.9008, which is just above the 50-day SMA at $65.6947. If the bulls defend this support zone, a few days of range-bound action is possible.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) formed successive inside day candlestick patterns on Dec. 2 and 3, indicating indecision. The bulls tried to resume the up-move today but the long wick on the candlestick suggests aggressive selling by the bears at higher levels.The bears tried to sink the price below the $280 support but the bulls are defending this level. Both moving averages are flattening out and the RSI is just above the midpoint, suggesting a balance between supply and demand.A break below the $280 support could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($268) and then to $246.85. On the other hand, if the bulls sustain the price above $300, the BCH/USD pair may rise to $320 and then to $338.Chainlink (LINK) turned down from the downtrend line and the bears are currently attempting to sink the price back below the$13.28 support. If they succeed, the altcoin could drop to the 50-day SMA at $12.46.The failure of the bulls to push the price above the downtrend line suggests that the bears are aggressively defending the higher levels. The 20-day EMA ($13.48) has flattened out and the RSI has dropped to the midpoint, indicating that bulls are losing their grip.A break below the 50-day SMA could pull the price down to the uptrend line. A break below this support will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.This negative view will be invalidated if the price turns up from the current levels or rebounds off the 50-day SMA and rises above the downtrend line.Polkadot (DOT) again turned down from the $5.5899 overhead resistance on Dec. 3. This suggests that the bears are aggressively defending this level. The price has now dipped back to the 20-day EMA ($5.09).If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will once again try to propel the price above the $5.5899 overhead resistance. If they succeed, a rally to $6.0857 and then to $6.8619 may be on the cards.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the DOT/USD pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($4.61) and remain range-bound for a few more days.Cardano (ADA) is currently correcting in an uptrend. If the bears sink the price below the $0.155 support, the altcoin could drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.144). The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls have the upper hand.The bulls are likely to defend the 20-day EMA support, which is just above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at ($0.141).If the ADA/USD pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA and rises above the downtrend line, it will increase the possibility of resumption of the uptrend.However, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, a deeper correction to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.131 is possible.Binance Coin (BNB) formed consecutive inside day candlestick patterns on Dec. 2 and 3. Today, the altcoin has formed a bearish engulfing candlestick, which shows that the bears have asserted their dominance.If the bears sink the price below the moving averages, the BNB/USD pair could drop to the $25.6652 support. This is an important level that has held twice before. Therefore, the bulls are likely to buy a dip to this support once again.The flat moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. The bulls will have to push and sustain the price above the $32 overhead resistance to gain strength.Stellar Lumens (XLM) formed an inside day candlestick pattern on Dec. 2 and a Doji candlestick pattern on Dec. 3, both indicating indecision about the next directional move.However, the uncertainty has resolved to the downside today. The XLM/USD pair has broken below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.17513 and it can now drop to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.15767, placed just above the 20-day EMA ($0.155).Both moving averages are sloping up, hence, the bulls may buy the dip to the 20-day EMA. A strong bounce could take the price to the downtrend line but a weak rebound could increase the possibility of a fall to the 61.8% retracement level at $0.140.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns up and breaks above the downtrend line, a rally to $0.22 could be on the cards.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

341,"In an interview with economist Marc Friedrich, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor said that Bitcoin is not the same as it was in 2015 or 2017. According to Saylor, the arguments against Bitcoin (BTC) that were relevant four years ago are no longer applicable.Bitcoin has grown exponentially since the 2017 peak in terms of infrastructure, fundamentals and adoption. In the past year, institutions have started to increasingly see BTC as a store of value and an inflation hedge.In 2017, critics said Bitcoin was too volatile and that there was a risk it could drop to zero because it was an asset in a nascent phase. Saylor emphasized that these arguments are less relevant now because BTC has evolved significantly in three years.Saylor emphasized that Lebron James played basketball from ages 8 to 18, but he matured to evolve into one of the all-time greats. He said Bitcoin went through a similar period, stating: Tonight 7pm CET @michael_saylor from @MicroStrategy about #bitcoin, #bitcoin, #bitcoin, #gold, #xrp and much more (mostly #bitcoin).

Tune in: https://t.co/L9PMOtdcKR pic.twitter.com/2itjTLaZAhOne of the major changes Bitcoin has seen since 2017 is its market structure. Three years ago, retail platforms like BitMEX were the dominant players in the derivatives market.As Cointelegraph reported, institutional platforms such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) have consistently processed volumes similar to leading retail-focused exchanges. As of Dec. 4, the CME BTC futures market has an open interest of $1.14 billion, which is higher than Binance Futures, Bybit, Huobi and BitMEX.On-chain data also show a considerable increase in institutional growth based on large transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.According to data from IntoTheBlock, the number of transactions valued at above $100,000 has increased twofold over the past year. This is indicative of the increase in institutional activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, the analysts said.Considering the noticeable change in volume trends and on-chain data in the past 12 months, the analysts wrote that Bitcoin is seeing high institutional growth. They wrote:Based on a variety of factors, including the fact that there is significant institutional involvement in the Bitcoin market, investors like Saylor remain confident that BTC is evolving into an established store of value and that this is improving its perception with mainstream investors."
342,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has been seeing a massive run in recent months as it surged by almost 100% from $10,000 to $19,800. However, the all-time high region at $20,000 has been showing significant resistance, causing the price to drop several times including today, as BTC has now fallen below $19,000 on Dec. 4.The chances of a correction have been slowly increasing amid diminishing volume in recent days. Multiple arguments can be made for a deeper correction, which wouldn’t necessarily be bad for the market in general. The all-time high region has not been broken yet, as the chart shows. This is not unexpected, however, as many retail investors will have the all-time high of 2017 as a marker for potential profit-taking. It’s the final hurdle before Bitcoin goes into price discovery, which would make the next targets difficult to determine.Given that Bitcoin’s price reached the all-time high in a nearly vertical manner, a clear-cut breakout above the all-time high doesn’t seem likely to occur at this point.However, as long as Bitcoin’s price remains in this region, several arguments can be made for a potential correction.Specifically, the volume is dropping severely on the recent attempt to break $20,000 indicating a potential weakening of momentum. Second, the current all-time high tests open the door for a possible bearish divergence on the daily timeframe.This bearish divergence isn’t confirmed yet, but it shows some potential signals of a slight trend reversal. In case of a correction, the key areas to watch for support are $16,000 and $14,000.The current price action is comparable to the price action in the previous cycle. The 2014 peak acted as the final resistance, after which a significant correction of 30% took place.This correction often leads back to the previous resistance, and as the chart shows, this resistance was at $800.The previous high then flipped for support through that correction, which caused the price of Bitcoin to continue rallying to new all-time highs.As markets often act the same way in every cycle, a similar correction of 30% would put the price of Bitcoin at $14,000. Additionally, the previous high in June 2019 is also at $14,000, making it a likely target for a potential support/resistance flip.Such a correction of 30% wouldn’t be unhealthy for the market and is quite common. It may also give latecomers a beautiful entry opportunity to boot.The lower timeframes are indicating a potential reversal is in the making. The range is defined, with the support at the green zone around $18,500. This level has to hold for support to sustain the upward momentum.If it fails to sustain support, the $16,000 area’s retest is very likely. However, if the market wants to maintain bullish momentum, the upper resistance at $19,500 needs to break to warrant further continuation. However, a classic bearish support/resistance flip is occurring here.The $19,400 used to be resistance, after which a fake breakout occurred. Such a failed breakout often is confirmed through the previous resistance becoming resistance again, as the chart shows.Therefore, for further upward momentum, the U.S. dollar has to continue showing weakness, and the price of Bitcoin must break through $19,500. If that doesn’t happen, retests of $18,500 and possibly $16,000 are on the table.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

343,"Bitcoin (BTC) whales appear to be selling to institutions as the supply squeeze tightens below $20,000.Data from various sources shows that while more BTC returned to exchanges this week, large-scale buyers are still creating more demand than supply can meet.Statistics from on-chain analytics service Coin98 confirmed that investment giant Grayscale bought twice as much Bitcoin as miners could create in November.Together with Square and PayPal, the other major corporate actors requiring more and more BTC stocks, Grayscale is creating a supply imbalance to which price gains are the only logical outcome.This scenario set the stage for December with Grayscale continuing its buying of Bitcoin, totaling over 7,000 BTC in just 24 hours as its Bitcoin Assets Under Management now exceed 10.5 billion as of Dec. 4.Simultaneously, this week saw Bitcoin break all-time highs and challenge $20,000, only to encounter massive selling pressure.Having bounced off lows of $18,100 and returned to circle $19,000, BTC/USD looks primed for another test of the seminal level, but selling dynamics remain unusual. With sell walls at $20,000 still firmly in place, longtime hodlers and whales looking to exit have reliable buyers in the form of Grayscale and other institutions.Evidence points to increasing inflows from whales to exchanges this week, something which coincided with the $20,000 attempt. Should selling already be keeping prices down, BTC should thus be finding its way from whales to the stronger hands of Grayscale and its clients.The phenomenon has even caught the attention of mainstream media.“Total accounts buying more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin and then moving it off of exchange has skyrocketed,” CNBC reported on Thursday.At the same time, total Bitcoin addresses in profit versus when coins were placed in them hit new record highs on Friday, according to the latest data from Glassnode.On Wall Street, meanwhile, news on Thursday came that Bitcoin and hundreds of altcoins would compose new cryptocurrency indexes by S&P Dow Jones Indices from January 2021."
344,"Shapeshift CEO Erik Voorhees has drawn a metaphorical line in the financial sand, stating that every asset manager should understand Bitcoin now based on its astonishing rate of return.Voorhees made the comments while retweeting data shared by analytics platform Messari co-founder Dan McArdle that shows Bitcoin has dramatically outperformed everything over the last decade. While gold has returned a 32% profit and the S&P 500 has tripled investors’ money, Bitcoin has posted an incredible 7,837,884% gain in ten years.Looking across its 10-year life, Voorhees believes Bitcoin is “vastly superior to any other investment.” He said that:Voorhees is not the only one discussing the recent embrace of Bitcoin by traditional finance that is believed to underpin the latest rally. This week alone half a dozen figures with expertise in the traditional finance world made similarly bullish observations. On Dec 2. Crypto trading firm Genesis CEO Michael Moro predicted that 250 publicly traded companies will invest in Bitcoin by the end of 2021.On Dec. 4, former JP Morgan commodity trader Danny Masters told CNBC that soon it will be a “career-risk for not having Bitcoin in your portfolio.”Also this week, BlackRock chief investment officer Larry Fink warned that Bitcoin’s success could have a real impact on the U.S. dollar, and will even “take the place of gold to a large extent.” This fits with Gold Bullion International co-founder Dan Tapiero’s recent assertion that it’s only a matter of time before Bitcoin’s price surges into the six-figure threshold.Of course, no matter how many pundits back Bitcoin, or how much money institutions put into it, gold bug Peter Schiff, will remain unmoved:Some have postulated that investors are selling #gold and buying #Bitcoin. Since they have nothing in common, I doubt that's happening. But some speculators may be selling gold stocks and buying GBTC, with gold stocks falling as gold rises, and GBTC trading up to a 25% premium."
345,"The November BTC rally to test all-time price highs saw more than 1% of Bitcoin’s supply move out of long-term storage.According to Unchained Capital’s “hodlwaves” metric, which measures the time since Bitcoin has moved on-chain, roughly 15% of the Bitcoin that had not been moved for between five and seven years as of Nov. 1 was finally transferred on-chain during the month of November.Nearly 1% of the total supply of #bitcoin moved out of long-term storage (>1 year in the same address) during the price run-up from $13,700-$19,670 in November.

61.43% of the supply of bitcoin has not moved in >1 year. #HODLwaves, h/t @glassnode https://t.co/by2nmlXQIJ pic.twitter.com/WPrserjaSNThe share of BTC supply represented by coins that were previously dormant for between two and three years also fell from 12.20% to 11.58% — a relative decline of nearly 5% over November, while coins that had not moved for between one and two years dropped from 17.87% to 17.13% — a relative drop of 4%.However, the number of Bitcoins that has sat still for at least seven years increased slightly over the month.Surprisingly, short-term, on-chain Bitcoin transfers fell during November, with the share of supply that last moved between one day and one week sliding from 3.72% at the start of the month to 2.94% on Nov. 30.November’s largest shift occurred in the one-week to one-month hodlwave, which shows the share of Bitcoin’s supply that last moved between seven and 30 days. It increased from 6.28% to 8.20% during November.Only 38.5% of Bitcoin’s supply has been active on-chain in the past 12 months.Crypto market data aggregator Glassnode released another bullish metric, estimating that nearly 19.6 million Bitcoin addresses were active during November.As such, November saw the second-highest number of active wallets during a single month in Bitcoin’s history, sitting behind only the 21.6 million wallets that were active during December 2017.November comprised the single-largest monthly candle in Bitcoin’s history when measuring from opening price to closing price, with BTC rallying 42% from roughly $13,800 to $19,700."
346,"An unusual interview with Bitcoin SV (BSV) proponent Jimmy Nguyen on Fox Business earlier today appears to have been cut short after Nguyen kept criticizing Bitcoin.Nguyen appeared on the Dec. 3 episode of Fox Business’ Varney and Co. to discuss the increasing interest around Bitcoin, but the interview came to an abrupt end after a total of about two minutes.Introduced as the “Bitcoin Association” founding president, Nguyen repeatedly took shots at Bitcoin in response to questions from host Stuart Varney suggesting that Bitcoin was increasingly being used for payments.There was no mention of Bitcoin SV in either the graphics, the introduction, or the interview itself, leading to speculation the host, or the producers — or both — may have been unaware the “Bitcoin Association President” was actually an advocate for the controversial fork BSV.#Bitcoin should be used for daily transactions, not as reserve asset (which is fueling BTC's recent price rise). This is exactly why we support #SatoshiVision.

Thanks @Varneyco & @FoxBusiness for having me on the show.https://t.co/bUTFu10dopAsked by host Stuart Varney if he thought Bitcoin’s use as a currency was continuing to expand, Nguyen replied, “No, I would disagree with that. I think Bitcoin is very rarely used today to pay for things at merchants.” Nguyen went on to name Bitcoin’s “inability to scale” as the main culprit behind the “$7” transaction fees that prevent it from being used as a currency for everyday transactions.Nguyen also used his brief time on-air to reject Bitcoin’s “store of value” narrative while claiming that it has been “driving up its price recently.” As an example of what is, in his view, an incorrect usage of Bitcoin, he mentioned companies that have famously added large sums of BTC to their holdings in recent months:Bitcoin proponents and BSV critics took to Twitter to remark on some of the oddities surrounding the interview, noting they felt it was strange that Jimmy Nguyen, one of the main faces behind Bitcoin SV, was asked by Fox Business to speak about Bitcoin (BTC).Jimmy Nguyen on Fox Business today.

While the real Bitcoin was discussed & shown, he didn't get a chance to shill his affinity scam token, the host cut him right off! https://t.co/FabSQS2cyv pic.twitter.com/i20pmskyZLAlso noted as curious was the fact that Nguyen did not have the opportunity to mention BSV at all in the short interview, leaving the mention of his position as founding president of the Bitcoin Association without any sort of context to suggest it is a BSV organization. Twitter user Zectro said, ""It's delicious though that he likely went on there with the singular purpose to shill BSV and he couldn't even get that right.""Bitcoin SV’s claim to be the ""real"" Bitcoin, and its use of the Bitcoin Association name — rather than the more correct “Bitcoin SV Association” name — invites comparisons with Roger Ver’s promotion and sales of Bitcoin Cash via the Bitcoin.com website, which has led to potential confusion among newcomers to crypto.Starting late March, Nguyen took an extended hiatus from Twitter, prompting claims that he was intentionally evading a subpoena regarding Satoshi-claimant Craig Wright’s ongoing legal battle with the estate of Dave Kleiman. He returned to the platform in mid June where he remains a staunch supporter and promoter of Bitcoin SV.On Sept. 30, Nguyen wrote a guest article for Cointelegraph expressing his desire to see the world unite behind a single blockchain."
347,"After a rather lengthy wait, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is finally back to the same price range it was in three years ago. Back in 2017, when the Bitcoin price peaked near $19,900, most altcoins also posted 200% or higher weekly gains.Fast forward to the present time, and BTC’s $19,100 price is virtually identical to where it was on Dec. 17, 2017. One might think that not much has changed, despite some altcoins crashing, but that couldn’t be more distant from the truth.A lot has changed in the cryptocurrency sector, and compared to 2017, a significant amount of necessary infrastructure has been built.Today, there are tightly regulated derivatives offered through CME and CBOE futures contracts, and the rapid growth of institutional investors is providing an unending source of demand for Bitcoin.A new host of multi-billion-dollar-market-cap decentralized finance platforms have also emerged. They support a new system of lending, synthetic swaps and interest-earning systems for a whole new set of investors.Compared to 2017, there is a wealth of easily accessible data related to price and market capitalization ranking. This should help investors better understand how today’s market differed from the market in 2017.We can better understand how the cryptocurrency market may look in a couple of years by analyzing the differences.Regarding the ranking of cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, four of the top five remained the same. Oddly enough, Ether (ETH) and XRP’s market cap are relatively the same at $69 billion and $28 billion, respectively. This movement happened despite both cryptocurrencies seeing a 15% price drop since December 2017.This effect is caused by the issuance of new coins. For example, Ether’s coin supply rose from 96.4 million to 113.7 million. The equivalent inflation amounted to 17.9% over three years. For comparison, the total number of Bitcoin in circulation increased by 10.8% in the same period.Apart from Bitcoin, Ether, and XRP, the remaining cryptocurrencies in the top-20 took on heavy losses. IOTA lost 91%, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) 84%, Litecoin (LTC) 73%, and Cardano (ADA) saw a loss of 70%.It is worth noting that out of the current top 15, the only newcomers are Chainlink (LINK), Polkadot (DOT), and Binance Coin (BNB). It should also be noted that Polkadot was not in existence in 2017 or 2018.On the other hand, Ether competitors like Cardano, EOS, NEO, Ethereum Classic (ETC) and QTUM seem to be losing ground. In the past year, they have been replaced with interoperability tokens like Chainlink and Polkadot.The current top three coins, BTC, ETH, and XRP, entice a $448 billion market capitalization, which is a 7% increase over three years. Meanwhile, the remaining 21 leaders currently add up to a $77 billion capitalization, which is a 41% decrease.One would automatically assume that Bitcoin dominance vastly increased in this time, but it rose by only 2% to the current 63%. This effect is only possible by the addition of hundreds of new tokens. The three sectors that stand out are exchange tokens, stablecoins and lastly, the decentralized finance sector.As previously mentioned, neither CBOE nor CME futures existed back in Dec. 2017, let alone with relevant liquidity. The same can be said from institutional investors’ praising and effectively investing in Bitcoin.More recently, even BlackRock CEO Larry Fink seems to be somehow optimistic about Bitcoin becoming an asset class by itself.Derivatives instruments give Bitcoin and Ether an enormous competitive advantage for professional investors’ money. Recent favorable comments from United States CFTC regulator chairman Heath Tarbert left ETH regulated futures launch a step closer.Thus, the odds of BTC and Ether being flipped becomes smaller as time goes by. Besides their dominance in the derivatives markets, the BTC and Ether 97% concentration of Grayscale Investment funds provides some insight into this theory.Trying to predict massive future market shifts is a daunting and usually ineffective strategy. Nevertheless, a few conclusions can be drawn from this comparison.According to the Lindy effect, the life expectancy of some technologies is proportional to their age, and the longer their survival, the longer they can be predicted to exist.If this paradigm is applied to the sector, one might conclude that the longer a cryptocurrency stays in the top 12, the higher the probability it shall remain relevant three years later.For example, the Bitcoin and Ethereum “killer” narrative was incredibly popular in 2017 and 2018 when competitor blockchains were forecast to overtake the sector leaders because of their faster throughput, cheaper fees and enhanced scaling or “real-world use.”Although those narratives may have sounded smart back in 2017, time has proven that the network effect stands. The best technology does not always win.Another unique phenomenon in the crypto sector that investors should watch out for are hard forks and code-base clones. Back in 2017, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold (BTG), Ethereum Classic, and Dash forked or had competitive clones launched. They prospered initially, but reviewing their price and market cap shows that their success was short-lived.The total coin supply and the issuance rate of a cryptocurrency can also impact its price performance. Cryptocurrencies with high issuance might experience difficulty catching up in price. That includes XRP, Chainlink (LINK), Polkadot (DOT), Stellar (XLM), Tron (TRX), and Tezos (XTZ).Even though each of these has plenty of convincing real-world applications and impressive partnerships, their massive coin supply makes sharp, upward price movements difficult.Retail-driven flow will almost certainly push some altcoins higher, except this time around, there are some with real use cases.Judging by the usage increase in 2020, the sectors likely to see increased interest include oracles, interconnectivity, decentralized exchange tokens, non-custodial lending and liquidity provision.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

348,"Since hitting a new all-time high, Bitcoin (BTC) price has been unable to flip the $19,400 level to support. This is likely due to the possibility that whales are selling aggressively in the $19,400 to $19,600 range to prevent the all-time high from being breached. Above the record high, there is little resistance until a new ceiling is achieved.Data from both CryptoQuant and Whalemap show that the $19,500 level is an important area for whales.First, there are large whale clusters at around $19,500. This means that whales bought BTC here and did not move their holdings, which might make it a take profit region.Furthermore, whale inflows to exchanges have been increasing as the price of Bitcoin surpassed $19,500. This shows that whales are strongly selling or shorting $19,500 and beyond.A pseudonymous trader known as “Byzantine General” also emphasized that there are heavy sell orders on Binance. He noted that the $19,500 level would be a difficult resistance area for buyers to break.Binance doing shenanigans again.

19500 will be difficult to breach.$BTC pic.twitter.com/8LAQmAM47PIn the near term, analysts are divided on the short-term outlook of BTC. Some say that a major correction could still come, especially if  BTC continues to reject at the $19,500 level.Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, said he expects BTC to either move sideways or down in the short term. He wrote:Ki pinpointed that Bitcoin whales stopped accumulating Bitcoin at the current price. He explained that it is difficult to segregate institutional bids from spot bids. Still, he said that the timing of the stalling of BTC’s rally and the sell-off from whales match. He added:Bitcoin (BTC) saw the biggest whale inflows since July, according to data from CryptoQuant. The data coincides with BTC’s continuous rejection at $19,400."
349,"Legendary investor Paul Tudor Jones has likened Bitcoin (BTC) to precious metals, and other cryptocurrencies to industrial metals, in terms of use case — a clear indicator of where he thinks the market is headed over the next 20 years. In a Thursday interview with Yahoo Finance’s Julia LaRoche, Jones outlined his vision of the digital currency market over the next several decades.“I’m not an expert on Bitcoin by any stretch,” Jones said, adding:Jones was referring to the notion that Bitcoin’s market capitalization, which is currently at $358 billion, is too small relative to its use case and future value drivers. He continued:Jones expects that everyone, including sovereign nations, will be using “some type of digital currency” over the next 20 years. By that time, the digital currency market will be a lot like the “metals complex” of today, where you have “precious crypto” like Bitcoin assuming the role of gold and transactional cryptos serving the function of industrial metals like copper and aluminum.Jones came out publicly in favor of Bitcoin in May when he described the asset as the “fastest horse in the race” against inflation. Just last week, he introduced a fractal model based on gold’s trajectory in the 1970s to predict an explosive price rally for BTC next year.2020 could go down as the year where institutions permanently altered the trajectory of Bitcoin. Institutional fingerprints are all over the alarming Bitcoin shortage that is driving prices higher, as corporations and large-scale investors scoop up all of the 900 BTC being mined each day.Crypto assets will officially hit Wall Street data feeds in 2021, allowing investors to monitor minute-by-minute price movements. S&P Dow Jones Indices announced Thursday it will soon debut cryptocurrency indexes on more than 550 of the top traded coins."
350,"Google searches for Bitcoin (BTC) appear to be far less popular today than they were when the asset achieved its previous all-time high in December 2017.“2017 was all about hype and first-time users jumping in to try to catch BTC because of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out),” Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky told Cointelegraph. “This time, it is different,” he noted. “The fact almost no one is searching for BTC,” said Mashinsky, referencing data from Google Trends, “tells you everyone already knows what it is and where to buy it (cash app or Paypal).”Bitcoin has gained mainstream adoption in a number of areas this year, including PayPal launching crypto services on its platform, bolstering public awareness of the industry. After multiple years on a range-bound price roller coaster, Mashinsky said crypto began its current macro uptrend around the same time COVID-19 came on the scene — a stance also held by TradingView’s general manager Pierce Crosby.“I started talking about new all-time highs in Feb 2020,” Mashinsky noted, subsequently pointing toward his YouTube interview with Ivan on Tech from April. In the interview, Mashinsky predicted BTC would hit fresh all-time highs before 2021, and he was right.As far as future Bitcoin price action goes, the Celsius CEO seemingly has a more conservative view of Bitcoin's potential than a number of other speculators, some of which project prices of $100,000 or more in the coming year. “We will retest $15-16k before we hit $30k towards the middle or second half of 2021,” he said. “There is still less supply and more demand, so Bitcoin price has more to do with what the economy, COVID-19, and the USD do than what Bitcoin does.”After a brief retrace to $16,200, Bitcoin has once again traveled back up into $19,000 territory."
351,"S&P Dow Jones Indices — a joint venture between S&P Global, the CME Group and News Corp — will debut cryptocurrency indexes in 2021, it has confirmed.In a press release on Thursday, S&P DJI describes Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins as an “emerging asset class.”The firm will partner with Lukka, a U.S. blockchain data provider, to launch the indexes, which will cover a reported 550 cryptocurrencies.""With digital assets such as cryptocurrencies becoming a rapidly emerging asset class, the time is right for independent, reliable and user-friendly benchmarks,” Peter Roffman, global head of innovation and strategy at S&P DJI, state in the press release.The move marks the latest commitment from Wall Street to embrace Bitcoin and other digital currencies, underscoring interest from the institutional sphere.“Our collaboration with S&P DJI is yet another milestone that bridges the gap between the crypto asset ecosystem and traditional financial services,"" Robert Materazzi, CEO of Lukka, added.The release did not state which specific cryptocurrencies will be covered or the methodology behind their selection if it is not based on market capitalization.The move comes as Bitcoin sets new all-time highs on various exchanges and challenges resistance at $20,000."
352,"The demand for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) continues to rise with its premium surpassing 30% on Dec. 3. This indicates that Bitcoin (BTC) is seeing increasing institutional demand as its price consolidates above $19,000.The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is an institutional vehicle that is tradable in the United States through over-the-counter markets. Accredited and institutional investors typically use the trust to obtain exposure to BTC with their brokerage accounts.The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is the go-to institutional vehicle in the U.S. for BTC due to the lack of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).Other markets, like Canada, have a Bitcoin ETF that investors can use to gain exposure to BTC. Without an ETF, institutions in the U.S. turn to alternative vehicles, like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, to invest in BTC.Each share of the trust represents 0.00095346 BTC. Hence, buying one share of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is like buying 0.095% of one Bitcoin.As of Dec. 3, GBTC is trading at $23.39 across retail and spot markets, Bitcoin is trading at around $19,250, which makes 0.095% of 1 BTC worth around $17.33. This means that GBTC is roughly 35% more expensive than buying Bitcoin at the current market price.On Dec. 3, the price of Bitcoin increased from $19,000 to $19,250 after the U.S. market closed. When that difference is deducted, the current premium of GBTC is around 25% to 30%. Notably, this is the highest level since June when the BTC market price was around $9,600 prior to rallying higher.Grayscale itself does not charge the premium, however. The market prices in the premium as it trades in a public market in the United States. When the premium rises, it signifies that more institutions and accredited investors are accumulating BTC via GBTC.Although the current premium is rising, it is still relatively low compared with 2017. This suggests that the rally of Bitcoin still has a lot more room to run. When GBTC's premium increases, it typically signifies a bullish trend and an overall increase in investor appetite for BTC.Consequently, the amount of Bitcoin owned by Grayscale has increased substantially in recent months. Currently, Grayscale owns $10.19 billion in BTC, according to its latest report. What's more, Grayscale bought twice as much Bitcoin than was mined in November..@Grayscale Bitcoin Trust bought near 2 times total #BTC mined during Nov 2020. $BTC #BTC pic.twitter.com/GFJTwPR9MkAtop the continuous increase in demand for Bitcoin on Grayscale, Travis Kling, a fund manager at Ikigai, found similarities between BTC’s past intraday price spikes and the entrance of new institutions.Kling cited a chart that marks when major institutions — such as JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Blackrock and Guggenheim — spoke positively about BTC, which was seemingly followed by more upside for BTC price. On Dec. 1, he said:Unlike previous bull cycles, institutions are now more actively involved in the current Bitcoin rally. The clash between institutions accumulating BTC and whales selling might have furthered fueled the extreme volatility in the market.In the past several days, Bitcoin has been recording wild price swings within a matter of hours after getting rejected by $20,000. This has also led analysts to have mixed opinions on where BTC is heading next, as Cointelegraph previously reported.At the same time, several indicators suggest that Bitcoin may be on the verge of breaking $20,000 sooner rather than later.

353,"The U.K. Tory Party's nemesis, Nigel Farage, has gone “full crypto.” Last Friday, Farage sat down for a video interview to discuss all things crypto with Sam Volkering, editor of Southbank Investment Research — which is, notably, the publisher of Farage's recently launched investor newsletter ""Fortune & Freedom."" In the interview, Farage derided the government's “funny money,” which it continues to print throughout the pandemic at warp speed, and concluded that it's therefore “crucially important” to get one's head around crypto. He has elsewhere called Bitcoin “the ultimate anti-lockdown investment” — pointedly on-brand for his newly launched Reform UK party.Farage and Volkering's video interview is apparently just the first in a series, which will educate viewers about how to buy crypto, store it and keep it safe. Journalists at The Financial Times have apparently long expected the politician's pivot to crypto. “It was only a matter of time,” as Alphaville columnist Jemima Kelly would have it.The evidence for the “inevitable” crypto pivot is hard to quibble with. Farage's Fortune & Freedom pitches itself to an audience that aspires to “grow [its] wealth” in a “New Britain, unleashed after Brexit.” Farage, a former commodities trader, tells his readers that having secured political freedom through Brexit, it's time for them to get their money and their destiny back in their hands.Other newsletters published by Southbank Investment Research include titles such as “Short the World,“ “Crypto Profits Extreme,“ and “Exponential Investor Premium.“ Volkering is a self-described “authority in the new field of digital assets,” having first bought Bitcoin in 2011 and “followed the cryptocurrencies ‘wild west.’” He is also the author of a book called Crypto Revolution: Bitcoin, Cryptocurrencies and The Future of Money, also published by Southbank Investment Research. Kelly scathingly recommends the book as an opportune gift choice for FT readers who may have ended up with a despised colleague for their 2020 office Secret Santa. The FT's unabashed dislike of Farage and his crypto enthusiast colleague aside, some of the influences on Fortune & Freedom appear to be more eclectic than the alleged free-market fundamentalism of the Brexiteers.The close ties between the libertarian movement and the arch-Atlanticists of the Vote Leave campaign have, by now, been well documented. One Whitehall source stated that ""Not even Margaret Thatcher or monetarism at its height had contemplated such shock therapy” as the Brexiteers, with their drive toward a unilateral opening up of the United Kingdom to the U.S. market and a radical economic liberalization of the country.Yet Farage's partner on the newsletter, Nick Hubble, published a piece on Thursday claiming that both ""Keynes and Friedman died of COVID-19"" and advocating the ""radical future"" promised by the proponents of Modern Monetary Theory, or MMT. MMT takes up the argument that states create the demand for their fiat currencies by taxing the population. Money is therefore seen as a unit of account for credit and debt, which can be created and destroyed at will by sovereign states. MMT popularizer Stephanie Kelton writes that the state can “afford to buy whatever is for sale in its own unit of account.” This is a view starkly opposed to many Bitcoiners’ conviction that loose monetary policy represents a putative, inflationary debasement of value.How Hubble will reconcile his apparent embrace of MMT with his previous view that cryptocurrencies ""represent the first reversal of [...] government theft in hundreds of years"" remains to be seen.With the U.K. poised to face its worst shock in 300 years due to the combined impact of the coronavirus and Brexit, it is perhaps the spirit of the monetarists, if not the letter, that will triumph according to Milton Friedman's legendary maxim: ""Only a crisis — actual or perceived — produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around.""Whether it be MMT, the crypto revolution or Farage-Hubble eclecticism, something will present itself as being ready to hand for the select few beneficiaries of Britain's 2020 twofold crisis. It is, after all, the perfect time for someone's preferred alternative to shift from ""politically impossible"" to being ""politically inevitable.” "
354,"An “elegant” Bitcoin (BTC) metric that predicted its run to $12,000 in August has flashed bullish again for the first time since July.As noted by creator Charles Edwards on Dec. 3, the Hash Ribbons indicator is now signaling for buyers to enter the Bitcoin market.Uploading an annotated chart to social media, Edwards, who is also the founder of digital asset manager Capriole, noted similarities between Bitcoin now and before the previous bullish upticks throughout this year.“Look what I found. A blue dot,” he commented, identifying the new entry point.Hash ribbons are based on Bitcoin’s network hash rate behavior and designed to tell investors when price is due to experience upside.In theory, when miners capitulate due to events such as a major price correction, hash rate declines, only to revive thanks to Bitcoin’s automated difficulty readjustments. Hash ribbons demonstrate that around midway through this miner capitulation is an optimal time to take positions.As the saying goes, “Price follows hash rate” in Bitcoin, hash ribbons lend technical proof to the popular mantra.Edwards’ “blue dot” occurs when the 30-day hash rate value crosses the 60-day value, indicating a recovery is underway.“Hash Ribbon is setting up for a buy signal soon,” Rafael Schultze-Kraft, chief technical officer of on-chain analytics resource Glassnode, continued with a further chart.Schultze-Kraft described hash ribbons as “elegant” for the indicator’s reliability. In July, the time of the previous “blue dot” event, Bitcoin took a matter of weeks to post highs not seen in over a year.The signal comes as Bitcoin continues to range below $20,000, having seen considerable volatility while getting rejected at just above all-time highs.Major selling pressure remains, while conversely, successfully overcoming resistance would give Bitcoin a clean sweep to the likely next level of resistance at $22,000, exchange orderbook data shows.At press time, BTC/USD circled $19,300, having been unable thus far to retake $19,500."
355,"As Ripple reportedly prepares to relocate its headquarters outside of the United States, it turns out that only 5% of the company’s clients are based in the country, according to the firm’s CEO.On Dec. 2, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse sat for an interview with CNN anchor Julia Chatterley to discuss Ripple’s regulatory hurdles in operating in the U.S.According to Garlinghouse, as much as 95% of the San Francisco-based company’s customers are located abroad. He claimed that Ripple’s services are not as popular in the U.S. due to the ongoing regulatory uncertainty around its associate token XRP, Garlinghouse said:Garlinghouse noted that the SEC recognized other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) as non-securities years ago. However, XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, still does not have that clarity:According to Garlinghouse, Ripple has had some issues with U.S. customers concerned about the regulatory status of Ripple’s XRP-related offerings.“Oftentimes when I’m speaking to customers, talking to them about our product that uses XRP in the payment flows, they will ask me about regulatory dynamics, and we have had customers saying ‘Look, until there’s clarity and regulatory frameworks, we’re going to hold off,’” the CEO said, adding, “Now that has not been the case because of the clarity and the certainty” in other countries like the U.K.” Previous comments by Garlinghouse would suggest that Ripple is gunning for the SEC to treat XRP much the same as it has Bitcoin or Ether, that is, by not classifying it as as security. Last month, he said, “It’s very hard to look at XRP as a security,” stating that he is “not aware of any market globally that thinks that XRP is a security.”"
356,"Slush Pool, the world’s oldest mining pool, put a Reuters headline about Bitcoin’s 2020 bull run in a block on Dec. 2.“Dollar plummets on U.S. stimulus hopes; Bitcoin hits all-time peak” is now part of Bitcoin block number 659678.Announcing the news on Twitter, Slush Pool said that the pool’s miners wanted to “immortalize” the bullish Bitcoin (BTC) headline from mainstream media, making it live forever on the Bitcoin blockchain.Our miners asked us to immortalize it.

Block 659678: Reuters 01/Dec/2020 Dollar plummets on U.S. stimulus hopes; bitcoin hits all-time peakhttps://t.co/pmzK3HXhpw pic.twitter.com/LKpvlj9TC4Reuters published the article about the weakening U.S. dollar while Bitcoin was hitting all-time highs on Dec. 1. In the piece, columnist Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss noted that the U.S. dollar’s drop coincided with the news of a second COVID-19 relief bill being discussed in the Unite States Congress.Encoding the article in the Bitcoin blockchain seems to be a nod to the genesis block, which contains a 2009 headline from The Times that reads, “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” As Cointelegraph previously reported, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high on some crypto exchanges on Dec. 1, surpassing $19,892.Amid an ongoing rally on crypto markets, mainstream media has significantly increased its focus on the industry and Bitcoin. Peter Schiff, a gold enthusiast and one of the biggest Bitcoin naysayers, has opposed news agencies’ coverage of the current crypto boom. “CNBC’s excessive coverage of Bitcoin sets a new low in financial journalism ethics,” Schiff said in a Dec. 1 tweet."
357,"CoinShares chair and former JP Morgan commodity trader Danny Masters told CNBC that the financial landscape has changed to the point where not having exposure to Bitcoin could be a riskier move for portfolio managers than investing in it. Interviewed on Power Lunch, the head of the digital asset management firm referred to the fact that in the past it was seen as risky for asset managers working in institutions to put money into Bitcoin. But he claimed that the “perceived career-risk for having Bitcoin in your institutional portfolio, as a portfolio manager, is fast migrating into a career-risk for not having Bitcoin in your portfolio, and that’s a really stunning development.”CNBC host Kelly Evans summarized the statement:Masters believes that perceptions of Bitcoin as an extremely volatile asset had subsided because “the volatility of other asset classes has proved to be a lot more volatile than people expected.”He said that Bitcoin has shed its former negative stigma among mainstream investors and that it's no longer a question of if companies will get exposure to the digital asset, but when and how much, citing investments from Square, Microstrategy, and Paypal.These companies “are outperforming the market because they are going public with their exposure to Bitcoin,” and as a result:In October, Masters stated that Bitcoin was increasingly resilient and in a very strong position as its price refused to falter despite news around charges being laid against the founders of major derivatives exchange BitMEX that would have driven a price reduction in the past:The Fear & Greed Index is sitting at 92 out of 100, indicating a sentiment of extreme greed. These levels had not been seen since June 2019 when the index hit 95."
358,"After an impressive run to a new all-time high on Dec.1, Bitcoin (BTC) price appears to have entered a short consolidation phase as the price ranges between $18,200 and $19,500. The 1 and 4-hour charts show the price compressing into a pennant-like structure and break out from the pattern would likely see the price move to the $19,400 level where is a bit more resistance.A breakthrough the pennant would also suggest that the $19,000 level could now function as solid support and if bulls are able to flip the $19,400 to $19,500 zone to support then an attempt at overtaking the new all-time high is expected.As many analysts have pointed out, periods of consolidation and pullbacks to retest underlying support are critically important to sustaining the strength of an uptrend.Furthermore, if Bitcoin is truly is in a bull market, investors will view major and minor pullbacks as purchasing opportunities. Clear evidence of this can be seen in the daily chart which shows traders buying into every significant dip since mid-October.We can also see that the pattern of daily higher lows is intact even after the most recent strong rejections at the $19,000 level.If Bitcoin price fails to push through $19,200 or loses the $19,000 level, the volume profile visible range (VPVR) shows there’s support at $18,650 and below this at $17,800. $17,800 is also aligned with the 20-day moving average, a metric that has been respected since the uptrend first began on Oct. 7 when Bitcoin price traded for $10,600.According to Cointelegraph contributor Micheal van de Poppe:Van de Poppe also suggested that one the weekly timeframe the crucial area to hold is $19,000 and on the daily timeframe. He cautioned that a potential bearish divergence could be hinting that a reversal in the shorter term.In the event that Bitcoin price takes a bearish turn by dropping from the current range and losing the $17,800 support at the 20-MA, a retest of the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at $16,100 is possible.The VPVR on the daily timeframe also shows interest around $15,700, but as mentioned earlier, the price has respected the 20-MA since early October.It's also clear that retail and institutional investors have demonstrated a strong interest in buying significant dips so it seems unlikely that this trend will end even if BTC loses the current range.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

359,"Crypto broker Bitcoin Suisse recently installed a blockchain-related Christmas advertisement in the  Zurich Main train station in Zürich, Switzerland. The ad, which is largely indecipherable to non-native speakers, involves a piece of broccoli, a shoe, and one lone Bitcoin (BTC).The text above the images reads Neujahrsvorsätze, a German word meaning “New Year's resolutions.” Unsatisfied with the printed description for this seemingly non-sequitur string of objects, Cointelegraph reached out to Bitcoin Suisse for further clarification. Marc Baumann, the company's head of marketing and communication, explained:To the left of the broccoli, shoe, and Bitcoin combo sits another ad showing three Christmas trees whose sizes range small, medium, and large from left to right. The star atop each tree appears to be the Ethereum symbol. Above them sits the phrase: Weihnachten mit Bitcoin, which translates to ""Christmas with Bitcoin."" Baumann told Cointelegraph that “The USD value of Bitcoin is growing with each Christmas Eve.”“Next to Zurich Airport and our Bitcoin tram that is driving around in Zurich, we thought we’d bring Bitcoin on the radar again to end on a good note, next to the rising prices and a successful ETH2 launch,” Baumann said.Baumann mentioned several indications of crypto’s growth in 2020, including big player entrances, such as Paul Tudor Jones, and the decentralized finance boom.“Of course, this ad does not reflect the depths of that, but it’s a nice symbol for the growing adoption,” he said. Bitcoin Suisse also has other ads posted around airports, and a tram painted with Bitcoin Suisse' colors and text.Other Bitcoin and crypto advertisements have also surfaced over the years, including televised efforts from Grayscale."
360,"Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high above $19,892 on Dec. 1. This is a significant event because it proves that the rally in 2017 was ahead of fundamentals but not a bubble. Generally, when a bubble bursts, it takes several years for the price to cross the high made during the bubble. For example, the Japanese stock market bubble came after a high was made way back in 1989, and that level has not been conquered yet. Similarly, silver’s high close to $50 per ounce was made in 1980, and the price came close to that level only in 2011. The Nasdaq made its high made during the dot-com bubble in 2000, and this was only crossed in 2015.Now that it has been established that Bitcoin (BTC) was not in a bubble, the next question in the minds of traders is: How high can BTC price go?Several analysts have forecast target levels according to their assumptions and calculations. However, traders should not get carried away with lofty targets because even strong uptrends witness nerve-racking corrections. Traders should aim to trade with the major trend because it generally proves to be profitable.The increasing interest from the institutional investors suggests that the uptrend could still have some steam left. Reports suggest that it took only three investors to raise $150 million in two separate cryptocurrency funds by the New York Digital Investment Group. While the fundamentals look strong, do the technicals also support a further rally?Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high on Dec. 1 and quickly reversed direction, which shows profit-booking at higher levels. However, the long tail on the day’s candlestick shows that the sentiment remains bullish because the bulls purchased the intraday dip.Both moving averages are sloping up, and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive territory suggests that bulls have the upper hand. The buyers will now try to propel the price above the $20,000 psychological resistance.If they succeed, the momentum could pick up and the BTC/USD pair may rally to $22,727 and then to $25,000.However, if the price turns around from the $19,500–$20,000 resistance zone, it will suggest that the bears are aggressively selling at higher levels. In such a case, the pair may consolidate for a few days before attempting to resume the uptrend.The first sign of a break in the bullish momentum will be a slide below the 20-day exponential moving average ($17,723). The advantage will shift in favor of the bears if the pair plummets below $16,191.Ether (ETH) broke above the $622.807 resistance and hit an intraday high of $635.456 on Dec. 1. However, the bulls could not sustain the breakout, and that could have trapped a few aggressive buyers who closed their positions in a hurry.That pulled the price back below $600. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that bulls are in command.However, the inside day Doji candlestick pattern today suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. If the bulls push the price above the overhead resistance zone, the next leg of the uptrend to $800 could be on the cards.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($535), a drop to $488.134 is possible.XRP closed above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.649138 on Nov. 30, but the bulls could not capitalize on this strength. This shows that the bears are selling on rallies.The XRP/USD pair turned down sharply on Dec. 1, but the long tail on the candlestick shows buying at lower levels. When bears sell on rallies and bulls buy on dips, it is an early sign of a range formation.The pair has formed an inside day candlestick pattern today, which suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears about the next directional move.If the bears sink the price below $0.565, a drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.50) is possible. However, if the bulls push the price above $0.68, the pair may rally to $0.780574.Litecoin (LTC) turned down from the $93.9282 resistance on Dec. 1, but the positive sign is that the bulls are buying the dips below $84.3374. This suggests that the sentiment is positive.The rising moving averages and the RSI above 61 suggest that the bulls are in control. If the price sustains above $84.3374, the bulls will make another attempt to clear the overhead resistance.If they succeed, the next leg of the up-move to $100 may begin. Conversely, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, a few more days of range-bound action is possible.A break below the 20-day EMA ($76) will be the first indication that the bears are making a comeback.The bulls could not push Bitcoin Cash (BCH) above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $324.01 on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1. This attracted profit-booking, and the altcoin plunged to the 20-day EMA ($283).The weak rebound off the 20-day EMA suggests a lack of urgency among the bulls to buy at the current levels. If the BCH/USD pair does not pick up momentum, the possibility of a break below the $280 support increases.If the bears sink the price below the 50-day simple moving average, the pair could drop to $246.85 and then to $231. This negative view will be invalidated if the pair picks up momentum and rises above $324.01. If that happens, a rally to $344.98, then to $371.70, will be on the cards.Chainlink's LINK rose above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $14.4433 on Dec. 1, but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. This suggests that bears are selling on minor rallies.However, the failure of the bears to sink and sustain the price below the $13.28 support shows that lower levels are attracting buyers. The flat 20-day EMA ($13.43) and the RSI close to the midpoint suggest a few days of range-bound action.If the bulls push the price above $14.8328, the LINK/USD pair could rise to $16.39. A breakout of this resistance could see the momentum pick up. On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below $13.28, a retest of the 50-day SMA ($12.34) is possible.Polkadot's DOT turned down from $5.5429 on Dec. 1, which shows that the bears are aggressively defending the $5.5899 resistance. However, a minor positive is that the altcoin has bounced off the 20-day EMA ($5.04).The gradually upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI above 57 suggest a minor advantage to the bulls. The buyers will now again try to propel the price above the $5.5899 –$6.0857 resistance zone.If they succeed, the next leg of the uptrend to $6.8619, then to $7.64, may begin. This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA. In such a case, the DOT/USD pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($4.56).The bears are defending the $0.175 level in Cardano's ADA. The failure to rise above this resistance attracted profit-booking on Dec. 1 and pulled the price down to the 20-day EMA ($0.140).The bulls are aggressively buying the dips to the 20-day EMA and are trying to keep the price above $0.155. If they manage to sustain the price above this level, the ADA/USD pair may again reach $0.175.If the price turns down from this resistance, a few days of range-bound action is possible. On the other hand, if the pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the 20-day EMA, the correction could deepen to the 50-day SMA ($0.115).Binance Coin (BNB) turned down from the $32 overhead resistance on Dec. 1 and corrected to the moving averages. This shows that the bears are defending this resistance, as they want to keep the altcoin range-bound between $25.6652 and $32.Although the bulls purchased the dip to the moving averages on Dec. 1, they have not been able to sustain the buying pressure today. This suggests hesitation to buy near the overhead resistance.If the bears sink the price below the moving averages, the BNB/USD pair could drop to $25.6652.The flat moving averages and the RSI above 51 do not indicate a major advantage to either the bulls or the bears. Hence, a few days of range-bound action is possible.Failure of the bulls to push the price above the downtrend line attracted profit-booking in Stellar Lumens (XLM) on Dec. 1. However, the bears are not able to sustain the lower levels, as seen from the long tail on the candlestick.The inside day candlestick pattern today suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears about the next directional move. If the bulls again fail to propel the price above the downtrend line, a deeper correction to the 20-day EMA ($.0.15) is possible.Both moving averages are sloping up, and the RSI is in the positive zone. This suggests that the sentiment is positive and the bulls may buy the dips to the 20-day EMA. A strong rebound off this level could keep the XLM/USD pair range-bound for a few days.A break above the downtrend line will signal strength and could result in a retest of the Nov. 25 high at $0.231655.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

361,"The state of the world economy has pushed institutional investors to look for alternative methods of investment. And more and more often, Bitcoin (BTC) is becoming such a tool.Since August, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy has purchased BTC worth a total of $425 million. At the same time, digital asset manager Grayscale Investments raised record amounts of money in both the first and second quarters of this year ($1.4 billion in total).But should we celebrate institutional investors as the “saviors” of crypto? Or, on the contrary, are they the ones that will lead to the digital asset industry’s downfall?Related: Why institutions suddenly give a damn about BitcoinBefore I answer the above questions, let’s look at the main reason that institutions are eyeing crypto. There is a worldwide crisis when it comes to generating returns from the traditional market’s safe assets. Low-risk instruments, such as savings accounts and high-quality bonds like U.S. Treasurys, have been providing minimal yields in recent years. The returns are so low for these assets that inflation often eats away the profits and leaves investors with a negative return on investment, or ROI.Furthermore, some nations such as Denmark, Switzerland and Japan use negative interest rates to boost the economy. While it’s a good way to fight deflation, negative and low interest rates discourage people from investing in safe assets. However, this doesn’t mean that traditional instruments are failing investors. Instead, we are going through a phase in the world economy’s development where low-risk investments don’t yet provide decent returns to investors.With that said, this will drive interest in cryptocurrencies until the global economy advances to a phase where traditional assets start performing well again. Compared with the general market, the digital asset industry has been developing at a much faster pace, with multiple reasons behind this phenomenon. The regulatory scrutiny surrounding the market is limited, and crypto projects have a different mindset. Also, the current technology level allows and encourages businesses in the space to innovate.As a result, crypto has become a maturing industry that has a history of providing excellent returns to investors. Furthermore, even in the middle of a global economic crisis, Bitcoin’s volatility is at record-low levels. And the less volatile an asset is, the lower the risks are for investors.While the above makes crypto attractive for individuals, the current digital asset market offers institutional investors a way to meet their investors’ ROI expectations. The stakes are high, and they are looking into Bitcoin for a very good reason.People in crypto often think that institutional investors will be the main facilitators of the next Bitcoin boom. However, that’s not exactly the case here. And the opposite — that institutions will corrupt the crypto market with their whale-sized investments — is not true either.Instead of “destroying” the crypto market or launching Bitcoin “to the moon,” institutional investors help the crypto market mature, making it more efficient. For example, when BTC is underpriced, they use this inefficiency to drive it up, and they bring it down when the digital asset is overpriced.Because institutional investors are seasoned investors with vast money-market experience, they follow the above practices to limit their risks and maximize their returns. This dampens the volatility and increases the market’s liquidity. However, factors like Bitcoin’s adoption rate and the current macroeconomic situation have a more substantial impact on the underlying long-term BTC price movement than do institutional investors.On the flip side, a more mature market also means the potential gains from crypto investments will also decrease. But this won’t lead to the digital asset industry’s downfall. Instead, it’s a sign of the natural development that all new markets go through as they enter into the mass adoption phase, which will result in a more mature, more stable, less volatile cryptocurrency sector.Related: Will PayPal’s crypto integration bring crypto to the masses? Experts answerWith that said, taking strong positions in crypto, like what MicroStrategy did recently, provides a buying signal to other institutional investors that will see cryptocurrency as a serious asset class. It’s important to note that MicroStrategy’s case with Bitcoin bears great significance, considering that the firm is a publicly traded company listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange.Therefore, it has strict requirements for financial diligence to its shareholders. By acquiring substantial amounts of BTC, MicroStrategy believes firmly that this move won’t have adverse effects on its share price or corporate social responsibility.If a private business — no matter how large — had taken the same position in crypto, it wouldn’t be a major news story like MicroStrategy’s.In 2017, we didn’t have many institutional investors in the crypto market. With so much fear of missing out, hype and fraud as well as so many cyber threats, speculation was the main force driving the initial-coin-offering craze and extreme bull market.With effective regulation taking place in multiple jurisdictions and institutional investors making the market more effective, crypto is more mature than ever. Fewer risks and good returns make Bitcoin an attractive alternative investment for institutions. And now, they are coming to the industry in great numbers.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

362,"Bitcoin (BTC) may get fresh support for a record-breaking year in 2021 thanks to the demise of a familiar foe: the U.S. dollar.As various sources noted this week, the dollar is trading at almost three-year lows against various currencies and five-year lows against the Swiss franc.Weakness in the dollar tends to translate into strength for Bitcoin, and 2020 has been the year in which the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) has become a reliable yardstick for price direction.An inverse correlation has been palpable throughout 2020, and while Bitcoin’s relationship with DXY has broken down more recently, analysts remained convinced that the fresh lows were only good news for the cryptocurrency.A combination of renewed hopes of global economic recovery and a new coronavirus stimulus package are the latest threats undermining the dollar. DXY hit 91.1 on Tuesday, its lowest since April 2018.“When you get a report that a bipartisan stimulus deal can get done after hopes have been dashed, it’s just another reason to bid risk up and sell the dollar,” John Doyle, vice president of dealing and trading at Tempus, told Reuters.Even Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff — as ever, fully enamored with gold — agreed with hodlers on the dollar’s fate.“The U.S. dollar is now trading at its lowest level against the Swiss franc since Jan. of 2015,” he noted on Wednesday.On the topic of gold, meanwhile, Schiff’s loyalty may soon be rewarded as the precious metal bounces back from its current lackluster performance.Barry Silbert, the founder of cryptocurrency asset management giant Grayscale, confirmed that the firm had brought back its “Bitcoin-not-gold” advertisements this month, a move that signals the market believes that gold has bottomed, one analyst said.“Huge BUY signal for gold traders,” macro investor Dan Tapiero responded to the news."
363,"There is no other way for the cryptocurrency industry to thrive without working hand in hand with regulators, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman believes.On Wednesday, Schulman joined the Web Summit online conference to discuss the cashless era of the global financial industry with Squawk Box host Andrew Ross Sorkin.As part of the discussion, Schulman addressed issues related to cryptocurrency regulation, calling on the industry to closely collaborate with financial authorities to bring more utility to crypto. “There is only one way to approach this, and that is working hand in hand with regulators,” he argued.Schulman went on to say that regulatory compliance is foundational for providing services in the crypto industry:Schulman said that the company invested a “tremendous amount” in regulatory compliance, noting that PayPal became the first firm to get a conditional BitLicense from regulators in New York. “We’re doing this hand in hand with regulators, and it’s the only way to go about doing this,” Schulman argued.“Strong regulatory oversight is extraordinarily important, and I’ve got zero issue with that,” the executive said. Schulman stated that PayPal has strong relationships with regulators because it aims to prevent illicit practices like money laundering while providing some degree of financial health.In October, PayPal officially broke the news on the company’s plans to introduce the ability to buy, hold and sell a number of cryptos including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) directly with the PayPal digital wallet. PayPal subsequently rolled out its crypto service in the United States, allowing clients to trade up to $20,000 per week.Schulman has previously claimed that PayPal’s crypto services will eventually increase the utility of cryptocurrencies.

364,"Bitmain, one of the world’s largest Bitcoin (BTC) miner producers, has reportedly halted its funding for some primary developers maintaining Bitcoin-related software.Jonas Schnelli, a major Bitcoin Core contributor and maintainer, claimed that Bitmain halted its support after funding his efforts for more than three years.In a Dec. 1 tweet, Schnelli said that he lost his sponsorship from Bitmain alongside Joao Barbosa, another Bitcoin Core contributor also known under the “Promag” nickname on GitHub.“Thanks Bitmain for all the help (despite the disagreement we had),” Schnelli tweeted, asking the crypto community to contribute to his further efforts on Bitcoin Core.Bitmain did not respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment as of publishing time.Hex founder Richard Heart subsequently commented that other companies would be willing to fund the Bitcoin Core project as Bitcoin hits new all-time highs.Surely with #Bitcoin making new all time highs, some whale out there would like to fund its development.Some Reddit users also suggested that Bitmain could have found better ways to spend their money than funding the Bitcoin Core project. “I consider it a miracle that they were still being funded by them,” one Redditor noted.Bitcoin Core is a major open-source project maintaining and releasing Bitcoin client software. The project describes itself as a direct descendant of the original Bitcoin software client released by Satoshi Nakamoto after he published the Bitcoin white paper back in 2008."
365,"Blockstream’s Samson Mow wants to move the conversation away from Bitcoin’s (BTC) performance in transactions per second and toward its role in ushering in “a new financial paradigm,” that is, serving as a permissionless medium for the store and transfer of value.#Bitcoin moves nearly half a million dollars in value around the globe permissionlessly every second. It was never about transactions per second and coffee. It's all about value transacted per second and a new financial paradigm. #VTPS not #TPS. Nothing comes close to @BTC. pic.twitter.com/aXfDauPx9bMow’s argument is that “VPTS [value transacted per second] not TPS [transaction per second]” is what really counts. Calculations for the video were reportedly made using on-chain data by the editor of the Blockstream engineering blog, who goes by “Grubles” on Twitter. The editor similarly tweeted that “Bitcoin scales just fine. 1 BTC can store an infinite amount of value.”The video, according to a follow-up tweet from Mow, “was inspired by a stupid XRP marketing video comparing their sh*tcoin’s TPS [transaction per second] to Bitcoin’s.” Blockchain.com data shows that as of Dec. 1, the total estimated value of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain was estimated at $4.627 billion. This figure hit $5.15 billion, close to its all-time-high, on Nov. 5.TPS has long been presented as a purported Achilles heel for Bitcoin, whose capacity maxes out at a lower threshold than competitor coins like Ether (ETH). This is notably the line taken by Bitcoin Cash (BCH) evangelists like Roger Ver, who tout the asset as a better currency for retail adoption in small-scale transactions.Mow’s line on Bitcoin has been consistent, arguing that those who are interested in everyday transactions can use second-layer solutions like the Lightning Network. Bitcoin in itself, he says, has an altogether different purpose:"
366,"New York Digital Investment Group has raised $150 million through two separate cryptocurrency investment funds, according to documents filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on Nov. 24 and Dec. 1.The NYDIG Digital Assets Fund I raised $50 million, while the NYDIG Digital Assets Fund II raised $100 million.Reports suggest that the money raised by Fund I, which invests purely in Bitcoin (BTC), came from just two unnamed investors. Meanwhile, the larger Fund II is reputed to have received its entire $100 million investment from a single investor.The new funds follow a big year for NYDIG, which announced $50 million in equity growth in October through investments from commercial and investment banks, insurance firms and asset managers. New York Digital Investment Group is a subsidiary of Stone Ridge, a $10 billion asset management giant.As Cointelegraph reported, Stone Ridge recently made a Bitcoin investment of its own to the tune of 10,000 BTC. To date, that investment has seen gains of over $75 million.There seems to be a growing trend of large businesses investing in Bitcoin, as business intelligence firm MicroStrategy made a $250 million investment into the number one cryptocurrency back in August. NYDIG CEO Robert Gutmann noticed this trend earlier this year, stating that Bitcoin is transitioning to a “predominantly institutionally-owned asset.” "
367,"Bitcoin (BTC) hitting $300,000 in just one year’s time is “not out of the question,” popular statistician Willy Woo says.In a series of tweets on Dec. 1, Woo stated that he has “never been so bullish” on Bitcoin’s prospects for 2021.Discussing potential price trajectory, he confirmed that he was looking at six figures by December next year.“My Top Model suggesting $200K per BTC by end of 2021 looks conservative, $300K not out of the question,” one post read.Woo used his technical Top Cap metric to deliver the forecast. Despite being what his analytics website Woobull calls “experimental,” Top Cap has accurately matched price tops in the past.Continuing, he eyed the decreasing amount of BTC held on spot exchanges as a sign that bullish price action would be catalyzed in the coming twelve months.“I’ve never been so bullish for 2021,” he wrote.Lastly, the dollar gain in Bitcoin’s market cap for each dollar invested this cycle has outpaced the 2013 and 2017 bull runs.“All pointing to reflexivity increasing; an amplified 2021 bullish feedback loop,” Woo concluded.As Cointelegraph reported, Woo is far from alone in his optimistic outlook for post-2020 Bitcoin.Sky-high price predictions have come thick and fast over the course of the past two months, with quant analyst PlanB’s $100,000 December 2021 estimate now looking decidedly modest.Beyond technical circles, familiar figures such as serial investor Mike Novogratz have begun taking price predictions to the mainstream. In the case of Novogratz, he told actress Maisie Williams last month that BTC/USD would head to $20,000 and then to $65,000. Williams subsequently invested.This week, meanwhile, a giant $590,000 price forecast came courtesy of the Realized Profit/ Loss metric, which has returned to its classic bull run launch position."
368,"The market sentiment around Bitcoin (BTC) is mixed, as the BTC price dropped almost immediately by 10% right after hitting its previous all-time high at $19,892 on Dec. 1.Nevertheless, some analysts and fund managers anticipate the dominant cryptocurrency to rise past $20,000 in the short term. But others are adamant that there will be another correction first, as seen in previous bull cycles.There are many compelling reasons to believe that a deeper Bitcoin correction is coming. In the past, multiple 30% to 40% pullbacks accompanied major uptrends such as in 2017. Thus, the current BTC correction of roughly 10% from the new all-time high is relatively minor by comparison.Meanwhile, Mohit Sorout, the founding partner at Bitazu Capital, argues that Bitcoin could soon enter a bigger, multi-month rally. He emphasized that the medium-term outlook of BTC remains highly positive despite the price failing to break the key psychological $20,000 barrier upon its first attempt.Bitcoin price was rejected right before $20,000 with a strong reaction from sellers across the spot market. As Cointelegraph reported, on-chain analysts attributed the drop to a combination of miners and whales selling.The futures market took a hit as well following the initial spot-driven sell-off. The derivatives market was already overheated before the drop, reaching as high as $23,000 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange alongside a surging BTC futures funding rate and a record-high Fear and Greed Index of 95.Since the market was swayed toward buyers, this meant that if a minor drop occurs, the probability of a larger drop caused by cascading liquidations was high. This resulted in the drop that resulted in BTC bouncing off the $18,000 support area.However, some analysts now expect BTC to break past $20,000 upon the next attempt.Specifically, Sorout pinpointed the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of Bitcoin’s 1-month chart. It shows that in spite of the recent uptrend, the RSI is at 69, which is neutral. An asset becomes overbought if it surpasses 75 on the RSI indicator. He said:Additionally, a pseudonymous cryptocurrency derivatives trader known as “Flood” echoed this sentiment. He said that a strong rally after a fakeout rally to the all-time high is not unlikely. He wrote:Other traders, however, believe that the probability of a correction would continue to increase if Bitcoin consolidates under $19,000.Michaël van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said that weakening momentum increases the likelihood of a pullback.The likelihood of a correction is slowly increasing. $BTCTechnically, an argument could be made that the bull run of BTC is indeed overextended. After the past two minor pullbacks, lower time frame charts, like the four-hour and one-day charts, show Bitcoin treading closely above short-term moving averages, or MAs. This signifies that BTC is not overbought on lower time frames.However, on the weekly and the monthly chart, Bitcoin is still significantly above short-term MAs, which indicates that a large correction could occur.As Cointelegraph reported, some traders have said that a correction to around $13,000 should not come as a surprise for this reason as previous bull cycles have shown. If BTC drops further, the major support areas should be found at $13,000, $13,800 and above $15,000 on the high timeframe charts."
369,"The U.S. Dollar Index fell sharply today, extending a 10-month losing streak that places it at its lowest point since April 2018. International news agency Reuters marked the occasion with a story headlined: “Dollar plummets on U.S. stimulus hopes; Bitcoin hits all-time peak.” The article noted the tumble coincided with today’s news of a second COVID relief bill being discussed in Congress and the recommencement of negotiations between the United States Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The piece contrasted the falling dollar with the rising price of Bitcoin, which  briefly surpassed all-time highs for the second day in a row on Tuesday.I certainly didn’t expect to see a headline like this from mainstream press. pic.twitter.com/istPVkw9Sc“Looks like a headline from 2024,” remarked Erik Voorhees, CEO of ShapeShift and long-time Bitcoin advocate, in a tweet about Reuters’ headline, “but I guess we should assume it won’t be one headline, but many over the coming years.”Some Bitcoiners compared the Reuters headline with that of the famed headline from The Times that is embedded in the Bitcoin genesis block: “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,” noting the significance of the changes between now and then.Historically speaking, Reuters isn’t known for its positive coverage of Bitcoin, but this may be changing. Last week, the news agency published a story examining the likelihood of a $100,000 price target for Bitcoin by the end of 2021, and the week before came a story about how this year’s “bubble” is different to 2017’s.The U.S. Dollar Index is a measure of the value of USD relative to a basket of other currencies: the euro, Japanese yen, pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.Starting at a relative value of 100 in 1973, the index reached an all-time high of 151 in October 1984 and an all-time low of 71.8 in April 2008. It currently sits at 91.1 — a low not witnessed for more than two and a half years.The USD has also fallen relative to a number of other currencies and heavily traded assets over the years, including many commodities and stocks. The devaluation of the dollar via inflation was sped up this year by the U.S. government’s attempts to provide COVID-19 relief in the form of economic stimulus, which, according to experts, is helping to drive the price of BTC to all-time highs."
370,"The cryptocurrency space has undergone a number of bull and bear markets since its inception in 2009. The crypto bull run in 2017 was one of the biggest years for the industry, hosting soaring digital asset prices and growth.Blockchain markets look much different today than they did three years ago, however, based on regulation, adoption, and other factors. How will crypto’s current macro uptrend differ from 2017? Asset dispersion is a key differentiator, according to Pierce Crosby, general manager of asset charting platform TradingView. “The key here is to be looking at the distribution of accounts, i.e. the total number of accounts holding a given crypto asset,” Crosby told Cointelegraph, adding:Coinbase currently boasts over 35 million users on its platform, up from 11.7 million in October 2017, according to numbers from CNBC reporting. “Additionally, I think people should consider the institutional ownership percentage, which is typically a strong ‘support’ factor for price,” Crosby said. Crypto now garners greater interest from large mainstream players. Jack Dorsey’s Square and business intelligence outfit Microstrategy are just two examples of fresh Bitcoin buying power stepping up to the plate in 2020.Crosby noted technology as another differentiator between the current bull market and 2017. “There are now thousands of applications built on top of one of the various blockchains in the ecosystem, these also play a key role in stabilizing price drips,” he said. The decentralized finance boom this year serves as one such example of advancement.Bitcoin recently broke its all-time price high, shooting past its previous record of $19,892, set in 2017.Bitcoin has largely shown price strength in 2020, although COVID-19 concerns sent the asset tumbling down to $3,600 in March. Since then, Bitcoin and the overall crypto market have trended upward amid a year which has also hosted a United States presidential election.“Generally, we see a shift in sentiment and focus during the last year of the current US administration,” Crosby explained. “Things kicked into high gear once the pandemic hit, both as a result of the downturn in Bitcoin's price, but also due to the increase in an overly dovish monetary policy across the globe.”The U.S. has printed massive amounts of dollars in 2020 while also keeping interest rates low."
371,"Mike Novogratz, CEO of financial services firm Galaxy Digital, recently expressed his usual bullish Bitcoin sentiments on CNBC’s Squawk Box morning show. During the short segment, the show’s interviewer asked Novogratz about Bitcoin (BTC) in relation to gold. He noted that big players are seemingly buying crypto after selling their gold investments, with gold recently seeing an all-time high level of outflow.“I think it’s meaningful but it’s not the real story,” Novogratz said on Tuesday morning. “The real story is adoption of Bitcoin, adoption of crypto, across a vast variety of accounts,” he noted, going on to mention Guggenheim's recent interest in picking up $500 million of Grayscale’s GBTC asset.""It's just a litany of institutional investors that are changing their mind, or realizing that now is the time, there's enough liquidity for Bitcoin to be part of it,"" said Novogratz, referencing the mainstream players who have invested in Bitcoin in 2020, including billionaire hedge funder Paul Tudor Jones and Microstrategy, a business intelligence firm.“If Bitcoin was easy to buy, the price would have been a lot higher,” Novogratz explained. “Grayscale Trust was a very interesting way for people to get an ETF-like exposure.”In contrast, gold enthusiast and known Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff remains opposed to the digital asset. “CNBC’s excessive coverage of #Bitcoin sets a new low in financial journalism ethics,” Schiff tweeted on Tuesday. “Their constant promotion has legitimized the asset in the eyes of their audience, many of whom will buy and then be left holding the bag when the whales dump what @CNBC helped pump.”Schiff's tweet calls out CNBC's coverage in general. While he did not mention the segment directly, the timing of his comment seemingly lines up with the morning's Squawk Box segment, coming shortly after Novogratz joined the show.“Bitcoin pumpers assured HODLers that once #Bitcoin made a new high, momentum investors would rush in to buy,” Schiff tweeted on Tuesday.Bitcoin broke its all-time price high of $19,892 early Tuesday morning, briefly hitting approximately $19,915 on Coinbase before dumping more than $1,500."
372,"Digital asset manager Grayscale is bringing back its controversial ""drop gold"" campaign just in time for the potential Bitcoin (BTC) bull market. CEO Barry Silbert tweeted Tuesday that the 30-second advertisement will be “running on major networks all over the country.”The commercial implores investors to “leave the pack behind” by dropping gold and adding digital assets like Bitcoin to their portfolio.“In a digital world, gold shouldn’t weigh down your portfolio,” the commercial says, adding:Grayscale launched its #dropgold campaign in May 2019 when Bitcoin was trading at roughly $5,400. At the time, few institutional investors had come out publicly in favor of digital assets. Times have certainly changed.Since that time, institutions like JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and Guggenheim have expressed varying degrees of interest in cryptocurrencies.JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank have reportedly stated that institutional investors are shifting some of their allocations away from gold and into Bitcoin.In the case of Citigroup, managing director Tom Fitzpatrick has seemingly forecast a $318,000 BTC price in the next 12 months.Meanwhile, Guggenheim has filed an amendment with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to allocate $500 million to Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.As Cointelegraph Magazine reported in August 2020, Grayscale’s #dropgold campaign could introduce millions of people to Bitcoin, much in the same way that Merrill Lynch’s 1948 New York Times ad introduced boomers to stocks. Gold is coming off its worst month since 2016, all while Bitcoin recorded its highest monthly close on record. Currently, 1 Bitcoin buys you 10.539 ounces of gold, the highest in almost three years."
373,"The price of Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, plunged harder than Bitcoin (BTC) in the recent pullback. After reaching an all-time high on Coinbase, the price of Bitcoin fell steeply by over 9% within several hours. In the same period, Ether corrected by over 11%, following a marketwide pullback.The deep correction in Ether comes as a surprise because of the Ethereum 2.0 network upgrade launch. On Dec. 1, the Eth2 Beacon Chain released on the mainnet, marking an important milestone for Ethereum.Eth2 is a key network upgrade for the Ethereum blockchain that improves its scalability and transaction capacity. Prior to the upgrade, the network was able to process around 15 transactions per second.After the upgrade, Ethereum will be able to scale to thousands of transactions per second, potentially more with sharding over the long term.This is a fundamentally optimistic upgrade for the Ethereum network because it will allow decentralized applications to operate without the barriers of scalability. It would also allow new decentralized finance cycles to become more sustainable, easing user experience.Ether's correction after the Eth2 upgrade could have been expected due to the tendency of the market to buy rumors and sell the news. For instance, when the Eth2 upgrade was confirmed in late November, Ether price similarly dropped from around $620.Still, the 11% decline in the price of Ether within just two hours has caught many traders off guard. The significance of the Eth2 upgrade and the implications it carries likely led the market to expect more short-term resilience from Ether.Industry executives have also been highly optimistic about the medium- to long-term growth trajectory of Ethereum after the Beacon Chain release. This likely added to the overall positive market sentiment around ETH.Joseph Lubin, co-creator of Ethereum and founder of ConsenSys, described Eth2 and proof-of-stake as a monumental upgrade. He said:Traders are anticipating a deeper pullback in the near term, or at least some consolidation. The futures market took a large hit when BTC abruptly dropped, causing havoc across the derivatives market.A pseudonymous trader known as “TraderKoz” said that Ether would become compelling once it consolidates above $620 again. The $561 level remains a key support level for ETH in the near term if the pullback continues. The trader said:"
374,"Bitcoin (BTC) finally managed to secure a new all-time high, but the digital asset rejected strongly near $20,000. On-chain analysts say a sell-off from whales and miners, combined with the $20,000 level acting as a resistance level caused a fierce drop.For whales and high-net-worth investors, liquidity is the most important factor. Because they deal with large orders, they need to calculate the slippage their sell orders will cause.Typically, the best period for whales to sell is when there is peak euphoria in the market met with large buyer demand. This allows whales to more efficiently sell their holdings without causing massive volatility.When the price of Bitcoin officially surpassed its all-time high on Coinbase, it caused the market sentiment to become highly bullish. Shortly thereafter, whales started to sell, causing large liquidations across major exchanges.CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju explained that whale withdrawals were slowing down on Nov. 30. He said:The confluence of whales keeping BTC on exchanges, which means higher selling pressure, and the sell-off from miners amplified BTC’s downturn.Ki also noted that whales began to deposit Bitcoin into exchanges once again, which happens when whales want to sell their holdings.Whales are depositing $BTC
+ Miners are selling $BTC
+ No exchange withdrawals from whales
+ $20K rejection
= Huge pullback ($19.9k -> $18k) https://t.co/F1n7ypl4kT pic.twitter.com/NnJJxzIcAVThe price of BTC recovered swiftly after dropping to around $18,200, surging back above $19,400 within hours.The speedy recovery likely occurred due to the nature of the drop. As the price declined, exchanges saw cascading long liquidations. As such, BTC likely dropped harder than it should have if it weren’t for the large liquidations.The recovery was equally intense to the upside for that reason. Late short-sellers could have gotten aggressive as BTC dropped, leading to a short-term short squeeze.In the near term, Bitcoin could see two major scenarios. First, it could consolidate above $19,000, which would allow the derivatives market to find composure and the open interest to rebuild.Second, BTC could continue to drop as traders anticipate a blow-off top after achieving an all-time high.But the macro outlook on Bitcoin still remains highly optimistic. Scott Melker, a cryptocurrency trader, emphasized that the monthly candle for November closed at BTC’s all-time high, which paints a positive long-term picture for BTC. He said:In the near term, the key support levels for Bitcoin are $18,200, $17,700 and $16,200. There are still large whale clusters in these areas, which could cause a reaction from buyers."
375,"Bitcoin (BTC) continued an intense day of volatility on Dec. 1, hitting lows of $18,400 just over an hour after challenging $20,000 and breaking a new all-time high.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView tracked BTC/USD as it delivered some of its most unpredictable moves in history.At press time, the pair was moving in a range roughly bordered by $18,500 and $19,000, with conditions changing by the minute.Just an hour previously, an attempt to crack $20,000 resulted in a firm rejection along with a $1,000 dive to $19,000 in under ten minutes.The move mimics Bitcoin's behavior from last week, during which an initial attempt to break $19,500 also sparked major problems.furtherAs reported on Monday, traders will now likely be watching the newly established BTC futures gap, between $16,900 and $18,300, which may get ""filled"" if the price corrects further. Meanwhile, volatility spilled over to altcoins, with Ether (ETH) abruptly losing $600 to trade closer to $575 at press time, thus reversing the previous day’s gains.The performance puts a dampener on the launch of Ethereum 2.0, Ether’s parent network’s long-awaited protocol upgrade."
376,"Bitcoin (BTC) futures hit $20,000 on Dec. 1 as all-time highs finally began to convert into a new price era for BTC/USD.Data from TradingView showed Chicago Mercantile Exchange Bitcoin futures heading past the historic $20,000 mark during Tuesday trading.At press time, CME BTC futures' highs of $20,300 had appeared amid characteristic volatility, which saw BTC/USD crash to $19,000 in under ten minutes.“Worth noting that a $1,000 swing is just 5% now. Adjust accordingly,” popular pseudonymous trader CryptoBull tweeted in response to the flash crash. The move is nonetheless a momentous occasion for Bitcoin, which today has officially broken above its all-time high of $19,892 established nearly three years ago. With futures normally a modest percentage higher than the spot price, CME and other operators’ order books were already primed to head into uncharted territory first. CME in fact passed $20,000 when it launched at around $20,700 in December 2017, with the market still waiting for new all-time highs on Tuesday.As Cointelegraph reported, record volume and open interest had already buoyed analysts keen to see the extent of institutional interest in Bitcoin as 2020 draws to a close.This year has differentiated Bitcoin from 2017 when a previous attempt to crack $20,000 on spot markets coincided with the first futures markets going live.Thanks to this weekend’s volatility, a giant $1,300 “gap” in futures markets remained open as the new highs hit, this traditionally suggesting that BTC/USD will fall to “fill” it in. In this case, such a pullback could take the pair as low as $16,900."
377,"Bitcoin price officially reached a new all-time high above $19,892 on Dec. 1 after nearly three years, according to data from Coinbase and Tradingview.Despite the Thanksgiving crash last week, Bitcoin (BTC) price managed to rebound throughout the weekend. BTC then easily passed the $19,000 mark on Monday to reach its all-time high, albeit on a couple of exchanges.There are three key trends that fueled BTC's rise from sub-$3,600 in March to over $19,892. These include the rise in institutional demand, lower selling pressure and the resilience of BTC throughout 2020.Most on-chain data points show that the demand for Bitcoin from institutions has been rapidly increasing.In November, Grayscale recorded all-time high net inflows, and the CME Bitcoin futures market saw its open interest climb near $1 billion.Grayscale, in particular, said that more institutions invested in cryptocurrencies during the third quarter of 2020 than ever before.The figures Grayscale sees are important to gauge the institutional interest in Bitcoin because the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is typically the first point of entry for most institutions to gain exposure to BTC.In the United States, there is no exchange-traded fund (ETF) for Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. Hence, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is the closest investment vehicle to an ETF in the U.S. market. The Grayscale report reads:As Cointelegraph reported in August, MicroStrategy purchased $450 million worth of BTC, adopting Bitcoin as its primary treasury asset. This was likely the spark that triggered the current wave of institutional demand for the digital store of value.This was accompanied throughout the summer by high-profile allocations to Bitcoin from the likes of Square, Paul Tudor Jones, and later, Stanley Druckenmiller, which only further fueled the positive market sentiment.I call this chart ""The Traditional Onslaught"".

We've been talking about ""The Herd"" for 3+ years. The Herd requires career risk cover. This is that.

They are by definition not early adopters, but their pockets are deep & their capital is sticky. #Bitcoin is just getting started. pic.twitter.com/jC7uVBXxxWIn November, Druckenmiller explained that Bitcoin is likely here to stay, as it has significantly outperformed gold in 2020, saying:Six months after the halving, November also saw low selling pressure from whales, according to on-chain data. In other words, the amount of Bitcoin being sent to exchanges from high-net-worth investors consistently decreased throughout the month.CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju pinpointed the Exchange Whale Ratio as an indicator of long-term bullish market sentiment. He said:The low selling pressure on BTC helped sustain its rally throughout the month, eventually allowing the dominant cryptocurrency to reach a record high.On June 13, JPMorgan Chase said in a note that Bitcoin’s recovery from the March crash showed it had staying power. The recognition of Bitcoin’s resilience by the largest investment bank in the U.S. likely acted as a major confidence boost, especially for institutional investors.Ultimately, the impressive performance over the past decade and Bitcoin's strong momentum since dropping below $3,600 across major exchanges in March demonstrated BTC’s resilience and long-term potential as a digital store of value."
378,"The South Korean government has officially postponed a new tax regime on cryptocurrency gains until 2022.According to Yonhap on Dec. 1, the planning and finance committee of South Korea’s national assembly passed amendments to the country’s tax laws wherein a new cryptocurrency tax regime will come into effect in January 2022.On Nov. 25, the legislature suggested delaying the adoption of a cryptocurrency income tax rule to Jan. 1, 2022 instead of October 2021.The decision will provide local crypto businesses with more time to adapt to new tax laws. The newly passed amendments stipulate that investors in South Korea pay a 20% tax rate on crypto trading gains above 2.5 million won ($2,260) per year. Korean authorities first finalized the tax rate in July 2020.The postponement of a new crypto tax in South Korea comes in response to the efforts of local cryptocurrency advocates. In October, the Korea Blockchain Association requested the government to delay the implementation of its new tax framework until 2023. The association did not explicitly state it was against the 20% tax rate, but said that local crypto companies need a reasonable period of time to prepare for laws."
379,"The current Bitcoin (BTC) bull run could send BTC/USD as high as $590,000, one indicator forecast this week.Curated by on-chain analytics resource Glassnode, the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) index has reached a level that has historically launched the Bitcoin price an order of magnitude higher.The latest bull signal was noticed and uploaded to social media by the company’s chief technical offier, Rafael Schultze-Kraft, on Nov. 30. At the time, BTC/USD was already making new all-time highs on several exchanges.NUPL currently resides at 0.62. Previously, reaching this level has begun an uptrend that only reversed once Bitcoin hit a new price range.In 2011, the price expanded by a record 3,000% after the NUPL event, while in early 2013 it expanded 800% and another 600% later that year. In 2017, the year which delivered Bitcoin’s previous all-time high, there were 1,200% gains.NUPL measures the proportion of coins in the network that are in profit versus those that are not. Built around a neutral zero value, the closer the index gets away from it, the more the network is in profit. Negative readings likewise signify majority losses.“NUPL is at 0.62 and predicts tops at 0.8+,” Schulze-Kraft explained alongside an annotated chart.A 0.8 reading or higher this time around thus opens the door to BTC/USD topping out at anywhere between $133,000 and $590,000.“Just getting started,” he concluded.Monday’s action meanwhile boosted an already confident analyst who had long said that this year’s performance would be “like clockwork.”“PlanB,” the pseudonymous creator of the stock-to-flow-based family of Bitcoin price models, said on Dec. 1 that all was still going to plan after the most recent halving event in May.“My fellow Bitcoiners, the bull market is upon us,” he declared, producing the latest version of his Stock-to-Flow Cross-Asset (S2FX) chart showing BTC/USD posting its highest-ever monthly close.Like Schulze-Kraft, PlanB believes that recent gains mark just the start of Bitcoin’s next phase, a theory which would see Bitcoin simply follow its historical behavior.“Like clockwork November red dot closed above all other red dots .. at $19,700 .. a new Bitcoin ATH. This is just the beginning. We will see volatility (e.g. -35%), but also new ATHs. Enjoy the ride!” he added."
380,"Ethereum 2.0 genesis stakers have pushed the total number of Ethereum nodes past the number of Bitcoin nodes for the second time this year.According to Ethernodes.org, 11,259 Ethereum nodes are currently active, giving it a roughly 1% lead over Bitcoin’s 11,136. Ethereum’s node count last surpassed Bitcoin’s in early September.The number of Ethereum nodes has increased by more than 50% in the past two weeks or so, spiking from 8,086 on Nov. 15, just 11 days after the Eth2 deposit contract went live. Ethereum’s node count overtook Bitcoin’s on Nov. 30.According to Blockchain Center’s “Flippening” index, which seeks to track the strength of Ethereum’s network relative to Bitcoin, the surge in node counts has seen the index gain from 50.5% to 62.4% over the course of November.According to the index, node count is the third major on-chain metric on which Ethereum has currently “flipped” Bitcoin, alongside transaction count and transaction fees.Etherscan estimates that Ethereum processed nearly 1.2 million transactions in the past 24 hours, compared to Bitcoin’s 300,000. Ethereum also processed $3.6 million worth of transaction fees in the last 24 hours, while Bitcoin fees were worth close to $1.4 million.The Flippening Index estimates that Ethereum posted a two-year high of 67.68% for strength relative to Bitcoin in early September due to the third-quarter DeFi boom.Eth2’s beacon chain genesis kicks off in just a few hours from now. The launch of the deposit contract allowed ETH holders to designate their Ether (ETH) for staking, with the 524,288 Ether required to initiate the beacon chain’s launch being surpassed just hours before its deadline on Nov. 24.According to Beaconcha.in, 878,808 Ether have now been sent to the deposit contract. The beacon chain’s genesis will lay the groundwork for sharding and proof-of-stake."
381,"Local sources report that authorities from the city of Baoshan in the Chinese province of Yunnan are escalating efforts to crack down on Bitcoin miners, ordering electricity producers to cease supplying power to the city’s miners.On Nov. 30, Chinese crypto reporter Colin Wu tweeted that several miners had informed him of the ban, sharing what appear to be scanned copies of official documents issued to power producers:Several miners told Wu that Baoshan, Yunnan, where China’s crypto mines are located, received a ban on November 30, requiring the power station to stop supplying power to the miners. Yunnan is the third largest mining place in China after Sichuan and Xinjiang. pic.twitter.com/1zAhcTLmXiHowever, Wu added that the ban was probably informed by localized “economic interests,” and probably is not indicative of a desire to quash crypto mining on the part of Beijing: The ban appears to have coincided with a 24-hour drop in global hash rate of roughly 10% from 140 exahashes per second to 125 EX/s, though correlation is far from causation.According to Cambridge University’s Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, Yunnan was China’s fourth-largest region by mining hash rate, behind Xinjian, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia as of April 2020. Yunnan then represented 5.42% of global hash rate — ranking it above all countries except for China, the United States, Russia and Kazakhstan.In June, Wu reported that Yunnan’s government had ordered 64 unauthorized mining operations to shut down, including seven that were still under construction. The government cited tax evasion and security risks including how the mines were wired to local hydropower stations.During that same month, a local Bitcoin mine caught on fire, resulting in the incineration of thousands of units.The mid-year crackdown also followed a May 29 explosion at a hydropower station in Yunnan that killed six people and injured five. The explosion was believed to have prompted greater enforcement of safety standards concerning hydropower plants in the region.In April, Yunnan’s state grid also issued a document warning electricity producers against the unauthorized diversion of power to Bitcoin mines."
382,"Most investors that follow Bitcoin will have recently heard about the growing impact Bitcoin (BTC) futures and options markets have on the Bitcoin price. The same can be said for the price swings caused by liquidations at OKEx and Huobi exchanges.Considering that derivatives markets are now playing a much bigger role in Bitcoin price fluctuations, it is becoming increasingly necessary to review some of the key metrics professional traders use to gauge activity in the markets.While reviewing futures and options contracts can be quite complicated, the average retail trader can still benefit from knowing how to properly interpret the futures premium, funding rate, options skew and put-call ratio.The futures premium measures how expensive longer-term futures contracts are to the current spot at traditional markets. It can be thought of as a relative reflection of investor optimism, and fixed-calendar futures tend to trade at a slight premium to regular spot exchanges.The two-month futures should trade with a 0.8% to 2.3% premium in healthy markets, and any number above this range denotes extreme optimism. Meanwhile, the lack of a futures premium indicates bearishness.The past week was a roller coaster and the indicator reached 2% on Nov. 24 while Bitcoin price peaked at $19,434.Even though the premium currently sits at 1.1%, what is more significant is that despite a 14% price drop, the indicator held above 0.8%. Generally, investors view this level as bullish, and today we can see that Bitcoin price secured a new high above $19,900.Perpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate usually charged every eight hours. Funding rates ensure there are no exchange risk imbalances. Even though both buyers and sellers open interest is matched at all times, leverage can vary.When buyers (longs) are the ones demanding more leverage, the funding rate goes positive. Therefore, those buyers will be the ones paying up the fees. This issue holds especially true under bull run periods, when usually there is more demand for longs.Sustainable rates above 2% per week translate to extreme optimism. This level is acceptable during market rallies but problematic if BTC price is sideways or in a downtrend.In situations like these, high leverage from buyers presents the potential of large liquidations during surprise price drops.Take notice how, despite the recent bull run, the weekly funding rate has managed to remain below 2%. This data indicates that although traders feel optimistic, buyers were not overleveraged. Similarly, during the $1,400 price drop on Nov. 26, the indicator held a healthy neutral level.Unlike futures contracts, options are divided into two segments. Call (buy) options allow the buyer to acquire BTC at a fixed price on the expiry date. On the other hand, the seller of the instrument will be obliged to make the BTC sale.The 25% delta skew compares side-by-side equivalent call (buy) and put (sell) options. If the protection for price upswings using call options is more costly, the skew indicator shifts to the negative range. The opposite holds when investors are bearish, causing put options to trade at a premium and skew indicators to shift positively.Oscillations between -15% (slightly bullish) to +15% (somewhat bearish) are typical and expected. It’s very unusual for any market to remain flat or near zero most of the time.Thus, traders should monitor more extreme situations as they may indicate that market makers are unwilling to take risks on either side.The above chart shows that since Nov. 5, option traders are unwilling to take positions exposing themselves against an upside. Therefore, traders will deem this a very bullish situation.By measuring whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options, one can gauge the overall market sentiment. Generally speaking, call options are used for bullish strategies, whereas put options are used for bearish ones.A 0.70 put-to-call ratio indicates that put options open interest lag the more bullish calls by 30% and is therefore bullish.In contrast, a 1.20 indicator favors put options by 20%, which can be deemed bearish. One thing to note is that the indicator aggregates the entire BTC options market, including all calendar months.In situations such as the one currently seen in the market, it’s only natural for investors to seek downside protection as BTC surpasses $19,000 even though the put/call ratio has been way below its 6-month average of 0.90. The current 0.64 level shows that there is a lack of pessimism from professional traders.Overall these four key indicators have held steady, especially considering the market just suffered a somewhat traumatic pullback as BTC price dropped to retest $16,200.With the price back above $19,500 again, nearly every investor wants to know if Bitcoin has enough strength to break its all-time high this week.From a derivatives trading perspective, nothing is holding it back.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

383,"Bitcoin (BTC) price came within striking distance of hitting a new all-time high today. This shows that institutional and retail investors continue to buy on every dip and BTC is in a strong uptrend. Hence, traders should not urgently looking to call a top.While Bitcoin has been creating new records, gold has corrected about 15% from its all-time high. This shows that traders are dumping their positions and this led to the largest weekly outflow in gold.Analysts believe that some of the money flowing out of gold could enter Bitcoin as institutional interest continues to soar. A new high could also attract momentum traders who like to piggyback on a strong trend.Traders are now wondering if Bitcoin's momentum will pull the whole crypto sector higher or if it will continue to hog the limelight at the expense of the altcoins?Let’s analyze the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Corrections in a strong uptrend usually last for one to three days and that is what happened with Bitcoin price. The pullback from the intraday high of $19,459.22 on Nov. 25 bottomed out at $16,191.02 on Nov. 26.A shallow correction is generally a sign of strength. It shows that existing owners of the BTC/USD pair are in no hurry to book profits while traders who want to buy are not waiting for lower levels to enter.The upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index near the overbought zone suggest that bulls are in command. The momentum picked up today and the bulls pushed the price above $19,459.22.But the bears have not yet given up. They are trying to mount a stiff resistance in the $19,500 to $20,000 zone. If the price turns down sharply from this resistance, a drop to $17,200 is possible.On the other hand, if the bulls can push the price above $20,000, the momentum could pick up further and a rally to $22,727 and then to $25,000 will be on the cards.Ether’s (ETH) strong rebound off the $488.134 support shows that the bulls are buying aggressively as they expect the next leg of the uptrend to resume.If the bulls can push the price above $625, the ETH/USD pair could start its journey towards the next major resistance at $800. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest that bulls are in command.Contrary to this assumption, if the price again turns down from $625, the pair may consolidate for a few days before resuming its up-move. A break below the 20-day exponential moving average ($523) will be the first sign of weakness.The pullback in XRP had been facing resistance at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.649138 for the past two days. Today, the bulls pushed the price above the resistance but failed to sustain the higher levels.However, the upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought territory suggest that bulls have the upper hand. If they can push the price above $0.649138, the XRP/USD pair could rally to $0.706942 and then to $0.780574.This bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from either overhead resistance and plummets below the 20-day EMA ($0.47).Bitcoin Cash (BCH) rose above $280 on Nov. 29 and has picked up momentum today. However, the relief rally could face resistance at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $324.01.If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, it will suggest that the bulls who are stuck at higher levels are bailing out of their positions. The bears will then try to sink the price to $280.Contrary to this negative assumption, if the bulls can push the price above $324.01, the BCH/USD pair could move up to $344.98 and then to $371.70. The gradually rising moving averages and the RSI above 58 suggest that bulls have a minor advantage.Chainlink (LINK) bounced off the 50-day simple moving average ($12.25) on Nov. 26 and 27 and the bulls have pushed the price back above the overhead resistance at $13.28. The recovery is currently facing resistance at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $14.4433.The flattish 20-day EMA ($13.40) and the RSI just above the midpoint does not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.If the bears sink the price back below $13.28, it will suggest that sentiment has turned bearish and the traders are selling on rallies. A break and close below the 50-day SMA could start a deeper correction.On the contrary, if the bulls push the price above $14.4433, the LINK/USD pair could rally to $15.2994 and then to $16.39. A break above this resistance could resume the uptrend.Litecoin (LTC) found support near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $64.8317 on Nov. 26 and 27. The rebound since then has been sharp but the bulls are currently facing resistance at $88.However, the upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls have the upper hand. If they can push the price above $88, a retest of $93.9282 will be on the cards. Above this level, the rally could extend to $100.On the other hand, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the LTC/USD pair could remain range-bound for a few days. The pair will turn negative if the bears sink the price below $64.Cardano (ADA) surged back above the overhead resistance at $0.155 on Nov. 28, which shows aggressive buying at lower levels. However, the bulls are struggling to sustain the price above $0.17 for the past two days.This shows that the bears are defending the zone between $0.17 and $0.1826315. If the bears can sink the price below $0.155, a drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.137) is possible.However, if the bulls buy the dips to $0.155, it will suggest accumulation at this level. A consolidation near the overhead resistance is a positive sign as it shows that traders are not closing their positions in a hurry and are not waiting for deep corrections to buy.If the bulls can propel the price above $0.1826315, the ADA/USD pair may start its journey to $0.2129 and then to $0.235.Polkadot (DOT) bounced off the 50-day SMA ($4.52), which shows that the bulls are defending this support. They will now try to push the price above the $5.5899 to $6.0857 resistance zone.If they succeed, the DOT/USD pair could rally to $6.8619 and then to $7.64. The gradually upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 57 suggest that bulls are at a minor advantage.However, if the price again turns down from the overhead resistance zone, the pair could remain stuck in the range for a few more days.Binance Coin (BNB) remains range-bound between $25.6652 and $32. The bounce off the Nov. 26 low suggests that bulls continue to buy near the support of the range. The price has now reached close to the resistance of the range at $32.If the price turns down from $32, the BNB/USD pair may extend its stay inside the range. The moving averages are flat but the RSI has jumped into the positive territory, which suggests that the momentum favors the bulls.If the buyers can push the price above $32, the BNB/USD pair could move up to $35.4338. A breakout of this resistance may result in a retest of the all-time high at $39.5941.Stellar Lumens (XLM) is facing resistance at the downtrend line but the positive thing is that the bulls have not given up much ground. This shows that the buyers are accumulating on every minor dip.If the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, the XLM/USD pair could rally to $0.231655. The bears may again mount a stiff resistance at this level and if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, a few days of range-bound action is possible.If the bulls can drive the price above $0.231655, the next leg of the uptrend could begin. The next target to watch on the upside is $0.2933. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $0.188, the pair may drop to $0.16.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

384,"Back in 2016, 119,756 Bitcoin (BTC) was stolen from the Bitfinex crypto exchange. Some of the coins have continued to move between wallets over the years, including as recently as Monday.Blockchain data shows that an unknown crypto user has moved 270.97974 Bitcoin from a wallet associated with the hack. The sum is worth roughly $5.2 million at time of publication.The address 1GytseWXyzGpmHkcv9uDzkU9D8pLaGyR5x, which is believed to be associated with the hack, shows less than 0.001 BTC remaining. The BTC were sent to a previously unknown Bitcoin address, 3MyXrfSg7JFXLa7bD6YF1GnomEr8EXYRnx, which holds only the transacted amount.The hackers responsible for the breach have moved only 1%–2% of the stolen funds during the four-year interim since the theft took place. Their HODLing strategy appears to be paying off — the haul was worth a mere $72 million at the time, but is now valued at around $2.3 billion.In June, the thieves transferred 736 BTC from the hack to the Russian darknet marketplace Hydra, with some coins actually ending up back at Bitfinex. Likewise, someone transferred 3,503 BTC from addresses associated with the 2016 Bitfinex hack back in July as well. Coins also moved in October, with 2,900 BTC changing wallets. Various amounts of Bitcoin from the hack have also moved on multiple other occasions.98% of the stolen funds have remained untouched for four years, however. This may suggest that the hackers have faced difficulties laundering the digital assets as authorities enforce stricter regulations. Turner Wright contributed to this article."
385,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) reached $19,873 on Coinbase on Nov. 30, breaking above $19,000 in a surprising recovery rally. Although many in the cryptocurrency sector a celebrating BTC achieving an all-time high, it has not just yet.On Coinbase, the price of Bitcoin hit its peak at $19,891 in December 2017. The all-time high price on Coinbase is particularly important because it has consistently remained as the top U.S. exchange for the past several years.Also, some top global exchanges like Binance launched in mid-2017. An argument could be made that an exchange that has been around since 2012 carries more significance in terms of historical price data and to date, Coinbase remains one of the primary exchanges used by retail investors.2017 was a tumultuous period for cryptocurrencies. By the time Bitcoin achieved a new all-time high, it saw 30% to 50% price swings in a week as the cryptocurrency exchange market showed a lack of liquidity.Currently, the record highs differ by nearly $300 between exchanges. For instance, on Kraken and Bitstamp, BTC peaked at $19,660 and $19,666, respectively. Today, BTC price hit a new all-time high at both exchanges.On Binance and Huobi, BTC reached a top at $19,799 and $19,867, both of which were also achieved on Nov. 30.At the time of writing, Bitcoin is yet to see a new record high on Bitfinex, Coinbase, and Gemini, which are also coincidentally known as the exchange for whales due to their high liquidity.In 2017 Coinbase was a leading exchange in terms of trading volume, and in the minds of many traders, seeing the price surpass its previous all-time high would provide further confirmation that a bull market has officially started. For many traders, $20,000 is the barrier that needs to be broken as it will officially concretize a new all-time high for the top-ranked digital asset.A pseudonymous trader known as “Bitcoin Jack” pinpointed Bitfinex as the most liquid exchange during this ongoing rally. Hence, considering that Gemini and Coinbase’s record highs are near Bitfinex, the $19,873 level makes an accurate all-time high. He said:On-chain analysts, including CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, predicted that whales would try front-run the all-time high and apply significant selling pressure.As Bitcoin neared its record high on Coinbase, a sudden sell-off occurred, taking BTC to as low as $18,998 within two hours.Following the heightened level of volatility and a whale-induced sell-off, the futures market’s open interest took a hit, and exchange order books have been hindered.There are two scenarios in the near term that Bitcoin could see after its first attempt to break out of its all-time high.First, the momentum may continue in the Asian markets during their morning session and this could catalyze buyer demand to increase again.Second, Bitcoin could consolidate under the all-time high at $19,873, possibly ranging between $19,000 and $19,873. This scenario is the most ideal for BTC to see a sustainable rally, as it would prevent the derivatives market from getting overheated."
386,"Gold bug and Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff was just 17 years old when the yellow metal set its true all-time price high. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC), a much younger asset, sits close to its inflation-adjusted all-time high after just three years of downward pressure.Gold reached a price of $678 U.S. dollars in 1980, according to a breakdown from Visual Capitalist. Accounting for inflation, based on calculations from Officialdata.org, $678 in 1980 held the same buying power as approximately $2,142 in 2020.The precious metal technically broke its U.S. dollar all-time high this year, hitting $2,075, according to TradingView data. Its 1980 record purchasing power level remains unbroken, however. Since its push to $2,075 in August, gold has retraced in price, sitting near $1,778 per ounce at the time of publication. Bitcoin hit its last all-time price high in 2017, tagging $19,891.99, according to Coinbase’s price index. Accounting for inflation, Bitcoin’s record high stands at $21,131.02 in terms of value, Officialdata.org indicates.Gold has stood the test of time as a store of value for thousands of years, undergoing price discovery in each era as people determine the metal’s worth through buying and selling. The game has potentially changed with BTC though, which is similar to a digital representation of gold — a commodity with scarce supply used for value storage. Bitcoin touts lower barriers for storage and transaction, also holding a defined limited supply.Economist Schiff has pitted gold against BTC many times, often discounting Bitcoin’s worth. While gold moves slowly in price compared with Bitcoin, Schiff likes gold for its wealth-maintenance role.Bitcoin has ridden a dramatic price rally in recent weeks, reaching within $100 of its Coinbase all-time price high. Raoul Pal, a macro investor, recently indicated his intention to sell his gold stack and buy more BTC.“I have a sell order in tomorrow to sell all my gold and to scale in to buy BTC and ETH (80/20),” he tweeted on Nov. 29. “I dont own anything else (except some bond calls and some $'s),” he said, adding: “98% of my liquid net worth. See, you can't categorize me except #irresponsiblylong.”Amid Bitcoin’s upward surge, people are reportedly exiting gold in droves, as seen in recent record outflow numbers."
387,"Not one to mince words, Tyler Winklevoss reportedly told the business network CNBC that “Cash is trash.” In his view, it’s only a matter of time before investors dump the dollar and other fiat currencies for BTC:His twin brother Cameron Winklevoss also said that Bitcoin (BTC) “just needs to be better than gold” to see its value rise to remarkable levels.The twins, who run the United States-based cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, believe BTC will eventually hit $500,000 — mirroring a recent forecast from Catherine Wood, CEO of ARK Investment Management.Crypto enthusiasts believe Bitcoin’s recent run-up is different from previous market cycles because of the influx of institutional investors into the space. Bitcoin’s maturation leap also suggests that the digital currency is carving out a permanent place in the financial system.As Tyler Winklevoss implied, Bitcoin’s adoption curve is accelerating amid fears of a historic debasement in national currencies like the U.S. dollar. These debasement fears were at the heart of a June forecast from Goldman Sachs, which called for higher gold prices.Unlike Bitcoin, the price of gold has languished in recent months, with the spot price now trading 14% below its August all-time high.The bullion market has seen significant outflows in recent weeks, while holders of Bitcoin have accumulated even larger positions. Raoul Paul, CEO of Real Vision Group, recently told his Twitter followers that he will liquidate his entire gold portfolio for Bitcoin and Ether (ETH). "
388,"Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high on various exchanges on Nov. 30, but one record, in particular, hit the headlines for a different reason.Data from cryptocurrency exchange Kraken shows BTC/USD hit its highest ever price on its order book — then dove to $16,600 in seconds.The reason for the crash, which will have liquidated a large number of positions and caused considerable pain for many a speculator, was likely what is known as a ""stop-loss run.""Stop-loss runs involve large-volume traders who intentionally place large sell orders at a specific price point, then target where they think a large number of stop-loss positions reside. In this case, the target was around $16,600, near the location of last week's local bottom.The result is a cascade of selling pressure that very quickly delivers the result, if successfully estimated, only for the market to subsequently rebound once the process is over.Liquidity risk is always a given factor in exchange trading, and Kraken's one-minute wick down by $3,000 aptly demonstrates why traders should exercise caution around significant price points.Another explanation, or possibly one that contributed to the event, was investors choosing to exit at near $20,000 in order to avoid the costs of a sudden reversal at resistance.""OK, time to pay attention, $BTCUSD. That is a classic top setup,"" John Bollinger, creator of the Bollinger Bands volatility indicator, warned.When asked by a Twitter user if this is a local top or whether Bitcoin's price will go down from here, he responded that ""For now, a potential local top...""Beyond Kraken, meanwhile, Bitstamp also reached its own all-time high at $19,869, with BTC/USD then falling toward $19,000, a level that the pair reclaimed just hours ago.""For those who are feeling bullish about #Bitcoin, today is the day you’ve been waiting for,"" exchange Binance meanwhile summarized."
389,"Cryptocurrency-related fraud and theft are likely to grow in the post-COVID-19 world, according to a new report by cybersecurity and antivirus provider Kaspersky Lab.Securelist, Kaspersky’s cyberthreat research arm, published a report on cyberthreats to financial organizations, forecasting some specific types of financial attacks that are likely to surge in 2021.Securelist has predicted that a wave of poverty fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic will inevitably lead to “more people resorting to crime including cybercrime.” That could also mean a rise in crimes related to Bitcoin (BTC).According to Kaspersky’s research arm, Bitcoin is likely to be the most attractive asset for cybercrime because it is the most popular digital asset. The report reads:Securelist’s researchers also suggested that online perpetrators could switch to more privacy-focused digital assets like Monero (XMR). According to the company, this switch would happen due to the increasing “technical capabilities of monitoring, deanonymization and seizing of BTC.” Securelist’s report reads:As previously reported by Cointelegraph, crypto-related crimes slowed significantly in 2020, though some crypto sectors, like decentralized finance, have become new hotbeds for criminal activity. According to a report by virtual private network firm Atlas VPN, crypto- and blockchain-related hacks are likely to continue declining in 2021."
390,"Bitcoin (BTC) returned to $19,000 on Nov. 30 as a weekend surge continued to produce fresh gains for investors and hodlers.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView showed BTC/USD retaking another key psychological level during Monday trading.The weekend had already produced major upside for the pair, which late last week dived to $16,300. By the start of Monday, $18,600 had appeared, with Bitcoin going on to deliver returns of at least 17% versus those lows.As Cointelegraph reported, a giant $1,300 CME futures gap threatens to take the market lower, but buyers so far remain unfazed. At press time, highs above $19,200 were in progress with around half an hour to go before the start of trading on Wall Street.""Leveling up. The crucial area around $17,800 held,"" Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe summarized just prior to the $19,000 move.Should Bitcoin manage to flip that zone to support, the door remains open for another attempt at challenging $20,000. Last week, however, $19,500 provided firm resistance."
391,"The ongoing Bitcoin (BTC) rally has primarily been driven by institutions, analysts say, with metrics such as CME’s open interest and Grayscale’s assets under management (AUM), supporting this narrative. At the same time, the gold market has seen large outflows in recent weeks. On Nov. 24, independent financial researcher Jan Nieuwenhuijs reported that gold saw its largest weekly outflow in history.Largest outflow from gold ever. pic.twitter.com/Re4o3PHrelThe timing of the heightened level of outflows from the gold market is noteworthy because it comes after the entrance of major institutional investors into the Bitcoin market.Cointelegraph reported that Guggenheim Partners, which manages $275 billion in assets, is the latest institution to show interest in Bitcoin.In the medium to long term, the inflow of institutional capital into Bitcoin could lead to two key trends.First, Bitcoin could see a more sustained uptrend that has emerged since September. Institutions, especially those gaining exposure to BTC through the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, are likely accumulating BTC with a long-term strategy.Some long-time Bitcoin investors, who had gold positions for prolonged periods, have also started to allocate their capital fully into BTC. Raoul Pal, the CEO of Real Vision Group, said:Second, fund managers say that this could make Bitcoin even more dominant in the cryptocurrency market. Currently, the market cap of Bitcoin accounts for 63.83% of the global cryptocurrency market’s valuation.Kyle Davies, the co-founder at Three Arrows Capital, one of the largest funds in the cryptocurrency sector, said:Bitcoin has seen strong momentum throughout the past three months, barely seeing major corrections.During previous bull cycles, it's not uncommon for BTC to see 30% pullbacks, and the recent run is yet to post a major downturn. But, in the near term, on-chain analysts say that BTC could be braced for a deeper drop.Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, said that whales are keeping more BTC on exchanges than in the past few months. This could indicate that whales could sell more BTC in the foreseeable future. He said:Whether the buyer demand from institutions and their Time-weighted Average Price (TWAP) algorithms would counter the selling pressure from whales would likely dictate the short-term price cycle of BTC."
392,"Bitcoin (BTC) is back this week as a rebound takes the largest cryptocurrency ever closer to new all-time highs — what’s in store?Cointelegraph takes a look what could move Bitcoin markets in the coming days as buyers emerge and $16,000 gets left behind — at least for now.The main story among Bitcoiners on Monday is its performance over the weekend.After plumbing depths of $16,300 last week and failing to get much higher than $17,000 in the days following, Bitcoin surprised on Saturday, beginning a climb that has reached $18,600 on Nov. 30.The timing led to comparisons to Black Friday, as BTC/USD fell in time for the infamous discount day and rose back up afterward.“Guess the Black Friday bitcoin sale is officially over. Hope you stocked up,” Barry Silbert, CEO of asset management giant Grayscale summarized.At press-time levels of $18,550, Bitcoin is now up almost 14% versus the lows, recouping the majority of its losses from when it fell from $19,500. This will be a familiar sight for traders, who will now be eyeing the potential for Bitcoin to avoid the psychological selling pressure which so clearly set in near the all-time highs of $20,000.“Crucial level to hold is the $17,700-17,850 breaker. If that is lost, I think we'll see the 16's again,” Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe said in his latest analysis on Sunday.Van de Poppe likewise highlighted the area around $18,500 and $18,700 as the crucial breakout point to fuel further bullishness. Bitcoin subsequently hit the midpoint of that range, but has so far failed to turn it into a launchpad for reclaiming any higher levels.Nonetheless, should current levels hold, Bitcoin will easily see its highest ever monthly close at the end of Monday.One major argument for Bitcoin reversing downwards for its next move comes in the form of a classic “gap” setup on futures markets.Thanks to the weekend’s volatility, Monday has begun with a noticeable “gap” on the charts at CME Bitcoin Futures, this one lying $1,500 lower than the current spot price.Gaps refer to the empty space left between the end of Friday trading and the start of Monday trading for futures, and the latest one to open is $1,300 in size — one of the largest ever.Historically, Bitcoin has opted to rise or fall to “fill” such gaps once they appear, and this has tended to occur quickly, meaning that the chance is there for a fresh dip to as low as $16,990 — the beginning of the gap.A further albeit much smaller gap remains “unfilled” from previous trading at around $19,000.“It all depends on how harshly we reject in this range and how we are going to react around the support at $17,000, which is also the weekly close on the CME futures,” Van de Poppe commented.He also noted that one weekend’s upside is no good as a starting point for being bullish. Entering Bitcoin is a wise move only when support is reached on higher timeframe support levels, meaning that the CME gap should be resolved by the time that the real state of the market becomes more obvious.An accompanying survey meanwhile showed a fairly even split between 6,000 respondents regarding whether BTC/USD would hit $14,000 or $22,000 first.Outside Bitcoin, the macro picture is mixed as the month ends. November saw 13% for equities worldwide, a record month as expectations of a Coronavirus vaccine ran high.On Monday, however, progress began to retreat, with China leading a turnaround from gains to losses and European futures following suit.The U.S. dollar, already under pressure, is expected to dip to its lowest levels since April 2018, Bloomberg reported on the day. As noted by Cointelegraph, the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) has been steadily falling over the past weeks, erasing some previous gains.Bitcoin typically reacts favorably to DXY weakness, and while its relationship to macro assets more broadly is waning, abrupt movements in the index remain apt to dictate short-term market direction.At press time, DXY stood at 91.72, having broken the 92 support level, which was preserved even in August when Bitcoin hit $12,000 for the first time this year.Virus-induced headaches meanwhile continue across the Western world. The United Kingdom’s economy, according to estimates from Bloomberg shared by market commentator Holger Zschaepitz, will contract by the most in over 300 years.Market-specific issues, such as Tesla debuting on the S&P 500, are also on the radar.“Extreme greed” is what is characterizing investor sentiment in both cryptocurrency and traditional markets, according to classic indicator the Fear & Greed Index.A popular sentiment gauge for crypto in paritcualr, the Index uses a basket of factors to assess how overbought or oversold the market is based on investor behavior. A normalized score out of 100, the higher the reading, the more likely the market is due for a correction.Cointelegraph has frequently reported on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index in recent times as it heads towards all-time highs of 95/100. A recent peak of 94 came just prior to BTC/USD shedding $3,000 in a day.On Monday, the Index stood at 88 — lower than before but still firmly in the “extreme greed” category.For Zschaepitz, however, the identical “extreme greed” rating for traditional markets is being distorted thanks to the interventions by central banks as part of Coronavirus measures.“Just to put things into perspective: CNN‘s Fear & Greed Index has risen to 92 as investors have become extreme greedy,” he wrote on Sunday.Central banks have bought up a huge range of bad assets in order to give the illusion of competition on the market since March this year, a move which has garnered considerable criticism from Bitcoin circles.As quant analyst PlanB acknowledged in a timely reminder on Sunday, a new week means a new round of Bitcoin buying by a group of familiar faces: Grayscale, Square and PayPal.As last week, the corporate giants will need to satisfy client demand by buying up the diminishing number of coins available at current prices.This new status quo, formed when PayPal released its cryptocurrency features, has led to estimates showing that there is simply not enough Bitcoin to go around. The three companies’ needs are more than miners can produce, and still compete with demand from elsewhere.The only logical outcome, should demand increase or stay the same, is for the price of Bitcoin in other assets to rise — a simple equation of supply and demand.In an interview with CNBC last week, Dan Schulman, PayPal’s CEO, said that the company was betting on Bitcoin becoming more widely used as a currency."
393,"As Bitcoin price rallied to a new 2020 high, the open interest on CME Bitcoin (BTC) futures rose to $1.16 billion, making it the world’s largest Bitcoin futures market, according to Arcane Research. This suggests that institutional investors are relatively unmoved by the recent sharp correction in Bitcoin price.Guggenheim Partners has become the latest and the largest Wall Street institution that plans to invest in Bitcoin. Guggenheim has sought the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) nod to invest up to 10% of its Macro Opportunities Fund’s net asset value in Bitcoin through the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. The fund currently has $5.3 billion in assets, hence, Guggenheim may buy $500 million or more worth of Bitcoin.The increase in institutional investor’s appetite comes even as Bitcoin is close to its all-time high and this shows they are confident in the long term story of the digital asset.Global Macro Investor and Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal said in an interview with Cointelegraph that Bitcoin’s most conservative target is a rally to $150,000 by November 2021. If a large amount of institutional money continues to flow into the crypto space, Bitcoin could even rise to $250,000, added Pal.The long-term fundamentals of cryptocurrencies continue to improve but the price could still fall in the short term and it's likely that investors will view each dip as a buying opportunity.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-five cryptocurrencies to find out what opportunities exist.In a strong uptrend, the bulls generally buy the dip to the 20-day exponential moving average. The long tails on the Nov. 26 and 27 candlesticks show that bulls aggressively purchased Bitcoin (BTC) at lower levels.The upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the positive zone suggest that bulls are in control. However, the bears will try to stall the current up-move at $18,210.77, which is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the most recent fall. If the price turns down from this resistance, a few days of range-bound action is possible.Conversely, if the bulls can push the price above $18,210.77, the BTC/USD pair could rally to $19,459.22 and then to the magical number of $20,000. A breakout of this resistance could start the next leg of the uptrend.This bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels and plummets below $16,000.The 4-hour chart shows that the rebound off the lower levels has hit a wall near the 50-simple moving average, which is placed just below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $18,210.77.If the bears can sink the price below $17,500, a retest of $16,400 will be on the cards. If the bulls again buy at lower levels, a few days of range-bound action could ensue.On the contrary, if the bulls can propel the price above $18,210.77, a retest of $19,459.22 is possible.The long tails on the Nov. 26 and 27 candlesticks show that the bulls purchased the dips in Ether (ETH) to the breakout level of $488.134 aggressively. This suggests that the sentiment remains positive.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that bulls have the upper hand. However, the buyers are unlikely to have an easy path to $625. The bears will try to stall the current rally at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $569.019.If the price turns down from this resistance and breaks the 20-day EMA ($512), then a retest of $482 will be on the cards.Conversely, if the bulls can push the price above $569.019, the ETH/USD pair could rally to $592.674 and then $622.807. A breakout of this level may start the next leg of the uptrend that could propel the pair to $800.The 4-hour chart shows that the bears are defending the 50-SMA. If the price turns down from the current levels and drops below $520, a retest of $482 will be on the cards.However, if the bulls can push the price above $569.019, a rally to $592.674 and then to $622.807 is possible.Traders can keep an eye on the RSI because if it sustains above 60, it will suggest that bulls are back in command. On the other hand, if the RSI turns down from 60, it will suggest resistance at higher levels and that could result in a few days of range-bound action.Cardano's ADA had corrected to $0.1199845 on Nov. 26, just above the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.1173063. Usually, such a large fall reduces the possibility of the continuation of the uptrend.However, the long tail on the Nov. 26 candlestick and the sharp rebound on Nov. 28 has again brought the bulls back in contention. The bounce shows that the bull aggressively purchased at lower levels.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory suggest that bulls are in command. If the bulls can thrust the price above $0.1826315, the next leg of the uptrend to $0.2129 and then to $0.235 could begin.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the $0.1826315 resistance, the ADA/USD pair may remain range-bound for a few days.The upsloping moving averages on the 4-hour chart and the RSI in the positive zone show that the bulls have the upper hand. The buyers will now try to drive the price above $0.175 resistance.If they can do that, a retest of $0.1826315 is possible. Conversely, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the pair could remain range-bound for a few days. A break below the moving averages will suggest that the bears have made a comeback.The correction in Stellar Lumens (XLM), from the recent highs of $0.231655 on Nov. 25, only lasted only for a day on Nov. 26. This suggests that the bulls aggressively purchased the dips as they expect the rally to extend further.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought territory suggest that bulls are in command. The buyers made their intention clear with the 22.83% rally on Nov. 27.If the bulls can push the price above $0.231655, the next leg of the uptrend could begin. The next level to watch on the upside is $0.2933.However, the bears have other plans as they are trying to stall the up-move in the $0.22 to $0.2316555 resistance zone.The bulls are attempting to defend the 20-EMA. If the price bounces off this support, the bulls will try to push it above the downtrend line. If they succeed, a retest of $0.231655 will be on the cards.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the 20-EMA, the pair could drop to the 50-SMA. If that happens, the pair may consolidate in a large symmetrical triangle for a few days.The advantage will shift in favor of the bears if the pair drops below the $0.145 to $0.140 support zone.NEM (XEM) broke out and closed above $0.1690655 on Nov. 25 but the long wick on the day’s candlestick showed that the bulls booked profits at higher levels. That was followed by a sharp decline on Nov. 26.However, the bulls purchased the dip to the 20-day EMA ($0.147) as seen from the long tail on the Nov. 26 candlestick. The bulls pushed the price back above the overhead resistance on Nov. 27.The price has sustained above $0.1690655 for the past two days but the bulls are facing resistance close to $0.190. The bears are currently attempting to sink the price back below $0.1690655. If they succeed, a drop to the 20-day EMA will be on the cards.Conversely, if the bulls can push the price above the $0.190 to $0.2122 resistance zone, the next leg of the uptrend to $0.275 could begin.The bulls are currently attempting to defend the critical support at $0.1690655. If the pair rebounds off this support, the bulls will try to push the price above the downtrend line. If they succeed, the XEM/USD pair could rise to the $0.203 to $0.2122 resistance zone.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below $0.1690655, a drop to the 50-SMA is possible. A break below this level could result in a retest of the $0.1428512 support.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

394,"It’s been another bumper week for Bitcoin, another reason for hodlers to feel grateful. The dollar value remains over $17,000 having reached a three-year high when it topped $19,000 for only the second time. People are starting to notice. The Wall Street Journal talked about Bitcoin’s rise on its front page. Google searches for Bitcoin reached their highest this year, and the coin is now doing better than the halving that sent it to nearly $20,000. Even the Queen has expressed her “interest” in the blockchain.One reason for Bitcoin’s rise is Paypal. Since offering cryptocurrency services a month ago, the payments company has taken 70% of newly minted Bitcoin. Add in Square’s Cash App, and more than 100% of new Bitcoins are going to the two payment companies. And it’s just as well that those companies are getting into the Bitcoin game because current players are struggling to handle the demand. Coinbase has suffered a number of outages as demand has risen.So where could Bitcoin go next? According to one analysis of previous bull runs, this one could go as high as $160,000 with a $25,000 bottom.Of course, there’s always the government to get in the way. The US Federal Reserve and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network have proposed a rule to acquire more information about small, international transactions—including digital currencies. They’ve suggested lowering the threshold to $250. President-elect Joe Biden will appoint Janet Yellen to serve as Treasury Secretary. Yellen previously chaired the Federal Reserve and has called Bitcoin “anything but useful.” On the other hand, Andrew Yang appears to be in line for the job of Secretary of Commerce. Yang has talked of implementing blockchain-based voting and laid out plans to regulate cryptocurrency. Nigeria appears to be doing better. The country’s Ministry of Finance is talking to the securities regulator to create a crypto framework.It’s not just Bitcoin that’s having a good time, though. Celsius has given 25,000 ETH to the Ethereum 2.0 platform, allowing researcher Justin Drake to announce that ETH 2.0 has set the Ethereum 2.0 genesis block. The Genesis Day will be December 1. And XRP almost doubled over the space of a week, though it’s not entirely clear why.That mystery shows why understanding and discussing crypto is so important. CNBC’s Ran Neuner has launched a 24/7 crypto call-in show. Crypto Banter, the first show of its kind, aims to be a source of live, credible information about cryptocurrencies.From November 30, motor racing fans can use REVV to load up on Formula 1-themed NFTs.

395,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) faces two crucial events on Dec. 1 right after the weekly and monthly candles close. The upcoming weekly candle close is particularly noteworthy because it could mark the first red weekly candle since late September.The monthly candle will be significant since it would mark the highest close in Bitcoin’s history if the price remains over $13,791.There are three key factors that could cause the volatility of Bitcoin to spike upon the weekly and monthly candle close. The factors are general uncertainty around the BTC price, record-high futures trading activity and open interest, as well as the overextended weekly chart.Meanwhile, traders have turned cautious anticipating a pullback in the near term despite the rebound in price from around $16,500 on Nov. 28.There are two key trends that could be fueling the recovery of BTC. First, Guggenheim Investments, a global asset management firm with over $233 billion in assets under management, secured the right to invest $500 million in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. In the U.S., where a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) does not exist, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is the first point of entry for most institutional investors. Deribit reported that the news triggered significant buying activity in the options market. The firm said:Second, high-net-worth investors and whales might be buying the dip in anticipation of Monday. In recent weeks, as quantitative traders pointed out, most of the buyer demand came from the U.S.Some speculate that the demand is coming from Time-weighted Average Price (TWAP) algorithms, typically used by institutions and funds. Since TWAP algorithms would get activated again on Monday, this could add to the buyer demand for BTC.There is a high degree of uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market at the moment as traders are divided on where the price will go next.Some are confident that BTC likely bottomed during the weekend due to market trends. For instance, Avi Felman, the head of trading at BlockTower, said that on Coinbase the recent pullback caused BTC to transfer to stronger hands.Sell-offs during a bull market can become overextended, especially because traders often look for reasons to sell. As such, overleveraged buyers get caught at local tops, leading to cascading liquidations. But BTC frequently tends to recover right when traders expect more downside and market sentiment reaches a low point. Felman explained:Additionally, various technical indicators signal that Bitcoin is neither overbought nor oversold across lower timeframes.On the daily chart, as an example, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of BTC is at around 55. An asset is considered oversold on the RSI indicator if it drops below 35. Hence, Bitcoin is in an awkward position because high time frame charts, like the weekly chart, remain overbought.This has led traders to predict a potential correction to the $13,000 to $14,000 support range could soon occur. This high level of uncertainty in the market could cause volatility to increase as the new weekly and monthly candles open.The open interest across futures exchanges would likely increase again, raising the probability of big price movements.Throughout the rally of Bitcoin in recent weeks, the trading activity on major BTC futures exchanges has continuously increased. Despite the recent drop, the open interest on top futures trading platforms remains above $1 billion. When the open interest is high, the likelihood of a short or long squeeze increases, which may result in large spikes in volatility.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), in particular, has seen a noticeable increase in Bitcoin futures trading activity. Interestingly, Arcane Research reported that large traders who hold a minimum position of over 25 BTC more than doubled on the CME in 2020.The researchers at Arcane explained that this trend shows increased institutional demand for Bitcoin. The heightened trading activity on CME, which tailors to accredited and institutional investors, can cause short-term volatility to increase due to the large sizes of trades. The researchers said:Although the institutional demand for Bitcoin has been rising, the futures market remains a major factor driving volatility.Cointelegraph reported earlier this week that when BTC fell from $19,400 to $16,200 largely due to cascading liquidations, over $400 million worth of futures contracts were wiped out on Binance Futures alone.Bitcoin will see a new weekly candle emerge in the next 48 hours, but the variable remains the overbought nature on the weekly time frame.The RSI of the weekly chart is at 88, and when the RSI of an asset surpasses 75, it is considered overbought. The weekly candle is also significantly above short-term moving averages (MAs), namely the 5-day, 10-day and 20-day MAs.Traders have been anticipating a correction because the weekly chart is overextended. It would make a more sustainable rally if BTC consolidates above short-term MAs, as it would give time for the derivatives market and spot buyer demand to catch up.Furthermore, the monthly candle chart of Bitcoin is even more overextended than the weekly chart. The 5-day, 10-day and 20-day MAs are at $13,129, $10,778, and $9,685, respectively, and significantly below the current market price.But whether technicals alone would cause BTC to correct in the foreseeable future remains uncertain. If institutional buyers, like Guggenheim, continue to make headlines by entering the Bitcoin market, it could attract additional buyers and retail interest in the near term.To boot, December has historically been highly volatile for the price of Bitcoin. Though December 2019 recorded a relatively low level of volatility, the end of 2017 and 2018 saw wild price swings including the all-time high BTC price of nearly $20,000 and the bear market bottom, respectively.If a similar pattern emerges, BTC price could see a spike in volatility as it heads towards the end of the year."
396,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) surged above $18,000 on Nov. 29, reaching as high as $18,209 on Binance. However, traders are turning cautious despite BTC’s weekend rally.Bitcoin currently faces resistance at around $18,200, which is also the 10-day moving average (MA) on the daily chart. As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, some traders still anticipate BTC to see another drop in the near term before the rally can continue.A pseudonymous trader known as “Crypto Capo” predicted Bitcoin would see a relief rally to $18,000 as it dropped to the $16,000 region.On Nov. 27, when the price of Bitcoin was still hovering at around $16,700, the trader said he is ready to short $18,000.He added that he is now starting to hedge at $18,100 with plans to cut the hedge if the trend reverses. In the near term, the trader noted that the first confirmation of a correction would be a drop to $17,400. He said:If Bitcoin continues to drop below $17,400 and eventually $16,800, the trader said a drop to the $14,000 region would become likely.But, if Bitcoin rises above $18,400 and consolidates at around $18,200, that would invalidate the bearish structure. Crypto Capo also noted that consolidation above $19,000 would completely invalidate the bearish setup.Another pseudonymous trader known as “Loma,” who discussed a bullish structure for Bitcoin at $17,500, said he has cut half of his long position.The trader emphasized that BTC is nearing resistance as it looks to close its weekly and monthly candles. Considering that the $18,200-$18,400 area remains a resistance range, the trader said:A technical analyst called “CryptoBirb” said that Bitcoin typically faces two types of correction: 15% and 30%.The analyst said that he expects a pullback to $14,000, but also noted that this is not guaranteed. He pinpointed various technical indicators, including BTC being in oversold territory for the first time since the rally began. He wrote:The bullish scenario for Bitcoin would still require BTC reclaiming $18,400 and consolidating above it to confirm the new support levels. Popular trader filbfilb, meanwhile, said that he is currently in cash as market uncertainty is calling for increased risk management.""In the event of a breakdown below $15K and a flip of previous support into resistance, that may present a straightforward short opportunity,"" he wrote on Sunday in his weekly newsletter."
397,"An SEC filing on Friday indicates that the next Wall Street institution to take a public position in Bitcoin may also be among the largest yet: the $275 billion financial services firm Guggenheim Partners. The Guggenheim filing allows the Macro Opportunities fund to purchase GBTC, a publicly-traded Bitcoin investment vehicle from Grayscale, at an indeterminate point in the future. “The Guggenheim Macro Opportunities Fund may seek investment exposure to bitcoin indirectly through investing up to 10% of its net asset value in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (“GBTC”),” the filing reads.According to independent ratings firm Morningstar, the Guggenheim Macro Opportunities fund currently has $5.3 billion in assets under management and sports a four-star rating “based on risk-adjusted returns out of 270 Nontraditional Bond funds.”Guggenheim describes the overall fund strategy for the institutional-grade shares (ticker: GIOIX) as a product of the investment team's “highest-conviction ideas.” If the fund were to take the full 10% stake in GBTC, it would be worth north of $500 million.The filing also notes a long list of potential investor risks associated with cryptocurrencies, which it refers to as “digital assets designed to act as a medium of exchange.” Risks include lack of cryptocurrency exchange regulation, GBTC’s historical “significant premium” to net asset value, and uncertainty regarding tax laws and regulations, among others.This preparatory move by Guggenheim appears to be part of a cascading series of investments indicating increased acceptance of Bitcoin among major financial institutions. In August, business intelligence firm Microstrategy purchased nearly 40,000 Bitcoin, leading to a parabolic move in share price. Likewise, financial services firm Square, Inc bought $50 million in Bitcoin in October.This rolling snowball of institution interest may quickly become an avalanche, as noted by one prominent voice in crypto journalism: 2016: The institutions are coming!
2017: The institutions are coming!
2018: The institutions are coming!
2019: The institutions are coming!
2020: The institutions are here!
2021: Dammit, the institutions bought all the #Bitcoin"
398,"A month ago, one would be hard pressed to find any investor who would have expected a $32,000 Bitcoin (BTC) price for January. At the time, a 140% upside was needed from the $13,300 price on Oct. 30 and this seemed quite far fetched. Therefore, the January $32,000 BTC call (buy) options traded at Deribit for a meager $67, or 0.005 BTC in late October.Fast forward to now, and the same call option peaked at $705. That’s an almost 10x gain in less than four weeks. Keep in mind that despite the rally to $19,484, an additional 67% upside is still needed to reach $32,000.Albeit the recent BTC price increase, the implied options probability (delta) currently sits at 11%. That call option price has also increased due to the BTC volatility change as sellers will request a more substantial premium for taking the risk during uncertain markets.Intense price swings, regardless of the direction, will push volatility higher and any unexpected newsflow usually drives the indicator upwards.Take notice of how BTC volatility spiked from 57% on 30 Oct. to 78% this week. This event is notably bullish for call option buyers. Even if the BTC price had stayed the same, the option price would have climbed accordingly.Options pricing is also heavily dependent on how distant the expiry date is. This same $32,000 call might be deemed worthless two days ahead of maturity. Therefore, traders should not fixate too much on implied options probability (delta).By looking at call (buy) options for Dec. 25, an investor might infer that the 26% odds for $20,000 seems dim. After all, an 18% pump in a month seems unreasonable. Traders tend to have a short-term memory, but an 18% increase in 30 days happened in 9 out of the past 12 months.The last time an 18% or even larger monthly pump happened was not so long ago. On Aug. 23 Bitcoin closed at $11,645, which was a 22% increase from the previous month.Traders and investors should consider buying call options with longer expiry dates. Those who were brave enough to bet on the 150% BTC price increase a month ago are extremely satisfied with the results.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

399,"Based on the fractal, Bitcoin is in an early phase of a prolonged rally that could allow BTC to experience exponential growth in the longer term.There are two main reasons why Bitcoin could follow the macro trend gold saw from the 1970s. First, BTC has a fixed supply that cannot expand, which makes it an attractive hedge against inflation. Second, BTC has the same qualities of a safe-haven asset that gold has.In August 2020, the Winklevoss twins, billionaire Bitcoin investors behind the major U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, laid out a bull case for why BTC price could rally to $500,000.In the thesis, they identified the qualities of Bitcoin that make it a viable safe-haven asset. The Winklevoss specifically emphasized that BTC is not subject to any potential supply shocks, unlike gold. They wrote:Due to this characteristic of Bitcoin, investors continuously make the argument that BTC makes a better safe-haven asset than gold. This comparison between BTC and gold is what leads many to believe that Bitcoin is on a trajectory for long-term exponential growth.Su Zhu, the CEO of Three Arrows Capital, one of the largest funds in the cryptocurrency space, saidThere is also a massive gap between the valuation of Bitcoin and gold. Currently, gold's market cap is estimated to be $9 trillion. In comparison, Bitcoin's market cap is less than 4% of gold’s valuation, which leaves a gap between the two assets.Tyler Winklevoss also noted that the anonymity of Bitcoin’s creator is a major positive factor for the digital ass.He said that Bitcoin has evolved into a $330 billion asset and yet, Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator behind it, remains anonymous.This only legitimizes and further strengthens the perception of Bitcoin as a proper store of value. He said:"
400,"Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped severely in the previous week, falling from $19,500 to $16,000. Corrections never occur smoothly as dropdowns are frequently sudden and painful. The recent correction isn’t much different as the drop occurred in a matter of hours. Since then, Bitcoin’s price consolidated above $16,000, which marked a temporary bottom. The primary question is whether the correction is over or not. A determining factor will be whether or not BTC price can reclaim the crucial levels that will support further upward momentum.As the daily chart shows, a crucial support area was established around the $16,000 area. Bitcoin’s price did lose the uptrend on lower timeframes, through which a chain reaction of liquidations occurred. This chain reaction made the price accelerate downwards.Bitcoin’s price frequently takes the staircase up and the elevator down. When this happens, the daily timeframe marks the crucial support levels to hold, through which the zone around $16,000 is a massive area to hold.The chart shows temporary support and bounces from this area, as Bitcoin’s price is currently $1,400 higher than the support level.The hourly chart shows a clear breakdown from the $18,600 support level, which caused the chain reaction downwards.However, during this correction, some lower timeframe signals are showing crucial resistance levels starting at the $18,000 level. The price of Bitcoin dropped toward the support zone at $17,200, made a slight bounce upward, but couldn’t break through $18,000.Through that failure of breaking $18,000, a resistance area is established. This resistance area needs to break to sustain the bullish momentum and then flip back bullish on the lower timeframes.The next hurdle is found at the $18,600 area, which failed to sustain support in the previous run upward.The daily chart of the total market capitalization shows an apparent breakdown, as the total market capitalization dropped significantly after reaching the 1.618 Fibonacci level.However, the bullish part is a new higher high and a breakout above the $400 billion resistance zone.In this run-up, the massive resistance zone at $400 billion never received confirmation through a retest. In that perspective, it’s very likely to see a further correction towards $400 billion to confirm the previous resistance zone to become support.The most likely scenario would be a relief rally towards the $18,000 to 18,500 area. Through that, the $18,000 to 18,500 area is immediately the crucial breaker of the scenario described.If the $18,000 to18,500 breaks, a further sustained rally toward new all-time highs is a very likely outcome. However, failing to break through this resistance zone would establish a new range.This range is acting between $16,000 to 18,000, in which the $18,000 resistance is a confirmation of a new lower high. Lower highs indicate a downward trend, and therefore could the market expect further corrections south.In that matter, a correction towards $14,000 isn’t unlikely at this point, as that’s the previous high in June 2019 and could warrant a massive support/resistance flip for the markets.If Bitcoin’s price holds above $14,000, the next rally would most likely bring the price of Bitcoin above a price of $30,000.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

401,"Without a doubt, Bitcoin (BTC) has become an increasingly popular asset to own among institutional investors. By the end of the second quarter of 2020, Fidelity reported in a survey of almost 800 institutional investors that 36% owned crypto assets. A separate survey, conducted by crypto asset insurance company Evertas, shared that respondents believe hedge funds will increase their crypto holdings drastically. It also projected that 90% of institutional holders of crypto assets expect to invest even more in Bitcoin this coming year.Related: Corporate Bitcoin treasuries are here, which can only mean good thingsFrom MicroStrategy and Grayscale to JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, Bitcoin has solidified its place in investment portfolios as the asset to hold as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. However, beyond that, there are real technical reasons why institutional investors are becoming more and more bullish on Bitcoin, with some predicting it will reach $1 million by 2025.Related: Time is our best friend: Bitcoin’s 12-month trajectory to $100KWhile the future value of Bitcoin may continue to be a topic of debate, the reality is that investors and financial institutions now believe “holding BTC might prove to be less risky than not having Bitcoin exposure at all.” In fact, according to a crypto research firm Messari, more than 81,000 BTC belongs to “the treasuries of publicly traded companies.”In total 81,154 BTC, or 0.5% of all BTC in circulation is held in the treasuries of publicly traded companies.

https://t.co/Rx6Z8a5NqN pic.twitter.com/DHB7N2dm8JBut, what spurred the Bitcoin rally of 2020, and what are institutional investors seeing in Bitcoin now that they didn’t see before?Bitcoin acts as a non-sovereign currency that is uncorrelated with other asset classes. For institutional investors, it serves as a diversification tool to hedge against highly correlated markets such as the S&P 500, Nasdaq and the dollar. Two major areas where Bitcoin and blockchain technologies offer the most value to institutional investors include secure, borderless transactions and access to new opportunities that can’t exist in traditional financial markets.Bitcoin’s innovative technology including smart contracts, borderless payments, lower fees and faster, more secure transactions are the catalyst that will prepare us for a future where national currencies break from their current physical form and become digitized.Related: Bitcoin is the best treasury reserve asset humanity’s ever hadWith U.S. dollar inflation on the horizon, notable investors like Ray Dalio and Paul Tudor Jones are also beginning to “like Bitcoin more and more” and have identified it as the “best inflation hedge,” comparing it to gold and copper. As banks and technology providers continue to invest heavily in research and development projects related to verifying and recording finance transactions, such as JPMorgan’s new business blockchain and digital currency house Onyx, we will continue to see institutions increase their presence within the space.Custodians are used by financial institutions such as hedge funds and mutual funds, who are obliged to hold clients assets with a professional custodian for regulatory purposes.Previously, institutional investors were wary of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to the regulatory environment, and until recently, the wider crypto ecosystem was also severely lacking in institutional-grade crypto asset custodial solutions. With an urgent need for adequate custodians to secure the growing amount of crypto assets and an increase in clarity around regulatory guidelines for operating and investing in cryptocurrencies, a sector of institutional-grade custodian solutions was born.Anchorage, a newly-launched crypto custody firm backed by Andreessen Horowitz and a number of other prominent blockchain-focused venture capital firms, is one of those solutions. It was incorporated with the ethos to provide a crypto-native digital asset custodian for institutional investors. Bank Frick, a Liechtenstein-based private bank, has made it a priority to offer a range of blockchain banking services, including token launch support, crypto trading and digital asset custody. The regulated bank’s services are targeted at professional market participants and financial intermediaries in Europe.Banks have also received the green light to custody crypto companies. In a note to the public, senior deputy comptroller and senior counsel of the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan Gould wrote back in July:This marked a major industry-wide development allowing regulated financial institutions to hold the same safekeeping services previously exclusively held by specialist firms.Banking custody options coupled with the emergence of crypto insurance companies like Paragon International Insurance Brokers, which was recently integrated into Bitstamps offerings, are providing policies for digital assets such as Bitcoin to be protected both online and offline while covering a number of crime-related circumstances.The adopted regulatory and custodian solutions provide security for institutional investors who may have otherwise been skeptical. They are also helping hold cryptocurrency exchanges to a higher standard, encouraging them to protect investors’ money from theft or misappropriation. This has become an important catalyst for making digital assets more attractive to institutional investors and funds.As the crypto market sees an uptick in institutional investments, with large purchases being completed by more and more firms, it has correlated into a rally in the markets.According to a report from cryptocurrency derivatives platform Zubr, institutional investors are moving toward holding Bitcoin in “physical” form instead of cash-settled futures. The integration of institutional investors into the crypto ecosystem and their interest in holding is a positive sign for mainstream adoption. The similarities these investors share with holders indicate an easy transition from traditional finance to the digital economy, instilling trust in Bitcoin and representing an understanding and belief in the technology.Serving both parties is also the high-potential upside that comes with decentralized finance, which has introduced a flow of new business streams, products and services. Services from the likes of Maker and Compound allow individuals to take out loans of any size in a matter of minutes without having to disclose their identity to a third party, while the yields associated with new DeFi products are resulting in gains that are higher than savings accounts, certificate of deposit accounts and other traditional options.The potential benefits of the DeFi revolution are just one more reason the dynamic of cryptocurrency is shifting into what believers have wanted all along — a digitized, borderless asset.According to a recent survey by Fidelity Asset Management, 80% of surveyed institutions find investing in digital assets appealing, while the number of Bitcoin addresses has been steadily increasing. Addresses holding above 1,000 and 10,000 Bitcoins have also increased considerably. Coupled with declining balances on exchanges, this suggests that whales and larger investors are choosing to hold Bitcoin.Additionally, a report by Big Four audit firm KPMG found that major banks, asset managers and qualified custodians are launching a new wave of institutional-grade crypto products and services. The institutional investments into cryptocurrency confirms trust in the digital asset from a significant place of power.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

402,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating above $17,000 on Nov. 28 following a major correction from $19,400. In the near term, traders anticipate the dominant cryptocurrency to see another steep pullback.There are three main reasons why traders expect a deeper drop to occur in the near future, namely,  historical cycles, the Fibonacci Sequence, and the record-high open interest of the futures market.BTC price frequently saw 20% to 30% drops in past bull markets like the rally to nearly $20,000 in 2017. Although the rally continued afterward, major corrections occurred as the derivatives market became overcrowded.Several traders now say that the price of Bitcoin should correct to the $13,800-$14,500 range if a similar pattern occurs.In addition, some technical analysts are considering a worst-case scenario where BTC falls to the top of the August 2020 rally. That would put the price of Bitcoin at around $12,468.$BTC

Crypto Twitter is going to hate me for this...

I have strong conviction we'll see $13k-ish. pic.twitter.com/6g3sFzbVntA pseudonymous trader known as “Salsa Tekila” said that the technical outlook of Bitcoin is relatively straightforward.If BTC rises above $17,500 and stays above it, the trend becomes bullish once again. But, if BTC stays below $17,500, a drop to the $11,000 to $13,000 range should not be unexpected. The trader wrote:As Cointelegraph previously reported, traders are pinpointing the 0.618 level using the Fibonacci sequence as a potential area of interest for buyers.The Fibonacci sequence encompassing Bitcoin’s entire rally until $19,400 puts the 0.618 level at around $13,500. Under the sequence, 0.618 is considered a pivotal level for a potential trend reversal.When the open interest of the Bitcoin futures market remains above $1 billion, the price of BTC tends to drop.Earlier today, Cointelegraph reported that throughout BTC’s history, its price often corrected when the futures market saw a heightened level of trading activity.According to data from Skew, the open interest across major futures exchanges currently exceeds $1 billion. OKEx, Binance Futures, and CME, the three largest BTC futures markets, have now reached an all-time high open interest of $1.4 billion, $0.94 billion, and $0.93 billion, respectively.Other traders, however, believe that Bitcoin could either rally to $18,000 before any pullback or even see a continuation of the general uptrend to new highs.Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said earlier today that the range low for BTC price is currently holding, which is above $16,000.This may result in a relief rally to $18,000. Whale clusters also show that the $16,000 area remains a strong support level.Send it to 18k. pic.twitter.com/vsRtaFfDewSimilarly, a pseudonymous trader known as “Crypto Capo” said that based on previous fractals, BTC could first see $18,000 before another major drop."
403,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropped sharply on Nov. 26 following a mass sell-off from whales. Data from on-chain data firms, namely Santiment, Intotheblock, and CryptoQuant, show heightened levels of whale exchange inflows.Whales selling right under Bitcoin's all-time high, particularly when the market sentiment was overly euphoric, led to a massive drop. Roughly $1.8 billion worth of futures contracts were wiped out, as Cointelegraph reported.Some exchanges, like Binance as an example, recorded $400 million worth of liquidations within merely several hours.According to Santiment, whales sold quickly after Bitcoin surpassed $19,300. Many of these high-net-worth individuals sold so aggressively that they are no longer in the whale category of holding over 1,000 BTC.The overleveraged derivatives market started crashing as soon as the price of Bitcoin saw a relatively minor drop. Eventually, BTC dropped to as low as $16,200 on major exchanges. Analysts at Santiment said:Researchers at Intotheblock spotted a similar trend. The drop in the price of Bitcoin matched the moment when whales transferred 93,000 BTC into exchanges. When the price of BTC was at the yearly peak, 93,000 BTC were worth $1.8 billion.Whales have been moving $BTC into exchanges.#Bitcoin has faced a steep correction since Wednesday’s highs of $19,600

This drop started as soon as whales began to deposit BTC to exchanges. More than 93 thousand Bitcoin's were deposited into centralized exchanges. pic.twitter.com/ntq1yIlDeVSubsequent to the rapid crash of the Bitcoin futures market, the outlook on Bitcoin from traders and analysts remains divided. Some believe that BTC is headed for a deeper pullback, possibly to the $13,800 support level. Others, however, say that buyers now have the incentive to bring BTC above $18,000 to tap the liquidity above.The bearish case for Bitcoin in the near term mainly revolves around two things. First, during previous bull markets, BTC historically dropped 30% or more before seeing a continuation of the rally. If BTC sees a similar trend, that would mean a drop to at least $14,500.Second, short-term investor activity is increasing as the price of BTC consolidates. In the past, a spike in the number of young addresses marked a bearish trend.Cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst, Edward Morra, emphasized that previous bull markets saw multiple corrections that were even more severe, such as by 30% to 40%. Furthermore, the trader also said that the Fibonacci sequence 0.618 level is $13,500.Based on the combination of these two data points, Morra explains that a drop to $13,500 would be a “fantastic” opportunity. He said:Josh Olszewicz, a chartist and a cryptocurrency investor, meanwhile says that local Bitcoin tops usually occur when unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) aged one to three months reach 10%.The investor notes that it is currently at 8%, which has historically signaled a market top. He noted that “similar to BDD, more young on-chain coin movements are generally bearish.”Nevertheless, the market sentiment around Bitcoin remains generally bullish. Many analysts that anticipate BTC to fall in the near term still expect the dominant cryptocurrency to hit an all-time high by the year’s end. Considering this, some traders are also optimistic about the short-term price trend of BTC.A pseudonymous trader known as “Byzantine General” noted that the liquidity for Bitcoin is now in the $17,500 to $19,000 range. Liquidity emerges when traders in the futures market sway to one side of the market. Since the liquidity is higher up, it indicates that traders are likely shorting BTC and the liquidation prices of overleveraged shorts are located around $18,000.Stop hunts and cascading liquidations can work both ways. If mass long contract liquidations caused BTC to drop on Nov. 26, short liquidations could trigger BTC to rally. Given that BTC/USD has dropped substantially in a short period, a relief rally is certainly possible. With liquidity near $18,000, the probability of this happening remains high.Former Credit Suisse banker Mira Christanto added that the medium to the long-term outlook of BTC remains strong. She pinpointed the Bitcoin Difficulty Ribbon indicator, which suggests the price of BTC has been suppressed for a long time. The indicator signifies an acceleration of mining difficulty, which as seen in 2013 and 2016, marked the start of bull cycles.Whale exchange deposits have continuously remained high throughout November, which was the main source of selling pressure. But, the one variable that could offset the sell-off from whales is stablecoin inflows. In the latest note to its clients, data analytics firm CryptoQuant said that the number of stablecoins deposited into exchanges rose sharply in recent months.For the rally of Bitcoin to continue in the near term, two main factors are critical. BTC needs to stay above the $16,200 support region, which it has defended so far with a strong reaction from the market.It also would need to see higher stablecoin inflow in the next several days, which would indicate that sidelined capital is returning to the market. The note read:At least in the foreseeable future, it is critical for BTC to remain stable above $17,000 and consolidate. This would allow the derivatives market to see a potential resurgence in momentum and the open interest to build up. So far, there aren't too many signs that a massive correction must occur and that the road toward a new all-time high in the medium term has been hindered.Moreover, the culmination of negative news, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s tweet thread about U.S. regulation and Chinese police seizing $4.2 billion in BTC and other cryptocurrencies from the PlusToken Ponzi scheme, hit the market in recent days to fuel bearish sentiment.However, as the impact of this negative news wears off, the fear along with selling pressure on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could decrease in the upcoming weeks "
404,"There was a time when BitMEX derivatives exchange reigned sovereign over other exchanges, and the company effectively held a 50% market share until July 2019. For this reason, traders kept a close eye on every indicator connected to BitMEX, including its funding rate, open interest, and basis.Open interest measures the total number of contracts held by market participants. As the figure rises higher, so does the potential size of liquidations. On Aug. 2, a $1,400 crash happened as $1 billion in futures contracts were forcefully closed due to insufficient margins.Although there is no magic number, traders tend to get shaky as open interest nears $1 billion, causing a phenomenon some traders refer to as the BitMEX ghost. This became evident during the second half of 2019, when massive Bitcoin price crashes occurred on seven different instances when open interest tops $1 billion.The perceived risk associated with high open interest depends on how liquid the underlying asset is. During the third quarter of 2019, Bitcoin's regular volume on spot exchanges averaged $2.4 billion per day. Thus, a single contract totaling 42% of the Bitcoin volume seemed sizeable enough.As the chart above depicts, there is little doubt that open interest near $1 billion coincided with relevant price crashes from July through September. It is worth noting that a notable number of contracts in play cannot be deemed bullish or bearish.The latter half of 2019 was quite rough for cryptocurrencies, and as most investors will recall, even President Trump publicly bashed Bitcoin, as reported by Cointelegraph. All this happened while the United States Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin demanded additional regulation and oversight for the sector.The chart above shows much better detail of how relevant BitMEX's 40% market share was back then. A single exchange held an open interest equivalent to half of Bitcoin's daily spot volume.Fast forward to 2020, and BitMEX has been dethroned by OKEx, where the total open interest on perpetual and fixed-month futures surpassed $1 billion on July 25.The remaining contenders kept growing their share, but it was only recently that Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), Binance, and Bybit managed to break the psychological $1 billion barrier.Oddly enough, this happened on Nov. 20, just four days ahead of the 16% crash to $16,334. The total futures open interest on Sept. 2019 totaled $3 billion to put things in perspective. This time around, four exchanges were able to break the $1 billion barrier.Although futures open interest grew to $7.4 billion, so did the daily average volume on regular spot exchanges where the figure now reads $3.5 billion. Thus, unlike the previous year, a single exchange holding a $1 billion open interest should not raise eyebrows in the same manner that it did in 2019. To sum up, the markets have grown and developed to the extent that the BitMEX ghost is gone but it might have been replaced by a similar phenomenon that occurs when four exchanges cross the $1 billion futures open interest mark.Regardless, one should keep a close eye on such an indicator from now on as those four exchanges have replaced BitMEX as the market leader. Combined, Binance, CME, OKEx, and Bybit hold over half of the futures’ open interest. Although such a coincidence has only happened once, it indeed mimics the $1 billion effect from the past.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

405,"The market cap of Tether (USDT), a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, has surged in recent weeks, potentially helping to fuel the recent Bitcoin (BTC) rally that drove prices to near all-time highs. Paolo Ardoino, who serves as dual CTO to Bitfinex and Tether, tweeted Thursday that the supply of USDT increased by 1 billion over nine days, marking the second-fastest expansion in its history. The record was set on Sept. 4, 2020 when, over eight days, USDT's circulating supply increased by 1 billion.At press time, Tether had a market cap of nearly $19 billion, meaning that there are roughly 19 billion USDT in circulation at a price of $1.00. Tether’s market cap has increased by nearly four times since the start of 2020, according to CoinMarketCap data.At the current circulating supply, Tether has the fourth-highest market capitalization of any cryptocurrency.USDT and other so-called stablecoins offer fiat onramps to cryptocurrency markets, thereby minimizing price volatility and ensuring easy redeemability once digital assets are sold. Although USDT is supposedly backed by real U.S. dollar reserves, Tether has never produced a full audit of its bank accounts.In 2019, a Bloomberg report claimed that Tether’s USDT was not completely pegged to the dollar, but rather that the circulating supply is only backed by 74% in cash and short-term securities.Tether is also run by the same management group that oversees Bitfinex, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. It has been alleged that Tether and Bitfinex manipulated the 2017 bull market, though proving such a claim is difficult due to the complex nature of decentralized cryptocurrency markets.Legal experts informed Cointelegraph earlier this year that the scope of market manipulation in an asset as novel as Bitcoin will be difficult to establish.In the meantime, Tether remains the dominant stablecoin in the industry, accounting for more than three-quarters of the stablecoin market cap."
406,"Cryptocurrency adoption is slowly but surely making its way to the mainstream — a notion that has become more apparent as major retailers like PayPal announce support for digital currencies. As such, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that crypto holders may be keen to spend some of their digital currency this holiday season. According to a new report from Forrester and blockchain payments service provider BitPay, cryptocurrency adopters tend to spend more than other consumers. Based on interviews with BitPay merchants, the report noted that cryptocurrency users have an average order value of $450, compared to about $200 for non-cryptocurrency users.Merrick Theobald, vice president of marketing for BitPay, told Cointelegraph that often times when the price of Bitcoin increases, there is also an increase in payment transactions:According to Theobald, a number of BitPay merchants are offering special Bitcoin deals for Black Friday, catering to shoppers who prefer to pay in crypto. He further commented that jewelry, electronic retailers, and other industries often faced with fraudulent transactions are offering special discounts for payments made in crypto.For example, Ace Jewelers is giving 20% off luxury watches and jewelry for BitPay users with the code “BF2020BitP@y.” Newegg Australia and Newegg Hong Kong are also offering discounts on online orders via BitPay. Additionally, Muft Electric Bikes is offering BitPay’s U.S. users 10% off with the code “HODL.” Cointelegraph is also offering users 20% off Bitcoin and crypto clothing and accessories from the Cointelegraph online store with the code “blackfriday.” In addition to Black Friday deals from BitPay merchants, Lolli – an online Bitcoin rewards platform – is offering users additional Bitcoin back for purchases made on Black Friday. Lolli caters to over 1,000 mainstream online stories including Nike, Sephora, and Expedia. Lolli also announced an integration with eBay via a tweet on Nov. 25.Through its Chrome extension, Lolli provides users with up to 30% back in Bitcoin rewards. Alex Adelman, chief executive officer of Lolli, told Cointelegraph that for Black Friday several of Lolli’s retailers have increased their rewards rates.For instance, Groupon is offering a 12.5% reward rate rather than a 9% rate. Booking.com is also offering a 7% reward rate versus a 3.5% rate. The dog food company Chewy has increased their rate to 7% from 4.5% this holiday. In addition, Lolli has encouraged users to share their purchases via Twitter to get even more Bitcoin rewards directly from the platform.Adelman said that Lolli is offering its highest Bitcoin back rates ever this holiday season, noting that the platform has recently brought on over 250 new retailers. Adelman attributed Lolli’s growth to the increasing price of Bitcoin, which has piqued mainstream interest. “Lolli.com has more than tripled our growth rate from this time last year. This is a great signal for mass bitcoin adoption,” Adelman said.It’s also notable to mention that the fast food restaurant chain Church’s Chicken Venezuela offered a Black Friday deal for customers paying in the digital currency Dash. Church’s Chicken Venezuela has been accepting Dash payments since 2018, serving as the first fast food chain in Venezuela to accept crypto. Currently, Church’s Venezuela also accepts Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) payments.Orlando Gustavo Navas, general director of Church’s Chicken Venezuela, told Cointelegraph that Black Friday is a special event celebrated in Venezuela’s Sambil Caracas shopping mall during Nov. 20 to Nov. 22. During this time, Church’s Chicken offered customers paying with Dash a combo meal for two people for $5 and a combo meal for five people for $10. Navas said:Navas shared that 800 customers paid with Dash during Black Friday, further demonstrating the acceptance of crypto payments in countries like Venezuela. “The result was undoubtedly a success. People are eager for crypto solutions, from the elderly to teenagers who want to know about how to use cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies could be part of the solution here in Venezuela and that is why it is so important for us to be part of this process,” Navas said.Crypto wallet providers are offering Black Friday deals to help individuals get started with cryptocurrency or to further secure their funds. Wallet provider Ledger is offering 40% off its Nano X and Nano S hardware wallets during Nov. 23 to Nov. 30.A Ledger spokesperson told Cointelegraph that as crypto prices continue to rise, it’s become more important than ever to secure funds. The company noted that there has been a 50% increase in turnover in the last two weeks, as well as higher conversion rates from browser to customer. “On LedgerLive, the volume of purchase has increased by 33% in buy transactions, while the average crypto shopping cart has also increased in the last fifteen days,” a Ledger spokesperson said.In addition to physical goods being discounted this Black Friday, some nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, are being offered at a special rate.Cointelegraph’s talented illustrators recently created over two dozen NFTs inspired by cryptocurrency and blockchain concepts. The NFTs portray these concepts through famous murals and paintings, like those from Salvador Dali and Leonardo da Vinci.These unique NFTs can be purchased on Rarible.com, a community-owned digital collectibles marketplace. For Black Friday, Cointelegraph is offering a 50% discount on the collectible NFTs. In addition, Cointelegraph will be holding auctions for the artwork through Nov. 30, which is Cyber Monday.Upland, an NFT community, is also hosting a virtual Thanksgiving scavenger hunt beginning on Nov. 26 through Nov. 27. Players who register will have a chance to win virtual properties and will receive a Thanksgiving themed block explorer."
407,"The motivation and time horizon for entering Bitcoin (BTC) will ultimately dictate whether investors succeed in this new asset class, according to crypto pioneer Mark Yusko.On Friday, the CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Management commented on the recent wave of negative headlines concerning Bitcoin. In a series of tweets, Yusko said financial institutions are justifiably concerned about Bitcoin’s disruptive impact and will use whatever means they have to slow its adoption.The normal response to Bitcoin’s threat is to “erect barriers to adoption and innovation,” Yusko said, adding:Ultimately, this has been “a losing strategy for centuries,” he said.In the meantime, speculators seeking short-term exposure will continue to influence Bitcoin’s price by reacting to headlines. They’ve had no shortage of negative news in recent days, with China seizing $4.2 billion worth of crypto assets and Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong foretelling of potentially damaging Bitcoin regulations.However, he believes that investors with a longer time horizon are more likely to succeed as Bitcoin’s fundamental narrative strengthens:Bitcoin holders are notorious for their low time preference, meaning they defer immediate gratification for long-term gain. In this case, the ""long-term gain"" is a paradigm shift in society’s understanding of money.Bitcoin holders, or HODLers as they’ve come to be known, appear to have strengthened their conviction amid the latest market melt-up. Case in point: 61% of Bitcoin’s supply has not moved for over a year despite BTC being profitable for over 99% of its history.On the price front, Bitcoin peaked north of $19,200 last week. In the process, BTC’s market cap ballooned to $352 billion; a new all-time high. The asset is currently trading below $17,000 after a heavy correction on Thursday."
408,"Bitcoin may hit $150,000 by November 2021, according to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor and Real Vision — and that would be the most conservative scenario. Pal believes that Bitcoin could even reach $250,000 due to the large amount of institutional money currently flowing into the Bitcoin market.That is what, according to Pal, makes the latest Bitcoin rally fundamentally different from 2017’s crypto bubble, which is believed to have been driven mainly by retail investors.According to Pal, most of Bitcoin's additional supply is currently being absorbed by PayPal, Square — which recently adopted crypto services  — and Grayscale. He believes that the resulting supply squeeze is the catalyst for Bitcoin’s latest surge.“I've never seen a market with this supply and demand imbalance before”, Pal said, pointing out the macroeconomic factors that are playing in Bitcoin’s favor.Despite news on the coronavirus vaccine sparking hopes of a quick economic recovery, governments will likely need to release additional monetary stimulus to sustain their economies. That, according to Pal, will lead to a devaluation of fiat. He believes that this together with low interest rates will propel Bitcoin's price to new highs.""It's life-changing. No other asset has an upside of 5x, 10x, 20x in a short space of time,"" he stated.Check out the full interview on our YouTube channel, and don’t forget to subscribe!"
409,"CME Group has become the world’s largest Bitcoin (BTC) futures market following a surge in open interest over the past month, industry data shows. In a Friday tweet, Arcane Research announced that CME had overtaken OKEx as the world’s largest Bitcoin futures market. Citing data from Skew, a market intelligence firm, Arcane said open interest in CME’s Bitcoin futures contract has reached $1.16 billion. OKEx, meanwhile, registered $1.07 billion.“Institutional investors are here,” Arcane said.CME’s Bitcoin futures market has more than doubled over the past month, with more traders seeking exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency as it surged to near all-time highs. Futures trading can sometimes invoke heavy volatility, especially as expiry nears, as contract holders adjust their positions before that date.Its November futures contract, BTCX20, expires on Friday.Cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Huobi have also emerged as major futures players. Based on open interest, they are the third- and fourth-largest BTC futures platforms, respectively.Bybit, which also appeared on Arcane’s list, announced earlier this week that it will soon launch a quarterly Bitcoin futures contract.The futures market is an important bellwether for Bitcoin adoption because it means traditional investors are getting into the mix. While the 2017 bull market was driven largely by retail traders, the current uptrend has been fueled by deeper institutional pockets.CME, in particular, is becoming vital to Bitcoin price discovery, according to investment manager Wilshire Phoenix.CME’s significance is “not only demonstrated through trading volume and open interest,” Wilshire said, “but also by influence on spot price formation.Bitcoin price is currently consolidating in the $16,500 range following a heavy Thanksgiving day sell-off.

410,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) rise above $20,000 will have to wait, as the price saw a strong correction and turned away from reaching a new all-time high.Data suggests that whales decided to book profits when Bitcoin was close to $19,000, and this pulled the price lower. This fall could have resulted in the liquidation of overleveraged positions in the futures market and further aggravated the decline.The current correction is a healthy sign, as the crypto market was becoming overheated as several altcoins rallied vertically in the past week. While some altcoins have given back a large portion of their recent up-move, Bitcoin remains strong, suggesting that investors are buying into support at lower levels.Galaxy Digital founder and CEO Mike Novogratz recently said that Bitcoin is attracting institutional investors because it is viewed as a hedge against the debasement of fiat currency. Novogratz suggested investors keep about 2% to 3% of their net worth in Bitcoin with a long-term objective, as he believes BTC will be worth a lot more in five years.However, traders should wait for the price to stabilize and form a base before buying because trying to catch a falling knife could be dangerous. Traders can watch the price action near the critical support levels, then consider buying if they hold steady.Let’s analyze the top 10 cryptocurrencies to spot the important support levels that may attract buyers.Bitcoin (BTC) turned down from $19,458.56 on Nov. 25, and the selling intensified on Nov. 26, which pulled the price below the 20-day exponential moving average ($17,048) for the first time since Oct. 8.The bulls defended the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $16,049.61 on Nov. 26, but they are struggling to sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. This suggests that traders are selling on rallies.If the bears sink the price below $16,049.61, the next support is likely to be the 50% retracement level of $14,996.59, which is placed just above the 50-day simple moving average at $14,535. The bulls are likely to defend this level aggressively.The 20-day EMA has flattened out, and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint suggests a range formation in the short term.Ether (ETH) turned down from the stiff overhead resistance at $625 on Nov. 24 as traders booked profits. The selling intensified on Nov. 26, and the biggest altcoin broke below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $526.348, the 20-day EMA at $504.The bulls purchased the dip to the breakout level of $488.134, as seen from the long tail on the Nov. 26 candlestick. However, the bulls are struggling to sustain the rebound as traders are selling on minor rallies.If the bears sink the price below $488.134, a drop to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $466.755 is possible. A break below this support will shift the advantage in favor of the bears.On the other hand, a strong rebound off the current level or the support at $466.755 will suggest demand at lower levels, and that could keep the ETH/USD pair range-bound for a few days.After the long wick on the Nov. 24 candlestick, XRP formed an inside day candlestick pattern on Nov. 25 that closed in the red. This showed that the bulls were booking profits after the sharp rally of the past few days.The XRP/USD pair plunged to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.438968 on Nov. 26, but the long tail on the candlestick shows buying at lower levels.However, the bears are unlikely to give up their advantage. They are selling on rallies and the pair has formed a Doji candlestick pattern today. This suggests that the pair could consolidate in a range for a few days before the next trending move.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) nosedived on Nov. 25 and 26 and completed a 100% retracement of the latest leg of the uptrend that had started on Nov. 20.Although the bulls purchased the dip on Nov. 26, the price turned down from the 20-day EMA ($277) today. This suggests that the sentiment has changed from buy on dips to sell on rallies.The bears will now try to sink the price below the $231 support. If that happens, the BCH/USD pair could drop to $200. Conversely, if the bulls push the price above $280, the pair may rise to $300.The bulls could not flip $13.28, the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, into support on Nov. 26. This attracted further selling, and Chainlink's LINK plummeted below the moving averages.The bulls are currently attempting to defend the 50-day SMA, but the weak rebound off it suggests a lack of urgency to buy, even at these levels.If the bulls fail to push the price back above $13.28 within the next few days, the bears will try to drag the price down to $10. A break below this support could shift the advantage in favor of the bears.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls push and sustain the price above $13.28, it will suggest that the sentiment remains bullish.Litecoin (LTC) formed a Doji candlestick pattern on Nov. 24, and that was followed by a sharp drop on Nov. 25. This suggested aggressive profit-booking by the bulls and selling by the bears.The failure of the LTC/USD pair to rebound off the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $75.943, or the 20-day EMA ($73), shows that the bulls are not buying on dips.Although the pair rebounded off the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $64.8317 on Nov. 26, the bulls could not push the price above the 20-day EMA.If the price breaks below $64, a drop to the 50-day SMA ($60) is possible. Conversely, if the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA, it will point to a possible range-bound action for a few days.Cardano's ADA formed a dark cloud cover candlestick pattern on Nov. 25, which indicates a bearish reversal. This was followed by further selling from the aggressive bears and covering of long positions by the trapped bulls.The ADA/USD pair plunged on Nov. 26 and dipped below the 20-day EMA ($0.126), but the long tail on the candlestick shows buying at lower levels.However, the buyers have not been able to sustain the bullish momentum, as the bears are selling even on minor rallies. If the bears can sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair could drop to $0.1142241.On the contrary, if the pair again rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it could rise to $0.155, then consolidate in a range for a few days before starting the next trending move.The bulls could not sustain the breakout above $5.5899, and Polkadot's DOT plunged back below this level on Nov. 25. This trapped the aggressive bulls who may have been forced to cover their positions in a hurry.Due to this, and the aggressive selling by the bears, the DOT/USD pair plummeted below the 20-day EMA ($4.91) on Nov. 26. The failure to defend this support is a negative sign and suggests that the bulls are not buying the dips anymore.There was a bounce off the 50-day SMA ($4.46), but the bulls are finding it difficult to sustain the price above the 20-day EMA.If the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA, the pair could drop to $3.80, then to the critical support at $3.5321. The flattish moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest that the pair could remain range-bound for a few more days.Stellar Lumens (XLM) formed a Doji candlestick pattern on Nov. 25 that had a long wick. This suggests aggressive selling by the bears at higher levels. The bears continued their selling on the next day, and the altcoin plunged to $0.145377, just above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.140209.The bulls purchased the dip on Nov. 26 and are currently attempting to resume the uptrend. However, the higher levels are again likely to attract selling.After the large trending moves of the past few days, the volatility is likely to reduce, and the XLM/USD pair could consolidate in a range for a few days.This view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.122) or the bulls propel the price above $0.231655.The bulls could not sustain Binance Coin (BNB) above $33.3888 on Nov. 25, and the price dipped back below the $32 support. This could have trapped several bulls who had purchased on the breakout above the $32–to–$33.3888 zone.Aggressive selling by the bears and liquidation by the bulls on Nov. 26 pulled the price down to $26.35, just above the critical support at $25.6652. If the bears sink the price below this support, the BNB/USD pair could plummet to $19.However, the crisscrossing moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory do not suggest a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. Therefore, if the price rebounds off $25.6652, the pair may remain range-bound for a few more days.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

411,"Since its launch approximately 12 years ago, Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a number of bull and bear cycles, each greater than the last. What drives these cycles, however? Decred co-founder Jake Yocom-Piatt has claimed that the answer lies within the human brain. “Bitcoin’s bull and bear cycles are functions of generic human psychology, attention spans, and its deterministic and diminishing issuance,” Yocom-Piatt told Cointelegraph.Over the years, various parties have argued different cases for Bitcoin’s cycles, including PlanB’s stock-to-flow model, which projects future Bitcoin prices based on its programmed halving events every four years.Bitcoin is unlike any asset before it. Its programmed finite supply and ease of movement allow for borderless value storage.One might wonder, though, whether Bitcoin’s nature as a programmed asset dictates its price cycles on some level, especially since its mining reward cuts in half every four years, essentially putting fewer Bitcoin on the market each time a block is mined. Its ultimate 21 million supply cap may also factor into the equation.“The rate of supply of Bitcoin is constantly shrinking as a percentage of the total circulation, with the addition of a substantial supply shock every halvening,” Yocom-Piatt explained.Bitcoin recently flirted with its 2017 all-time high near $20,000, receiving its fair share of mainstream media coverage in the process."
412,"As cryptocurrency investment becomes more and more popular, long-term investors are increasingly concerned with the uncomfortable question: What happens to your Bitcoin (BTC) when you die? According to a 2020 study by the Cremation Institute, nearly 90% of crypto owners are worried about what will happen to their crypto after they pass away. Furthermore, despite a high level of concern, crypto holders are reportedly four times less likely to use wills for inheritances than non-crypto investors.As explained in its white paper, Bitcoin is a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash, allowing online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.As a distributed network, Bitcoin has no central authority to control user funds, so no one but the owners themselves can control their assets.Consequently, millions of dollars in crypto is being lost each year through the deaths of its owners. Crypto insurance firm Coincover estimates that around 4 million Bitcoin, or $68 billion at publishing time, is out of circulation after access was lost, with a large portion likely caused by death.But this doesn’t mean that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can't be bequeathed and will inevitably be buried forever with the deceased owner.In fact, there are a number of ways for investors to bequeath their crypto to the next generation, but each method requires some decision-making and planning, as well as some general knowledge about how crypto works.Sharing keys with trusted family members is probably one of the most straightforward methods to passing on your crypto. Some of the most prominent people in the crypto industry have publicly claimed to use this method to ensure their crypto fortune gets passed on.Hal Finney, an early supporter of Bitcoin and recipient of the first Bitcoin transaction from BTC creator Satoshi Nakamoto, willed his crypto holdings to his children by simply providing his keys. About a year before his death in 2014, Finney wrote:This crypto inheritance practice is straightforward but may not be suitable for everyone in the crypto community. This way of bequeathing Bitcoin could be also considered risky, as shared keys come with the responsibility of keeping those assets secure. If you choose this method, be sure that your heirs are aware of the plan and some best practices for crypto security. Despite the Bitcoin network itself not caring about things like inheritance, some crypto services allow family members of a deceased client to access their crypto assets. Major United States-based cryptocurrency exchange and wallet service Coinbase, for example, allows the bereaved to gain access to a family member's assets after providing a number of documents including a death certificate and a last will.Coinbase users can also name a beneficiary on their Coinbase account. However, the procedure is not supported directly through Coinbase but rather using the services of an estate planning attorney.A spokesperson for Binance — the world’s largest crypto exchange — told Cointelegraph that the company has similar policies for providing access to crypto beneficiaries but did not elaborate on the process. “The beneficiary should contact customer support directly where one of our agents can guide them through the process,” the representative said.There are also some projects that are dedicated to ensuring the inheritance of digital assets. For example, companies such as Safe Haven, Casa and TrustVerse are working on their own solutions that allow people to bequeath their crypto assets using blockchain technology and cryptography.Officially launched in September, Safe Haven's digital inheritance platform Inheriti allows users to bequeath access not only to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but also to social media profiles like Facebook and Google+. Safe Haven's CEO, Dujardin Logino, said that neither Safe Haven nor Inheriti will ever store any digital assets themselves but rather provide a service to store encrypted information to the assets in question. “It is 100% your decision who gets a Safe Key since Safe Haven or the platform Inheriti has no idea what you are encrypting,” said Logino.Logino told Cointelegraph that Inheriti has been gaining more traction amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic:While specialized services may offer a tailor-made solution to the crypto inheritance problem, they are generally in their early stages of development and also charge a fee. According to Logino, each backup share by Safe Haven costs about $20 to $40 in the firm’s native token, SHA. A standard edition solution also charges a $5 monthly subscription."
413,"Bitcoin (BTC) continues to convert some of its harshest traditional critics from mainstream finance as Bloomberg admits that this bull run is nothing like 2017. In an article on Nov. 27, the publication known for its pessimism highlighted a range of Bitcoin metrics pointing to a bullish future — despite Thursday’s $3,000 price rout.Included as evidence were record-high Bitcoin futures open interest, non-zero wallet numbers, hash rate and the lack of correlation between Bitcoin and other macro assets.“Just look at market technicals and Wall Street’s growing embrace of the world’s biggest digital currency,” it began.Bloomberg referenced what it describes as “crypto diehards” who reject the idea that the current price gains are another bubble. Among them was regular Cointelegraph contributor, Mati Greenspan.“It’s different now,” he commented.A separate interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday meanwhile saw Antoni Trenchev, CEO of the world's biggest crypto lender Nexo, forecast Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high by the end of 2020, adding:The lack of criticism contained in the article echoes growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a genuine asset, whether investment interest is coming from retail or institutional circles.Part of the cryptocurrency’s positive image stems from its now eight-month growth spurt versus its March crash, during which it has consistently outperformed other macro assets. Even after its retreat to $17,000, Bitcoin’s year-to-date returns stand at 135%, against 19% for gold and 12% for the S&P 500, data from analytics resource Skew confirms.In the case of Gold, Mike McGlone, the Bloomberg Intelligence chief strategist who has long diverged from the broader narrative to be fully bullish on Bitcoin, believes that institutions will continue to pile in to cryptocurrency going forward.“Is Bitcoin replacing gold? Futures and fund flows are saying Yes — Rising futures open interest and investor inflows in Bitcoin vs. the same declining for gold indicate the cryptocurrency gaining an edge for price appreciation, in our view,” he tweeted earlier this week.McGlone subsequently added that gold would likely see a rebound next year, with the precious metal “favorably tilted” towards regaining $2,000.“Dipping into support layers toward the end of November should provide a foundation for further gold price gains,” he wrote on Friday."
414,"Earlier this week, Lithuania's tax service, the Lithuanian State Tax Inspectorate, added $7.6 million dollars to the state budget through the sale of cryptocurrencies seized in criminal investigations. The occasion marked the first time that the Lithuanian government liquidated confiscated cryptocurrencies. In doing so, the country joined the growing number of jurisdictions worldwide that have auctioned off or sold cryptos obtained by the long arm of the law. However, unlike the United States Federal Marshals, which netted $37 million at auction from confiscated crypto last February, the STI opted to sell the crypto through an exchange. According to Linas Rajackas, CEO of Vilnius-based crypto startup Kaiserex, this seemed to work out in the regulator's favor:The STI chose Kaiserex as a technology partner for selling the cryptocurrency via a public tender. STI head Edita Janušienė told Cointelegraph:According to Janušienė, the crypto sale started on Nov. 18 and took nearly 24 hours to complete, with the STI eventually adding more than 6.4 million euro to the state budget. The rypto was initially confiscated by a local court. While Janušienė confirmed the partnership Kaiserex, she did not elaborate as to why the regulator shied away from the auction model.Rajackas speculated that “[the STI] have consulted with professionals in the field and it was obvious that selling at large OTC desks would be much more profitable than doing it in an auction. Auction in comparison is a very bad choice, because you can not know in advance a good day to sell, set the price or back off.”Kaiserex completed the sale through an over-the-counter desk at a major cryptocurrency exchange. Rajackas said, “I can not tell the OTC desk that we used, what I can tell is that it is in the top five crypto exchanges worldwide.” At publishing time, the top five crypto exchanges on CoinMarketCap are Binance, Huobi Global, Coinbase Pro, Kraken and Bithumb.The sale involved about 337 Bitcoin (BTC), 360 Ether (ETH) and nearly 12,000 Monero (XMR). Each cryptocurrency was sold at a market price on the day of the trade, with one BTC priced at 15,100 euros ($17,900), one ETH at 400 euros ($480), and one XMR at 99.6 euro ($119).The bull market, in which Bitcoin briefly broke the $19,000 threshold, was one reason the sale was so profitable, according to Rajackas. “This made it possible to sell the available cryptocurrency at record prices and extract the maximum amount of euros,” Rajackas said, adding:Kaiserex is a cryptocurrency exchange acting as a broker connected to more than 40 crypto exchanges and multiple OTC desks. Rajackas, who owns 100% of the company shares, says that Kaiserex is not listed on major crypto websites like CMC because it does not have internal order books and relies on other exchanges for liquidity.The company reportedly plans to continue working with the Lithuanian institutions on similar cryptocurrency deals and support the Lithuanian central bank in its digital currency efforts."
415,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $16,900 again on Nov. 27 across top exchanges, including Binance. The recent pullback comes as whale exchange deposits started to increase.Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, reported that the All Exchange Inflows Mean indicator reached the “danger zone.” Historically, this caused BTC to suffer short-term corrections.After the price of Bitcoin briefly dropped to $16,200 on Nov. 27, it started to show some signs of recovery. It remained above the $17,000 level for over 11 hours before another leg down.Following the sharp drop of Bitcoin, a low volatility price range was expected. The earlier drop on Nov. 26 to $16,200 decimated exchange order books, particularly in the futures market. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of futures contracts were liquidated within several hours, as Cointelegraph Markets reported.But as soon as whales began to deposit BTC to exchanges, the price started to fall. This suggests that there have  likely been many traders buying the dip in the derivatives market who could be getting squeezed out. Ki wrote on Nov. 27:Some traders, like the pseudonymous Bitcoin investor known as “Bitcoin Jack,” predicted this scenario. He said that investors would likely rush to buy the dip early, leading to another drop.On Nov. 26, after predicting a blow-off top near the all-time high, the trader said:Following up on the initial prediction, the trader also said that Bitcoin would likely drop or consolidate for a week before it begins grinding upwards.The expectations of the short-term Bitcoin bottom varies. Some traders expect the $16,000 level to hold, while others anticipate $15,000 and even $14,000.A pseudonymous trader known as “Beatlorion” said a drop below $15,000 has become a possibility. Although BTC might not drop that low, the trader said that he feels more confident shorting than longing in this environment. He said:Meanwhile, popular Bitcoin trader Tone Vays said on Nov. 25 that he expects Bitcoin to eventually drop even further to the $14,000 support level. As Cointelegraph Markets reported, this $14,000 zone should serve as crucial support, as it marked the top of the bull cycle in summer 2019. "
416,"New data suggests that “wholecoiners” — Bitcoin wallets holding 1 BTC or more — now account for 95% of the cryptocurrency’s entire capitalization. That leaves just 5% of the market cap divided among tens of millions of users with a balance below 1BTC.The total number of wholecoiner addresses has steadily increased year-over-year since 2009, despite BTC's astronomic price rallies. On Nov. 27, Glassnode CTO Rafael Shultze-Kraft tweeted a chart revealing that more than 800,000 addresses currently hold at least 1 BTC.The number of #Bitcoin ""wholecoiner"" addresses (holding ≥ 1 BTC) on this day every year

Data: https://t.co/VJm4nRFKp8 pic.twitter.com/6VJff2vB3rAccording to Bit Info Charts, wholecoiner addresses represent around $301 billion worth of BTC. By contrast, the current combined value of less-than-wholecoin addresses is $16 billion.A linear chart reveals few retracements in the history of wholecoiners, with the largest dip coming in early 2016 when the number of addresses holding at least 1 BTC fell by 13.5%, from 520,000 to 450,000.The year 2018 also saw wholecoiner growth stagnate, with the number of addresses oscillating between roughly 720,000 and 690,000 for 12 months from December 2017.According to Into The Block, 32.95 million Bitcoin addresses currently hold some value of BTC, suggesting that wholecoiners represent just 0.47% of balance-bearing Bitcoin wallets."
417,"Crypto index fund provider Stack Funds has labeled yesterday’s pullback as a “healthy correction” that was needed before Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory. Bitcoin (BTC) broke through $19,000 earlier this week after posting seven weeks of consecutive gains. According to the firm, the crypto has been at overbought levels since October, further supporting the need for a correction.The firm examined metrics around market psychology and says market participants are currently in the “belief” stage of the cycle, which will eventually flow into a “euphoria” stage.To support its claims, the fund cites Glassnode’s data on Bitcoin’s net unrealized profit/loss, often referred to as NUPL, which compares BTC’s current price with when each coin last moved on the chain.Historically, when the number of people in profit has surged above 95%, the fund explained, it has been a good indicator of market tops. Color-mapping the parameters in percentiles with various market states allows for a breakdown of Bitcoin’s macrocycles — with ""euphoria"" being greater than 75%, ""belief"" 50% to 75%, ""optimism"" 25% to 50%, ""hope"" 0% to 25% and ""capitulation"" less than 0%.The state of “belief,” which Bitcoin has just passed into this month, held for more than a year during the 2017 bull market, causing BTC price to rise from $850 to almost $20,000 — representing an increase of 2,250%.Extrapolating the 2017 bull market pattern to BTC’s current state, the fund suggested that even a quarter of this price increase would see Bitcoin hitting more than $86,000 next year, by the time we enter the euphoria stage of the cycle.Other analysts also believe this is nothing more than a blip on the road, with Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan speculating that the correction may have already bottomed out, adding:Crypto personality Lark Davis pointed out this morning that it didn’t take long for support levels to stop the correction at $16,500, asking, “Was this the dip? Or are we going lower?”Crypto trader “Mayne of Tether” told his more than 70,000 Twitter followers the pullback is going to create some excellent buy-in opportunities for altcoins. Another trader account called “Teklordz” tweeted that the retracement is essential:#bitcoin
35 day pump. Now cooling off. This pullback is greatly needed. Daily RSI receding to mid level territory.
I have a feeling the the next pump will be even stronger.Data from analytics platform Santiment indicated that profit-taking among Bitcoin holders could become rampant, with both short-term and long-term Bitcoin holders in profit of 15% and 63%, respectively."
418,"According to data collected from over 1,000 crypto social media channels, the average crowd sentiment towards Bitcoin (BTC) adapted from slightly bullish to overwhelmingly bullish in the days leading up to Thursday’s dramatic pullback, mirroring the levels previously observed during its May and August price tops, respectively. The latest findings by Santiment, published in Cointelegraph Consulting’s biweekly newsletter, indicated that with both short-term and long-term Bitcoin holders in a position of 15% and 63% profit, the likelihood of profit-taking became high. To make matters more ominous, the funding rate on Bitcoin’s derivatives market was at a three-month high on Bitmex, Kraken and Binance. The funding rate is the price paid by one side of perpetual contracts to the other, helping to keep the price of contracts trading close to the underlying reference price. A large funding rate is a sign that there is a large increase in long predictions on the exchanges, which can accelerate the frequency of mass-liquidations in the event of a price correction.Other news from around the legislative and enterprise blockchain world showed fashion is becoming a target for blockchain solutions with VeChain powering a streetwear collection and IBM reaching a partnership with a textile giant.

419,"Cypherpunk Holdings (CSE:HODL), a privacy-focused Canadian investment company, has upped its stake in Bitcoin (BTC). The company disclosed Thursday that it has added 72.979 BTC to its reserves since June 30, 2020.Cypherpunk funded the acquisition by liquidating its holdings of Monero (XMR) and Ethereum (ETH), as well as through partial proceeds from a private placement of CA$505,000, or $388,000, closed on Aug. 27.With the purchase, Cypherpunk now has 276.479 BTC in its reserves, making it the ninth-largest public Bitcoin holder. At current values, Cypherpunk’s stake in BTC is worth just under $4.8 million.At the time of writing, at least 14 publicly-traded companies held Bitcoin on their books. Combined, their holdings amount to 66,896.59 BTC, or $1.2 billion. That’s equivalent to roughly 3.2% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply.Cypherpunk Holdings, which trades on the Canadian Securities Exchange, has several privacy-focused businesses on its books, including Wasabi Wallet and Samourai Wallet. The company also invests in Hydro66, a green cloud infrastructure platform, and smart contract protocol Chia Network.The company is run by Antanas Guoga, or Tony G, a Lithuanian businessman, politician and former professional poker player. He now serves as an elected member of the Seimas, the legislative branch of the Lithuanian government. Previously, he served as a member of European Parliament for Lithuania. It appears that more public companies are converting their cash holdings into Bitcoin as a more suitable store of value. MicroStrategy, which has converted most of its cash holdings into Bitcoin, is the most prominent example of this trend. The company now sits on 38,250 BTC after nearly doubling its holdings over the summer. Galaxy Digital is the second-largest public Bitcoin holder at 16,402 BTC, followed by Square’s 4,709 BTC.Cypherpunk did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
420,"With Bitcoin's (BTC) recent price movements drawing fresh attention to the blockchain industry, conversations centered around cryptocurrency have once again begun to see an uptick. Google Trends data shows that searches for the term “Bitcoin” have increased to yearly highs following the asset's rally above $19,000. Given the current circumstances, discussion centered around Bitcoin, general questions about blockchain and cryptocurrencies may come up at the Thanksgiving table. Yet while the crypto community has a lot to be thankful for this year, newcomers and the crypto curious may want to know more about the space than just the price of Bitcoin. With this in mind, leading experts shared some ways to explain certain Bitcoin and blockchain topics to friends and family this holiday.If you’ve ever ventured down the crypto rabbit hole, there is a good chance that your friends and family will ask you about Bitcoin and its function as a currency.Tim Draper – the famous venture capitalist and legendary Bitcoin investor – told Cointelegraph that it’s best to let crypto newcomers know that Bitcoin is a trusted currency that isn't subject to government control. “Bitcoin isn’t subject to the whims of a government that will freely flood the market with 13 trillion of them, diluting yours,” he said.Draper further mentioned that retailers who accept Bitcoin don’t have to pay between 2% to 4% each time a debit card is swiped. Lower transaction fees are indeed one of the main benefits for retailers that accept cryptocurrency. According to findings from research firm Forrester and BitPay – a Bitcoin payment service provider – retailers that accept cryptocurrencies via BitPay only pay a 1% fee on purchases. The report states, “The composite merchant avoids 2.25% in transaction fees (based on primarily US rates) for every transaction completed using BitPay.”Additionally, Draper mentioned how important it is that Bitcoin is borderless:The borderless nature of Bitcoin is extremely important, especially in countries suffering from high inflation rates and economic turmoil. For example, in countries like Argentina the demand for Bitcoin is on the rise as foreign debt accumulates.While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are volatile by nature, many tend to think that crypto market prices are based purely on supply and demand. However, this is only part of the equation.Bill Barhydt, the CEO of Abra — a peer-to-peer payments platform that supports over 70 cryptocurrencies — told Cointelegraph that the price of Bitcoin is currently going up because the supply is being outpaced by demand. However, Barhydt noted that Bitcoin’s price is also being influenced by institutional interest:Barhydt further noted that retail interest is growing and therefore the price of Bitcoin is increasing. For example, one of the most notable wins for crypto this year has been PayPal’s announcement of support for the technology. “The bottom line is that this combination of retail and institutional buying is eating up the supply of Bitcoin at an accelerating rate,” Barhydt said.Oftentimes there is confusion regarding the differences between blockchain and cryptocurrencies when discussing the topic with newcomers.Alistair Rennie, IBM Blockchain’s general manager, told Cointelegraph that the main difference between blockchain and cryptocurrency is that blockchain is a technology underpinning cryptocurrency, while cryptocurrency is a monetary asset.Rennie further mentioned that blockchain as a technology enables trust to be established and maintained among different parties. According to Rennie, this is possible due to the unique capabilities of blockchain to independently verify data for everyone involved with a transaction. As such, this makes blockchain useful for solving business problems outside of the cryptocurrency realm. Rennie explained:Due to blockchain’s unique capabilities, Rennie noted that all users can look towards the blockchain as a single source of truth. In addition, he pointed out that blockchains never rely on third-parties to mediate transactions, giving users more control over their data and who is allowed to see it. “Blockchain has numerous uses beyond cryptocurrency where trust and data accuracy are important,” he remarked.In regards to cryptocurrency, Barhydt of Abra told Cointelegraph that it’s best to explain cryptocurrencies as the idea of decentralized software based systems for storing and moving value between people or entities. “Decentralized means that no one owns it, there is no centralized or trusted third party required in the middle of any transaction and there is no off switch except for the Internet itself,” he said.In the case of Bitcoin and its blockchain network, Barhydt noted that blockchain helps address the double spend problem, ensuring that individuals cannot spend or send the same Bitcoin more than once. “A blockchain represents an immutable database of transactions throughout a cyrpotcurrency's history,” he elaborated.A key thing worth mentioning this Thanksgiving is that cryptocurrency appears to be headed towards mainstream adoption. Recent statistics show that over 55 million crypto wallets have been created. It’s also been reported that millions of dollars have been spent using crypto debit cards.Moreover, PayPal’s recent support for cryptocurrency could help bring digital currencies to the masses. PayPal chief executive Dan Schulman stated during an interview with CNBC that cryptocurrencies will eventually go mainstream as businesses and consumers flock to digital payments and digital forms of currency. Schulman also pointed out that the COVID19 pandemic has led to a decline in cash payments, noting that “40 to 70% of consumers no longer want to handle cash.”"
421,"The Bitcoin (BTC) price failed to blast through the $20,000 level this week, but multiple records related to volume and open interest were made on the way up to $19,484. One notable achievement was the open interest on aggregated futures contracts reaching $7.4 billion at derivatives exchanges. As depicted above, there has been a 110% increase over the past six months, and it is also worth noting that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange now holds over $1.1 billion of these contracts. This data is indisputable evidence of the growing institutional participation in BTC markets.The total cryptocurrency market volume also reached a record high on Nov. 24. Some investors might infer that this is a bullish event, but it’s important to remember that every trade has a buyer and a seller. Therefore, how can the entry of large sellers be deemed as bullish?The total volume on every spot exchange reached $285 billion this week but there is always the possibility that some of these exchanges may have inflated their volumes. Despite this, $285 billion represents an 11% increase compared to the March 13 peak.Bitcoin options markets also established a new open interest high yesterday. These are the contracts that a buyer pays upfront for either buying (calls) or selling (puts) at a predetermined price in the future.Take notice how BTC options current $5 billion open interest represents a 316% increase from the $1.2 billion level just six months ago. Even though this includes both call and put options, this impressive liquidity increase is a positive event.Higher open interest tends to draw attention to new arbitrage desks and open doors for larger institutional clients. Still, to better assess how professional traders are pricing to continue the current bull run, one should analyze the options 25% delta skew.A positive 25% delta skew indicates put (sell) options cost more than similar call (buy) options, thus indicating bearish sentiment. On the other hand, a negative skew suggests bullishness.The above chart shows that the Nov. 24 figure at -27.5% virtually matches its all-time low. Indisputably, this is an extremely bullish condition and the data indicates that options traders are unwilling to sell upside protection.Therefore, even though the $20,000 level has yet to be broken, there is enough reason to celebrate a healthy market with no signs of excessive leverage or diminished investor interest.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
422,"Launched nearly 12 years ago, Bitcoin (BTC) is known for its often volatile market cycles. Though some feel that Bitcoin's position as a store of value keeps these cycles fairly consistent, Rob Viglione, co-founder and CEO of Horizen, disagrees.“The only consistent thing about Bitcoin and crypto markets is a large degree of uncertainty,” Viglione told Cointelegraph. “We’re witnessing, in real-time, the birth of an industry, the birth of a new monetary system, and the birth of a new peer-to-peer economy; creating a new world is messy business.”Bitcoin is decentralized, borderless, and untied to any government. Holders can send and receive it quickly, as well as pseudonymously. It also touts a finite maximum supply, listed publicly. Based on its code, the coin automatically decreases the amount of new Bitcoin entering the ecosystem every four years until the full supply has hit circulation.Analyst PlanB built a stock-to-flow model projecting future prices for Bitcoin based on these halving events. Such a school of thought leaves room for some possible level of consistency for Bitcoin’s market cycles, at least logically. The human component of the equation, however, stirs the pot, creating uncertainty, according to Viglione.“Sure, the Bitcoin money supply path is entirely prescribed from its genesis — everyone knows to a high degree of certainty exactly how much Bitcoin exists today and how much will exist tomorrow, but the demand side is entirely uncertain and swings wildly,” he posited. “Uncertainty will naturally decrease with mass adoption and real-world utility, but it sure is exciting to be part of this industry in its infancy.”MyEtherWallet CEO and founder, Kosala Hemachandra, does not see consistency in Bitcoin’s market cycles either. “We humans tend to see patterns especially in the trading world,” he said, subsequently labeling the tendency apophenia.Bull cycles, for Bitcoin as well as other assets, can also play out as a result of other drivers, such as technological developments or popularity, Hemachandra explained.Speaking of popularity, Bitcoin has surfed many headlines in recent days as it recently traded within spitting distance of its all-time high."
423,"Analysts say a larger Bitcoin (BTC) price pullback or a consolidation period could occur. The two factors that could trigger more downside include increasing whale activity and short-term resistance.As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin crashed after it surpassed $19,400 across major exchanges. It dropped to below $16,400 before slightly recovering. But analysts foresee another possible drop incoming, especially if BTC does not rebound strongly in the near term.Two key trends caused the recent Bitcoin correction. First, whales began to sell BTC at around $19,000, resulting in a downside volatility spike. Second, this relatively small price drop triggered a cascading wave of liquidations in an overleveraged futures market.Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, said that more corrections might come in the short term. The All Exchanges Inflow Mean indicator, for instance, is still hovering at a high level, suggesting that there is still a lot of selling pressure in the market. He said:The timing of the sell-off from whales is noteworthy because it comes after BTC rejected a crucial resistance area. A pseudonymous trader known as “CryptoKea” has discussed the resistance level under the Mayer Multiple Price Bands since early November.If history rhymes, the trader said that a bigger correction is likely. Such a trend would still be in line with previous bull cycles when BTC dropped 30%–40% before continuing its rally. The trader said:In the near term, the key support for Bitcoin is found at $16,000. Below it, the next major support areas to watch are $14,000 and $13,500.Philip Swift, the creator of Lookintobitcoin.com, said that the Golden Ratio Multiplier indicator showed a rejection of the 350-DMA resistance.The Golden Ratio Multiplier identifies $16,000 and $13,000 as crucial support levels, similar to the Mayer Multiple. Swift said:Based on the two indicators, if Bitcoin rebounds and consolidates above $16,000, then a relief rally to the next areas of resistance is possible. If not, BTC is at risk of testing the $13,000–$14,000 support range."
424,"Bybit announced Thursday that it will roll out a BTC/USD quarterly futures contract on Nov. 30. Two contracts will be offered at launch — BTCUSD1225, settling on Dec. 25, 2020, and BTCUSD0326, which will be settled on March 26, 2021.Bybit says the new futures contracts have no funding fee, which means traders can hold the position without charge as long as the contracts are still in effect.Like traditional futures contracts, Bitcoin (BTC) futures allow traders to buy and sell the digital currency at a predetermined price at a specific future date.Bybit isn’t the first crypto trading platform to offer quarterly Bitcoin futures. Binance, a Malta-based exchange with the highest daily volume, launched its quarterly BTC futures contracts in January.Demand for crypto derivatives is on the rise as more institutional investors come into the fold. Recent data from Wilshire Phoenix suggest that CME Bitcoin futures are having a significant impact on the digital currency’s price.The report claimed:Launched in December 2017, CME Bitcoin futures are now the second-largest BTC futures exchange by open interest. The top spot belongs to OKEx, according to data analytics firm Skew.Institutions are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a long-term investment opportunity. The likes of Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller have also thrown their weight behind the flagship digital currency, potentially signaling a shift in institutional thinking."
425,"Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin has appeared to express support for the further development of the local cryptocurrency market.At a recent governmental meeting held on Nov. 26, Mishustin proposed the introduction of legal protections for crypto holders in the country in order to contribute to the growth of the new industry.According to Mishustin, such a framework would develop the industry in a “civilized way so that the owners of such assets can protect their rights and interests,” while at the same time preventing “shadow schemes.” As part of the plan, Mishustin proposed amending the Russian Tax Code to recognize cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) as property, stating:Mishustin replaced Russia’s former prime minister Dmitry Medvedev in January 2020, whereupon he urged the country to prioritize the development of a digital economy. However, the current status of the local crypto ecosystem remains in doubt because the government is planning to officially ban payments in crypto in January 2021. Russian authorities also want to introduce prison terms for failing to report annual crypto transactions of about $600,000.Meanwhile, major Russian financial institutions are rushing to launch crypto and blockchain-related services abroad. On Nov. 19, Gazprombank Switzerland, a subsidiary of one of the largest banks in Russia, debuted its Bitcoin transaction service following regulatory approval by Swiss regulators. "
426,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been seeing significant momentum in previous weeks as its price was approaching the precious $20,000 all-time high. However, an abrupt end came to this glorious rally, with Bitcoin price crashing severely over the past 24 hours.While most investors were celebrating a potential new all-time high, the price of Bitcoin dropped from $19,500 to $16,300, a drop of 15% in less than 24 hours. The majority of the crypto markets also followed suit with alts in the deep red across the board on Nov. 26.The crucial area to hold between $18,400 and $18,700 was lost. This area was vital as support due to several reasons. The first one is the immediate failure of the uptrend.If Bitcoin’s price dropped below this support level, it means that the uptrend of flipping every previous resistance to support failed.As the chart shows, the breakdown caused a downward chain reaction. This is the second reason, as losing that level triggered many stop/losses fueling the drop.Previously, many traders likely anticipated a further up-move, as the funding rates were favorable on most exchanges. This breakdown and the imminent chain reaction of stop/loss triggers are a typical outcome of a trend reversal.Indeed, it’s quite common that market corrections don’t happen in a smooth manner. They are often vertical and painful. Staircase up, elevator down.The weekly chart of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization often shows a much clearer perspective.In this manner, the total market cap reached the 1.618 Fibonacci level, where it hit resistance, similar to the $600 billion range.More importantly, the total market cap established a new higher high and broke above the previous resistance zone at $400 billion.This breakout above $400 billion was the first breakout in more than two years, as this level served as a difficult hurdle for the past few years.Therefore, a correction back to this resistance level to confirm as new support should be almost expected and certainly healthy at the start of a new bull cycle.More importantly, a correction toward this level would also line up with the 0.35–0.382 Fibonacci region, which is often used by traders and investors to look for a potential entry.The Bitcoin price chart shows a breakdown below the $18,500–$18,800 area and that’s immediately the most important resistance to break if the market is to turn bullish again.Regardless, the region between $15,800 and $16,300 is a crucial support zone to hold and is currently holding as one on the daily timeframe.In that light, a new range is established. As long as Bitcoin sustains support above $15,800–$16,300, the bull market is likely to resume.However, if it fails to hold support, a further correction toward $13,800–$14,200 should be expected next. This level is the summer 2019 high, where the next bullish support/resistance flip can occur.On the higher timeframes, $18,000–$18,200 is the first clear hurdle to break, as that was the level the price of Bitcoin failed to break earlier today on the rebound. If that breaks, the next area to watch is $18,400–$18,800, at which today’s downward chain reaction began.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
427," After a five-week-long suspension of all user withdrawals, cryptocurrency exchange OKEx  resumed normal services at 8:00 am UTC on Nov. 26.Having announced the re-opening last week, OKEx then indicated it would be launching a compensation and rewards program to express its gratitude to customers for holding out during the disruption. These programs include commission rebate cards denominated in Tether (USDT), a one-time compensation payment based on users’ asset and transaction histories, and a doubling of the asset weight calculation for holders of the exchange’s native token, OKB.Despite these efforts, today’s data shows that the programs have not been enough to forestall users from withdrawing their funds, having apparently lost confidence in the exchange.While withdrawals have not been open for long, some telling initial data is emerging on social media transaction trackers. Mason Jang, the chief operating officer of Crypto Quant, tweeted:#OKEx stats

- OKex BTC Reserve: 101,686 => 98,821 BTC
- 2,822 BTC outflows has been occurred
- 446 BTC moved to #Binance
- 54 Accounts withdrew their $BTC

Source: https://t.co/tAPwJdhpw4 pic.twitter.com/dkWOsQh8ZZMore data from CryptoQuant shows that “the first OKEx outflow after the withdrawal opening hit 2,822 BTC by the block time frame,” which is “the year-high in the block time frame”:Crypto tracking service Whale Alert also traced at least a couple of high-value transactions within an hour of withdrawals opening:198,467 #OKB (1,033,580 USD) transferred from #OKEx to #FTX

Tx: https://t.co/yW7WeHlLaUAs reported, OKEx had suspended withdrawals on Oct. 16 while one of the holders of the exchange’s private keys cooperated with an investigation led by authorities and was therefore unable to authorize transactions within the hot wallet system. The exchange has maintained it was not involved in any illegal activities, although there have been reports that its founder, Star Xu, had been questioned by police that same week.The sudden withdrawal suspension in mid-October caused significant volatility in the markets at the time, prompting a dip of 3% in Bitcoin’s (BTC) trading price. With outflows continuing from the exchange to other exchanges and wallets, bearish sentiment is circling in the market. BTC/USD has just lost support at $17,000, reporting its largest losses since March."
428,"Bitcoin (BTC) price fell by a whopping 16% to $16,334 on Nov. 26 since achieving its peak at $19,484 the previous day. Data suggests that cascading liquidations were the driving force of the massive correction.Prior to the pullback, the open interest of the Bitcoin futures market hit a new record high. The derivatives market was also overheated with buyers, causing the market to sway to one side.The combination of two factors triggered a rapid BTC price drop alongside a spike in futures trading volume.Over a billion dollars worth of futures contracts were liquidated, similar to the March 12 crash. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, for example, saw $1.8 billion in volume — its highest ever, according to Skew.As the price of Bitcoin started to drop, inflows into exchanges spiked. This indicates that whales, or high-net-worth investors, were selling heavily on major exchanges, including Coinbase.Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, pointed out that the All Exchanges Inflow Mean indicator was showing the selling pressuring coming from whales.Initially, the sell-off from whales caused the price of Bitcoin to drop to around $18,000. But, because there was likely a large number of overleveraged long contracts, it led to a massive long squeeze.Within several hours, Bitcoin declined to as low as $16,334, posting a March-like crash. Data suggests that nearly $1.9 billion worth of futures contracts were liquidated on the day.According to Glassnode, an on-chain market data analysis firm, Binance Futures saw the largest spikes in liquidations of $425 million in just two hours at 3 am and 8 am UTC.Hourly liquidations of long positions on #Binance:

- $262M at 3am UTC
- $163M at 8am UTC#Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/iVmD4TXCpZMassive price swings following a minor initial pullback were largely expected because of the high funding rates. The market has been overwhelmingly long on buying BTC since early November, which increased the risk of a sharp BTC correction.Order books of major exchanges were obliterated and as a result, the cryptocurrency market saw a massive short-term correction.There are three potential scenarios for Bitcoin in the near term. First, it could recover relatively quickly to $18,000. Second, it could continue declining to the next major support area at $13,700. Third, it could range, allowing the derivatives market to stabilize.But, there is one concerning metric. Glassnode found that the number of Bitcoin whales has hit a new all-time high.This means that there is still large potential selling pressure that could come from high-net-worth investors. The analysts at Glassnode said on Nov. 25:"
429,"Bitcoin (BTC) has continued falling on Nov. 26 as selling pressure transforms into the biggest losses — in terms of U.S. dollars — since March.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView tracked BTC/USD as it lost support at $17,000 to hit fresh local lows of $16,300.At press time, a rebound had secured $16,800, but heavy volatility remained. The latest losses continue a downtrend, which began overnight on Wednesday, shortly after Bitcoin hit highs of just below $19,500.At the same time, major exchange OKEx announced that it had reinstated withdrawals. Ki Young Ju, founder of on-chain analytics service CryptoQuant, highlighted increased outflow activity from OKEx to both wallets and other exchanges“BTC flows from OKEx to all other exchanges hit 493 BTC at that time,” he wrote in his latest Twitter update.Additional bearish fuel came from Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, who commented on recent rumors that the United States plans to introduce new regulation governing self-hosted cryptocurrency wallets.“If this crypto regulation comes out, it would be a terrible legacy and have long standing negative impacts for the U.S. In the early days of the internet there were people who called for it to be regulated like the phone companies. Thank goodness they didn’t,” he warned."
430,"Analysts are pointing to demand from financial institutions and publicly listed companies as the primary forces behind Bitcoin’s (BTC) sudden retest of its all-time highs.“The primary reason for the steady grind up in Bitcon has been the increased interest and aggressive buying activity from institutions,” said Nick Cote of gamified trading platform Hxro Labs. “A lot of investors are going through Grayscale.”Rising institutional demand can be seen in heavy accumulation by Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust, with the fund’s BTC holdings exceeding 500,000 earlier this month.Cote also said that top American companies like Square and Microstrategy are “putting BTC on their books as a hedge against inflation and poor monetary policy management from the central banks.” He described this behavior as driving a “positive feedback loop” in the markets:NEM head of trading Nicholas Pelecanos agreed, stating that Bitcoin’s fundamentals are now stronger than ever before, pointing to post-halving supply dynamics, a rise in institutional adoption, and a number of “publicly listed U.S. companies moving 10% of their balance sheet into the asset.”Pelecanos is now looking to a rise in the altcoin markets, stating, “BTC is back at its all-time high levels, but what is worth noting is the valuation of the altcoins which are on average still 50% below their all-time highs.”Despite his bullish outlook for alts, Pelecanos warned that many alternative cryptocurrencies have failed to attract meaningful adoption, stating:Analysts have also pointed to bullish signals coming from the mining markets, with Glassnode chief technical officer Rafael Schultze-Kraft noting that miners have hoarded an additional 10,000 BTC since March.Are miners selling more #BTC at these prices?

I don't think so.

The Miner Unspent Supply (mined BTC that has never been moved) has been on an upwards trend since the crash in March.

431,"Bitcoin (BTC) dropped $1,000 in minutes on Nov. 26 as a long-awaited pullback hit the market at close to $19,500.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView showed BTC/USD experiencing major volatility overnight on Wednesday.After nearly hitting $19,500 during the day’s trading, after-hours saw a period of bearish indecision that ended in a sharp sell-off. Bitcoin then bounced at $17,250, capping daily losses of around 5%.Many analysts had already warned that the recent gains were due for a pullback, among them CNBC host Brian Kelly and trader Tone Vays, who forecast a dip to $14,000 on Thursday. Meanwhile, several metrics have also hinted at a looming correction. Among them is the popular Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which has remained at record-high levels throughout November.The sudden price drop came in tandem with large-volume investors depositing BTC to exchanges — presumably with the aim of taking profit near Bitcoin’s $20,000 all-time highs.“All Exchanges Inflow Mean increased a few hours ago. It indicates that whales, relatively speaking, deposited $BTC to exchanges,” Ki Young Ju, creator of on-chain analytics resource CryptoQuant, summarized to Twitter followers.Bitcoin’s fundamental indicators support the bullish theory going forward with the mining difficulty set for a 7.3% uptick in three days’ time and hash rate continuing to grow.At press time, BTC/USD circled $17,900 after a modest recovery from local lows."
432,"Despite Bitcoin’s surge to retest its 2017 highs, a combination of low on-chain transactions and diminished retail speculation has seen transaction fees remain low.The current fees of around $3.50 per transaction starkly contrast with three years ago, when the fees incurred to send any amount of BTC briefly spiked above $50. But average transaction values are currently approaching $200,000, suggesting the current rally has not been accompanied by the same retail trading frenzy that drove prices toward $20,000 in 2017.Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin doesn’t believe Bitcoin’s current low fees will last. In a Twitter thread, the Ethereum co-founder suggested that an inevitable increase in transaction fees will push out the majority of users:However, the data does not suggest high fees are likely in the current environment. To understand what is happening in the background, it is important to look at the number of transactions being processed, the value of these transactions, and how much BTC is being held long term.Bitcoin’s memory pool, similar to a waiting room for transactions, shows the current number of daily unconfirmed transactions at 38,900 — around 20% of the 2017 figures.It is worth noting that not only are the number of transactions significantly less than during the previous bull market, but this time around, there has been no increase in response to the price surge. In fact, the seven-day moving average shows an overall decline since the start of 2019.In October, the average Bitcoin transaction surpassed the 2017 high of $150,000. Ten days ago, the average was above $190,000, suggesting that although the number of transactions has decreased, those that are still transacting are wealthier individuals or organizations. Bitcoin users are also holding onto their coins rather than transacting with them this time around. The number of Bitcoin held on exchanges has been dropping fast. Data from analytics platform Glassnode Studio shows the year-to-date change is down 18% as of Nov. 21.#Bitcoin liquidity continues its downward trajectory.

433,"A new report has determined that London was the most likely place Satoshi Nakamoto worked on Bitcoin (BTC) between 2008 and 2010.Report author Doncho Karaivanov reviewed several factors in order to justify the conclusion, including an analysis of timestamps of Satoshi’s published materials, his use of regional colloquialisms and word spellings, and the fact that The Times headline embedded in the genesis block was specific to England’s print version of the periodical.The idea that Satoshi was British is not new, as hundreds of journalists, sleuths and investigators have thoroughly pored over traces of the Bitcoin creator’s activity and scoured the internet for clues leading to his origins.But this latest report in The Chain Bulletin includes additional information to previous analyses, such as highlighting the probability that Satoshi must have been referring to the print edition of The Times when coding the now-famous headline from Jan. 3, 2009 into Bitcoin’s genesis block.That’s because only the print edition of The Times distributed in England used the headline, “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,” whereas the online edition included the chancellor’s name in the headline. The U.S. edition of the paper did not contain the story at all. Karaivanov analyzed readership data that shows roughly 43% of The Times’ readership is located in London, and when “coupled with London being the largest financial hub in the world, this data makes it highly probable that Satoshi lived in London in the period between 2008 and 2010.”Karaivanov’s analysis of time-stamped materials posted by Satoshi — including posts on Bitcointalk, emails sent to Bitcoin’s early developers, and commits made to the Bitcoin repository on SourceForge — lends additional evidence that Satoshi may have resided in the United Kingdom time zone. However, he acknowledges that Satoshi’s pattern of posting could also reflect somebody who resided in the East Coast or West Coast time zones of the United States.Among the time zones ruled out completely were those encompassing Japan, where Satoshi claimed to have been from according to his P2P Foundation profile, and Australia, which Karaivanov says was “not even remotely possible” unless Satoshi was “a vampire.”The finding that Satoshi probably lived in London between the years of 2008 and 2010 was not revelatory information to some Reddit users, with one commenting: “In other breaking news, Santa Claus may have lived in the North Pole while working on toys for young children.”Not everybody in the Bitcoin industry is keen to uncover the origins or identity of Satoshi. In August, Blockstream CEO Adam Back told Cointelegraph it would be unwise for Satoshi to publicly reveal himself. Blockstream holds the position that Satoshi’s identity should not be speculated upon, as the activity runs “counter to cypherpunk ideals.”"
434,"The crypto market has been in a strong bull run over the past few days, and that has pushed Bitcoin (BTC) to its second-best day ever. Almost every trader now seems to be fixated on the magical figure of $20,000 per BTC.After such a sharp up-move, some traders are calling for a top, while others are projecting lofty targets for the future.CNBC Fast Money host Brian Kelly, for example, believes that the recent volitile moves in altcoins, overpriced Bitcoin address growth, and rising funding rates pointing to the arrival of retail traders may be a warning sign of a short to medium-term top.On the other end of the spectrum are analysts such as Off the Chain Capital chief investment officer Brian Estes who believes that Bitcoin could rally to $100,000 in one year, and even better, to $288,000 by the end of 2021.Another bullish view was projected by Gold Bullion International co-founder Dan Tapiero, who opined that Bitcoin could rally to “somewhere between $300,000 and $500,000” in the next five years.During a bull cycle, it is very easy to get sucked into making hasty decisions. Actions taken due to greed could wipe out the trading account, especially if traders use excessive leverage in a volatile market. Therefore, traders should stick to their trading strategies and mitigate risk.After the vertical rallies of the past few days, is there more steam left, or is it time for a correction? Let’s analyze the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin (BTC) broke the $19,000 barrier on Nov. 24 and is trying to inch higher toward the $20,000 mark. The formation of a Doji candlestick pattern today suggests hesitation among the bulls to buy aggressively at the current levels.However, the positive thing is that the bulls have not allowed the price to correct, even to the 20-day exponential moving average ($17,095), since the uptrend started on Oct. 8. This shows that the bulls are buying on every minor dip.Due to this incessant buying, the relative strength index (RSI) has remained in the overbought zone since Oct 21. The bears may try to stall the rally before the $20,000 level, but unless they sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the bulls remain in control.If the BTC/USD pair rises above $20,000 without a meaningful correction, then it may continue vertically, before turning around sharply. In a market with strong bullish momentum, it is foolhardy to call a top.The frenzied buying usually signals a top, but before the reversal happens, it also offers the best periods to make money to the prudent trader.Therefore, traders can book partial profits at stiff resistances and protect their remaining positions with a trailing stop-loss order to protect their paper profits.Ether (ETH) is facing profit-booking near the stiff overhead resistance at $625. However, the shallow correction shows that the bulls are not closing their positions in a hurry. The bulls may again attempt to push the price above $625 in the next few days.If they succeed, the ETH/USD pair could start its journey to the next major resistance at $800. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest that bulls are in command.However, if the ETH/USD pair turns down from the overhead resistance, the bears may sink the pair to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $526.348, and a deeper correction could extend the decline to the 50% retracement level at $496.552.XRP price soared to an intraday high at $0.780574 on Nov. 24 from a low of $0.227813 on Nov. 3, which is a 242% rally within a short time. Such vertical rallies are not sustainable. The long wick on the Nov. 24 candlestick shows profit-booking at higher levels.The RSI above 91 suggests that the markets are overheated in the short term and need to cool off. However, the long tail on today’s candlestick shows that bulls continue to buy at lower levels in anticipation of a further up-move.If the XRP/USD pair rallies above $0.780574, the uptrend could enter a blow-off phase and reach $0.96. However, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the pair may remain range-bound for a few days.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) rallied hard on Nov. 23 and 24 and broke above the $353 resistance, but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. The long wick on the Nov. 24 candlestick shows profit-booking at higher levels.The bulls again pushed the price above $353 today but are finding it difficult to sustain the higher levels. This could start a correction to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $324.13, then to the 50% retracement level at $309.44.A shallow correction will suggest that traders are not booking profits aggressively and fresh buyers are not waiting for a large correction to get in. That will increase the possibility of a resumption of the uptrend to $420, then to $500.Chainlink's LINK has been sustaining above the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern for the past few days but has failed to pick up momentum. This increases the possibility of a retest of the breakout level at $13.28.A strong rebound off $13.28 will flip it to support and could start the next leg of the up-move, which may take the LINK/USD pair to $18, then to $19.2731. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest bulls have the upper hand.This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below $13.28. Such a move would suggest that the current breakout was a bull trap. A break below the 50-day simple moving average ($11.96) will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.Litecoin (LTC) once again closed above $84.3374 on Nov. 23. However, the Doji candlestick pattern on Nov. 24 shows indecision among the bulls and the bears. This indecision has resolved to the downside today.The bears are currently attempting to sink the price back below the breakout level of $84.3374. If they succeed, the LTC/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($74).If the pair rebounds strongly off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will once again attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $93.9282. If they manage to do that, a retest of $100 will be in the cards.Conversely, a break below the 20-day EMA would suggest that the bullish momentum has weakened.Cardano's ADA surged above the $0.155 resistance on Nov. 24 and hit an intraday high at $0.1826315. However, the long wick on the day’s candlestick shows profit-booking by traders at higher levels.The bears attempted to pull the price back below the breakout level at $0.155 today, but the long tail on the candlestick shows traders are buying on dips.The ADA/USD pair has formed an inside day candlestick pattern today, which suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. This could result in a consolidation for a few days before the next trending move starts.If the bulls can propel the price above $0.20, the pair may rally to $0.24, then to $0.28. If both these levels are crossed, the rally could extend to $0.40. This bullish view will be invalidated if the price dips and sustains below $0.155.The bulls are having a tough time sustaining Polkadot's DOT above the $5.5899 level. Although the bulls pushed the price to $6.0857 on Nov. 24, they could not sustain the higher levels.The bears are currently attempting to sink and sustain the price back below $5.5899. If they succeed, the DOT/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($4.98).If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will once again try to push the price above $6.0857. If they succeed, a rally to $6.8619 will be on the cards. The upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory give the advantage to the bulls.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair could spend some more time inside the range.Binance Coin (BNB) broke above the $32–$33.3888 resistance zone on Nov. 24, but the bulls are struggling to build upon this strength. The bears are currently attempting to pull the price back below $32.If the price rebounds off $32, the BNB/USD pair could resume its up-move towards the target objective of $38.3348, which is just below the all-time high at $39.5941.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears succeed in sinking the price back below $32, it may catch off guard the aggressive bulls who have purchased the breakout. If the price sustains below $32, the pair may remain range-bound for a few more days.Stellar Lumen (XLM) has surged from $0.083684 on Nov. 20 to an intraday high of $0.231655 today, a 176% gain within a short time. The next resistance on the upside is $0.2864.The sharp rally of the past few days has pushed the RSI above the 92 level. Usually, such deeply overbought levels are not sustainable, and traders can expect a correction to start in the next few days.A vertical rally is usually followed by a sharp correction. The first support on the downside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.17513. The bulls are likely to buy this dip aggressively, and the XLM/USD pair could remain volatile for the next few days.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

435,"Bitcoin (BTC) traders are pinpointing the order books of major exchanges that show the $19,500 level is a near-term resistance level.On Nov. 25, Bitcoin price was rejected at $19,500 with a relatively large volume across top spot exchanges. On Binance, for example, BTC price hit $19,484 before seeing a slight pullback to sub-$19,300.The minor rejection likely occurred because of the stacks of sell orders between $19,450 and $19,550.A popular pseudonymous trader known as “Byzantine General” shared the order books of all major exchanges that showed $19,500 as a key area for sellers.All eyes on 19500.$BTC pic.twitter.com/fJWpyAnTcvVijay Boyapati, a Bitcoin researcher, similarly said that the $19,500–$19,550 range remains as the last sell wall before a new all-time high.Let's gooooo. Past this baby wall most prior exchange all time highs are going to get taken out very quickly pic.twitter.com/7E0gmgdgpDIf Bitcoin does not retest the $19,500 area again in the next several hours, this could mean that another drop is likely. Considering that it would be the last resistance until the new all-time high, traders expect some reaction from sellers.Another small pullback would benefit Bitcoin because it would further neutralize the futures funding rate. The funding rate of BTC futures has increased once again to 0.07% on Binance Futures and other exchanges.Considering that the average funding rate of Bitcoin is 0.01%, another short-term drop to reset the derivatives market may even strengthen the upward momentum.However, a variable to consider is that the number of shorts in the Bitcoin market is at its highest since April.In March, the price of Bitcoin crashed to below $3,600. Subsequently, it continued to climb, eventually surpassing $19,000. The rally accelerated in April when short contracts hit a yearly high.The likelihood of a short squeeze rises when the number of short contracts in the market increases. A short squeeze occurs when the price of an asset continues to go up despite the presence of significant selling pressure.This trend causes short-sellers to market-buy their positions, fueling more buying demand in the market. A pseudonymous analyst known as “Cactus” wrote:If the number of shorts continues to increase, it would also cause the futures funding rate to decline. In a way, this could make the rally more sustainable in the medium term."
436,"DeFi protocol Money on Chain, a lending platform and stablecoin issuer based on Bitcoin (BTC) sidechain RSK, announced Wednesday the launch of TEX, an automated token swap platform based on an order book — with a unique twist.Instead of being available instantaneously, orders are processed in batches according to a slightly variable interval of a few minutes. Each execution, called a tick, matches the orders submitted to the blockchain.Each trade occurring in a given tick is performed at the same average price between all orders submitted by traders. Limit orders submitted by users indicate the maximum or minimum acceptable price. For example, a limit order to sell Bitcoin for $18,000 will not be triggered if the average price is $17,900.Max Carjuzaa, CEO of Money on Chain, explained to Cointelegraph that the system also uses an oracle system for more fine-tuned control. With so-called market maker orders, traders express a price with a certain percentage offset from the reference rate obtained by the oracle. This ensures that the orders will track the changes in price occurring between ticks.The design of the system was inspired by the London Spot Fix, a pricing mechanism for gold where a committee deliberates on the price of gold two times per day.Automated market makers like Uniswap are often seen as a necessity in light of the slow performance of blockchain-based systems. When asked if these concerns drove the design of TEX, Carjuzaa replied:Front-running and price discovery are often considered major issues in AMM exchanges, but Carjuzaa also believes their system “needs much less liquidity to operate.” For the same liquidity, he claims AMMs will have more slippage compared to TEX. This benefit is “especially important in a new network, and enables organic liquidity growth.”"
437,"CNBC Fast Money trader Brian Kelly sees three potential signs of a price top as Bitcoin (BTC) hits $19,000. Both fundamental and technical factors suggest a pullback could be imminent as the rally becomes overextended.Kelly named three reasons why a short-term Bitcoin pullback might occur. The reasons were the pump of altcoins, overpriced address growth and high funding rates. On Nov. 25, he said on CNBC:As Cointelegraph reported, alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, such as XRP and Stellar (XLM) have surged steeply in recent months. Their uptrends were reminiscent of the January 2018 altcoin mania, when BTC started to pull back and altcoins rallied.During the last market peak, Bitcoin corrected strongly as altcoins rallied, and then the entire market crashed in tandem in the months that followed.Considering that major altcoins have surged 50% to 100% in recent weeks, Kelly is cautious about the altcoin market’s upsurge. He said:The rally in altcoins has been causing major problems in the cryptocurrency market. For instance, on Nov. 24, the price of XRP rallied nearly 50%, spiking above $0.90 on Coinbase. The demand increased to a point where it caused Coinbase to temporarily go down, which coincided with a drop in Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) prices.Kelly has continuously used the address growth metric of Bitcoin as a way to value BTC since 2017. When the address growth does not match the price of BTC, it could signify that BTC is overpriced.Currently, Kelly said that the market is pricing in a 25% address growth for Bitcoin in the next month. According to Kelly, this is a concerning sign that could mean that the market is overvaluing BTC in the near term. He said:Lastly, Kelly pinpointed the rising funding rates of Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts across major exchanges.When the funding rate increases, it means that the market is dominated by buyers and long-contract holders, increasing the probability of a long squeeze or a pullback. He noted:In the past two days, however, the BTC futures funding rate stabilized after Bitcoin’s price dipped from $19,400 to $18,700. But while the funding rate is still higher than usual, it is hovering at around 0.03%. For comparison, the funding rate hovered at 0.18% on major exchanges at the peak of the recent rally.98% of $BTC addresses in profit–everybody happy! pic.twitter.com/pGpqqBh7uGThe market is getting less overheated while many addresses are comfortably in profit. The combination of the two could allow the rally to continue in the near term.Google Trends data also shows that the ongoing rally has lower overall mainstream interest than three years ago, which suggests that the rally is only in its early stages. The popularity of the keyword “Bitcoin” on Google Search is only 20% of the interest seen in late 2017."
438,"On Tuesday, the bulls showed that they are in full control of the crypto market as Bitcoin (BTC) rallied to $19,418.97 and several top 10 altcoins went on a double-digit rampage to new 2020 highs.Notable performers of the day were Stellar Lumens (XLM) and XRP with a 53% and 38% gain respectively. With all the excitement and anticipation surrounding the possibility of BTC moving to $20,000, crypto traders may have missed an equally impressive performance in traditional markets.On the same day the Dow also rallied by more than 400 points to secure a new all-time high at 30,046. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq followed suit by adding 1.6% and 1.3%.According to market analysts, the development of three effective COVID-19 vaccines, record low interest rates as part of Federal Reserve policy, the possibility of a second round of economic stimulus, and the increasing pace of the transition of power between the Trump Administration and President-Elect Biden are providing a much-needed confidence boost to the markets.At the time of writing, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures are also rising higher, suggesting that today’s rally could continue at the opening bell on Wednesday.Year-to-date, the DOW is up 6.84% and the S&P 500 by 10.73%. While these are good returns for any investor’s portfolio, Bitcoin has far outperformed both, currently up by 166.67%, according to data from Skew.Surprisingly, Ether (ETH) continues to outperform the Bitcoin price. Over the past week, the top-ranked altcoin entered a parabolic rally that took the price to a 2020 high at $623.Typically, Bitcoin and Ether receive the bulk of media coverage regarding their price movements, but this week has shown that altcoins should not be overlooked.While the top two digital assets by market cap have staged an amazing rally year to date, data from social analytics data provider TheTIE shows smaller-cap altcoins are also making some serious waves.In the past 24 hours, tweet volumes for select altcoins exploded and many altcoins realized gains in their BTC, USD and USDT pairs.After such a strong rally from Bitcoin, the digital asset may enter a brief period of consolidation or even retest lower supports. Historically, in these situations, funds flow into altcoins and cause them to rally higher.If Bitcoin does enter a sideways range over the coming days, investors may repeat this practice, thus extending the current rally seen among altcoins."
439,"Gold Bullion International co-founder Dan Tapiero believes that it’s only a matter of time before Bitcoin’s (BTC) price surges into the six-figure threshold. Speaking to Anthony Pompliano on the Pomp Podcast, Tapiero asserted that in terms of price appreciation, Bitcoin is king, even though he believes investors should own both gold and Bitcoin:He went on to add, “I don’t really think that anyone in the gold world [...] they are not going to debate that.”Tapiero believes that institutional investors and finance whales are likely to invest between 5% and 15% of their portfolios in Bitcoin, and noted that the sector was currently worth $100 trillion:Bitcoin is a hedge for the fiat system, he explained, and once its market cap is in the trillions of dollars, it will become easier to handle for larger investors, similar to gold.But gold is a store of value, and that is only one aspect of what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is an entire network, and that’s why he believes it will be much bigger than gold:Other analysts are similarly bullish about Bitcoin, with Off the Chain Capital chief investment officer Brian Estes telling Reuters today that it “is not a stretch” for BTC to surpass $100,000 in one year, and predicted that it could go as high as $288,000 by the end of 2021.CNBC host Jim Cramer also believes in the future of Bitcoin, as revealed on another podcast with Pompliano. Cramer, who was a Bitcoin skeptic during the 2017 bull market, recently stated that he had since realized that Bitcoin is a good hedge against inflation and also one that his kids can understand:"
440,"Bitcoin (BTC) price extended its rally toward a new all-time high on Nov. 25 as the price surged to $19,412 in the morning trading session. Determining the actual all-time high for BTC is somewhat debatable, as various exchanges have different figures listed. For example, Coinbase has registered $19,892 as Bitcoin’s peak, whereas BitMEX and Binance have $19,891 and $19,799 respectively. Thus, for most traders, $20,000 is likely to be the primary focal point that will solidify BTC reaching a new all-time high.Pushing through the $19,000 level occurred quicker than many expected, especially after Bitcoin price plummeted to $18,000 in the evening hours on Nov. 23. This drop was nearly in tandem with XRP’s 30% drop at Coinbase after the altcoin pumped to $0.92.Data from TheTie, a social analytics data platform, shows that as Bitcoin price lost momentum on Nov. 22 and Nov. 23, trading sentiment took a noticeable hit when traders anticipated a possible retest of lower supports in the sub-$18,000 zone.According to Joshua Frank, founder of TheTIE:This suggests that regardless of strong pullbacks to $18,000 or below, the majority of people investing in or tracking the Bitcoin price still feel overwhelmingly bullish about the digital asset’s prospects when compared to historical price and sentiment data.Google Trends data also shows that searches for the term “Bitcoin” also reached a 2020 high today as the price rallied above $19,000, but the figure is nowhere near the high seen in December 2017.As shown on the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin’s flushout to $18,000 created a double bottom right at the key support, and bulls stepped in to buy the dip, causing three successive high volume spikes.At the time of writing, the price has already pulled back to restest the lower support at $18,900, and if this level fails to hold, then the next support is at $18,650, which is slightly above the 20-MA and a high volume node on the VPVR.Similar to the move up to $18,000, a period of consolidation and support-building is normal and healthy for sustaining momentum in an uptrend.According to Matt Blom, the head of global sales trading at Equos exchange:"
441,"Bitcoin's (BTC) price rose to almost $20,000 in 2017 before losing more than 80% of its value to a multi-year long bear market. In the years since, the asset has never again come close to these price highs — until now. At time of publication, crypto's first currency is once again trading a few percentage points away from its previous milestone.While crossing $20,000 may soon be celebrated as a psychologically significant threshold, Bitcoin will not actually reach its all-time high in terms of buying power at that point thanks to inflation.“If you bought #Bitcoin at the top in December 2017, you won’t truly recover your buying power until we hit 21.24k,” podcaster Vlad Costea said in a tweet on Tuesday. Costea used $20,000 as Bitcoin’s high, putting the numbers and dates into an inflation calculator to determine the most accurate figures.U.S. dollar holders lose approximately 2% of their purchasing power per year on average from inflation. Official data reveals 2.13% inflation in 2017, 2.49% in 2018, 1.76% in 2019 and 1.86% in 2020.Bitcoin’s last all-time high varied across exchanges. Coinbase's price index shows that Bitcoin reached a record high of $19,891.99 on Dec. 16, 2017. Using this number, Bitcoin must reach $21,131.02 to once again hold the same purchasing power as it did in 2017, according to Officialdata.org’s inflation calculator.Other previous historical Bitcoin levels also show inflationary impact, although not particularly notable. Bitcoin’s $1,200 level in 2013 values about $1,341 in today’s dollars.With all the United States money printing in 2020, however, the future will tell whether this year will ultimately have a greater inflationary impact on the U.S. dollar than the currently stated sub-2%."
442,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) hit $19,469 on Coinbase, reaching its highest point since its December 2017 peak. Although the dominant cryptocurrency is close to surpassing its record high, there are some warning signs to take note of.Three potential reasons Bitcoin faces the possibility of a pullback at $20,000 are a bull trap, overhead resistance and an overcrowded derivatives market.A pseudonymous cryptocurrency trader known as “Bitcoin Jack,” who called the Bitcoin bottom in March, laid out a potential bull trap scenario.The term ""bull trap"" refers to a technical pattern wherein late buyers or long holders get trapped as the price of the asset drops.If Bitcoin rejects from the $19,200 to $19,300 area, the trader suggested that a potential pullback is likely. He noted that the $16,000 level would remain a compelling macro support level.Referring to Bitcoin Jack’s potential price trend projection, a trader known as “NekoZ” emphasized that such a trend is possible. He wrote:If Bitcoin passes $20,000, it would enter price discovery as it searches for a new ceiling. Above $20,000, there is no historical data or evidence to suggest that BTC would top out at a certain price.BTC could theoretically rise to various targets many industry executives and analysts have shared throughout the past year. Most predictions range anywhere between $25,000 to $100,000 for the ongoing cycle.Hence, there would be significant interest from sellers to aggressively defend Bitcoin from moving past $20,000.Sellers could find it compelling to add to their positions below $20,000 due to the high funding rates.Across major cryptocurrency exchanges, the funding rate for the Bitcoin perpetual swap contract ranges from 0.05% to 0.1%. This means that buyers or long contract holders are paying short-sellers a large part of their positions as fees.Considering that funding rates are highly positive, short-sellers could find it compelling to aggressively short the sub-$20,000 region.Still, on-chain data show that the over-the-counter (OTC) market is active. This typically suggests that whales, high-net-worth investors and institutions could be purchasing Bitcoin.CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said that while some corrections could occur, $20,000 would likely be overtaken. Ki said:"
443,"Bitcoin (BTC) is currently having its second-highest trading day ever as BTC/USD is hitting a new multiyear high of $19,330. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView provides a cause for celebration on Nov. 24 after Bitcoin suddenly tackled $19,000 resistance.Against a backdrop of rapid gains and the temptation of breaking all-time highs around $20,000, the achievement has not gone unnoticed on Bitcoin figures.Ryan Selkis, founder of data resource Messari, noted that on only one day in its existence has Bitcoin traded above even $19,000.By contrast, the largest cryptocurrency has now spent 283 days above $10,000 — including its longest-ever stint in 2020.“Will we see $20K today?” Selkis pondered.Meanwhile, Bitcoin has gained more in U.S. dollar terms than any month in its history, data shows. In a tweet on Nov. 24, quantitative analyst PlanB highlighted that the past three and a half weeks have been unlike any other period in Bitcoin’s lifetime.The largest cryptocurrency continued to climb on Tuesday after retesting $18,000, adding over $1,300 to its U.S. dollar price in under 24 hours.For PlanB, the performance indicated that Bitcoin was not only beating records but would deliver even bigger gains in the near future. This was down to its relative strength index (RSI), which had begun to enter the zone that signals a protracted Bitcoin price uptrend.“Slowly but surely this is beginning to look like (the start of) a bull market,” PlanB commented.As Cointelegraph reported, PlanB noted that RSI was strong at the beginning of November, not signaling that Bitcoin was overbought despite its price growth.At press time, meanwhile, BTC/USD was just 2.4% off its historic all-time highs, data from major exchange Bitstamp confirms."
444,"The Lithuanian government has reportedly sold a batch of cryptocurrency seized by local enforcement agencies.The State Tax Inspectorate, or STI, the country’s tax authority, sold confiscated crypto assets worth 6.4 million euro ($7.6 million) and subsequently added the funds to the state budget.According to an official announcement on Nov. 24, the seized crypto assets included major cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) as well as privacy-focused altcoin Monero (XMR).The STI said this is the first time that the agency has sold seized crypto for fiat. “The conversion of cryptocurrencies into euros took almost a day,” the authority noted.Irina Gavrilova, the director of the STI’s tax arrears administration department, said, “The whole process was new for the tax administrator, from the takeover of the confiscated cryptocurrencies to their realization.” She said that it will be much easier for the agency to sell confiscated crypto assets in the future.According to the announcement, the STI took over the confiscated funds in late February 2020. The authority did not specify how exactly the STI sold the seized assets but noted that the exchange process required the STI to create a crypto wallet in order to receive crypto from law enforcement agencies."
445,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed $19,000 on Nov. 24 for the first time in nearly three years. It followed an XRP flash crash on Coinbase, which trembled the crypto market.The two incidents could be entirely coincidental. Although considering that BTC price surged almost immediately after the XRP drop, there could be a correlation.As Cointelegraph reported on Nov. 24, the price of XRP spiked by nearly 80% in 48 hours. As the rally went on, the hype around the cryptocurrency continued to intensify.The interest in the cryptocurrency reached a point where it overwhelmed Coinbase, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States.Joe Weisenthal, the co-host of What’d You Miss on Bloomberg TV, emphasized that Coinbase was trending on Twitter. The spike in interest around Coinbase occurred when the price of XRP began to increase. He said:The problem emerged when XRP flash-crashed after hitting $0.90 on Coinbase. It caused the market to undergo extreme volatility in a short span of time. Bitcoin plunged to around $18,000, while ETH dropped to $585.Although it is difficult to prove conclusively, market trends suggest that the flash crash led algorithms to cause high volatility. The price of Bitcoin briskly rose from $18,000 to above $18,500, eventually breaking $19,000.When Bitcoin dropped to $18,000 within just minutes, a supply zone was likely tapped. In other words, it might have dropped to an area with significant liquidity, causing many buy orders to get filled.In the near term, traders and analysts anticipate Bitcoin to continue its uptrend as it nears its all-time high.A pseudonymous investor known as “Blackbeard” pinpointed the lack of exchange inflows despite the price of BTC reaching $19,000. This indicates that the selling pressure on the dominant cryptocurrency is still relatively low. He said:Prior to the breakout above $19,000, another pseudonymous trader known as “Salsa Tekila” predicted the rally. He said that when altcoins cool down, profits would likely move back into BTC. He said:There is a strong possibility that the trend of profits from altcoins cycling into Bitcoin will continue in the near term. If this happens, the altcoin market would likely stagnate while BTC shows strong momentum."
446,"Amid an ongoing parabolic bull run, Bitcoin (BTC) is breaking another major milestone in terms of its market capitalization against American banking giant JPMorgan.On Nov. 24, Bitcoin surpassed the $19,000 price mark for the first time since December 2017, breaking another all-time record in its market cap.At publishing time, Bitcoin’s market cap is $352 billion, up from $345 billion 24 hours ago.According to data from Macro Trends, JPMorgan’s market cap closed at $349 billion on Nov. 23. Earlier this year, JPMorgan’s market cap dropped to as low as $258 billion.The company’s CEO Jamie Dimon has emerged as a prominent critic of Bitcoin, calling the major cryptocurrency a “fraud” and a “scam” back in 2017.Dimon has not changed his negative stance on BTC despite the growing bull run and major companies like PayPal moving into Bitcoin. At The New York Times DealBook Online Summit on Nov. 18, Dimon compared the seminal cryptocurrency to proprietary blockchain networks with regulatory controls, stating, “Bitcoin is kind of different and it’s not my cup of tea.” Despite its CEO’s skepticism of Bitcoin, in October 2020, JPMorgan reportedly told investors that “the potential long-term upside for Bitcoin is considerable,” suggesting that BTC price would be doubling or tripling in the long term."
447,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) hit $19,000 on Nov. 24 for the first time since the historic rally in December 2017. Three key reasons are behind the dominant cryptocurrency’s strong momentum.The main factors buoying BTC’s ongoing rally are whale accumulation, decreasing exchange supply and explosive volume trends.All throughout November, Cointelegraph reported that whale clusters were steadily forming as the price of Bitcoin rallied.These clusters emerge when Bitcoin whales buy BTC at a certain price point and do not move them. Analysts have interpreted this as a signal that whales are accumulating and that they have no intention of selling in the near term.The difference between the ongoing Bitcoin rally and previous price cycles is that the recent uptrend has proven to be more sustainable. In fact, each whale cluster shows that every major support level BTC reclaimed was accompanied by whale accumulation.On Nov. 18, when Bitcoin dropped to as low as $17,200, analysts at Whalemap said that the new whale support is located at $16,411. They said:Since then, Bitcoin has seen several more dips below $18,000 but has since recovered above $18,800, sustaining its strong momentum.Furthermore, data from Santiment, an on-chain market analysis platform, shows a similar trend. Santiment researchers found that the number of BTC whales significantly increased in recent months. They explained:One consistent trend throughout the 2020 bull cycle has been the continuous drop in Bitcoin exchange reserves.Investors and whales deposit BTC to exchanges when they want to sell BTC. Hence, the recent drop in exchange reserves means there are fewer sellers in the market.A pseudonymous trader known as “Byzantine General” said that every time spot exchanges expand their BTC reserves, they get accumulated. He said:The volume of both institutional and spot exchanges has been increasing rapidly since September. Open interest on Bitcoin futures and options at CME surpassed $1 billion in November, and Binance’s BTC/USDT pair has consistently delivered over $1.5 billion in daily volume.Various data points also show that the spot market has been leading the rally, not derivatives or futures markets. This trend makes the rally more stable and reduces the risk of massive corrections.When the futures market accounts for the majority of the volume during a Bitcoin uptrend, there is a large risk of cascading liquidations. This time, the spot market has been leading the rally, thus making it more sustainable."
448,"Cryptocurrency exchange and debit card provider Crypto.com has scored major regulatory approvals from the Maltese government.According to a Nov. 24 announcement, the Malta Financial Services Authority, or MFSA, has granted in-principle approval to Crypto.com for two financial licenses: a Financial Institution License and a Class 3 Virtual Financial Assets, or VFA, License.Once Crypto.com meets the official conditions, the Financial Institution License will enable Crypto.com to provide payment services and issue electronic money. A Class 3 VFA License allows Crypto.com to offer investment management services, custody and trading to both professional and nonprofessional investors.According to the announcement, Crypto.com is one of the first crypto firms to receive these regulatory approvals from the MFSA after the agency approved the first VFA Agents in May 2019. Prior to obtaining these licenses, Crypto.com had been operating under the transitory provisions of the VFA Act in Malta.Crypto.com co-founder and CEO Kris Marszalek said that the firm hopes to obtain more regulatory approvals in different markets next year.Widely referred to as the “blockchain island” in the crypto community, Malta has been actively working to introduce crypto-related regulations in the country.In 2018, the Maltese government introduced three laws to establish a regulatory framework for crypto, reaffirming the country’s focus on the development of the blockchain and crypto industry. However, a number of industry startups reportedly had to leave the country amid an apparent lack of regulatory clarity, with the MFSA not issuing a single crypto license as of April 2020.In July 2020, the Maltese government claimed that it was breaking away from its once-prominent blockchain agenda to take a more holistic approach to regulating the digital economy."
449,"As Bitcoin keeps gaining momentum, the fear of missing out on investing in the world’s largest cryptocurrency is growing each day.Last week on Wednesday, Bitcoin (BTC) broke the $18,000 price mark for the first time since December 2017, less than 10% away from its all-time high price of $20,000.As some analysts believe that an upcoming $20,000 threshold is not the end but the start of Bitcoin’s upcoming explosion to a $1 trillion asset, it may still not be too late to get into Bitcoin.Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, but you don’t need to have thousands of dollars to own some. You can get started buying Bitcoin with as little as $15, getting about 0.0008 BTC in return, according to BTC price at publishing time.Getting started investing in Bitcoin is not as difficult as you might think. Here are some simple tips to buy Bitcoin easily.The first step to buy Bitcoin easily is to choose the right crypto exchange.You might have heard of the world’s largest crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, but there are about 400 crypto exchanges globally, according to major crypto data website CoinMarketCap.When choosing a digital asset exchange to buy Bitcoin, check whether the company is reputable and provides services to customers in your country. Using tools like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko, also check trading volumes on a certain platform. Do some research and read some news and updates on a company’s website or Twitter to get more info, such as the platform’s transaction fees, deposit methods and security protocols.Once you've picked a crypto exchange, prepare to create an account and proceed with the required verification processes. Opening an account on most crypto exchanges, like Binance, is free, requiring just an email and a phone number.Some cryptocurrency exchanges such as BitMEX and Coinbase require Know Your Customer checks for certain crypto operations, so you will want to have your passport or another form of official identification ready.Use a strong password for your account on a crypto exchange, and don’t forget to turn on two-factor authentication, or 2FA. Enabled 2FA reduces the risk of a security breach or a hack by putting an additional layer of security on your account. Google Authenticator is one of the most popular 2FA applications, providing users with two-step verification on a phone.There are a number of ways to buy Bitcoin with fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar or euro. Some crypto exchanges allow people to buy Bitcoin using a debit or credit card as well as a bank account. Using one of these methods will require linking a bank account or a card to your account on the platform.Some global exchanges also allow users to buy Bitcoin directly from users through a peer-to-peer service, wherein customers browse offers posted by other users.Other crypto exchanges allow users to buy Bitcoin via third-party payment solutions like Simplex and a few major payment companies like PayPal also allow crypto purchases.Now, you are ready to buy some Bitcoin. But first, you should decide how much you want to invest. Remember that it is a high-risk investment, and it's better to start with significant research and an honest calculation of how much one is willing to risk. Major investors and entrepreneurs like Mark Cuban have previously recommended investing up to 10% of one's savings in Bitcoin. Once you own some Bitcoin, take care of your crypto. By keeping holdings on a cryptocurrency exchange, users risk losing access to them due to a number of reasons, like a possible hack or security breach, which can result in frozen withdrawals or other issues.To keep your Bitcoin safe, consider using a cold wallet or paper wallet. Read Cointelegraph’s piece on how to keep your crypto safe for more tips about crypto security.Disclaimer: Bitcoin investment is associated with a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors due to the high volatility of BTC prices. Prior to investing in crypto, you should carefully consider your investment objectives and risks to lose money."
450,"Japanese financial giant SBI Group is introducing a cryptocurrency lending service through its crypto-related subsidiary, SBI VC Trade.According to an official announcement on Nov. 24, the new crypto lending platform will allow users to lend their crypto to SBI and earn interest at a rate of 1% with taxes included.The new service, dubbed VC Trade Lending, will initially support the major cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC), with SBI further planning to add support for Ether (ETH) and XRP. The minimum lending amount is 0.1 BTC, or $1,840 at publishing time, while the maximum amount is capped at 5 BTC, or $92,000.SBI said that VC Trade Lending will have no account management fees or annual membership fees. The service will also not charge any fees for deposits made in Japanese yen or crypto, but still charges a fee for yen withdrawals.SBI is a major financial institution in Japan involved in the crypto industry. In early October 2020, SBI’s foreign exchange and derivatives arm SBI Liquidity Market acquired TaoTao, a crypto exchange formerly 40% owned by Yahoo Japan’s YJFX. The firm is also running its own crypto business through its subsidiary SBI VC Trade. SBI is also a major partner of Ripple, a company that builds financial products on XRP, the fourth biggest crypto by market capitalization at publishing time. In late October 2020, SBI CEO Yoshitaka Kitao claimed that Ripple will most likely relocate to Japan should it choose to leave the United States."
451,"After rallying 80% in two months, Bitcoin (BTC) is recapturing media interest from the top end of town, with The Wall Street Journal discussing the cryptocurrency’s adoption among institutional investors on the site’s home page on Nov. 23.The report notes that Bitcoin has recently found support from “Wall Street billionaires” Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller, alongside other public figures including a sports radio host.#Bitcoin front page of the Wall Street Journal pic.twitter.com/wD7TUuMcTpWSJ’s coverage comes following a lull in Bitcoin’s presence in mainstream outlets, despite the cryptocurrency surging to test rarely seen prices while setting new records for market capitalization.In addition to significant investments from hedge fund managers and Grayscale Investments, WSJ emphasizes increasing demand from retail investors who can now access crypto assets through familiar financial service companies. The report notes that Bitcoin’s volume on Square’s Cash App was $1.6 billion during the third quarter of 2020, compared to $555 million for the entirety of 2019. Trade activity on U.S.-based exchange ItBit also surged after it was revealed that PayPal’s Bitcoin trading services would be executed through the platform.On the same day, PayPal CEO Dan Shulman predicted during an appearance on CNBC that increasing everyday adoption of Bitcoin will see crypto assets “move from being less of just an asset class and more into a currency,” adding:"
452,"In the last few days, Bitcoin (BTC) price has underperformed Ether (ETH) by almost 20%. Even though BTC seems to be struggling to break the $18,800 barrier, both cryptocurrencies display the same bullishness according to derivatives markets data.Ether is entering a parabolic rally as its Eth2 network launch progresses, and this optimism is reflected in the options markets. Despite the lack of similar price action from BTC, Bitcoin traders seem unfazed, and data shows they are still wildly bullish.Analyzing the basis indicator is a useful procedure as it compares the futures contracts level to the current price at regular spot exchanges.Healthy markets usually display a 5% to 10% annualized basis, in a situation known as contango. On the other hand, futures trading with a discount usually occurs during heavily bearish markets.The Ether futures basis has been ranging between 10% and 20%, indicating bullish expectations. Instead of leaving Ether at a derivatives exchange, the seller would rather utilize them for staking. Therefore, it is only natural to demand a premium for the trade.The BTC futures premium has been behaving similarly, despite today's lackluster negative performance. Had traders given up expectations of a continuous bull run, this indicator would have moved below 10% annualized.There's only one reason why a trader pays such a hefty premium on a futures contract, and the reason is bullishness. This indicator can be interpreted as a tax to carry leveraged long positions.Viewing the 25 delta skew also provides useful insight into the sentiment and stance of pro traders.A positive 25% delta skew indicates that put (sell) options cost more than similar call (buy) options, signaling bearish sentiment. On the other hand, a negative skew suggests bullishness.The indicator usually oscillates between -20% to +20% in neutral markets, although it hasn't been the case for Ether over the past weeks.Take notice how the Ether futures basis touched extreme optimism levels on Nov. 21, which is highly unusual.This data suggests that options traders are unwilling to sell upside protection. At -20%, the skew indicator signals that derivative investors remain bullish despite the 28% rally over the past seven days.One should expect BTC options traders to be slightly less optimistic after today's negative performance, but that hasn't been the case.Data shows that BTC option traders are presently remarkably optimistic, regardless of how difficult the last couple of days have been. Thus, there is no indication of a shift in sentiment coming from derivatives markets.Although there are multiple ways to read the same chart according to technical analysis, BTC hasn't precisely been transpiring optimism.Traders that prefer shorter time frames might have a bearish interpretation of the recent price action. Meanwhile, professional investors know how unpredictable BTC markets are. Therefore they are not ready to reduce their positive expectations at a whim.For now, there seems to be no reason to doubt Bitcoin's positive momentum. Even though Ether has outperformed it, traders are exhibiting the same confidence in both cryptocurrencies.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

453,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been leading the current crypto rally for the past few weeks, and this has boosted its dominance from 56% on Sep. 3 to 67% on Nov. 18. However, as Bitcoin nears its all-time high, it seems to be losing momentum as the action shifts to altcoins. This has pulled Bitcoin’s dominance down to about 62.3%. No long-term bull market can be led by one leader alone. There are periodic rotations when the leader enters a consolidation or a minor correction while others take the lead. A similar rotation is currently playing out in the crypto markets, with Ether (ETH) and XRP leading the rally while Bitcoin digests its gains.As the current bull phase matures and the commentary turns even more bullish, several traders who have missed a large part of the move may start buying the underperforming assets that were not swept up in the bull run.This phase usually marks a top. Hence, traders can keep a watch on the underperforming coins. When they start flying, it could be a sign that it’s time to book profits and run with your money.Let’s analyze the top 10 cryptocurrencies to determine whether the uptrend will continue or if a short-term correction around the corner.Bitcoin is currently witnessing a minor correction in a strong uptrend. Usually, the pullback in a strong trend lasts between one to three days before the trend resumes.As the bulls have not given up much ground from the 52-week high at $18,965.75, it suggests that traders are not hurrying to close their positions because they expect the uptrend to continue.The upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) in the overbought territory suggest that bulls are in command. A breakout above $18,965.75 could result in a rally to $20,000, which may act as a psychological resistance.However, if the bulls can drive the price above $20,000, the BTC/USD pair will enter uncharted territory and may rally vertically. Usually, after such a phase, a sharp correction is expected.This bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels and the bears sink the pair below the 20-day exponential moving average at $16,657.Ether picked up momentum after the bulls pushed the price above $488.134 on Nov. 20. Although the bears attempted to stall the rally on Nov. 22, the bulls purchased the dips aggressively.Both moving averages are sloping up, and the RSI is close to 80, which suggests that bulls are in control.The uptrend has resumed today with a breakout of the psychological $600 level. The next resistance is at $625, but if the bulls can thrust the price above this level, the ETH/USD pair could rally to $800.However, after the sharp run of the past few days, the pair may stall at $625 and digest the gains for a few days before starting the next trending move.XRP seems to be in an urgency to make up for the underperformance during the current crypto bull run. After the Doji candlestick on Nov. 22, the bulls have asserted their dominance today and have pushed the price above the $0.50 resistance.There is a minor resistance at $0.60 but if the bulls can drive the price above it, the XRP/USD pair could rally to $0.78.While overbought levels on the RSI is a bullish sign during the early stages of an uptrend, a reading above 90 suggests panic buying. Usually, such periods of frenzied buying are followed by a sharp correction or a consolidation.A break below the intraday low of Nov. 22 at $0.40 could intensify selling and signal an end to the bullish momentum.Chainlink's LINK is currently in an uptrend. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that the bulls are in command. The pattern target of the breakout of the inverse head-and-shoulders setup is $19.2731.However, the bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to stall the up-move and pull the price back below the breakout level of $13.28. The trend will tilt in favor of the bears if they can sink and sustain the price below $11.80.On the other hand, if the LINK/USD pair rebounds off $13.28, it will suggest demand at lower levels. The bulls will then attempt to resume the uptrend.There is a tough battle in progress near the $84.3374 level. The bulls are attempting to sustain Litecoin (LTC) above this level, while the bears are attempting to drag the price below it.The long tail on the Nov. 22 candlestick shows strong buying at lower levels, while the long wick on today’s candlestick shows selling at higher levels. This could keep the LTC/USD pair range-bound for a few days.However, the upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest bulls are in control. If they can push the price above $90, the next leg of the uptrend to $100 is possible.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears can sink the price below $78, the pair may drop to the 20-day EMA ($71). Such a move will suggest that the bullish momentum has weakened.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) soared above the overhead resistance at $280 on Nov. 21. Although the bears tried to fake this up-move by pulling the price back below $280 on Nov. 22, they could not sustain the lower levels. This suggests that bulls are buying on dips.If the bulls can push the price above $312.52, the BCH/USD pair could rally to $338, then to $353. The bears may mount a strong defense in this zone, but if the bulls can overcome this hurdle, the momentum could pick up.Both moving averages are sloping up, and the RSI is in the positive territory, which suggests that the buyers are in control. This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink and sustain the price below $280.Polkadot's DOT broke above the stiff overhead resistance at $5.5899 on Nov. 21. However, the bears pulled the price back below $5.5899 on Nov. 22 but could not sustain the lower levels. This suggests that the bulls are buying on dips.The bulls are again attempting to start a new uptrend by pushing the price above the overhead resistance at $5.8453. If they succeed, the DOT/USD pair could rally to $6.8619.The upsloping 20-day EMA ($4.81) and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest an advantage to the bulls.This positive view will be invalidated if the bears pull the price back below $5.5899 and then sink the pair below $4.95. Such a move will suggest that the current breakout was a bull trap.Cardano's ADA broke and closed above the $0.1142241 resistance on Nov. 20. This attracted aggressive buying from the bulls, who easily pushed the price above the overhead resistances.The ADA/USD pair had risen to a new 52-week high today, but the bears are trying to stall the current uptrend at the $0.1550 resistance. During the three previous occasions, when the RSI had risen close to 80, the pair had consolidated for a few days.Hence, a few days of range-bound action near the $0.1550 overhead resistance is possible. If the bulls can drive the price above $0.1550, the rally could extend to $0.20. This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair plummets from the current levels and closes below $0.128.Binance Coin (BNB) broke out and closed above the $27.30–$28.97 range on Nov. 21, but the bulls could not capitalize on this strength to push the price to $32. This attracted selling by the bears, and they tried to pull the price back below $28.97 on Nov. 22 but failed.The bulls are again attempting to push the price toward the top of the $25.6652–$32 range. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance at $32, it will suggest a lack of demand at higher levels and a few more days of range-bound action is likely.On the contrary, if the bulls can propel the price above the $32–$33.3888 resistance zone, the BNB/USD pair could start the next leg of the journey that may carry it to the all-time high at $39.5941.Bitcoin SV (BSV) surged above the $181 overhead resistance on Nov. 21, which marked a breakout from the $146–$181 range the price had been stuck in since early September. After the breakout from a range, the bears usually try to fake the bullish move, and they tried doing it on Nov. 22.However, the bulls used the lower levels to buy, and they have currently resumed the new up-move that can reach $227, and if this level is also scaled, the rally may extend to $258.Contrary to this assumption, if the price again turns down from the current level, the BSV/USD pair could remain range-bound between $181 and $194.The trend will tilt in favor of the bears if they can sink and sustain the price below $181. Such a move could catch the aggressive bulls off guard and result in a drop to the moving averages.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

454,"Coinbase appears to have a capacity problem. Users have pointed out for years that when Bitcoin and other crypto assets are especially volatile, the exchange sometimes goes offline without warning. These outages can prevent customers from buying or selling their crypto assets and are generally viewed unfavorably by traders.Between March and November, the exchange recorded nine different issues leading to various types of outages or connectivity problems, although direct customer impact is somewhat unclear in some of the instances. The issues seemingly range in their degree of severity. The main status update posted by Coinbase during such times is:  “Coinbase.com is experiencing connectivity issues.”Four of these instances coincided with volatile Bitcoin price action, according to 30-minute price candles on TradingView.com.On April 29, Coinbase reported connectivity issues. In an update to its status that was posted later, Coinbase.com appeared to have suffered issues between 10:00 am and 12:30 pm PDT on that day. Bitcoin's price moved 4.54% during that time window. Cointelegraph previously reported on platform difficulties seen on that day. On May 9, Coinbase notified the public of another difficulty, again stating: “Coinbase.com is experiencing connectivity issues.” This time, Bitcoin's price moved 15.26% between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm PDT — the time window showing difficulties, based on the status, which also included added details published several days after.Coincidence that everytime we have huge market moves @coinbase shuts down? @SEC_Enforcement seriously investigate this is fishy. We need some transparency on thisThe third instance correlating with notable Bitcoin price action happened on June 1, when Coinbase once again notified the public of connectivity issues. This incident seemingly impacted users on some level between 4:00 pm and 5:00 pm PDT, during which time Bitcoin moved 6.94% in price. The days following this particular incident saw some Coinbase customers leave the platform, judging by Bitcoin withdrawals and reported by Cointelegraph on June 9. Coinbase also suffered another connectivity issue on July 28 between 2:00 am and 4:30 am PDT, during which Bitcoin moved 3.82% in price.Not all of Coinbase's issues have coincided with major BTC price swing days, however. Coinbase notified the public of issues on Nov. 16, stating: “Website and mobile apps not loading.” Bitcoin only moved roughly 1.72% in price during the stated time window of the problems, although it was enough to provoke more outrage within the trading community. Connectivity issues also occurred on May 28, July 17, Aug. 18 and Nov. 11, during which Bitcoin moved less than 3% in price during each incident. Coinbase down AGAIN. At this point I adamantly encourage everyone to stop using Coinbase.

They’ve had years and endless resources to prepare for this. To me, it’s no coincidence this stuff happens, and it’s very shady

Delete CoinbaseCoinbase did not respond to questions regarding its outages. However, the firm's CEO, Brian Armstrong, tweeted that Coinbase aimed to fix the issues. We're working hard to add additional capacity (both in servers and customer support) to deal with increased traffic. Thank you for your patience during this time. And thank you to the team at Coinbase working hard to serve our customers! Bull runs can be exciting and stressful.Crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX also has a history of performance issues during large Bitcoin price swings."
455,"Bitcoin price has more than doubled since its latest block subsidy halving and is now outpacing its last bull run.Data compiled by on-chain monitoring resource ChartsBTC on Nov. 23 shows that versus its two previous halvings, Bitcoin (BTC) in 2020 is right on track to deliver major price gains.Using figures from Coin Metrics and statistician Clark Moody, ChartsBTC’s Halving Index compares Bitcoin’s progress since May’s halving with the six months after the 2012 and 2016 events.The results show that in terms of price action, Bitcoin is beating its run to 2017’s all-time highs of $20,000. Only 2012 produced quicker upside, at a time when at the halving, BTC/USD traded at just $12.Six months after the halving, Bitcoin's price is 2.2 times higher in 2020. 2016 was more like 1.3 times, while 2012 produced a 12-times upside in the same period.The data adds fuel to the argument that Bitcoin in 2020 has little in common with how it looked three years ago. Buyers have changed and now take the form of corporate giants satisfying client demand and investing for the long term, not for speculation.For PlanB, the quantitative analyst responsible for the stock-to-flow-based Bitcoin price models, this is all too apparent as a catalyst for further price gains.As Cointelegraph reported earlier Monday, he believes that January 2021 could mark the start of a much more rapid appreciation cycle, which would also chime with performance after both previous halvings.“Monday! Paypal, Grayscale and Square will resume buying today,” he mused about the habits of Bitcoin’s latest large-volume bulls.Last week, meanwhile a comparative chart of Bitcoin “halving candles” put 2020 into perspective, showing just how much potential remained before the current halving cycle ends in 2024.Each candle propelled BTC/USD to a price that was an order of magnitude larger than the last. 2024, therefore, should produce a $100,000 price tag if history repeats."
456,"In the early days, cryptocurrencies could only really be used for investing and trading. If you wanted to make a purchase using digital assets, you’d probably end up disappointed.Crypto debit cards have burst onto the scene in recent years — paving the way for these cutting-edge currencies to be used for everyday products. There’s just one problem… many products on the market have their limitations.More often than not, the owners of these debit cards need to top them up before they can be used, and their prepaid nature sometimes means they can’t be used to book hotel rooms, rent a car or withdraw funds from an ATM.But one digital asset gateway says its product functions like a true debit card, unlocking use cases that may not have been available to crypto enthusiasts in the past. CoinZoom’s Visa card converts crypto to fiat instantly at the point of sale. Each account comes with devoted wallets for fiat currencies and dozens of major coins — including BTC, ETH, XRP and LTC. All shoppers need to do is decide which wallet they would like to be debited for their transactions.“One of our primary goals is global expansion and greater crypto adoption,” CoinZoom’s CEO and founder Todd Crosland told Cointelegraph. “We believe that the CoinZoom Visa card is a solid step forward in this direction. Our Visa card allows people to spend their crypto seamlessly and instantly at over 53 million merchants worldwide, making it an easy transition from spending fiat to spending crypto on everyday purchases.”Figures suggest that millions of dollars each month are being spent on CoinZoom cards. Bitcoin and more than 25 other cryptocurrencies are supported. Their users are spending crypto in some fascinating ways — on everything from plane tickets to Airbnb stays, Apple products to Louis Vuitton couture, and furniture to groceries at Costco. Some have even flashed their plastic when they’ve needed car repairs or to pay for medical school tuition. All of this helps to illustrate how versatile this debit card is.A common theme among crypto debit cards involve cashback for making purchases, and CoinZoom claims that it can offer users a better deal than other established rivals.The brand offers five tiers of cards — all of which offer 24/7 support, access to ATMs, security features and debit card roundups. Users can also benefit from worldwide peer-to-peer fiat money transfers, with daily limits rising depending on the type of card someone owns. These cards can also result in discounts on trading fees through its exchange.CoinZoom’s choice of cryptocurrencies will be good news for those who may be reluctant to spend their Bitcoin, amid concerns that the value of the digital asset could rise further.

457,"Gazprombank Switzerland, a subsidiary of one of the largest banks in Russia, has piloted its Bitcoin (BTC) transaction service following regulatory approval by Swiss regulators.According to a Nov. 19 announcement, Gazprombank will provide its new cryptocurrency solution in collaboration with its long-running partners like fintech firm Avaloq and crypto custody provider Metaco.Gazprombank Switzerland CEO Roman Abdulin said that the new service intends to make crypto transactions “as easy as transactions with traditional assets,” stating:“Digital assets will become increasingly important for our clients and the global economy. We are pleased to work together with leading Swiss-based entities on the further development of the Swiss and global crypto and blockchain ecosystem.”In conjunction with debuting its first BTC transactions, Gazprombank Switzerland also announced that the bank has joined OpenVASP, a major industry association focused on regulatory compliance for virtual asset service providers, or VASPs.Launched in late 2019, OpenVASP intends to help VASPs in complying with the so-called “travel rule” Anti-Money Laundering regulation introduced by the Financial Action Task Force. According to the announcement, Gazprombank Switzerland is the first banking institution to join OpenVASP alongside major industry firms like Swiss crypto broker Bitcoin Suisse and local crypto bank Sygnum.The latest news from Gazprombank Switzerland comes shortly after the bank scored approval from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority to offer crypto custody and trading services to its institutional and corporate clients in late October 2020. Fully owned by Russia-based Gazprombank, Gazprombank Switzerland has been preparing to launch crypto services in Switzerland since at least 2018.Gazprombank is not the only Russian bank piloting crypto and blockchain-related services abroad. In September 2020, Sberbank — the country’s largest state-run bank — joined a blockchain-based platform for commodity trade finance through its Swiss subsidiary.While Russian banks are rushing to debut crypto services abroad, Russian lawmakers keep introducing more limits to the crypto industry. Alongside officially banning payments in crypto in 2021, Russian authorities also want to introduce prison terms for failing to report annual crypto transactions of about $600,000."
458,"Bitcoin (BTC) starts another week at near historic highs as the U.S. dollar continues to drop — what’s next?With investors seeking safe havens and Bitcoin already seeing a demand squeeze, Cointelegraph covers the factors that could further shape price action this week.News from the U.S. that mass vaccination against the Coronavirus may begin within a month has sent investors panicking for hedge assets.With multiple candidates now available among potential vaccines, the mood is tending towards worldwide recovery emerging, which means the dollar becomes less appealing compared to other destinations.“The vaccine news is favoring the view of a sooner-rather-than-later global economic recovery with the USD losing its safe haven appeal along the way,” Rodrigo Catril, a currency strategist at National Australia Bank, told Bloomberg.The U.S. dollar currency index (DXY), which tracks USD against a basket of twenty trading partner currencies, has fallen lows seen twice since August, with monthly losses totalling nearly 2.2%.As Cointelegraph often reports, DXY tends to show an inverse correlation to Bitcoin, meaning protracted weakness comes in tandem with stronger BTC/USD performance.The outlook for the dollar remains uncertain thanks also to the risk of fresh sanctions by the White House on Chinese tech firms, details of which are expected this week.Within Bitcoin, the emerging narrative that buyers are simply demanding more coins than can be produced continues.As noted previously, this is being driven by corporate entities, notably Grayscale, Square’s Cash App and PayPal, with the requirements of all three only rising with time as more clients choose to buy BTC.The result is that miners see their block subsidies snapped up, and the only way for the buy side to plug the gap is to pay higher prices per coin.“PayPal and Cash App are already buying more than 100% of all newly-issued bitcoins,” investment firm Pantera Capital summarized in a blog post on Nov. 21.Pantera included a chart of volume from ItBit, the exchange run by Paxos, the payment handler covering PayPal’s new cryptocurrency feature. PayPal alone, it added, appears already to be buying 70% of all newly-mined bitcoins.The new status quo differs markedly from the last time that Bitcoin traded at levels near $20,000. Unlike then, various figures argue, those buying this time are by definition in it for the long run.“At $18.5K #Bitcoin Google searches for ‘bitcoin’ have not seen an uptick. This is not a FOMO rally. It's steady hands. Few understand this,” Gemini exchange co-founder Cameron Winklevoss tweeted on Monday.Last week, comments from one traditional market strategist underlined the seeming lack of interest in Bitcoin from mainstream consumers. This, she told Bloomberg, had died in 2017.After its 4.82% increase last week, Bitcoin’s network difficulty is set to lead a resurgence in fundamentals in five days’ time.Difficulty and its automatic readjustments — after every 2016 blocks — are an essential feature in Bitcoin allowing it to maintain constant block mining intervals without outside intervention and, thus, ensuring network stability. At the beginning of November, difficulty dropped by the most in nine years in a single readjustment. This created a more accessible playing field for miners, with the expectation that increased activity would make difficulty rise again thanks to the ensuing competition.As such, at the end of this week, difficulty should bounce upwards by an estimated 7.7%, almost reversing the impact of the previous dip and opening the path to new all-time highs.Likewise, Bitcoin’s average hash rate — the estimated computing power dedicated to validating transactions — has hit 137 exahashes per second (EH/s), rebounding 30% since the difficulty drop.Seven-day average hash rate’s all-time high currently lies at 146 EH/s, this appearing in mid October.Zooming out — even slightly — is still a cause for major bullishness among some of Bitcoin’s best-known analysts.For PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow-based series of price forecasting models, the real upside for Bitcoin is still yet to come, despite monthly gains already totalling 43%.This is due to historical behavior after block subsidy halving events. In 2012 and 2016, upside ensued months after the halving, but serious gains came the following year — and looked more like a tsunami than a slowly increasing tide.“Current #bitcoin price action is nice, but we are waiting for a real jump (like the red arrows early 2013 and 2017),” he tweeted alongside an annotated chart.As Cointelegraph reported, PlanB is far from alone in considering next year to be the return of Bitcoin’s halcyon days.A concerning counterargument to further gains for Bitcoin last week came in the form of worrying readings from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index.Using a basket of factors to measure investor sentiment, the Index almost matched highs from 2019, which culminated in a significant price drop.As of Monday, however, the metric’s current “extreme greed” rating of market sentiment is slowly beginning to ease off, dropping from 94/100 to 90/100.“Extreme greed” refers to the rapidly deteriorating strength of investor resolve as prices increase, signalling the increasing likelihood of a sell-off."
459,"Bitcoin (BTC) has made a stellar comeback from its March lows in 2020 and this performance is getting noticed by institutional investors. Recently Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s CIO of fixed income, said that Bitcoin could replace gold as it is “more functional than passing a bar of gold around.”Comments like these are a positive sign as they demonstrate that the narrative of Bitcoin being increasingly viewed as digital gold even among traditional investors has been gaining wider acceptance.A new report by crypto investment firm Pantera Capital attributes the recent uptick in Bitcoin’s price to PayPal’s new crypto service. According to Pantera, data shows that “PayPal is already buying almost 70% of the new supply of bitcoins” and Cash App the rest 30%, which has created a real supply shortage.Bitcoin naysayers have long described the asset as too volatile but research by investment management firm Van Eck found that about 51% of the stocks on the S&P 500 are either equal or more volatile than Bitcoin on a 90-day basis.Findings such as these could attract more investors to cryptocurrencies if the data became widely known.Investors are now wondering if Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high next week and whether altcoins will follow?Let’s study the charts of the top-five cryptocurrencies to determine the path of least resistance and spot the critical levels on the upside and the downside.Bitcoin (BTC) formed a Doji candlestick pattern on Nov. 21 and that was resolved to the downside today. In a strong uptrend, the corrections usually last for one to three days, and then the trend resumes.The strong rebound from the intraday lows today suggests that buyers are accumulating on each dip. If the bulls can now push the price above $18,695.75, a rally to the all-time high is possible.If the buyers can drive the price above $20,000, the BTC/USD pair could pick up momentum and form a blow-off top.One thing to note is that the BTC/USD pair has not corrected in a meaningful way since the current leg of the rally started from the $10,500 level.The price has not even pulled back to the 20-day exponential moving average ($16,493) since Oct. 8, which suggests that there has been a buying stampede.If the pair turns down from the current levels and drops below $17,629, the decline could extend to the 20-day EMA. The bulls are likely to buy closer to this support as the trend remains strong.The relative strength index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart has formed a bearish divergence, which is a negative sign. However, the failure of the bears to keep the price below the 20-EMA suggests strong bullish accumulation at lower levels.If the bulls can sustain the price above the downtrend line, a retest of the overhead resistance at $18,965.75 is possible.On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below $17,600, the possibility of a break below $17,200 increases.Ether (ETH) picked up momentum on Nov. 20 after it soared above the overhead resistance at $488.134. The biggest altcoin quickly covered ground and rallied to an intraday high of $561.223 today.The correction in Bitcoin also resulted in profit booking in the ETH/USD pair today but the long tail on the candlestick shows aggressive buying at lower levels.If the bulls can push the price above $561.223, the uptrend could resume with the next target objective at $625. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest that bulls are in control.This bullish view will be negated if the bears can sink the price below today’s intraday low at $511.769. Such a move could attract aggressive selling and increase the possibility of a break below the critical support at $488.134.The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls aggressively purchased the dip to the 20-EMA. They will now try to drive the price above the overhead resistance. If they succeed, the uptrend could resume.Conversely, if the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance, the bears will try to sink the pair below the 20-EMA. If that happens, the decline could extend to the critical support at $488.134.XRP surged 40.48% on Nov. 21. This sharp rally suggests that traders were panic buying due to FOMO. However, when the underperformers start skyrocketing, it generally suggests that the bull phase has entered its last leg.The psychological level of $0.50 attracted profit-booking by traders today and the price pulled back to just above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.393344. The long tail on the candlestick shows strong buying at lower levels.If the altcoin rises above $0.46, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $0.50. If they succeed, the rally could extend to $0.60 and then to $0.75.The volatility expansion on Nov. 21 and today, has pushed the RSI deep into the overbought territory. Hence, the XRP/USD pair may enter a cool off period and consolidate for a few days before starting the next trending move.This view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below $0.39 as the next support is at the 50% Fibonacci retracement at $0.361738.The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls are buying on dips closer to the $0.40 levels but they are struggling to sustain the price above $0.46. This suggests that traders are selling on minor rallies.If the bulls can push the price above $0.46, a retest of $0.495663 is possible. A break above this resistance could resume the uptrend.Conversely, if the price turns down from the current levels or $0.46, a deeper correction to the 20-EMA is possible.Litecoin (LTC) is in a strong uptrend and the bulls had pushed the price above the overhead resistance of $84.3374 on Nov. 21. However, the buyers could not sustain the breakout, which suggests profit booking at higher levels.Today, the bears have pulled the price back below $84.3374 but the long tail on the candlestick shows buying at lower levels. If the bulls can push the price back above $84.3374 and sustain the breakout, the LTC/USD pair could resume the uptrend and rally to $100.However, if the bears defend the $84.3374 resistance, the pair could drop to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $72.5521. This support is just above the 20-day EMA ($69), hence, the bulls are likely to defend this zone aggressively. The advantage will shift in favor of the bears if they can sink the price below $67.The 4-hour chart shows that selling intensified after the bears dragged the price below $84.3374, but the sellers could not capitalize on the break below the 20-EMA. The pair has bounced off the intraday lows and reached the overhead resistance.If the bulls can sustain the price above $84.3374, the uptrend could resume. On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below $78, the pair could correct to the 50-simple moving average at $75.Dash (DASH) surged on Nov. 21 and closed just above the overhead resistance at $94.1813. The bulls tried to resume the up-move today but the price turned down from $95.4549.This suggests that failure to sustain the price above $94.1813 could have attracted profit-booking by short-term traders.The first support on the downside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $82.7761. If the price rebounds off this level, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend by pushing the DASH/USD pair above $95.4549. The next target on the upside is $104 and then $110.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below $82.7761, a deeper correction to the 20-day EMA ($78) is possible.The pair has bounced off the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart. If the rebound sustains above $91, the bulls will once again try to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $95.4549.On the other hand, if the pair turns down from the current levels and the bears sink the price below the 20-EMA, the bulls will try to arrest the decline at the 50-SMA.If they fail to do so, the pair could drop to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $78.8596, and if this support also cracks, then the next support is at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $74.9413.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

460,"Who could have imagined a year ago how different our lives would be in just 12 months? Without any doubt, last November will remain a significant point in humanity’s history — the time when it all started. Although “patient zero” has not yet been confirmed — if it ever will be at all — we now know that everything began in China back on Nov. 17, 2019, when the first patient reportedly presented symptoms of a novel coronavirus disease named COVID-19, according to the South China Morning Post with references to government data.In January 2020, Wuhan city in central China suffered from the massively expanding COVID-19 epidemic, and “41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed” cases, according to a publication in The Lancet. Just two months later, in March, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. One by one, governments worldwide closed their national borders, suspended public events, and banned people’s gatherings. The conversation unearthed two terms, rarely used before, which have now been declared 2020 words of the year by British Collins Dictionary: “lockdown” and “social distancing.”It’s hard to imagine which spheres of our lives have not been affected by these dramatic and tragic events, with the number of confirmed global cases exceeding 55 million.Despite everything, the ongoing COVID-19 crisis has also had a positive impact on the world. European conservatism, which has long relied on the traditional financial system, was questioned as the pandemic forced Europeans to shift toward cashless payments and cryptocurrencies. Some say it even fastened the mainstream adoption of crypto and DLT-based business solutions globally by changing people’s understanding of money.Related: What the COVID-19 pandemic means for blockchain and cryptoSpecifically, the COVID-19 outbreak has propelled Bitcoin’s (BTC) safe haven narrative as central banks print an estimated $15 trillion in stimulus in an attempt to ease the pandemic’s effects on global economies. Amid rising inflation rates, people are turning to Bitcoin as the next inflation hedge.Related: Not like before: Digital currencies debut amid COVID-19Meanwhile, in the name of public health, governments are initiating COVID-19 tracking programs, raising serious concerns about privacy violations and the tightening grip of centralization in the process. Not stopping there, governments have also taken another step in eroding civil autonomy via the development of central bank digital currencies, initiatives for which have been boosted globally due to the COVID-19 crisis. While experts see the solution to safeguarding privacy in decentralized technologies, the question about over-promised decentralization remains open.Nonetheless, the coronavirus outbreak significantly changed everyone’s lives, creating the new normal we now live by. Yet, despite all the challenges we are facing economically, politically and socially since the start of the year, there is no doubt that the pandemic is propelling digital innovation and accelerating humanity 20 years forward in technological development.It is too early to tell when it all ends, as COVID-19 is still gaining speed. Now, a year since Wuhan’s first case, Cointelegraph reached out to experts in blockchain technology and the crypto space for their opinions on how the coronavirus pandemic has impacted the industry.Asheesh Birla, general manager of RippleNet:Da Hongfei, founder of Neo, founder and CEO of Onchain:Mike Belshe, CEO at BitGo:Preston Byrne, Partner at Anderson Kill, P.C.:Tim Draper, venture capitalist and noted Bitcoin investor:These quotes have been edited and condensed.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors’ alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
461,"Barely 100 years ago at the start of the 20th century, people were able to exchange dollars for gold at their local bank. While gold was too hard to trade between people, banking institutions held gold and gave people cash for it. This was during what was known as the gold standard. Each sovereign currency’s value was determined relative to a fixed amount of gold. However, in the decades ahead, that standard quickly changed.Toward the end of World War II, dozens of powerful people organized a meeting to discuss a new monetary agreement designed to minimize the economic damage done by the war. This meeting was named after the location where it took place: Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in the United States.It was a long-term plan with several parts that spanned over decades. And the Bretton Woods delegates decided that multiple fiat currencies would now be backed by the U.S. dollar as opposed to gold itself. At first, the dollar proved to be stable enough to support the Bretton Woods agreement in 1944 — until it wasn’t in the decades ahead. During the Vietnam War, President Richard Nixon called for more money. There wasn’t any more money in circulation. So, he started printing.In 1971, President Nixon ended the dollar’s convertibility to gold, which effectively ended the Bretton Woods agreement after nearly 30 years.The removal of the gold standard turned each country’s fiat currency into a floating exchange rate that was no longer fixed. Money was not measured by the dollar anymore; now, each currency was measured in relation to every other currency, with prices that constantly changed, creating foreign exchange market volatility.Today, one asset that fiat currencies are measured against is Bitcoin (BTC). As I mentioned in 2019, I think Bitcoin is the best investment when it comes to currencies in the sense of sound money.In certain countries — such as Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela, to name a few — Bitcoin’s price is currently at an all-time high compared with their national fiat. Relatively speaking, that’d be equivalent to Bitcoin price already being around $20,000.The problem is that Bitcoin is not ready to be a monetary system in and of itself. Most people who have Bitcoin are just holding it — they’re not selling it or using it as currency due to its potential to rapidly appreciate, despite the downside risks.Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund is now calling for a second Bretton Woods era to be announced in 2020. This would establish the Special Drawing Right, or SDR, as the new reserve currency as opposed to the U.S. dollar. The SDR serves as the most stable investment option for the IMF. Its value consists of the top five global fiat currencies as a protection against volatile movements in forex markets. The problem with the SDR approach is that it could make the economic situation even worse than it is today.History has shown that when people have an inflated amount of power with regard to money, they will use it. Just look at President Nixon during the Vietnam War and the original Bretton Woods agreement in the mid-20th century. Even worse is that now, nearly all central banks are printing more money, which in turn leads to inflation as fiat currencies lose their purchasing power.We can’t have a single powerful entity with the power to print itself out of temporary trouble, especially while it would be putting us in future debt that would be impossible to manage. This is the opposite of democracy, where only a few people control big monetary decisions that affect everyone. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin aim to solve this dilemma, thanks to their limited supply, among other favorable qualities inherent in blockchain technology.Blockchain has raised our standards to expect decentralization in the institutions that are meant to serve us. True decentralization is reached when the hierarchy is broken. Everything becomes transparent, and incentives are offered to push the system forward in the right direction.Sogur, for example, is a startup tackling the ambitious challenge of creating a new monetary system based on its cryptocurrency SGR that models the SDR while leveraging blockchain and an intelligent economic design advised by world-renowned economists.I like the idea of currency baskets that serve as a much more reliable, stable means of exchange. I don’t like that the IMF gets endless decision-making power over our global monetary system. Blockchain-based solutions are different — they have a foundation that’s governed by an assembly and, for example, can give SGR holders veto power over every decision at any given time.Blockchain technology can combine the elements of decentralized governance into a classical corporate structure, in order to comply with international laws and Anti-Money Laundering requirements, while using a smart-contract-based bonding curve to tame inflation and volatility, which remain two of the biggest problems with traditional fiat currencies that can be solved.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
462,"Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped below the $18,000 support level on Nov. 22. This comes after BTC continuously saw high over-the-counter (OTC) and institutional volume throughout November.Data suggests that the growing institutional demand was likely one of the main catalysts behind the BTC price rally to $18,965.According to the data from Skew, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust’s volume on OTC Markets increased significantly in the fourth quarter.OTC Markets is a securities exchange in the U.S. that allows institutional and accredited investors to purchase various securities. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust trades on OTC Markets, similar to an exchange-traded fund (ETF).There is a clear difference between the ongoing uptrend and the 2017 rally. This time, Bitcoin has shown more composure and stability throughout the uptrend, consecutively reclaiming major resistance levels.Bitcoin saw a large spike in spot volume, futures exchange open interest, and institutional demand. Yet, various metrics such as Google Trends have shown the mainstream interest for Bitcoin is relatively low.The combination of the two abovementioned factors suggests institutions have likely been the primary driving force of the recent rally.The heavy involvement of institutions in a prolonged Bitcoin rally is optimistic because institutions are likely to accumulate BTC with a long-term strategy.This trend explains why most of the major dips Bitcoin saw in November were aggressively bought up. As Cointelegraph reported, Dan Tapiero, the co-founder of 10T Holdings, said “big boys will buy dips now.""Tapiero also emphasized that real fundamentals are driving the ongoing rally, unlike the 2017 mania. He said:Michael Novogratz, the billionaire Bitcoin investor, also said that Bitcoin has become an institutional asset along the way.In recent months, more institutions, hedge funds, and investment banks have started comparing BTC to gold. Novogratz said on CNBC:Whales, or high-net-worth investors, typically use OTC and exchanges simultaneously to accumulate Bitcoin.Throughout November, analysts at the on-chain analysis firm Whalemap found the emergence of major whale clusters.Whale clusters are price levels where whales buy BTC and do not move their holdings. Clusters often signify areas where whales buy Bitcoin.The data from Whalemap show that $16,411, $16,278 and $15,691 remain as the big whale clusters. Hence, even if BTC sees a short-term pullback, the aggressive accumulation from whales in November has established crucial support areas.In the near term, following BTC’s recent minor correction from $18,865 to below $18,000, whale clusters are expected to act as important support levels. The $17,300 and $16,411 price levels remain as the major support levels."
463,"Every once in a while, the crypto community crowns a new king for secure transactions, and the latest king seems to be multiparty computation, or MPC. This year, MPC adoption by custodial and noncustodial players has progressed and gained market traction at a rapid pace.However, it could come at a price. MPC providers offer regulators a backdoor into cryptocurrency transactions. As the industry becomes more reliant on MPC for security, it could end up compromising on the long-held principles of decentralization and censorship-resistance.In order to identify where the risks exist, let’s briefly recap on MPC and how it’s used. At the most basic level, MPC technology involves splitting private keys into segments and distributing them between different parties. Most commonly, the client holds one key segment, and the MPC provider holds another. The aim is to improve security by ensuring that no party has full control over any given transaction, which can only be executed if both parties provide their key segments.MPC service providers usually present their technology as something that merely helps to secure transactions. It’s sold under the premise of: “We keep half a key, you keep the other half, but you are the boss — only you decide when and where to transfer your funds. You can also pull all your funds from our account whenever you want.”But in reality, that isn’t exactly the case. MPC service providers act as middlemen whose approval is needed for a transaction to be executed.In this sense, MPC providers are playing a near-identical role to banks, with blockchain serving the role played by the SWIFT system. You could replace the sender’s bank with an MPC third-party service provider and replace the SWIFT system with the blockchain. The sole difference here lies in how the sender sends the payment. With a bank, the sender instructs the bank to release the funds; with an MPC provider, the sender and provider jointly sign the transaction. Both parties submit a partial key that is then transmitted to the blockchain by the MPC service provider.One could make the argument that there’s a significant difference between banks and MPC providers not accounted for in this comparison: Banks can freeze funds and even confiscate them. However, the issue is that such backdoors also exist in MPC providers.There is no argument here that MPC providers are just bad guys who want to rob their clients of their funds. As reputable, professional companies working with institutions, they need to meet a primary demand from their clients — that crypto funds are recoverable if someone loses their key.Private key security has long been a sticking point for institutions and crypto firms. So the ability to recover funds in the event of a key loss is absolutely critical for any firm that is claiming to offer secure crypto storage. Imagine a bank that didn’t allow you to recover a forgotten password, simply telling you that if you’ve lost your password, your money has gone forever.In light of the responsibility they hold for customer’s funds as a third party, it’s evident that MPC providers offer a backdoor for regulatory intervention. Ultimately, this means that MPC companies could play the same role as banks.If a legal authority demands an MPC service provider to stop a transaction, it will be compelled to do so. Furthermore, if MPC providers allow users to recover lost keys, it means that a regulator could also issue a demand to confiscate funds. Again, assuming this is a legally binding request, the provider would be forced to comply if they want to stay in business.This isn’t mere hyperbole. The regulators are already here. In June 2019, the Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, approved an initiative to regulate virtual assets and virtual asset service managers. While overall compliance is still low, we can rest assured that the FATF will continue to widen the net until all Virtual Asset Service Providers are included.While the crypto community’s focus has been on how exchanges will manage the FATF regulation, MPC providers also perfectly match the profile of a Virtual Asset Service Provider, which manages and transfers client funds in a similar way to a banking wire transfer. The same regulatory conditions apply to all companies who directly or indirectly hold, manage or control virtual assets.So it follows that this regulation creates the same expectations from MPCs as those that are currently applied to the banking system. In the end, this could mean large transactions become reportable to the regulator, and clients are subject to the same Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering requirements as they are for a bank account.If more evidence were needed, we only need to look at the big banks who have already recognized that MPC technology offers benefits that fit with their existing compliance frameworks. Citibank and Goldman Sachs have already invested in MPC providers, and we can expect many more to be announced very soon. With the United States Treasury Office of the Comptroller of the Currency having already green-lit crypto custody services for federally chartered banks, MPC offers a regulator-friendly way for banks to start digging into the crypto pile.The fact that MPC service providers limit the mobility of their customers by creating dependency on their own wallets could also prove to be attractive to banks, creating a kind of forced loyalty far removed from the vision of open finance that is held dear by many in the crypto space.It’s easy to assume that such a network will manage only “authorized” currencies and coins. “Unchecked” assets, like your personal Bitcoin (BTC), won’t generate the kind of fees they could levy on authorized transactions, and might even be banned over time.On a technical level, MPC is impressive and might fit perfectly for players who have no concerns about regulators getting involved in crypto. However, for those who do, it’s worth being aware that it also provides a backdoor to the regulated and centralized cryptosphere in just the same way as regulated and centralized exchanges are already experiencing. This is a good enough reason to think twice before advocating or using it.As a final point, it’s worth adding that the technology is still very much in its infancy. There is a vision for the creation of a decentralized MPC, but it’s far from a developed solution. The route there is still long and winding, but it would be a step in the right direction for those who advocate the original vision of decentralized, open networks underpinning an internet of value. I urge you to ask your MPC service provider what happens if you lose your wallet or your seed.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

464,"On Friday, investment management firm VanEck released new research indicating that Bitcoin’s price movements are less volatile than between a quarter and a third of the stocks listed on the S&P 500. In a blog post, the German issuer of exchange-traded products said that while Bitcoin (BTC) has long been considered a “nascent and volatile asset outside of the traditional stock and capital markets,” the reality shows that the world’s largest cryptocurrency trades with volatility comparable to that of some of the largest companies in the world.On a year-to-date basis, 29% of S&P 500 stocks experienced more volatile price fluctuations than the digital currency, while 22% did the same on a 90-day basis, said VanEck.The research is notable, given that VanEck’s flagship offerings are largely couched in an asset class long considered to be a competitor to Bitcoin — gold.Of VanEck’s nearly $50 billion in assets under management, the majority are related to gold funds. The company founded both the first gold stock fund in 1968 (INIVX) and the first — now wildly popular — gold miners’ exchange-traded fund in 2006 (GDX).Despite their emphasis on bullion, VanEck has never been shy about exploring Bitcoin, however. The company currently offers a Bitcoin exchange-traded product to institutional investors, and has previously sent applications to the SEC to offer a Bitcoin ETF.The company also recently issued a report arguing that institutional investors should consider having Bitcoin on their books.Perhaps, given the regulatory hurdles VanEck encountered during their last Bitcoin ETF venture, this latest research might be aimed more at assuaging SEC fears than those of investors, who to date have demonstrated a remarkable appetite for BTC-backed securities."
465,"Last week, as share prices ripped upwards of 50% to levels not seen since the 2018 cryptocurrency bullrun, Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ: RIOT) appointed former director of the listing committee for the Toronto Stock Exchange, Hubert Marleau, to the Riot board of directors. The Colorado-based firm was in the market for a new director after the departure of former Canadian Cabinet member Remo Mancini. Marleau brings a wide range of regulatory and governing experience to Riot, having also served as governor of the Montreal and Vancouver stock exchanges. Marleau also boasts a strong academic background, and he currently serves as a chair for a lecture series in his name at the University of Ottawa.Marleau’s appointment comes amid an unusually strong week for RIOT share price. RIOT closed at $6 even after opening the week at $4.10, easily outpacing Bitcoin's nearly 20% rise. On the year, RIOT is up nearly 500% from $1.22.Appointing a new director is not the only move that the mining giant has made in recent weeks. Riot agreed to a massive 8,000-unit, $17.7 million-dollar purchase of new Antminer S19 Pro Bitcoin mining rigs to expand operations in August.The purchase may be an effort to stave off rival mining firm Marathon Patent Group’s efforts to swipe the “Top Miner in North America” crown. As Cointelegraph previously reported, Marathon themselves purchased 10,000 S19 Pro units in late October.Like Riot, Marathon Patent Group’s MARA ticker is trading much higher on the week, closing at $3.39 price after a $2.38 Monday open."
466,"This week Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied to a new 3 year high at $18,965, leading investors to believe a new all-time high above $20,000 is on the cards. While these are exciting times, data does show that some professional investors feel antsy about the price at these levels and the absence of retail FOMO has some calling for a sharp pullback.Data shows Bitcoin hasn't seen a drop larger than 5% since Sept. 4 and over the past 77 days the digital asset has gained 84%.The last time similar price action was observed was on Nov. 25, 2019.Back then, BTC made a 47% move from $6,900 to $10,150 by mid-February 2020, a 86 day sequence. Nevertheless, one should not jump to the conclusion that a substantial correction necessarily follows every movement without a 5% daily drop.Evidence of such disparate expectations can be extracted from the futures contracts basis. Typically, the indicator should display a 3% to 10% annualized premium.Take notice how traders were willing to pay an additional 20% annualized to carry leveraged positions back in February. This is rather unusual and a signal of extreme optimism.This time around, the basis indicator has been gravitating near 10%. Therefore, it is safe to infer that the odds of cascading sell order liquidations is much lower this time.Traders have been taken aback by this unusual trend, and data confirms that there is a complete lack of conviction. Even though the BTC futures contracts premium currently stands at a bullish zone, that validify buying it indiscriminately.To effectively gauge whether professionals have been carrying long positions throughout this rally, investors should monitor the top traders long-to-short ratio at leading crypto exchanges.At Huobi we can see that the top traders entered a net short position as Bitcoin surpassed $16,000 on Nov.16. On Nov.19, a few bearish bets appeared as BTC failed to break the $18,000 resistance. Once again, they were quick to close their losses and are currently flat. Therefore, one can assume that professional traders have been trying to guess a local top without much conviction.Interestingly, data from Binance shows top traders applying a different strategy. Despite this, it still reflects a lack of conviction, as one can infer below.Binance top traders held a 10% net long while Bitcoin rallied above $16,000 but they then scrambled to buy after it shot above $17,500.While still maintaining a bullish position, they significantly reduced it as BTC struggled to break $18,000 on Nov.18.It is worth noting that exchanges gather top traders' data differently, as there are multiple ways to measure clients net exposure. Therefore, any comparison between different providers should be made on percentual changes instead of absolute numbers.Ultimately, the data signal that there is some indecision or at least a lack of strong conviction among top traders.When the market is sending mixed signals there’s nothing wrong with sitting tight and not being in a position. At least, this is what savvy traders seem to be doing.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

467,"Bitcoin continues to move through the gears. The currency is up more than 12 percent over the week and is now playing with the $18,000 mark. And it’s not just the US dollar that Bitcoin is bashing. It’s also hit all-time highs against the Russian ruble, the Colombian peso, the Brazilian real, the Turkish lira, and the Sudanese pound among others. Its rise, now 375 percent above the point that gold investor Peter Schiff accidentally called as Bitcoin’s bottom, is inevitably causing analysts to ask how high it can go.One expert is predicting that Bitcoin will soon hit $22,000, citing HODL and funding rates, the fall in Bitcoin reserves, and the growth of institutional accumulation. Investor Mike Novogratz has his eye on $65,000, powered by high demand and limited supply. Thomas Fitzpatrick, a senior analyst at Citibank, is looking even higher. In a report aimed at the bank’s institutional clients, he predicted $318,000 by December 2021.And yet despite Bitcoin’s current rise, and its positive direction, it’s all happening very quietly. While the coin’s last rush towards $20,000 generated headlines around the world, the press has barely noticed the current price increase.In China, at least one bank has noticed. The China Construction Bank chose the digital exchange Fusang to issue $3 billion worth of debt securities. The bonds would be tokenized and exchangeable for Bitcoin. But it’s not happening, at least not any time soon. Shortly after the announcement, Fusang said that the issuance would be delayed until further notice “at the request of the issuer.”In the US, Jay Clayton, the chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has announced that he is leaving his post. Clayton previously told Bitcoin investors they couldn’t expect to trade on mainstream exchanges without robust regulation.The blockchain, though, continues to find new uses. IBM is teaming up with German textile manufacturer Kaya&Kato to use the blockchain to track supply chains in the fashion industry. Albany Airport in New York is using the blockchain to track cleanliness, while BitPay is launching a new service to enable businesses to make payments using cryptocurrencies. And Cointelegraph is using Rarible to offer single edition NFTs of its illustrators’ art-inspired illustrations.But the blockchain might want to steer clear of voting systems for a while. Security experts at MIT say that using blockchain voting technology might increase the risk of hackers trying to tamper with elections.It’s not all good news for cryptocurrency journalists though. Binance is suing Forbes and two of its journalists. The publication had alleged that Binance had a plan to avoid US regulators. The company denies the allegation and is demanding compensation and punitive damages.Check out the audio here:The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

468,"In a blog post of Friday, Binance re-introduced BTCB to the world — a wrapped Bitcoin asset intended to bring liquidity from the world's largest cryptocurrency, BTC, to Binance Smart Chain's DeFi (decentralized finance) ecosystem. However, hodlers may be cheering the renewed interest in BTCB for a different reason: each Bitcoin locked on BSC may contribute to a looming BTC supply crisis.First announced last year, Binance initially saw wrapped Bitcoin solely as a vehicle for traders to obtain cross-chain asset exposure without leaving BSC. Since then, however, the utility of wrapped Bitcoin has boomed due to the precocious maturation of the DeFi ecosystem.For instance, WBTC — a wrapped Bitcoin token on Ethereum — has enjoyed massive success since its January 2019 launch: it currently ranks as the #14 cryptocurrency by marketcap, and has found significant adoption in protocols such as Aave and Uniswap, whose contracts both rank among the top-10 holders of WBTC. In their blog, Binance noted that similar adoption may be possible for BTCB. The wrapped Bitcoin could be used to mint stablecoins with BSC-native protocols such as QIAN and Venus; as collateral for lending protocols such as CREAM; and in yield farming and liquidity mining protocols such as Beefy, Bakery, and Pancake. According to what Binance calls a “Proof of Assets” page, there are currently over 9,600 Bitcoin on BSC — over $181 million worth. However, the blog post specifies that only 2,000 are circulating. Other smart contract-enabled chains intend to compound the growing scarcity. Solana’s cross-chain Wormhole project will turn ERC-20 tokens into SPL tokens, including WBTC, and likewise, Interlay is using support from a Web3 Foundation grant to build a trustless bridge bringing wrapped Bitcoin to Polkadot. Interlay will launch in early 2021.Particularly if the success of wrapped and cross-chain Bitcoin assets continue to grow, institutions looking to hoover the BTC supply may well be faced with mounting scarcity. Aaron Wright, the co-founder of OpenLaw, pointed to such a possible future in a Tweet:0.6%+ of Bitcoin is now wrapped and being put to work on Ethereum (and growing).

469,"For the past several months, miners around the world have been extremely active, which can be seen through spikes in hash rates that coincided with a significant increase in the prices of cryptocurrencies. At the beginning of 2020, Ether (ETH) could be bought for $130, and now, ETH has reached $500. The king of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC), added almost a cool $10,000 to its price.So, how can users engage with the industry? What has been obvious for some time now is that solo mining is not the way to go. For Bitcoin, Ether and every major altcoin, the blockchain is built in such a way that the complexity of finding blocks is constantly increasing, which means that a pair of GPU cards is not powerful enough to generate one block.The point is not that the rig is insufficiently powerful to mine Ether, rather it’s impossible mathematically. One rig can sit there searching for a block for several months. If we are talking about mining Bitcoin on ASICs, then it will take even more time. It’s easier to go bankrupt on equipment and electricity than to mine crypto solo. The calculation is simple: divide the total hash rate of Ether by your hash rate and get the number of seconds it will take on average to find a block.So, it seems logical that miners would flock to mining pools, especially today, as even non-mining companies are starting to launch such products. For example, Binance recently launched its own mining pool for Ether.A mining pool is a server that combines the computing power of all the participants connected to it. Miners join the pool over the internet, reallocating their hardware to the pool. They jointly perform mathematical solutions to find blocks of a specific cryptocurrency. When the pool finds a block, the pool obtains a consensus from other network participants, then receives a reward. This reward is shared among all members of the pool in accordance with the amount of hash rate provided.Before choosing a pool, it’s important to know the size of the pool. When a pool grows, the chances of discovering a block increase. But the more people join the pool, the less profit each participant receives. This is a double-edged sword: small but frequent payments, or bigger payments, but less often.Before joining the pool, users need to find out the minimum payment, which is the minimum amount of crypto that must be mined before it will be sent to the users’ wallet. If the minimum payment is high, then the user will have to be part of the pool for a long time before receiving any income.Another important thing that should be mentioned is that participation in any pool is not free. Users pay a certain percentage of their income for participating. Usually, such commission varies from 1% to 3%. In general, participation in any pool does not require serious investment and knowledge, and if the user has already put together a rig, then it will not be difficult to figure out which pool to choose. Here is what to pay attention to when choosing a pool, regardless of the cryptocurrency mined:After constructing a rig, it’s time to choose a mining pool. Of course, most of the pools work for Bitcoin or Ether mining. Below are some of the most popular pools used to mine the top two cryptocurrencies. For Bitcoin, almost all the main pools are based in China, which is not surprising, as the country produces most of the Bitcoin mining hardware.Founded in 2013, F2Pool is one of the oldest Chinese pools, and it’s of primary interest for Bitcoin miners. The pool accounts for almost a fifth of the total amount of BTC mined. The pool uses Pay Per Share+, or PPS+, as the payout model in which the miner receives a reward for each share accepted by the pool, regardless of the blocks found by the pool. The pool determines the cost of each share independently, taking into account the network complexity, reward, block time and the pool’s own power.In addition to Bitcoin, the pool mines more than 40 coins. The commission, depending on the coin, ranges from 1% to 5%. As for Bitcoin, the pool takes 2.5% of the rewards as a commission, and payments are made once per day. Users must withdraw the earned money within 90 days, otherwise the pool will keep it for the development of the service.Poolin is a pool owned by parent company Blockin that launched in 2017. The pool is popular among Bitcoin miners. Poolin offers quite a few coins to choose from: Ether, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin SV (BSV), Litecoin (LTC) and so on. Commission fees are not fixed; rather, they are set for each cryptocurrency separately, with a 2.5% fee for BTC.The payment model depends on the chosen coin: PPS or Full Pay Per Share, known as FPPS. Under the latter method, the pool also distributes transaction fees among miners, which adds 10% to 20% to their income. This method is used to pay for Bitcoin mining.A notable feature is that Poolin provides mining on ASICs and GPUs from Nvidia and AMD. The development team regularly updates the software every couple of weeks to ensure the stability of the service.BTC.com is one of the largest international cryptocurrency mining pools. It’s controlled by well-known manufacturer of mining equipment Bitmain, which produces a line of ASIC miners under the Antminer brand. The China-based platform was launched in 2013.The commission for each block mined by the pool is set at 4%. Besides Bitcoin, a number of other cryptocurrencies can be mined through BTC.com, including Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Mining pool representatives keep records of its users’ income.AntPool is a Chinese project that was launched in 2014. Just like BTC.com, the pool is controlled by Bitmain. In addition to BTC, AntPool can mine seven more cryptocurrencies, including the privacy-oriented coins Dash and Monero (XMR).Payments are made daily, and the service has low commissions, with some payments made with zero fees. In AntPool, payments are mainly made using the standard method, Pay Per Last N Share — or PPLNS — in which users get payments for the last share based on pool luck.With this method, there is no fixed payment for the share, and the main issue is the speed of finding a block. When a pool uses the PPLNS method, the payment comes from “time shifts” between searching two blocks. It means that if the block is not found for a long time, the payment gradually increases.A distinctive feature of the pool is the ability to work in “solo” mode — but not in the literal sense. The pool makes it possible to carry out “solo” mining through joint efforts. This means that the user whose rig has discovered the block will receive the payment.SparkPool is registered in China and was launched in January 2018, and half a year later, the pool has entered the list of leaders in mining Ether. Additionally, SparkPool allows the mining of coins such as Nervos’ Common Knowledge Base (CKB), Grin, and Beam.Mining takes place using the Ethash algorithm, and payments occur using the PPS+ method. Payments are made every day, based on Singapore Standard Time, and the minimum amount for payments is 0.1 ETH. On the 28th of every month, funds are withdrawn automatically if the balance is more than 0.0105 ETH, and the withdrawal fee is 1%.Registering with the pool is optional. Users can mine anonymously, but if so, not all the functions of the pool will be available.Ethermine is one of the most popular pools dedicated to Ether mining. This pool is the largest for Ethereum. Pool servers are located in Europe, Asia and the United States.The pool uses the PPLNS payout model. The minimum payment amount is the equivalent of 0.5 ETH, and the maximum amount is 10 ETH. There is no commission for the withdrawal of funds, and payment comes instantly if the blockchain network is stable. The pool is intended only for mining cryptocurrency on GPU processors.SpiderPool is a five-year-old Chinese project that only supports four coins: ETH, BTC, BSV and BCH. Nevertheless, the pool is quite popular among Ether miners.There is not much information available for non-Chinese users, but the pool’s commission is 2%. The minimum payout amount depends on the coin, but once per week, users can apply for an amount that is below the minimum threshold. Otherwise, payments are made automatically once per day.Nanopool specializes in coins that are mostly mined using GPU cards. Currently, Ether, Ethereum Classic (ETC), Zcash (ZEC), Monero, Ravencoin (RVN) and Pascal (PASC) mining are supported. The pool allows users to mine not only a single cryptocurrency but also two different cryptocurrencies simultaneously, with a proportional distribution of power between them. Like any other mining pool, Nanopool has a fee that is charged based on the income of its users. The pool uses the PPLNS payment method.Withdrawing Ether from a miner’s account balance to their wallet is carried out in Nanopool automatically when the minimum payment is reached, which is 0.05 ETH.Nanopool does not have a clear payment schedule, but payments happen in several stages throughout the day. As soon as the miner’s account balance exceeds the set minimum value, it will be paid during the next round of payment.When choosing a pool, each person should pay attention to the list of available coins to make sure their coin of choice is on the list. Also, consider the payout and commission model, as a pool that offers the lowest commission and pays for transactions is preferable. Another issue is the proximity of the pool servers: the closer the server, the more stable the mining process will be.Related: The top crypto-mining graphics cards to get a big bang for your buckIn general, it can be said that no matter what coin the user chooses, they are unlikely to lose out when using a mining pool. According to Chun Wang, co-founder of F2Pool, the entire mining industry is currently on the rise:"
470,"A pullback in the price of Bitcoin (BTC) is likely, based on several on-chain data points, namely the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) indicator, stablecoin inflows, stacked sell orders at $19,000, and the Crypto and Fear Index. However, the question remains when that correction would occur.The  SOPR indicator essentially gauges how profitable Bitcoin holders are at the moment. When the SOPR is high, BTC is at risk of a profit-taking pullback since traders tend to sell when they are in profit.Meanwhile, stablecoin inflows show how many stablecoins, such as USDT Tether, are flowing into exchanges. When stablecoin inflows increase, this typically means buyer demand is rising. On the other hand, selling pressure tends to rise when BTC reserves outpace the inflow of stablecoins.In the past several days, the SOPR indicator has reached a level that previously led the price of Bitcoin to correct such as in late 2018 and summer 2019.On Nov. 20, Rafael Schultz-Kraft, the chief technical officer at Glassnode, noted:This trend can become concerning if the momentum of Bitcoin slows. Renato Shirakashi, the creator of the SOPR indicator, said Nobel prize laureate Daniel Kahneman’s work shows investors are comfortable selling when in profit.Hence, if Bitcoin gets stagnant or consolidates in the near term below the $19,000 resistance, a minor pullback could emerge. Shirakashi wrote:The rise in the Exchange Stablecoins Ratio from CryptoQuant coincides with the rising SOPR. The Stablecoins Ratio is the Bitcoin exchange reserves divided by stablecoin reserves. When it increases, it shows that potential selling pressure is rising.As such, CryptoQuant CEO, Ki Young Ju, expects a short-term, albeit not a big correction, in the short term. He noted:Exchange order books also show that the $19,000 level has become an important resistance area. There are significant sell orders across Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Binance, and Coinbase near $19,000, which might prevent the continuation of a rally.Ok 19000 is kinda stacked @CryptoCobain is gonna have to pull out the big bucks. pic.twitter.com/KnNSzYYRnLAnother possible factor that could trigger a short-term pullback is the Crypto Fear and Greed index. The index is still at dangerously high levels, which raises the probability of a correction.However, over the past several months that exchanges' Bitcoin reserves have been in a continuous downtrend as Cointelegraph reported. This could offset a major market-wide correction, particularly if the BTC bull run accelerates triggering FOMO, which means a large influx of new buyers.Year-to-date, Glassnode found that the balance of Bitcoin on exchanges declined by 18%. The continuous drop in exchange reserves reduces the probability of deep pullbacks, which analysts, like Ki, have consistently emphasized in November.Moreover, there are other factors that could delay the correction until after Bitcoin breaks $19,000 or potentially even $20,000.CoinMetrics network data analyst Lucas Nuzzi found that the MVRV ratio, which tracks the realized cap of Bitcoin, is not near the level that marked previous tops.The term realized cap refers to the Bitcoin market cap at the time investors bought BTC. If the realized cap is high, it means many investors bought BTC at a higher price.Hence, there is a strong argument for a delayed pullback, potentially after the ongoing rally gets overextended. On Nov. 20, Cole Garner, an on-chain analyst, wrote:"
471,"Holding Bitcoin (BTC) in treasury will soon become a corporate standard. Wall Street firm MicroStrategy recently made headlines when it decided to allocate a large portion of its treasury to Bitcoin, buying over 21,000 BTC in August and almost 17,000 more in September, making its CEO, Michael Saylor, seem quite prescient already. MicroStrategy stock rallied just like BTC as well — by 50%. According to Saylor, Bitcoin was the best inflation hedge and store of value, and in his words, “Cash is trash.” His wager has, so far, been handsomely rewarding.Related: MicroStrategy buying Bitcoin shows institutional investors seek to de-riskTechnically speaking, Bitcoin is, in fact, a worldwide store of value. BTC is not just a United States or an Asian phenomenon — it is held and exchanged around the world via myriad local exchanges, making the available liquidity pool both global and capillary in granularity.There are many technical reasons for calling Bitcoin an inflation hedge. BTC is a numerus-clausus asset class, meaning that there is a finite number in circulation (a maximum of 21 million coins) much like gold, high-end real estate and fine art. Furthermore, there is a dwindling new supply of Bitcoin — after the BTC mining halving — and a culture of long-term holding among most crypto participants. All of this spells a small supply. Historically, BTC seems to replay its past bull run waves post-halvings. This is the third halving, and it doesn’t disappoint. On the demand side, the picture is expanding.The world’s economies are entering strong expansionary monetary phases — generalized quantitative easing, so to speak — as a reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bitcoin, so far, has outperformed every asset class throughout the crisis, spurring new demand and earning its wings as a global store of value. The fact that it is ethereal and not tied to real economic cash flows — unlike, say, stocks or real estate — plays to its advantage when the world’s economies sputter about.Related: What the COVID-19 pandemic means for blockchain and cryptoBitcoin provides an alternative, digital safe haven. Demand, then, is materializing on pure monetary considerations, and Bitcoin is, technically speaking, a natural inflation hedge in that regard. It will soon be a corporate standard like owning treasury notes is.There is also a slight ideological bent to the current corporate moves. For savvy chief financial officers, having a portion of the treasury held in digital currency provides a measure of regulatory hedge and arbitrage. No one controls the Bitcoin blockchain, and no government can hack it and seize operational funds. This added safety valve, a feature of most blockchains (censorship resistance), is in fact one of the main raisons d’etre of BTC. This feature may be a deterrent for most central banks, as they want to run their own currencies and blockchains, not Bitcoin’s, and they certainly want to control issuance, unlike Bitcoin’s programmatic and nondiscretionary issuance. And it is, in fact, why Bitcoin will find favor with many chief financial officers, ironically both conservative and avant-garde ones.What is surprising in the case of Saylor and MicroStrategy is the size of the bet. With a market capitalization of around $2 billion, a $425 million wager seems very consequential to the business. So far, it has paid off — dramatically. While waging everything may seem foolhardy, not waging anything is worse.What may seem foolhardy or extreme will seem run of the mill. With about a rough estimate of $10 trillion of corporate treasury worldwide, even a 3% allocation instead of cash represents $300 billion, which is about the aggregate value of Bitcoin, in liquid cash. These orders of magnitude say that BTC’s new wave has arrived. The demand number gets big, and the supply gets smaller. Soon, every chief financial officer will be calmly asking not if the corporation needs exposure to the digital asset class but how to do it well and who to trust in the management of its digital assets.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

472,"Earlier today the price of Bitcoin (BTC) hit $18,815 on Binance for the first time in nearly three years. Following the breakout, BTC is on track to see a new all-time high in the near term for four significant reasons.The factors that make a new record high likely are growing institutional demand, reduced selling pressure, a spot-driven market rally, and the significance of the $18,500 resistance breach.For Bitcoin holders to sell, they need to first deposit BTC to exchanges. When BTC exchange reserves drop, it often indicates that there is low sell-side pressure in the market.According to data from Glassnode, the year-to-date Bitcoin balance on exchanges dropped 18%. Analysts at the on-chain market analysis firm said that BTC liquidity is continuing its downward trajectory.This trend is significant because it shows there is hardly any appetite to sell Bitcoin at the current price level despite its rally from $3,600 to $18,700 within eight months.After BlackRock CIO of fixed income Rick Reider discussed Bitcoin on CNBC, billionaire investor Mike Novogratz said BTC is now an institutional asset.During the CNBC interview, Reider said that Bitcoin is here to say and that it has the potential to evolve. He suggested that millennials favor BTC and that the strengthening reality of digital currencies becoming mainstream payment options were both major positive factors for BTC.Considering institutional trends, Novogratz said 2021 would likely be as good or better than 2020 for Bitcoin. He said:On Oct. 10, a cryptocurrency derivatives trader known as “Light” said Bitcoin is showing signs of a sell-side liquidity crisis. He noted at the time:The performance of Bitcoin throughout the past two quarters depicted a clear lack of sellers in the market. Particularly after the halving, which occurred in May, the declining selling pressure on BTC is a notable positive.In addition to the decline in sellers, crypto derivatives trader, “Cantering Clark” noted that the spot market is leading the rest of the market. He said:The spot market leading the derivatives market is important because the latter enables traders to use high leverage. When the futures market leads a bull rally, the uptrend becomes susceptible to large price movements.On Nov. 18, Bitcoin crashed from $18,500 to around $17,200, minutes after reaching a two-year high.The sharp rejection on the day showed that large amounts of sell orders were filed above $18,500. Today's second breakout above $18,500 confirms that there is enough momentum in the market to break through crucial multi-year resistance levels and flip them to support.Based on the combination of these four factors, and the fact that global central bank policies of continued liquidity injections may raise inflation, the probability of BTC securing a new all-time high soon remains high."
473,"PayPal’s entry into the cryptocurrency market could be having a dramatic impact on the Bitcoin (BTC) price. In a newly published report, crypto investment firm Pantera Capital says a Bitcoin shortage is at the heart of the recent price surge and that the majority of newly minted BTC is being scooped up by PayPal.PayPal’s new crypto service is “already having a huge impact,” Pantera claims, adding that the payment merchant is snatching up roughly 70% of all the new BTC in circulation.Citing itBit data, Pantera claims:According to Pantera, the data suggest that PayPal and Cash App combined are buying up all of the newly-issued Bitcoin.Bitcoin’s monetary policy is programmed to be deflationary over time. With widescale adoption, that leads to higher purchasing power and supply scarcity. Pantera claims it is the latter that is contributing to BTC’s parabolic surge.PayPal launched its crypto trading services in the U.S. earlier this month, allowing customers to trade up to $20,000 a week. The platform will be rolled out globally in early 2021.The online payment merchant has 300 million active users, which makes its foray into digital currency a major stepping stone for adoption.Pantera says it’s a lot easier to purchase Bitcoin now than it was during the last bull market in 2017. In addition to PayPal, retail onramps into Bitcoin and other digital currencies now include Cash App and Robinhood.Wider adoption means the digital currency is more likely to sustain higher price levels. Although Bitcoin remains highly volatile, it carved out an unusually long period of stability before catapulting higher over the past two months."
474,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) current rally has largely been led by investments from institutional investors and publicly listed companies. Data from Bitcointreasuries shows that companies hold about 4.54% of the current Bitcoin supply.A survey of 700 high-net-worth individuals chosen from across the globe shows that about 73% of respondents either own or want to own cryptocurrencies before the end of 2022. The proposed influx of money from large investors could boost demand and drive crypto prices higher.Bloomberg Intelligence strategist Mike McGlone believes that if history repeats itself, Bitcoin could rally to $170,000 over the next two years. McGlone pointed out that Bitcoin’s volatility versus gold was the lowest on record, and while volatility in risky assets across the globe has been increasing, Bitcoin’s volatility has been in decline. However, in the short term, McGlone expects Bitcoin to consolidate before zooming higher.In an interview with Cointelegraph, Nugget’s News CEO Alex Saunders said that Bitcoin’s price could rally to “$100,000 in the next five years,” and if it becomes the global reserve currency, then it could reach $1 million by 2035.When markets are bullish, it is easy to get sucked into the rally due to greed. However, every bull phase witnesses periodic corrections; hence, traders should be careful and protect their paper profits with a suitable stop loss.Let’s analyze the top 10 cryptocurrencies to spot the critical resistance and support levels to watch over the coming days.Bitcoin’s correction from $18,466.14 was short-lived, as the bulls defended the $17,200 support and have currently pushed the price to a new 52-week high. This suggests that the uptrend is strong and the bulls are firmly in control.The next resistance on the upside is the all-time high at $19,531.90, then the psychological level at $20,000. If the bulls can propel the price above $20,000 in the current leg of the uptrend, the momentum could further pick up and make a blow-off top.Usually, vertical rallies are followed by waterfall declines. The first support in an uptrend is the 20-day exponential moving average ($16,019), but if this support cracks, the correction could reach $14,000.The relative strength index (RSI) has risen deep into overbought territory, suggesting a pullback may occur anytime.However, when the momentum is strong, the price can stay overbought for an extended period; hence, investors should not try to call a top but protect their position with a suitable trailing stop-loss according to their trading strategy.As Bitcoin rallied to a multiyear high, Ether (ETH) broke out of the $488.134 resistance and cleared the psychological level at $500 for the first time since July 2018. This shows aggressive buying at higher levels.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI close to the overbought territory suggest that bulls are in control. If the bulls can flip $488.134 to support during the next pullback, the ETH/USD pair may start its journey to $550 and then to $625.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears can pull the price below $488.134 during the next correction, it will indicate profit-booking at higher levels. A break below the 20-day EMA ($451) may suggest that the short-term bullish momentum has ended.The long tails on the Nov. 18 and 19 candlesticks suggest that bulls are buying on dips. So far, they have managed to push XRP above the $0.303746 resistance, and next, they will try to drive the price above the overhead resistance at $0.326113.If they succeed, the XRP/USD pair could rally to $0.40. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears defend the overhead resistance, the pair may consolidate between $0.303746 and $0.326113 for a few days.A break below the $0.303746 support could suggest a lack of buyers at higher levels. The bears will then try to sink the pair below the 20-day EMA ($0.272) and gain the upper hand.Chainlink's LINK broke out and closed above the $13.28 resistance on Nov. 18, which completed a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders setup. This new uptrend has a pattern target of $19.2731.However, the bears will try to stall the up-move close to $16 and pull the price back below the breakout level of $13.28. If they can sink the price below $11.80, it will suggest that the current breakout was a bull trap.In an uptrend, the sentiment is to buy the dips. The rising moving averages and the RSI above 66 suggest that the bulls are in command. Hence, they are likely to buy the dip to the breakout level of $13.28 and flip it to support. If that happens, the uptrend could resume.Litecoin (LTC) has hit a new 52-week high today, above the overhead resistance at $84.3374. The strong rebound off the $68.9008 support on Nov. 18 shows that the bulls aggressively purchased the dip to the breakout level.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI has risen into the overbought zone, indicating that the bulls are in control. If the price sustains above $85, the rally may extend to $100. This level may act as a hurdle, but if crossed, the rally could reach $140.However, during the previous two instances, a reading of close to 80 on the RSI resulted in a correction. Hence, traders should look out for the possibility of a minor correction in the next few days.The trend in the LTC/USD pair could turn negative if the bears pull the price back below the breakout level of $68.9008.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has held the $242 support for the past two days, which shows that bulls are buying at lower levels. If the buyers can push the price above $260, the altcoin may start its journey to the $272 and $280 resistance zone.The overhead zone may act as a stiff hurdle, but if the bulls can push the price above it, the BCH/USD pair could rally to $326.30, then to $337.90.However, the flat 20-day EMA ($254) and the RSI near the midpoint suggest that the range-bound action between $242 and $272 may continue for a few more days.The advantage will shift in favor of the bears if the pair turns down from the current levels and slips below the $231 support.Polkadot's DOT took support at the 20-day EMA ($4.54) over the past two days and has broken above the overhead resistance at $4.95 today. The upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest that bulls are in command.If the buyers can propel the price above $5.5899, the DOT/USD pair may rally to $6.25, then to the highs at $6.8619.However, the bears are unlikely to throw in the towel easily. They will try to stall the current rally at $5.5899. If they manage to do that, the pair could consolidate between $4.95 and $5.5899 for a few days.This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears drag the price back below the breakout level of $4.95 and the 20-day EMA.Binance Coin (BNB) has broken out of the $27.30–$28.97 range it had been stuck in for the past few days, but the bulls are struggling to sustain the higher levels. This suggests that bears are attempting to keep the price inside the range.However, if the bulls can sustain the breakout, a new up-move to the $32–$33.3888 zone is possible. If the price turns down from this zone, the BNB/USD pair may extend its stay inside a large range.On the other hand, if the bulls can thrust the price above the resistance zone, the pair could retest the all-time highs at $39.5941.This positive view will be invalidated if the bulls fail to sustain the current breakout. In that case, the bears will try to pull the price below the $27.30 support, and if they succeed, the pair could drop to $25.6652.The bulls did not allow Cardano's ADA to slip below the moving averages and the downtrend line in the past two days. This is a positive sign as it shows buying at lower levels. The altcoin has resumed its journey to the top of the range at $0.114241.If the bulls can drive the price above $0.1142241, the ADA/USD pair could start a new uptrend that can rally to $0.1280, then to $0.1445.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that bulls have the upper hand. Traders can watch the RSI because a break above 60 could suggest that the rally may pick up momentum.However, if the pair once again turns down from the overhead resistance, the range-bound action could continue for a few more days.The bears could not sustain Bitcoin SV (BSV) below the downtrend line over the past two days. This shows that the bulls are accumulating at lower levels, and they have pushed the price back above the moving averages today.The BSV/USD pair could now move up to $181. If the bears defend this resistance aggressively, the pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. The flat moving averages and the RSI close to 54 suggest a balance between supply and demand.However, if the bulls can drive the price above $181, the pair could start a new uptrend that has a target objective of $216. This positive view will be invalidated if the price turns down and plummets below the moving averages.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

475,"Singapore is exploring wholesale central bank digital currency, or CBDC, said Sopnendu Mohanty, chief fintech officer at Singapore’s central bank and financial regulator, the Monetary Authority of Singapore.Speaking on the subject during an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, Mohanty pointed out that in Singapore, there is not much demand for a retail CBDC given that payment system infrastructure in the country already allows fast and cheap payments among individuals.Instead, Singapore's central bank is focused on the development of a wholesale CBDC, which would be used to facilitate settlements of securities and payments among financial institutions. “I don’t think we need to do any more experiments on wholesale CBDCs,” pointed out Mohanty. “Now, we should start thinking about going into production.”According to Mohanty, a severe but clear regulatory framework coupled with an openness to innovation is what makes Singapore one of the most attractive places for cryptocurrency businesses in Southeast Asia. ""Defining Singapore 'crypto-friendly',"" said Mohanty, ""would be “highly misleading.”In fact, he pointed out that the small city-state has a very clear regulatory framework in place to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism.Singapore’s central bank still believes that while business activity poses certain risks, the technology itself is neutral.“Allowing crypto to be an experimental construct in Singapore is what we are looking at,” he explained.Watch the full interview on our YouTube channel, and don’t forget to subscribe!"
476,"There are both bearish and bullish scenarios for Bitcoin in the foreseeable future. The bear cases surround two key data points: rising BTC deposits from whales to exchanges and BTC’s lack of retests of crucial support levels. The bull cases are based on HODLer activity, address activity, the market capitalization gap between BTC and gold, and the favorable technical structure of Bitcoin.Bitcoin surpassing $18,500 is critical for its near-term price cycle. There were large sell orders right above $18,500, which acted as a strong resistance area. In prior attempts to break past $18,500, BTC dropped substantially within a short period. This time, it exceeded the resistance level with ease, marking a clean breakout.Despite the technically strong uptrend of BTC, whale data indicates that the selling pressure on Bitcoin could intensify. Cole Garner, an on-chain analyst, cited CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio to say: “It’s likely there’s one more blow off leg left in the tank.” The price of Bitcoin saw a blow-off top on Nov. 18 when it abruptly dropped from $18,476 to $17,214 within two hours. Garner emphasized that the Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio has a “history of topping here.”The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has stabilized above $18,000 as the market demonstrates strong momentum above what was once a heavy multiyear resistance level. On Nov. 20, BTC price hit a new two-year high at $18,828 on Binance, surpassing the previous peak from Nov. 18. Following the breakout of Bitcoin, analysts are divided on its future price trend.The Bitcoin Exchange Whale ratio is an important metric to gauge selling pressure from whales because it shows the estimate of the amount of BTC that high-net-worth investors are depositing to exchanges. Typically, investors move funds into exchanges when they want to sell. High-net-worth investors prefer to store their funds in noncustodial wallets that they fully control. Hence, analysts track exchange deposits as a potential signal for a sell-off.Atop the whale data that signals a minor pullback, the monthly chart of Bitcoin shows an overextended upside price movement. Sasha Fleyshman, a trader at the institutional cryptocurrency investment firm Arca, said on Nov. 1 that the $13,716 level is a crucial area. It marked the open and closing prices of the December 2017 and January 2018 candles, when Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high at almost $20,000. Hence, surpassing that level means $13,716 will serve as the major macro support area.Albeit unlikely, if a deep correction does occur, Fleyshman said that he expects the “palpable” support level at $13,716 “to be the line in the sand support wise to maintain structure.” Whether BTC will see a major correction in the near term still remains uncertain. But in the case of a correction, Fleyshman said BTC has a big support area to defend the ongoing bull run.Denis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto exchange and broker BeQuant, told Cointelegraph that similar price drops to the recent abrupt crash have happened before, and the recent dip was met with significant buyer demand. Hence, although BTC saw a major downside movement in a short period, he believes it’s not necessarily bearish:Due to the breakout of Bitcoin above $18,500, analysts have said that the market sentiment around Bitcoin is generally optimistic. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Guy Hirsch, managing director of the United States at eToro, said it would be surprising to see Bitcoin not challenge the all-time high soon. There are many positive narratives — such as the support for BTC from PayPal and Cash App, alongside rising institutional adoption — that brighten the outlook for Bitcoin:While there have been discussions around the high time frame charts of Bitcoin, such as the weekly and monthly charts throughout November, technical analysts have said lower time frame charts also seem optimistic. Before the breakout of Bitcoin above $18,500, a pseudonymous trader known as “Benjamin Blunts” said that BTC left a sideways structure that formed in the previous 48 hours. After the breakout, the trader said this rally “should be the one to take us to $20k and back to all-time highs.”In addition to the numerous technical and fundamental catalysts for Bitcoin, there is a strong argument to support an exponential growth trajectory for BTC in the long term. Mike McGlone, a senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, said that at a market cap of just $300 billion, Bitcoin is far from reaching gold’s $10 trillion market cap. But, this also shows that there is a large valuation gap between Bitcoin and gold: “Bitcoin is on track to be a digital version of #gold, but remains far from it in 2020.”Considering various trends Bitcoin has seen in the eight months since the March crash, Hirsch told Cointelegraph that there is a high probability Bitcoin will test $25,000. If Bitcoin breaks past $20,000, it would mean that BTC will look to explore a new ceiling. Hirsch has pinpointed the $25,000–$30,000 range as the potential top for Bitcoin in the near term:However, when Bitcoin surpasses $20,000, there is no longer any historical context to predict the next move of BTC. Hence, above the current all-time high, it’s nearly impossible to predict BTC’s next top until it peaks at a certain level. Another variable is that retail investors are likely to enter after BTC breaks past $20,000, which would add to the high level of interest and fear of missing out, or FOMO, that the cryptocurrency market is already seeing."
477,"Morgan Creek Capital Management and Exos Financial filed a new Bitcoin (BTC) fund with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. If approved, the fund will offer institutional investors another way to long the flagship cryptocurrency without the volatility of owning it outright. Kevin Rooke reported Friday that the Morgan Creek-Exos Risk Management Bitcoin Fund has been filed with U.S. regulators. The fund intends to provide direct exposure to Bitcoin with built-in mechanisms to reduce allocation when quantitative signals turn negative.As Rooke reports, the fund “handles technical details around trade, transfer, and custody of Bitcoin.”In its initial marketing materials, Exos says there's a need to smooth out market volatility for institutional investors that are unaccustomed to Bitcoin's turbulence and highly technical properties. According to Exos:Founded by Mark Yusko, Morgan Creek provides alternative investment products to institutional investors. The firm operates a digital asset division that specializes in blockchain technology and Bitcoin investments.As a business-to-business market platform, Exos is involved in securities, commercial finance and asset management services.Institutional on-ramps into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have ushered a new wave of adoption in 2020. Crypto funds, derivatives and exchange-traded products have spurred a new parabolic trend in Bitcoin’s price.Growing mainstream adoption has been aided by massively bullish calls from legendary investors such as Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller, both of whom own Bitcoin.Beyond investor adoption, corporations have also laid stake in Bitcoin this year. It’s estimated that corporate treasuries hold roughly 842,229 BTC, which is equivalent to $15.7 billion in today’s value."
478,"Bitcoin (BTC) hit new highs in excess of $18,750 on Nov. 20 as its latest extended bull run continued to delight investors.Data from Cointelegraph Markets, Coin360 and TradingView shows BTC/USD climbed swiftly after reclaiming $18,000, taking out its previous high of $18,420 to continue rising.At press time, local highs of $18,817 took Bitcoin to within $1,250 of its all-time highs from December 2017.The latest gains come as altcoins have also begun to hit historical levels that have remained untested for several years.Speaking about the market’s current strength and future prospects, Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, was more bullish than ever.""The halvening happened this year, which of course historically is good for price, bit history also says that the year following the halvenings is much more important,"" he told Yahoo Finance.Data from monitoring resource Skew underscores just how much Bitcoin has outperformed macro alternatives. Bitcoin's year-to-date returns total 160%, while gold has managed just 22% and the S&P 500 an even less appealing 10.9%. "
479,"A senior executive at BlockRock, the world’s largest asset manager, admits that Bitcoin (BTC) has become a permanent fixture in the global financial system, offering yet another tangible sign that the narrative surrounding digital currency has changed. Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s CIO of Fixed Income, told CNBC on Friday that, “Bitcoin is here to stay.”While conceding that he is not a Bitcoin bull, Rieder said the flagship currency “will take the place of gold to a large extent [because] it is so more functional than passing a bar of gold around.”Bitcoin is sometimes referred to as “digital gold” for its unique store-of-value characteristics. Bitcoin’s most ardent proponents believe that it will eventually take a sizable portion of gold’s market cap as more investors realize its utility.Priced in gold, 1 Bitcoin is currently worth 9.961 ounces.2020 could go down as the year that major Bitcoin narratives changed, especially among institutional investors who have long been skeptical about digital currencies. Investors like Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller have thrown their weight behind Bitcoin, while major banks like Citigroup and JPMorgan have issued positive guidance on the flagship cryptocurrency.On the business side, it’s estimated that corporations hold 4.54% of Bitcoin’s total supply, which is equivalent to around $15.3 billion at current prices.BlackRock, meanwhile, has indirect exposure to Bitcoin through its ownership stake in MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm that converted most of its cash reserves into BTC earlier this year. "
480,"According to data collected by Brad Michelson, a senior marketing manager at major trading and investment platform eToro, monthly global volume for Bitcoin searches in the December 2017 bull run was lower than in November 2020.Citing SEO data provider SEMrush, Michelson said that Bitcoin-related global monthly search volumes in November 2020 accounted for 8.9 million. This is 356% more than BTC search volumes recorded back in December 2017, which amounted to 2.5 million, according to Michelson’s data.Michelson pointed out a huge discrepancy between SEMrush’s data and Google Trends, a popular tool for analyzing the popularity of top search queries in Google:Indeed, according to data from Google Trends, Bitcoin’s to-date search volumes are far from the all-time highs recorded in December 2017, when Bitcoin hit its historical high of $20,000. According to Google Trends, the Bitcoin search index accounts for just 20 points in November 2020, standing against 100 points in December 2017.Michelsonthat Google Trends only counts results for one keyword, excluding results containing related keywords:If true, SEMrush’s data apparently correlates with a major surge in the number of new Bitcoin addresses registered. On Nov. 18, the number of BTC addresses registered per hour hit nearly 25,000 addresses for the first time since January 2018, according to data from cryptocurrency analytics service Glassnode."
481,"As of Nov. 20, companies hold around 842,229 BTC or 4.54% of today’s Bitcoin (BTC) supply, according to the Clark Moody dashboard and data from Bitcointreasuries. This is equivalent to a staggering $15.3 billion at the current price of $18,200.Public companies and institutional investors are continuously accumulating Bitcoin. The spark that began with MicroStrategy’s ambitious $425 million BTC purchase has led to a broad institutional frenzy around the dominant cryptocurrency.The demand for Bitcoin from companies and institutions likely comes from its growing reputation as a digital store of value.Bitcoin is unique in that it can hedge portfolios against inflation, like gold, but has the potential to see exponential growth.Hedge assets are typically stagnant and demonstrate low volatility over a prolonged period. They are meant to operate as insurance for a diversified portfolio so that when the market dips, the portfolio is protected.Bitcoin achieves both: it is able to operate as a hedge asset and also expose investors to large growth potential in the long term.As such, Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, said Bitcoin should not be considered as a payment network nor a currency.BTC is highly compelling as a store of value, which also does not put it in the crossfire of regulators. Referring to the interview of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Jay Clayton saying BTC is not a security, Saylor said:As long as the perception of Bitcoin from institutions and corporations as an established store of value remains, the demand for BTC would likely remain high.Corporations are now holding roughly 4.5% of today’s Bitcoin supply, which is around 18.5 million BTC. This percentage is relatively high considering that BTC has a total fixed supply of 21 million.When lost or dormant coins are considered, the total supply is estimated to be around 17 million in total.Companies acquiring Bitcoin as a treasury asset, like MicroStrategy, is particularly optimistic because it shows they are not expecting short-term returns.Hence, when corporations hold BTC with a low time-preference, it would also result in lower selling pressure over time by decreasing the available supply.For instance, on Aug. 11, when MicroStrategy announced its initial purchase of $250 million worth of Bitcoin, Saylor said:The prospect of inflation and consistent liquidity injections from central banks further fuel the medium- to long-term outlook for Bitcoin, which some analysts consider the perfect environment for BTC to shine over time. Meanwhile, to offset the negative economic impact the pandemic has had on the financial market, regulators are continuing to create relaxed financial conditions. For stores of value, like gold and Bitcoin, such a trend is beneficial heading into 2021."
482,"While the ongoing cryptocurrency bull run is boosting crypto adoption, some billionaire investors still find Bitcoin (BTC) to be something of a distraction. Masayoshi Son, a billionaire technology entrepreneur and CEO of Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, claimed that he “doesn't understand” Bitcoin amid the cryptocurrency breaking its three-year highs.Speaking at the New York Times DealBook conference, Son said that he found Bitcoin investment to be “distracting his own focus on his own business,” Business Insider reported on Nov. 19.Son said that he would spend about five minutes each day watching Bitcoin prices fluctuate. Son noted that he was told by a friend to invest “1% of his personal assets” into Bitcoin, meaning he invested “about $200 million.”The billionaire admitted that the recurring distraction triggered him to sell all his Bitcoin stake, causing losses of around $50 million. “I feel so much better,” Son said.Son stated that digital currencies are a useful development and that they won’t go away anytime soon, but he will focus on other projects. He said:Son reportedly bought Bitcoin when it was near its historic high of $20,000 in December 2017. As previously reported, Son allegedly lost millions by selling the cryptocurrency in early 2018 when the Bitcoin price subsequently started plummeting.Son’s latest remarks come amid a major bullish trend in crypto markets, with Bitcoin inching closer to $20,000. At publishing time, Bitcoin is trading at $18,227."
483,"As Bitcoin (BTC) momentum continues to grow, some people seem to prefer selling their belongings for cryptocurrency instead of fiat money.Jason Williams, a co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital, a dedicated digital asset investment business run by Morgan Creek Capital, sold his car for Bitcoin.Williams announced on Twitter that he sold his 2007 Chevrolet Suburban for 0.4 BTC, worth around $7,300 at publishing time. According to car shopper website Edmunds.com, a used 2007 Suburban costs around $7,000, while the new 2021 model costs over $50,000, according to Chevrolet's official website.If the Bitcoin price breaks $130,000, as some have predicted, there's a chance Williams will have sold his 13-year-old car for as much money as a brand new model.Despite publicized instances of celebrities and businesspeople transacting in crypto, Bitcoin use for payments is still relatively low, and many have criticized the coin for being a poor means for payment. However, in a recent blog post Fidelity Digital Assets aimed to dispel this notion, suggesting that the Bitcoin network's decentralization and immutability were a worthy trade-off. Furthermore, major payments-related firms are finally getting on-board with the seminal cryptocurrency. Earlier this month, major payments network PayPal finally rolled out its crypto trading and payment service to customers in the United States. "
484,"Ether (ETH) returned to $500 for the first time in more than two years on Nov. 20 as altcoins slowly staged a comeback from poor performance.Data from Cointelegraph Markets, Coin360 and TradingView showed ETH/USD briefly hitting the psychologically significant barrier in Friday trading before a rejection halted progress.Despite being capped at roughly 6% daily gains at press time, Ether’s achievement delighted traders, who noted that overall in 2020, the largest altcoin has outperformed even Bitcoin (BTC).Year-to-date returns stand at 284% for Ether and 155% for Bitcoin.Versus the pit of its price lows in mid March, just after the coronavirus-induced cross-asset crash, Bitcoin was still the strongest player. At the time, ETH/USD traded at just $117, making Friday’s levels an increase of 327%, while BTC/USD gained 411% from $3,600 to $18,420.Alongside the $500 visit — Ether’s first since June 2018 — other major altcoins also showed signs of life, notably Litecoin (LTC), which with 12% gains outperformed Bitcoin on the day, and is the only major altcoin to outperform BTC in the past month — by 7%.Earlier, Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe argued that a new “altseason” would need to wait, but that a realistic top for Ether’s next bull run could be as high as $20,000.In an interview with Van de Poppe for Cointelegraph, meanwhile, Nugget’s News CEO Alex Saunders forecast ETH/USD beating its current all-time highs of $1,400 by the end of 2021.Bitcoin meanwhile firmly held the majority of attention on Friday, reclaiming $18,000 and continuing to hit resistance at its previous top of $18,420 from earlier in the week.Anticipation of further gains remains strong, with 2017 highs of $20,000 forming the only major resistance level higher up the chart.A reversal down, possibly to levels as low as $11,600, has yet to occur, with $17,200 now serving as a firm floor for bulls."
485,"Following Game of Thrones actress Maisie Williams’ call for advice as to whether to go long on Bitcoin (BTC) earlier this week, the rapper Logic has dived into Bitcoin headlong.In a video posted to his Instagram story, Logic, real name Sir Robert Bryson Hall II, bragged that he “bought six million in Bitcoin last month,” while making the collar pull gesture popularized by fellow rapper Xzibit in the mid-1990s MTV show Pimp My Ride.He followed this up by trying to make out that it was really no big deal, muttering “F**k it,” “YOLO” (meaning “You only live once”) and “Seriously…”Despite his posturing, Logic’s investment could turn out to be a particularly canny financial move.In an absolute worst-case scenario, if “last month” meant that the rapper made the investment at the market top on Oct. 31, then his $6 million dollars would have bought roughly 433 BTC at a price of around $13,850.Fast forward to today, those 433 BTC are worth $7,926,500 at publishing time, representing a profit of almost $2 million.However, the probability of this being Logic’s exact strike point to buy into the market is slim.If the rapper used the phrase “last month” to refer to one month ago, then his buy-in price could have been $11,760. These hypothetical 510 BTC would now be worth $9.3 million, or a cool $3.3 million gain.And of course, if days and weeks mean little to the man, then it is feasible that he could have been referring to an investment around the start of October. This would have netted him almost 570 BTC at a price of around $10,550.These would now be worth $10.4 million, representing a profit of $4.4 million, or an almost 75% return on his initial investment.Logic has since changed his Twitter name to Bobby Bitcoin. “YOLO” indeed."
486,"The price of BTC has more than doubled since the Bitcoin’s third block reward halving in May. To be precise, BTC has gained 110%, with prices rallying from $8,566 on May 11 to test $18,000 as of this writing.According to a Nov. 19 report from crypto analytics firm Chainalysis, levels of liquidity and exchange flows have changed dramatically since the halving.The firm identifies illiquid, or investor-held Bitcoin, as “wallets that send less than 25% of Bitcoin they’ve ever received,” while the remaining wallets are classed as liquid Bitcoin, or trader-held Bitcoin.Chainalysis’ data shows that the number of Bitcoin available to new investors started to decline early this year, while illiquid BTC sharply increased. Chainalysis estimates that the number of Bitcoin that are currently liquid could be as low as 3.4 million.The firm attributes the diminishing supply of liquid Bitcoin to wholesale accumulation from institutional investors throughout 2020:Cryptocurrency fund manager Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which represents more than a dozen high profile institutional investors, now holds more than 500,000 BTC — 50% of which was accumulated in the last six months.Yesterday, analytics platform Glassnode Studio reported that Bitcoin mining revenue was back at pre-halving levels. The day prior, miners earned a year-to-date record of $21.2 million in daily revenue, approximately three times the earnings immediately following the halving.Before Bitcoin maximalists get too excited, however, it’s worth noting the price of Ether (ETH) has significantly outperformed Bitcoin over the same period, growing more than 160% from $185 to $482 since May 11."
487,"U.S.-based asset manager, Digital Asset Investment Management, or DAiM, has launched the country’s first employer-sponsored 401K retirement plans supporting Bitcoin (BTC)According to a Nov. 19 announcement, DAiM will serve as the advisor and fiduciary in helping companies “create a 401(k) plan that offers several recommended model portfolios of varying risk to traditional assets and allocation of up to 10% to Bitcoin.”The BTC will be held in cold storage by Gemini Trust, allowing DAiM to transfer Bitcoin to former employees who have left participating companies.DAiM’s crypto-friendly plans are compliant with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and will be able to be offered by employers from 2021.While U.S. citizens have been able to include crypto assets in their individual retirement accounts, 401K rollovers, and brokerage accounts since the Internal Revenue Service began taxing Bitcoin in 2018, DAiM chief operating officer Adam Pokornicky told Cointelegraph, “It’s been impossible to offer Bitcoin inside actually company-based plans until now.”Pokornicky said that the traditional wealth management industries have been “slow to warm up to Bitcoin,” noting there are “barely any investment advisors offering licensed and regulated access to Bitcoin directly in brokerage and retirement accounts.”He attributes the sector’s reluctance to “serious regulatory red tape” surrounding crypto compliance, emphasizing that it took “almost a full year of slow-building” before DAiM was approved to offer its employer-sponsored services:Pokornicky also noted “booming” demand for retirement investments in Bitcoin, adding: “We've seen most demand from individuals between the ages of 28–45.”"
488,"The outgoing SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, who oversaw the rejection of nine Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds during his tenure, has told CNBC that “inefficiencies” in the current payments systems are continuing to drive the popularity of Bitcoin.Appearing on CNBC’s Squawk Box yesterday, Clayton, who is due to step down by the end of the year, confirmed his agency’s general assessment that Bitcoin was not a security but a payment mechanism and store of value.""We determined that bitcoin was not a security, it was much more a payment mechanism and stored value,"" says SEC Chairman Jay Clayton on #btc. ""Our current payment mechanisms--have inefficiencies those inefficiencies are the things that are driving the rise of bitcoin."" pic.twitter.com/3r1mxzfgpiThe chairman has been widely criticized by the Bitcoin community for keeping a tight rein on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. However, during his years as SEC chair, Clayton was never a staunch opponent of Bitcoin in principle, but regularly expressed his fears that average investors could be subjected to unnecessary risk when investing in a Bitcoin ETF.This risk is due to the SEC’s perception that the largely unregulated nature of some Bitcoin exchanges makes it too easy for the price of BTC to be manipulated. With Clayton out as SEC chair, some Bitcoin proponents believe the chance of a Bitcoin ETF being approved is now greater than ever.Just in: SEC Chairman Jay Clayton will be stepping down in December.

This is a huge deal for crypto regulation.

Clayton’s successor will ultimately approve or deny a Bitcoin ETF.

Let’s hope the new chair understands innovationClayton believes Bitcoin will continue to grow, while regulations evolve.Clayton was the first member of the SEC to issue a warning about the potential pitfalls of investing in initial coin offerings during the 2017 ICO craze, reminding the public that such products were usually regarded as securities offerings and subject to the regulations accompanying them.“We did not regulate Bitcoin as a security,” said Clayton, explaining that BTC was “much more a payment mechanism and stored value” than a security.Clayton was nominated for SEC Chair by President Donald Trump in January 2017 and is leaving the position as one of the agency’s longest-serving chairs. In June 2020, Clayton was nominated by Trump to replace the outgoing United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, a position which he says he sought out of a strong desire to continue his career in public service."
489,"Mainstream media outlets are finally reporting on the recent rally that saw Bitcoin creep close to its all-time high — but some commentators appear to be determined to spread FUD.Two articles released within hours of each other earlier today — a Financial Times editorial titled “The elusive promise of Bitcoin,” and a Fox Business piece called “Bitcoin no match for gold in coronavirus world” — state that Bitcoin does not live up to its promise as a store of value.There appears to be coordinated media FUD aimed at #bitcoin today - 2 articles in major media. As bitcoin succeeds, expect this FUD to intensify, well beyond reporting.https://t.co/AuMN04v37Xhttps://t.co/XUFdHS4ldUThe Financial Times focused on Bitcoin’s volatility, stating that its “status as a safe haven is more theoretical than anything else.” The editorial claims “there are no fundamentals on which to base a judgment of Bitcoin’s value. Its current price just reflects what people are willing to spend on it.”The piece wasn’t all bad, pointing out that a major factor in Bitcoin’s recent rise was mainstream adoption, noting options on Chicago Mercantile Exchange and PayPal offering crypto sales to all U.S. residents. It goes on to say that Bitcoin’s price may continue to rise due to “the weakening of the dollar” and suggests that it is “because the Federal Reserve has done such a good job meeting the world’s need for dollars that investors feel comfortable taking a punt on Bitcoin,” concluding that:Fox Business also noted Bitcoin’s price rise with apparent alarm, and set about warning its readers away from investing in the cryptocurrency by rounding up Bitcoin haters including gold bug Peter Schiff, Roubini Macro Associates CEO Nouriel Roubini, and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio. The piece quotes Schiff saying it’s “nonsense” to think Bitcoin is better than gold:Fox quoted Roubini as stating that “crypto is the mother or father of all scams and bubbles,” while Dalio’s past criticisms of volatility and lack of buyer protections were also cited.The article did not mention that both Roubini and Dalio have recently softened their views towards Bitcoin. Last week, Roubini said the cryptocurrency might be a “partial store of value” because of its limited supply. Earlier this week, Dalio admitted he “might be missing something” about Bitcoin and “would love to be corrected.”However, there was some support for Bitcoin in the media from an unexpected party — China, a country well-known for its tight stance restricting the digital asset. Chinese state media channel CCTV covered the recent price rally on national TV this week, saying that Bitcoin’s network, development and investment ecosystem are more advanced compared to the 2017 bull market.CCTV, China's Official TV Channel: #Bitcoin price surpasses $17.5k, up 70% in less than 50 days. Compared with 2017's bull market, bitcoin's network, development and investment eco-system are now far better. The recent rise is driven by institutional funds. pic.twitter.com/yZqzGU5veM"
490,"Since topping out at $18,476 on Nov. 17, Bitcoin price has been flirting with the $18,000 level as bulls fight to flip the level to support and chase after the all-time high at $19,789. While this battle takes place and the bulk of crypto and mainstream finance outlets focus on Bitcoin price, a number of less-loved crypto assets are producing generous returns for investors.As shown by Messari’s DeFi assets index, many of the top tokens are providing hefty double-digit gains.Within the last 7 days, AAVE ricocheted off its double bottom to rally 214% and currently trades slightly above $80.Day traders are likely playing the support / resistance checks within the ascending channel pattern. At the time of writing, AAVE’s trading volume, MACD and RSI still reflect a healthy amount of interest from bulls.Even Curve finance’s CRV governance token, one which many crypto investors have described as a complete laggard, pulled off a clean double bottom reversal and rallied 176% to $0.84.After nearly being shorted to death by the likes of Sam Bankman-Fried and other savvy professional traders, Yearn Finance’s (YFI) token is also making waves with an 83.5% gain in the past week.On Nov. 18 YFI price was at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level ($25,500) and bulls were attempting to flip the level to support. Within the last few hours, this was accomplished and the price sliced through a gap in the volume profile visible range (VPVR) to make a new daily high at $29,850.Unsuprsingly, YFI clones like DFI. Money (YFII) and YF Link (YFL) also followed suit and each has rallied 58% and 49% respectively.SushiSwap’s (SUSHI) governance token has also attracted the attention of investors after losing more than 95% of its value back in September when Chef Nomi, the lead developer dumped approximately $13 million worth of SUSHI on the open market.As reported by Cointelegraph, this week marked the end of Uniswap’s liquidity pool rewards and rival exchanges like SushiSwap, 1inch, and Bancor have upped the APY rewards offered on their listed assets to attract former Uniswap liquidity providers.In fact, this week Uniswap saw a $1.3 billion dollar (57.5%) drop in in its total value locked as users sought more fertile pastures at other DeFi platforms. As this occurred SushiSwap saw a more than 300% increase and in the past week the token has rallied by 127% to trade at $1.63.Across the board, the majority of DeFi tokens are currently in the black and data from Digital Assets Data and DeFi Pulse shows an increase in daily active users, TVL across platforms and daily transaction volumes.Similar price action can also be seen across many altcoins, suggesting that while Bitcoin consolidates and attempts to flip $18,000 to support, traders have again embraced DeFi and altcoins.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

491,"According to analysis from Edward Morra, a popular Bitcoin trader, Coinbase and Bitfinex exchange now have major buy orders above $17,200.The emergence of major buy walls is important because on Nov. 18, BTC flash crashed to around $17,222. This shows that whales are using large buy orders to defend the $17,200 support area with strength.Both whale clusters and exchange order books show that the $17,000 level is turning into a major support area.Above $18,500, there is little resistance until the all-time high at $20,000. This means if Bitcoin stays stable above $17,000, the chances for breaking out above $18,500 significantly increase.Based on whale activity and exchange order books, it has become more unlikely that the price will drop below $17,200. For such a large downside movement to occur, a massive sell order would have to trigger cascading liquidations.Prior to the intraday recovery of Bitcoin from $17,340 to $18,000, whales on Bitfinex were placing sell orders. Recently, Morra said that Bitfinex has seen more buy orders at the $17,000 support. He wrote:Analysts at Whalemap track Bitcoin whale activity by identifying clusters and they said $17,783 and $17,651 have formed as clusters.These 'whale clusters' emerge when large Bitcoin holders purchase BTC at a certain price point and do not move those funds elsewhere. Hence, if whale clusters form at $17,783 and $17,651, it shows that whales bought at those levels and are holding onto their investment.Throughout November, many analysts have pointed to the high time frame charts to depict an optimistic short to medium-term outlook.Kevin Kelly, the co-founder and head of global macro at Delphi Digital, emphasized that Bitcoin is on track to mark the first monthly candle close above $14,000. Kelly said:Even during the run-up towards the record high in 2017, Bitcoin struggled to maintain stable high time frame price action. Based on the trend and many other factors, Kelly noted stated Bitcoin is maturing. He noted:Across major Bitcoin (BTC) exchanges, large buy walls are starting to emerge. Considering that BTC’s price has recovered beyond $18,000, this trend is optimistic."
492,"Bitcoin (BTC) has risen to rarely seen price highs, currently stalling between $17,000 and $18,500 before deciding on its next move. Gold recently broke all-time U.S.-dollar price highs, surpassing $2,000 per ounce before pulling back and consolidating in price. Bloomberg Intelligence strategist Mike McGlone thinks the same could happen with BTC.“Short term, $20,000 is pretty good resistance,” he said in a Bloomberg interview on Wednesday.Bitcoin rose to just shy of $18,500 on Tuesday before falling close to $17,200 shortly after, based on TradingView.com data. Since then, the asset has traded sideways, consolidating between those two levels. On a longer-term scale, McGlone expects further bullishness for Bitcoin in the coming years. He explained:With his reference to $7,000 near the end of 2019, Bitcoin added a one to that figure, making it $17,000. Adding a zero to the back of $17,000 gives a future projection of $170,000. Bitcoin had already breached $18,000 during McGlone’s interview, however, so adding a zero could arguably mean a future price of $180,000.McGlone touched on a number of other important points during the brief segment, including a reference to Bitcoin’s price swings. “Bitcoin is becoming a digital version of gold,” he explained. “One key point that’s happening this year is Bitcoin volatility has been declining,” he said. “In fact, it’s the lowest ever versus gold.”The strategist also explained low Bitcoin volatility against the Nasdaq, a common mainstream market barometer. “Every other risk asset on the planet, volatility has been increasing, Bitcoin has been declining.”McGlone also mentioned “institutional FOMO” on Bitcoin in line with money printing. This year has seen a number of mainstream financial players buy stacks of Bitcoin, such as MicroStrategy and Jack Dorsey’s Square."
493,"Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a tremendous run, particularly since September, with BTC price surging from $10,500 to $18,400 — a rally of 75% in less than three months.What's more, since March, BTC/USD has gained almost 400%, making it the best-performing asset of 2020 and likely catching many investors completely by surprise.Let's take a look at the charts to see whether the current rally is sustainable and if a reversal should be expected in the near term. The weekly chart of Bitcoin shows a massive run in the previous period as the region around the all-time high is being tapped.A clear resistance zone is marked around this all-time high and, thus, may serve as a trigger for investors to take some profits off the table.More importantly, however, is that the 1.618 Fibonacci extension was also reached. The Fibonacci tool is a powerful indicator to mark potential tops and bottoms, and the 1.618 level is arguably the most substantial.Currently, there are multiple arguments for a potential correction, including the Fear & Greed Index nearing record highs.There are several key price levels to watch if Bitcoin corrects before reaching $20,000. The first level of interest for traders can be found at around $16,000. The next levels are at $13,500 and $11,600.The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has arrived at the next and final resistance zone before a possible new all-time high: $500 billion is likely to be a significant hurdle to overcome.Remarkably, Bitcoin’s price is now just 10% beneath its all-time high and has already broken its all-time high market cap.Meanwhile, the total cryptocurrency market cap is still down 35% from its all-time high. This shows that Bitcoin is currently in the spotlight. Altcoins will most likely begin to play catch-up later on.However, if the cryptocurrency market starts to correct, the most likely area for a support/resistance (S/R) flip is around $380 billion to $400 billion. This level hasn't been backtested yet, as an S/R flip here would certainly be a bullish sign for more upside.Such S/R flips are quite common in bull markets and very healthy for continuing the general uptrend.Historical data tells a lot about market cycles. Until now, the fourth quarter of 2020 is showing many signals that are similar to previous years. One of them is the increase in Bitcoin dominance over the past weeks, which has risen to over 66%.As long as Bitcoin is in the spotlight, altcoins will not perform well. And if Bitcoin corrects, then altcoins are likely to drop even more.However, the moment for altcoins to shine may be getting closer by the day. The key indicator to watch for is the strength of Ethereum's Ether (ETH) price against Bitcoin and whether ETH/BTC has bottomed.The best conditions for altcoins are a slow, upward grind in the price of Bitcoin. Once that occurs, most likely in the first quarter of 2021, a powerful impulse move may then lift the prices of altcoins across the board.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

494,"Bitcoin (BTC) is all but guaranteed a price drop if one sentiment metric is right about the state of the market. On Nov. 19, with BTC/USD lingering at $17,500, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hit 94, nearly matching its all-time high of 95 points out of 100 on June 26, 2019.Compiled used multiple estimates of investor sentiment, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index delivers a normalized score out of 100 to gauge how overbought or oversold cryptocurrency markets really are. The closer the number is to 100, the greater the chance that the market is due for a pullback.Heavily tied to price action, the index has succeeded in calling price tops with considerable accuracy since its initiation in early 2018.“The crypto market behaviour is very emotional. People tend to get greedy when the market is rising which results in FOMO (Fear of missing out),” the developers explain on the metric’s official website.In late June 2019, the index hit its highest level ever — 95 out of 100 — and at press time on Thursday, the record was just a single point higher than current readings.Cointelegraph Markets analyst filbfilb meanwhile highlighted that 2020's market structure is ""very similar"" to 2019.As Cointelegraph reported, a host of charts tracking Bitcoin market activity have hit all-time highs this week, with their impact decidedly more bullish.Analysts have broadly stopped short of calling the current bull run too hasty, given its “organic” nature, in the words of statistician Willy Woo, compared with its clip to all-time highs in 2017.In principle, Woo and others argue, strong hands are buying up the supply this year, while amateurs and speculators remain on the sidelines.That perspective is corroborated by data showing large numbers of coins leaving exchanges for cold storage and other long-term wallets, as well as whales' buying activity."
495,"Sam Trabucco, a quantitative trader at Alameda Research, believes four general factors are pushing up the price of Bitcoin (BTC). The catalysts are increasing adoption, whales, inflows from other products into Bitcoin, and influence from other markets.Alameda Research is a major cryptocurrency firm that trades a variety of cryptocurrencies and derivatives, with a volume between $600 million and $1.5 billion a day.Throughout the past month, Cointelegraph has continued to report on the trend of whale accumulation.Whale clusters form when whales buy Bitcoin and do not immediately sell. This typically indicates that whales bought BTC, sent them to their personal wallets, and have not moved their funds.The accumulation of Bitcoin from whales possibly synergized with a profit-taking pullback in the altcoin market. Notably, when the decentralized finance market pulled back, Bitcoin continuously saw a significant rally.Based on various trends and data points, Trabucco said the four abovementioned factors likely contributed to the Bitcoin rally over the past months. He wrote:Atop these factors, Cointelegraph reported that the Bitcoin exchange reserves are also declining at a rapid rate.Bitcoin exchange reserves drop when investors increasingly pull their funds out of exchanges. Since investors often deposit cryptocurrencies to exchanges to sell, this trend suggests that there are fewer sellers in the market and a smaller available supply of BTC.When positive fundamental and technical factors coincide with an overall drop in selling pressure, it could buoy the momentum around Bitcoin.According to Trabucco, Joe Biden’s projected victory and the prospect of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are both positive factors for Bitcoin.The support for Bitcoin from various tech companies including PayPal, banks, politicians, high-net-worth investors and billionaires are all likely pushing up the BTC price, the trader argues. He wrote:In the near term, the roadblock for Bitcoin remains the $18,500 resistance area. Above it, there is little resistance until a new all-time high, after which BTC would enter the uncharted waters of price discovery.Considering that the post-halving bull run lasted 15 months following the 2016 halving, there is a high probability that Bitcoin could peak in mid- to late-2021, as some analysts believe.If so, the medium-term prospect of Bitcoin remains bright, particularly considering that many macro and technical factors are buoying the market sentiment."
496,"As Bitcoin (BTC) hit a three-year high on Nov. 18, more people around the world have started moving into the world’s largest cryptocurrency, according to Glassnode data.Glassnode, a major provider of cryptocurrency analytics data, recorded a major spike in the number of new Bitcoin addresses on Nov. 18.According to Glassnode, the number of new BTC addresses registered per hour hit nearly 25,000 addresses for the first time since January 2018 — the month following Bitcoin’s all-time high of $20,000. The spike in new Bitcoin addresses is still quite far from the highs recorded in January 2018, when the number of new BTC addresses per hour during that month hit nearly 25,000. The number of new addresses in a 24-hour period saw an all-time high on Dec. 21, 2017, with more than 600,000 addresses made. The spike in new BTC addresses shows that people around the world are increasingly turning to Bitcoin amid a major crypto bull run. As reported by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin surged nearly 400% this year, growing from below $4,000 in January 2020 to over $18,000 on Nov. 18.The growing prices have triggered more fear of missing out, driving crypto adoption at the highest pace over the past three years. The current adoption level is still apparently low, though. According to Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, the current adoption rate of crypto accounts for 0.1%, meaning that only one person out of 1,000 people owns crypto to date."
497,"Bitcoin (BTC) can hit $100,000 in five years and $1 million by 2035, Nugget’s News CEO Alex Saunders has told Cointelegraph.Speaking in an interview with Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe on Nov. 18, Saunders described current conditions as a “perfect backdrop” for new highs.“It’s either going to keep going like right now in the next few weeks and get to $20,000 very quickly, or it’s going to have its bit of a range now and then hopefully positive into next year,” he said.Saunders was speaking as BTC/USD came off recent highs of $18,400 to move in a wide corridor, which has become focused on $17,700. Gains have been swift, with weekly performance alone delivering up to 15% returns.Looking ahead, Saunders believed that six or seven figures for Bitcoin lay some way off, but that a combination of money and adoption meant that there was now “no way out.”“I honestly think that Bitcoin will hit $100,000 in the next five years, and then it’s going to become about, ‘Well do they actually try and shut it down, or how do they regulate it and trade it?’” he told Van de Poppe.The estimates appear somewhat conservative by comparison to some extant price forecasts, among them, the popular stock-to-flow based series, which predicts at least $100,000 by next year.Saunders’ concerns about legality in the event of major price rises echo those of major investor Ray Dalio, whose comments on Bitcoin earned him significant publicity this week.In terms of the largest altcoin Ether (ETH), meanwhile, the prognosis is even better. Saunders considers there to be a strong possibility that new all-time highs for ETH/USD are a year away — or less.Given current performance, that would require nearly 200% of upside from press-time levels of $470.Ether, like most altcoins, has failed to copy Bitcoin’s recent advances, despite the rollout of the long-awaited Ethereum 2.0 and associated roadmap, which will transform the network.Van de Poppe nonetheless agrees that the future is likely bright for Ether, with the next bull run halting only at an order of magnitude above the peak of the previous one.“Next cycle ATH for ETH probably between $10,000–20,000,” he told Twitter followers on Wednesday."
498,"After Bitcoin (BTC) price suddenly dropped from around $18,500 to $17,200, some traders began to question whether a local top had formed but there are multiple factors that suggest the bull run is still intact.Following the initial pullback, BTC continuously showed extreme volatility, demonstrating market uncertainty.The four factors that show Bitcoin’s momentum remains strong are whale inflows, a strong market response, resilience above each whale cluster, and high open interest.According to data from CryptoQuant, whales are not selling large amounts of BTC. This trend is noteworthy because Bitcoin is testing a heavy multiyear resistance level at $18,000.Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, said the Exchange Whale Ratio remains low. Given the relatively low selling pressure from whales, Ju said:If the selling pressure coming from miners and whales remains low in the short term, BTC could have sufficient firepower to kickstart a broader rally.Whalemap, an on-chain market analysis firms that tracks whales, have found a similar trend. The analysts said that whales accumulated BTC throughout November The price points from which whales bought BTC are holding.In the near term, the key whale cluster support for Bitcoin is at $16,411. As long as BTC stays stable above the $16,400 support area, the bull run will probably hold together.A whale cluster forms when whales buy Bitcoin at a certain price level and do not move them elsewhere. The analysts explained:In addition to favorable whale data that depict the resilience of Bitcoin, every major dip has been quickly bought up in the last 24 hours.On Nov. 18, Bitcoin dropped to $17,215 and $17,284, recording large pullbacks from its $18,520 peak. Yet, BTC recovered almost immediately after each minor correction, stabilizing above $17,600 for most of the time.Data from Skew shows that the open interest in the Bitcoin futures market is increasing. The open interest of the futures market shows the sum of all long and short contracts.High open interest typically means that there is a significantly high number of traders speculating on the price of Bitcoin.In the near term, this means major price movements are inevitable. Whether the volatility spike would cause BTC to increase or suffer a deep correction remains to be seen.However, based on the optimistic whale data and the market’s strong reaction to large dips, the chances of the next volatiltiy spike favoring Bitcoin are higher."
499,"A survey of more than 700 high-net-worth individuals, or HNWs, has found that almost three-quarters of millionaire respondents either already own or are looking to invest in cryptocurrencies before the end of 2022.Conducted by financial advisory organization deVere Group, the survey revealed that 73% of respondents are bullish toward cryptocurrencies, an increase from 68% in 2019.Participants were individuals who had more than 1 million British pounds, which equates to approximately $1.32 million. They were selected from a wide variety of regions including the United States, the United Kingdom, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Australia and Latin America.DeVere Group CEO and founder Nigel Green noted in the survey that Bitcoin had once again been one of the best-performing assets this year, with a year-to-date increase of 125%. He added:Green noted the respondents eyeing Bitcoin include some of the biggest Wall Street banks, and attributed their warming sentiment to adoption by large firms such as PayPal and Square:Even former Bitcoin skeptics on Wall Street are warming to digital currencies. During a recent New York Times conference, JPMorgan Chase’s Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said he’s a “believer” in blockchain technology and “properly backed, properly regulated” cryptocurrencies.Dimon made headlines in 2017 when he referred to Bitcoin as a fraud, although JPMorgan has since embraced digital assets.Billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio still has plenty of doubts about Bitcoin, but questioned his own skepticism on Tuesday, tweeting:Dalio had suggested Bitcoin falls down as a store of value and that governments may “outlaw it and make it too dangerous to use.” He also said that he can’t imagine central banks, multinational companies and big institutional investors using it.The survey of millionaires was revealed the same day that Bitcoin’s total market cap hit a new all-time-high of $336 billion and its price rallied to above $18,000, just shy of the $19,763 high reached in December 2017."
500,"Earlier today, Bitcoin (BTC) price peaked at $18,476 after an impressive 35% bull run that appears to have started in early September. This powerful movement was followed by a correction to $17,000, a natural pullback. This adjustment led some investors to question whether the current formation resembles the $13,850 top formed in July 2019.Back then, a 30% drop followed a similar-sized rally, and afterwards it took Bitcoin 14 months to regain the $13,850 level. Coincidently, an intense flash crash happened right after that local high, but the price eventually recovered and stabilized near $12,800.If something similar happened this time around, investors would expect a $13,000 low for the current cycle. Apart from a flash crash following a strong rally, what other indicators mimic the July 2019 price action?The first step is to analyze the futures basis indicator, which can be interpreted as investor optimism. Basis is also frequently referred to as the futures premium, and it measures the premium of longer-term futures contracts to the current spot (traditional markets) levels.Fixed-month futures contracts usually trade at a slight premium, indicating that sellers request more money to withhold settlement longer. On healthy markets, futures should trade at a 5% or more annualized premium, otherwise known as contango.Some excessive optimism might have taken place as the basis indicator touched 20% on June 23. Nevertheless, it sustained very healthy levels through the entire price correction back in 2019.The above chart can be interpreted as an absolute unwillingness to reduce long positions. This movement happened despite a $2,000 flash crash followed by a 30% correction from the top.Oddly enough, not even the 30% crash that followed the $13,850 top reduced the futures contract premium. Reduced bullishness usually has a massive impact on the basis indicator.Fast-forward to the current scenario, and there isn't a single instance of excessive optimism according to the same metric.The above chart shows the basis indicator quickly falling below 10% right after the $18,500 top formation. To further differentiate the current price action from July 2019, two weeks ahead of the price peak the futures premium stood at 0%, a clear indication that investors were feeling bearish.This time around, the lowest level over the past couple of weeks has been 7%. This means investors have kept positive expectations over the past couple of months, whereas in July 2019, the market faced an intense, quick, optimistic rush.To better assess the current market sentiment, investors should also evaluate options market spreads. The 25% delta skew indicator will shift to negative when call (neutral/bullish) options are more costly than equivalent put options. The metric usually oscillates between -20% to +20%, and it reflects the current market sentiment.Oddly enough, Bitcoin underwent an 80% bull run in the three weeks preceding the $13,850 top, but the options market seemed ill-prepared for this. At the time, protection for the upside using call options were trading at the same premium as the bearish puts.Therefore, we can conclude that option traders were pricing in the same probability of a strong market swing in either direction. This situation has not been the case recently, as the 25% delta skew indicator shows.For the past 30 days, this option market sentiment gauge has been signaling bullishness. Traders are unwilling to sell protection for the upside, thereby causing the skew indicator to reach an unprecedented -30%.As professional traders are demanding a sizable premium for bullish call options, one can only conclude that a sudden price dump is far away from their expectations.Investors should not make decisions solely based on the interpretation of a single indicator that shows option traders are overly bullish right now.

501,"In a lawsuit filed today in the U.S. District Court of New Jersey, Binance alleged that an article published by Forbes was defamatory and caused ""millions of dollars"" in damages.While there are already questions forming around the merits of the lawsuit, one thing is no longer in doubt: Binance is getting serious.Binance has retained the services of Charles Harder, the attorney best known for representing Hulk Hogan (Terry Gene Bollea) in a suit against Gawker Media. He procured an award of $115 million in compensatory damages and a further $25 million in punitive damages for his client in 2016 after the defendant posted portions of a sex tape on their website.Harder's prosecution directly led to the downfall of Gawker Media shortly thereafter. Peter Thiel, the billionaire founder of Palantir and co-founder of PayPal, helped finance the lawsuits after Gawker ran a headline that mentioned Thiel's sexual orientation.Harder also hit the headlines more recently when he represented Donald J. Trump in another sexually-charged case, filed against the President of the United States by Stormy Daniels (real name Stephanie Clifford). In this instance, Harder was on the winning side of an anti-SLAPP motion. A 'Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation' suit is defined as a nuisance suit designed to dissuade critics from publishing materials by burdening them with substantial legal costs, and has become a favorite tactic of corporations and deep-pocketed figures, including politicians. Harder has also appeared for other members of the Trump family, including Melania Trump. In an action brought against the UK's Daily Mail newspaper, Harder was able to garner $2.9 million and an apology after the tabloid insinuated that Trump had ""provided services beyond simply modelling"" earlier in her life. He has also represented Jared Kushner, the President's son-in-law, in a case against Vanity Fair.Harder is not always successful, however. He did not file a threatened lawsuit against the New York Times on behalf of Harvey Weinstein, and later withdrew his representation.Harder is appearing pro hac vice (one time only) in the case and is therefore not expected to represent Binance in other legal proceedings."
502,"Within the last 24-hours, Bitcoin (BTC) price hit an intraday high of $18,466.14 and this is just roughly 8% lower than the magical $20,000 figure being watched by many traders. However, investors in several countries such as Russia, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico have already seen their Bitcoin holdings hit a new all-time high in their local currency. Even Bitcoin’s market capitalization has hit a new record high, topping the high created in December 2017.With institutional investors finally arriving in herds, it seems it is only a matter of time before Bitcoin finally overtakes $20,000 and sets a new all-time high.Adding to the list of high profile billionaire’s acquiring Bitcoin, Ricardo Salinas Pliego, Mexico’s second-richest man, recently announced that he had invested in the digital asset. Accordion to Pliego, 10% of his liquid assets are held in Bitcoin.Even existing investors have added to their holdings. Galaxy Digital chairman and CEO Mike Novogratz recently said that he had purchased more Bitcoin at $15,800 as he expects a rally to $65,000. Novogratz believes that “the network effect has taken over” and with “tons of new buyers” coming in, the limited supply will not be enough.The steady institutional inflow has resulted in Grayscale Investments Bitcoin holdings surging to over 500,000 Bitcoin. An annual survey from the company revealed that about 38% of the respondents have bought Bitcoin in the past four months. 63% of these investors said that the coronavirus pandemic was the main factor that influenced their decision to purchase Bitcoin.After today’s spectacular rally, many investors are searching for hints on whether Bitcoin will continue its uptrend or correct sharply from the current levels.Let’s analyze the top-10 cryptocurrencies to see what the charts project.Bitcoin’s (BTC) momentum was very strong in the past two days and while many investors believed that $17,200 would serve as a major resistance, the price sliced right through it with ease.However, the cryptocurrency has been running hard since early October and it may soon tire out if it keeps proceeding at the current pace.If it takes a break to regroup and then resume the uptrend, this would be a positive as it would all the current rally to have longer staying power. The price has currently formed a Doji candlestick and this shows there is indecision among the bulls and the bears.If the price corrects to the 20-day exponential moving average ($15,528), placed just above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, it may be considered a healthy sign.Even if the price does not correct, a range-bound action between $16,500 and $18,500 will be positive.Contrary to this assumption, if the momentum drives the BTC/USD pair to new highs without any pullback, then the possibility of the record highs sustaining will be lowered. At that time, a correction could be vicious as there is no major support until $12,500.The relative strength index (RSI) has been trading between 70 and 84 for about a month, which shows that the trend is strong but also overextended. Hence, at the risk of missing out on some part of the rally, traders should keep their greed in check and trade with suitable stop losses.Ether (ETH) inched above the overhead resistance at $488.134 today but the bulls could not sustain the breakout. This shows that the bears are defending the overhead resistance aggressively.However, if the bulls do not allow the price to dip below the 20-day EMA ($442), it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. If the price consolidates near the overhead resistance, it will increase the possibility of a break above it.If the ETH/USD pair sustains above $488.134, the rally could extend to $520 and then to $550.On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the momentum has weakened. A break below the 50-day simple moving average ($399) will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.XRP reached its first target objective at $0.303746 on Nov. 17 and short-term traders seem to have booked profits at this level as seen from the sharp correction today. However, the bulls are trying to arrest the decline at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.278123.If they succeed, then another attempt to push the price above the $0.308176 resistance is likely. The next level where the bears may again launch a stiff resistance is $0.326113.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near overbought territory suggest that bulls have the upper hand.Contrary to this assumption, if the XRP/USD pair dips below $0.278123, a decline to the 20-day EMA ($0.264) is likely.Chainlink (LINK) broke above the $13.28 overhead resistance on Nov. 17 but the bulls are struggling to sustain the breakout. This suggests that the bears are attempting to sink the price back below the breakout level.If the LINK/USD pair breaks and sustains below the 20-day EMA ($12.26), it will invalidate the bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern.Conversely, if the bulls manage to sustain the price above the breakout level of $13.28, the pair could start its journey towards the target objective of $19.2731. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 59 suggest that bulls are in command.Litecoin (LTC) is currently witnessing a pullback in an uptrend but the long tail on the candlestick shows strong buying at the breakout level of $68.9008. This suggests that the bulls have managed to flip $68.9008 as support. This level may now act as a floor during future declines.The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that the bulls are in control. They will now attempt to push the price above the $77.20 resistance and resume the uptrend. If they succeed, the LTC/USD pair could rally to $100.On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below the immediate support at $68.9008, it will suggest that the momentum has weakened. A break below the 20-day EMA ($62.92) could signal that the bears have made a strong comeback.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) continues to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($255). This is a negative sign as it suggests that the bulls are not able to absorb the selling by the bears and push the price higher.The price has broken below the moving averages and the bears will now try to sink the BCH/USD pair below the immediate support at $242. If they succeed, the pair could drop to the $231 support.A break below $231 will increase the likelihood of a fall to $200 but if the pair rebounds off $231, the range-bound action may continue for a few more days. The flat moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory suggest a minor advantage to the bears.Polkadot (DOT) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($4.41) on Nov. 16 and reached the overhead resistance at $4.95 on Nov. 17. The bears are currently trying to defend the resistance and keep the altcoin range-bound for a few more days.However, the gradually upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in positive territory suggest that bulls have the upper hand.If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the buyers may once again attempt to clear the hurdle at $4.95. If they can do that, the DOT/USD pair could move up to $5.5899.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair breaks below the moving averages, the range-bound action between $3.80 and $4.95 could continue for a few more days.The bulls failed to propel Binance Coin (BNB) above the $27.30 to $28.97 range today as the price turned down from the overhead resistance. This suggests that buying dries up at higher levels.However, this tight range trading is unlikely to continue for long. Soon, the BNB/USD pair will either break above or below the range. It is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout because the indicators are suggesting a balance between supply and demand.Therefore, it is better to wait for the price to escape the range before placing large bets. If the bulls push the price above the range, a rally to $32 is possible. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $27.30, the pair could retest the critical support at $25.6652.The bulls pushed Cardano (ADA) above the downtrend line on Nov. 17 but they have not been able to clear the hurdle at $0.1142241. This suggests that the bears are defending this overhead resistance.However, if the ADA/USD pair does not dip back below the downtrend line, the bulls will once again try to propel the price above the overhead resistance. If they manage to do that, the pair will complete a double bottom pattern that has a target objective of $0.1391.If the RSI breaks and sustains above 60, it could signal a possible pick up in momentum that could result in a break above $0.1142241. This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair breaks below the $0.098822 support.Bitcoin SV (BSV) rallied above the downtrend line on Nov. 17 but the bulls have not been able to sustain the momentum. This suggests that traders are closing their positions even on minor rallies.The bears are currently trying to sink the BSV/USD pair back below the downtrend line, while the bulls are attempting to achieve a close above it. The flat moving averages and the RSI close to the midpoint does not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.A close above the downtrend line could increase the possibility of a rally to $181 while a close below the line may result in a drop to $146. The next trending move could start after the pair breaks above or below the $181 to $146 range.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

504,"Binance has filed a lawsuit in the state of New Jersey against Forbes Media and two of its journalists, Michael del Castillo and Jason Brett, alleging that an article published under the title ""Leaked ‘Tai Chi’ Document Reveals Binance’s Elaborate Scheme To Evade Bitcoin Regulators"" was defamatory. Binance is demanding both compensatory and punitive damages.The article, which appeared on the Forbes website on Oct. 29, reported that the ""Tai Chi"" document contained details of a scheme designed to “intentionally deceive regulators” in the United States. According to Forbes, the document described a plan to funnel revenue from a U.S. entity back to Binance while insulating the company from U.S. enforcement.In the complaint, filed on Wednesday with the United States District Court of New Jersey, Binance declares that “The Story contains numerous false, misleading and defamatory statements about Binance.” The complaint continues to state that the company did not create the Tai Chi document and has never implemented the scheme described within it. Binance also claims that Harry Zhou, reportedly the author of the document, never worked for the company.Binance’s complaint notes that the company sent the defendants a letter demanding a removal, retraction and apology. The article remains in place, and an editor’s note within the text states that “Chief compliance officer Lim had previously sent an email to Forbes confirming that Zhou had been a Binance employee.” In its complaint, Binance includes this claim in a list of ""false, misleading and defamatory statements.""Matt Hutchison, Chief Communications Officer for Forbes, told Cointelegraph ""We stand by our reporting.""The barrier for successful defamation lawsuits against journalists and media organizations is set high.

505,"Back in June, I wrote that Wall Street remaining on the sidelines is not necessarily bad for our industry. While most traditional investors are still observing, Bitcoin’s (BTC) mainstream momentum has been building over the last four months. Currently, the Bitcoin price is hovering around $18,000, steadily approaching its historical all-time high.When we talk about asset valuation, the first step is always to understand the fundamental economics. Equities, bonds and real estate, for example, generally derive value from generating cash flows. Therefore, valuation of these assets involves projecting future cash flows. Commodities, on the other hand, are more utility-based, so their prices are anchored by industrial supply and demand.So what is Bitcoin? Here’s my take as a holder:History of money shows us that natural forms of money generally go through three phases of evolution — first as collectible (speculation on scarcity), second as investment (store of value), third as money (unit of account) and payment (medium of exchange).Between 2009 and 2018, Bitcoin was in its first “collectible” phase. It was hard to estimate demand given the fickle nature of speculative trading, whose magnitude outweighed holders (mostly cypherpunks) who believed in Bitcoin as “future sound money.” The Bitcoin network also survived one of its most serious community divisions that led to the creation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) in 2017.We are now in the early days of the “investment” phase. This year has brought us a global pandemic, continued uncertainty, unapologetic money printing, and in contrast, a successful third halving of the Bitcoin (as expected). For the first time since its inception, Bitcoin has entered the mainstream media as “digital gold” to hedge inflation risk. As more people start to embrace Bitcoin as a long-term wealth preservation mechanism, a simple supply-and-demand valuation framework becomes much easier.There are many factors that could add upside to Bitcoin’s price in such a framework. Given that we are still in the early stage of mainstream adoption, I’ll leave out most of them to be conservative and only focus on a highly likely scenario where 1%–2% of U.S. household wealth is allocated to Bitcoin, while Fidelity’s most recent report actually recommends 5% target allocation.According to the United States Federal Reserve, U.S. household wealth reached $112 trillion by June 2020. So, 1% to 2% of that would be $1.1 trillion to $2.2 trillion in potential demand. On the supply side, the current total circulating BTC is about 18.5 million. To keep it simple, let’s assume the max supply of 21 million max is all up for sale. Demand divided by max supply — we get a price range of $56,000 to $112,000. Given current macro trends, it is not too crazy to expect this to play out in 2021.If we apply this math to $400 trillion global family wealth, according to Credit Suisse’s “The Global wealth report 2020,” 1% to 2% global allocation could push the Bitcoin price to $228,000 to $456,000. Will this happen within 2021? Likely not. Can this happen in the coming decade? Highly possible.It is prudent to play devil’s advocate and assess downside risks too. Let’s look at major risks that may derail a Bitcoin bull run.Protocol risk. The biggest risk always comes from within. Bitcoin has inherent value only because it has the unique characteristics of “sound money” — scarce, durable, accessible, divisible, verifiable and censorship-resistant. If any of those qualities are compromised, the foundation to its investment case will be eroded. Such protocol risks were high in its early years. After two major, controversial hard forks and three successful halvings, protocol-level risks seem to be contained now.Political risk. Given that Bitcoin is positioned as the future of money, it is possible that sovereign governments ban it for fear of threatening fiat currencies. Such bans have already happened in several countries. However, given the lack of geopolitical homogeneity and increasing momentum of Bitcoin going mainstream, the risk of the cryptocurrency being banned out of existence diminishes with each passing day.Adoption risk. This is a timing risk. It is quite possible that it may take much longer than expected for Bitcoin to go mainstream. Nevertheless, the unique quality of Bitcoin will speak for itself over time.Bitcoin’s price chart between 2017 and 2018 very much looked like a bubble. However, if we look at Bitcoin’s full trading history, there is a clear upward trend together with a growing number of asset-holding addresses as well as the network’s increasing computing power. The increasing mean hash rate of the Bitcoin network represents the increasing security level that one would want to see in a network where people’s wealth is stored.On-chain analysis also shows active addresses are still nowhere near the January 2018 level, even if the Bitcoin price is approaching its historical all-time-high. I may be on the bullish side for Bitcoin’s 12-month price trajectory, but I truly believe that time will be our best friend.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

506,"Bitcoin (BTC) is setting new records in almost all aspects except USD spot price, says a new digest, which concludes that 2020 is not like the 2017 rally.In a blog post on Nov. 17, Nic Carter, co-founder of statistics resource CoinMetrics, highlighted nine charts, which as of this week, are higher than ever.From wallet balances over $10 to institutional holdings and even Bitcoin spot prices in various fiat currencies, the data shows that Bitcoin is outperforming on a historic level.“To sum up, today’s market is far more mature, more financialized, more surveilled, more orderly, more restrained, less reflexive, more capital-efficient, and more liquid than the market that powered the prior bull run in 2017,” Carter summarized.PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow Bitcoin price models, supplied one more metric — Bitcoin’s fundamental 200-week moving average.All serve to differentiate the Bitcoin of 2020 with that of three years ago, when a fervent few weeks at the end of Q4 produced fleeting all-time highs near $20,000.As Cointelegraph reported, the past few days have produced a fresh round of bullish price predictions from well-known sources, who claim that $20,000 will not act as a ceiling this time around, and that breaking it will allow the bull run to continue.For 2021, entities from crypto investors to traditional banks have given sky-high price targets, among them, Citibank’s $318,000 punt by year end.Yet, not everyone is so optimistic. Even as $18,000 became a reality this week, one strategist told mainstream media that the lack of publicity Bitcoin is getting is proof that interest has died.“The fascination with it has worn off,” Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist for Schwab Center for Financial Research, declared to Bloomberg:The perspective underscores the divide between those within the cryptocurrency sphere and those outside it, the latter still convinced that 2017 marked the peak of the Bitcoin “fad.”“The $20,000 level is clearly the next target for Bitcoin. Should we surpass that this year, which I believe is possible, then we are into uncharted territory as sentiment remains positive,” Simon Peters, crypto-asset analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro, commented to Cointelegraph."
507,"Bitconic, a Netherlands-based Bitcoin (BTC) exchange, has informed its users that they now need to comply with a new verification measure in order to continue to use its services. The change comes following new requirements from the Dutch central bank, published in November 2019, which stipulate:Bitonic has informed customers that they must now, therefore, provide additional details, including which kind of wallet they use. They must also verify that they are the “legitimate” controller of the Bitcoin address they provide to make withdrawals from Bitonic. To do this, they need to upload a screenshot from their wallet or sign a message.All these measures, Bitonic states, are “a nuisance,” emphasizing, “we do not agree with the measures ourselves.” Crypto journalist Aaron van Wirdum notes on Twitter that the requirements far exceed those put on crypto firms in the rest of Europe:As imposed by the Dutch central bank (@DNB_NL), Bitcoin exchanges in The Netherlands must now ask their customers to ""prove"" they really control their withdrawal address. No other European country requires this.

Via @Bitonic: https://t.co/UEtVJD3e5z. pic.twitter.com/Nbsa9usSWFIn April of this year, as part of its implementation of the European Union’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, or AMLD5, the Dutch Ministry of Finance mandated the Dutch Central Bank to monitor the country’s cryptocurrency industry. At the time, experts were already warning that the finance ministry could be overreaching its authority in appointing the institution to oversee crypto firms.“This is much more than what the [AMLD5] has indicated. This envisaged way of supervision is unusual,” said Dutch lawyer Frank 't Hart at the time."
508,"Bitcoin (BTC) is on the run, printing a new high with each day. After officially achieving a new all-time high by market cap, will Bitcoin finally break through that elusive $20,000 barrier once more, or will we first see a major correction?It’s hard to not get excited when looking at the weekly Bitcoin chart. In the past 30 days, Bitcoin has undergone a true parabolic run. But it is yet to reclaim its previous all-time high, which is just 10% away.However, as the saying goes, “What goes up must come down,” and right now, the question on everyone’s mind is, “When correction?”The doomsday scenario of the Fibonacci retracement levels paints a bleak picture of a 50% correction to the .618 of around $9,000. But in a post-halving bull run, is this something hodlers need to prepare themselves for, or will previous resistance levels serve as the support on Bitcoin’s stairway to the moon?The daily Bitcoin chart hints at levels that people might be able to stomach a little better, with the previous $17,000 resistance being the first level of support to hold, before potentially dropping to $14,000 and $12,500.While this would represent close to a 25% drop in the price of Bitcoin, it would represent a “healthy” pullback, allowing the king of cryptocurrencies to entice more retail buyers to step in and buy the dip, and potentially push the price above the key $20,000 level.You might be screaming at the screen in disbelief right now, wondering how on earth this would be healthy. However, the fact remains that we must have a correction at some point, and the higher the price continues to climb, the steeper the correction will be.In other words, it’s important for Bitcoin to find a new local bottom if BTC is to climb to new all-time highs.Zooming into BTC/USD on the hourly chart provides a different perspective, one that shows a structure that has been valid since the beginning of November. This shows that Bitcoin is currently overextended and has already tapped the mid-channel support after hitting the top of the channel.Should the structure remain intact, this view paints a downside of just 9% to the lower channel support of around $16,285. But for now, it seems the previous resistance of around $17,000 is holding quite well.Should Bitcoin punch through the upper resistance of the channel around $19,000, then it could be that we already had our correction, which will catch those trying to short the local top off-guard.Heatmap data on Tensorcharts shows that there are sell walls at $18,500 and $19,000, indicating that whales are paying attention to the current ascending channel.Interestingly, there are multiple buy walls between $17,800 and $17,000, further signaling the upper part of the channel is the range that Bitcoin could expect to stay in over the coming days.However, once $19,000 pops, there’s very little in the way of resistance before Bitcoin could go on to print new highs, and if you want to know what price level that is, I suggest purchasing a crystal ball.Should the mid-channel support of $17,000 fail, the last level to hold sits around $16,285 for the current structure to become invalidated. From here, I would expect the next logical floor to be found around the $14,000 region.Closing above $19,000 opens up a whole new chapter in the history of the price of Bitcoin. Attempting to forecast where the price will go at this stage would be nothing more than a guess.However, if you follow the Blockcenter rainbow chart, Bitcoin looks set to move from the “Accumulate” to “Still Cheap” color level, which puts Bitcoin at over $22,600 in the coming week.For now, it’s all about price discovery. As many of us have waited three years for this moment, I suggest sitting back and enjoying the ride.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of @officiallykeith and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

509,"Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission has revised its net capital rules regarding digital assets.According to a Nov. 18 report by The Bangkok Post, the Thai SEC now allows firms dealing with digital assets to include the value of those assets when calculating their net capital funds. The new rules follow a surge in volume on Thai exchanges. The Bangkok Post states that, following the United States presidential election, the Stock Exchange of Thailand saw one-day trading value hit $5.5 billion while futures contracts on the Thailand Futures Exchanges increased to 1 million per day. The new rules aim to support the rising trading volumes by allowing securities and derivatives brokers to increase their liquidity management. According to The Bangkok Post, the new regulations include a deduction based on the quality of the assets. “The maximum amount calculable for digital assets to a firm’s [net capital] is 50% of the asset value,” the report notes.The SEC also requires securities companies operating digital asset services to maintain more than 1% of customer digital assets in the cold wallets, and more than 5% of assets in online storage systems like hot wallets.The Thai government has been amending local regulations in order to support the growing domestic crypto industry. In August 2020, the Thai SEC granted four provisional licenses to South Korean exchange UpBit enabling the firm to provide crypto services to customers in Thailand. Last year, the authority approved Seamico Securities’ subsidiary SE Digital as the first initial coin offering portal operator in Thailand."
510,"Bitcoin (BTC) hitting new all-time highs by Christmas is beginning to look conservative, but one analyst called current levels back in August.As noted by consumer investment service Swan Bitcoin on Nov. 18, the co-founder of The Investor’s Podcast Network, Preston Pysh, predicted 90% end-of-year returns for BTC/USD when the pair traded at $11,400.“You should be making a new all-time high by Christmas 2020. That means we’ve got 80–90% upside from here, which is insane, right because there’s not that many more months between now and Christmas,” Pysh said during an episode of the company’s Swan Signal podcast.He added that gold would fail to match “anything like” Bitcoin’s growth, something that has since come true as the precious metal flagged following the United States persidential elections.BTC/USD hit highs of $18,400 overnight on Tuesday, capping an extraordinary 24 hours that saw gains hit 10%. The performance accompanied new all-time highs for Bitcoin’s market cap.Pysh himself was already in the spotlight thanks to a Twitter discussion in which he highlighted common fallacies about Bitcoin and its security. This week, he recalled another statement from August, in which he endorsed the projections of quantitativ analyst PlanB’s stock-to-flow price forecasting model.As PlanB himself continues to note, Bitcoin is behaving exactly in line with expectations following the start of its third halving cycle in May this year.“Remember posting this tweet in August and all the traditional financiers thought I was nuts. Guess what. It’s just math,” Pysh commented on Wednesday.On the subject of traditional financiers, a renewed sense of satisfaction came over much of social media on Tuesday when Ray Dalio, the well-known investor who had just poured scorn on Bitcoin, appeared to admit that he did not understand it.In a now infamous update, Dalio conceded that he was open to being taught the facts about the cryptocurrency.“I might be missing something about Bitcoin so I’d love to be corrected,” he wrote.Among those offering to do so were Pysh himself, along with Avanti Bank CEO Caitlin Long."
511,"Amid a meteoric bull run in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin (BTC) is overtaking another major American company in terms of market capitalization.As the Bitcoin price briefly crossed the $18,000 threshold on Nov. 18, Bitcoin’s market cap surged above $336 billion, outstripping the market cap of Nvidia — one of the world’s most well-known manufacturers of graphics cards.On Nov. 17, Nvidia’s shares closed at $330.7 billion, according to data from Macro Trends. The close follows a significant decline from a $358.7 billion threshold recorded on Nov. 2. At publishing time, Bitcoin’s market cap accounts for $336 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.Bitcoin’s new market cap milestone against Nvidia comes amid both Bitcoin and Nvidia seeing major growth in 2020.As reported by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin has surged by nearly 400% this year, skyrocketing from below $4,000 in January 2020 to over $18,000 in November. Nvidia’s market cap surged more than 100% this year, up from around $150 billion to over $350 billion. According to Nvidia’s financial results released in August 2020, the company saw record revenue of $3.87 billion in the second quarter of 2020, up 50% from 2019.Bitcoin and Nvidia have some close ties, as the latter is providing one of the world’s best-performing GPU cards for mining cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. As previously reported, Nvidia might be facing some issues due to its crypto mining-related activity.In May 2020, a class action accused Nvidia of misrepresenting over $1 billion in sales to downplay the firm’s reliance on sales to crypto miners. In September 2020, Nvidia’s legal representatives argued that its investors are not entitled to access its internal records about the “crypto craze” of 2017 and 2018."
512,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropped sharply after approaching $18,500 on Binance and Coinbase. The plunge took place as large sell orders were spotted on both spot and futures exchanges.As Cointelegraph previously reported, traders anticipated a pullback as the price of BTC neared the $18,000 to $19,000 resistance zone. Upon its first retest of the area in nearly three years, the market saw a strong reaction.There are two main reasons why Bitcoin saw a swift drop near $18,500, and this caused other cryptocurrencies like Ether (ETH) to correct even harder.First, the $18,500 level remains the biggest resistance level before a new all-time high above $20,000. Hence, it is a key area of interest for sellers to defend, as breaching $18,500 would raise the chances of a broader rally.Second, an overwhelming majority of Bitcoin addresses are profitable as BTC tests an important resistance area. According to IntoTheBlock, 99% of BTC addresses are now in a state of profit. This raises the probability of a profit-taking-induced pullback.Based on BTC’s recovery in the past two hours, there is a high probability that dips will be aggressively bought. Following the initial drop to $17,214 on Binance, Bitcoin immediately recovered above $17,600.The hourly chart of Bitcoin shows that the 20-day moving average hovers at $17,586. As such, if BTC remains comfortably above that level, the likelihood of a prolonged recovery increases.Dan Tapiero, co-founder of 10T Holdings, expressed confidence in Bitcoin’s medium-term outlook. He said that the “big boys” or the smart money would likely buy the dips. Referring to the weekly chart of Bitcoin, he wrote:John Wick, a popular Bitcoin trader, echoed this sentiment. Wick said that Bitcoin is seeing some profit-taking, but it remains uncertain how long bears would be able to sustain the pressure. He said:A pseudonymous trader known as “Bitcoin Jack” said the dominant cryptocurrency is reaching the “finale” of its short-term cycle. There is some upside left for Bitcoin following the recent pullback, but he notes that more longs or buyers could be trapped, which could make another drop likely.The trader explained: Considering that the hourly moving averages of Bitcoin held strongly after the dip, the chances of a recovery are higher than a larger drop."
513,"Ricardo Salinas Pliego, the second-wealthiest man in Mexico, has revealed that 10% of his “liquid portfolio” is invested in Bitcoin (BTC).The billionaire shared a video captured in “a Latin country” depicting banks throwing out garbage bags filled with paper money into a dumpster. He asserted that “paper money is worth nothing,” adding: “That is why it is always good to diversify our investment portfolio.”The video appears to show bags of Venezuelan bolivars being thrown out, including 10,000 bolivar notes issued in 2016 and 2017 before the country redenominated its banknotes in 2018 amid an escalating inflation crisis.Three hours later, Pliego then tweeted a recommendation for the book The Bitcoin Standard, asserting that “Bitcoin protects the citizen from government expropriation” and revealing his cryptocurrency investment:Hoy les recomiendo EL PATRÓN BITCOIN, este libro es el mejor y más importante para entender #Bitcoin.

El Bitcoin protege al ciudadano de la expropiación gubernamental.

Muchas personas me preguntan si tengo bitcoins, SÍ.

514,"Bitcoin (BTC) just set another 2020 high by rallying above $18,000 for the first time in three years.On Nov. 17, the BTC price rallied to $17,858 after a highvolume surge pushed the price cleanly through the $17,100 to $17,300 range that many analysts believed would be a strong resistance level.According to Decentrader co-founder Filbfilb, Bitcoin’s price could continue to march higher in the short term if key underlying supports hold.The popular analyst tweeted the above chart and said:As shown on the weekly chart, Bitcoin is just a hair away from snatching the $19,763 all-time high reached on December 2017, and on multiple timeframes, the volume profile visible range (VPVR) shows there is little resistance above $17,000.Analysts were expecting the price to briefly consolidate in the $17,500 to $17,700 range as some traders took profits, but bulls appear intent upon pushing BTC higher. To date, Bitcoin has rallied 13.06% since breaking through the $16,000 resistance, therefore a period of consolidation to build support for the next leg up is healthy and expected.As for the fundamentals behind today’s price move and possible outcomes for the short term, Matt Blom, the head of global sales trading at EQUOS, said:As BTC stormed through the $17,000 level, there was a lot of talk about whether the price would reject near the 2017 high or break through the “resistance” and rally to a new all-time high.According to Blom:In 2017, the rally was driven purely by retail traders and a huge amount of FOMO, or fear of missing out, but the scenario is much different in 2020.All throughout 2020, Cointelegraph has reported on the growing trend of large-size Bitcoin acquisitions by institutional investors. Data also shows that the increasing volumes at regulated Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) derivatives markets is the result of bigger hands becoming involved with Bitcoin.Blom said:"
515,"Recent research has revealed that institutional-grade exchange-traded products surged in volume this month.A report by CryptoCompare delves into some metrics behind Bitcoin’s (BTC) epic bull run to a new 2020 high of $17,800 and reveals that institutions have been a driver of momentum.The Digital Asset Management Review found that aggregate exchange-traded products volumes have surged 53% over the past 30 days. Average daily volumes now stand at $173.5 million compared to $113 million in October. Exchange-traded products, or ETPs, are types of securities that track underlying securities, indexes or financial instruments — in this case, Bitcoin.The report cited Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust product as one of the key drivers of momentum, surpassing $9 billion in assets under management. However, the latest update from the institutional fund posted on Nov. 18 states that it has hit a milestone of $10 billion in digital assets under management. Grayscale now holds half a million BTC.MILESTONE: Grayscale just surpassed $10 billion total AUM. It's yet another reason to #GoGrayscale. pic.twitter.com/j5mWQbIzGmGrayscale’s Ethereum Trust product (ETHE) followed, with assets under management of $1.7 billion, an increase of over 40% on the previous 30 days. The institutional grade fund provider has also been loading up on Litecoin (LTC), which now represents $58 million in AUM, surpassing the Bitcoin Cash Trust’s $46 million.The report added that 3iQ’s Bitcoin Fund (QBTC) experienced its highest returns over the last 30 days at just over 49%. 3iQ is Canada's leading Bitcoin and crypto asset fund manager.ETC Group’s BTCE product saw the largest percentage increase in assets under management, which almost doubled to $116 million, a surge of 93% from the previous 30 days. Average volumes for the BTCE product tripled in November to $8.87 million per day, which is over 200% higher than October’s average.The BTCE fund was launched in June 2020, becoming the first Bitcoin-based ETP to list on Xetra, a trading technology platform operated by the Deutsche Börse Group.WisdomTree’s BTCW meanwhile experienced a 65% increase in assets under management to $79 million over the same period. WisdomTree is a New York-based exchange-traded fund and ETP sponsor and asset manager.Institutional-grade products are playing a far greater role in Bitcoin’s rally in 2020. The last time BTC surged to these prices in 2017, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board Options Exchange were just launching the first institutional Bitcoin futures products for the asset."
516,"Amaury Sechet's Bitcoin ABC coin is up 70% today as the developer announced a new upgrade for the client software that includes stability-related fixes for both forks of the Bitcoin Cash client.The new release breathes much-needed life into the Bitcoin ABC (BCHA) faction of Bitcoin Cash which was crushed by rival Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) in a briefly-lived hash war following the fork on November 15. This led to rumors about its impending demise.According to CoinMarketCap, BCHA opened trading at $11.78. The coin is now trading with substantial volume on exchanges and has been as low as $10.50 and as high as $21 before settling back down in the $19-$20 range.This represents a 70% increase over the last 24 hours and a boost in confidence that the coin will not be abandoned. However the BCHN version currently trades at $254.61, and is now listed as Bitcoin Cash or BCH on most exchanges.Sechet also signaled positivity for the future of his creation on Twitter overnight, inferring that he would remain dedicated to the ABC community.The BCHA crowd is the most amazing crowd in crypto, hands down.

The fact that it is small, yet, says way more about crypto than it says about anything else.

There is no other place I'd rather be in.Losing its claim to the Bitcoin Cash name and BCH ticker, BCHA faces heavy crosswinds as a new coin in terms of gaining merchant and exchange support. In addition to these problems, only a handful of blocks have been added to the BCHA chain by miners since Nov 15, the date of the fork. The slowdown is the result of a lingering imbalance between an overly-high mining difficulty and a lack of hash power necessary to find blocks at said difficulty.The most recent BCHA block, which took seven hours to find, contained over 14,000 transactions — a substantial uptick from the previous blocks’ count of 1,674. It also contained slightly over 0.9 BCHA in transaction fees, which is $19.40 at today’s prices. Per the new coinbase rules implemented by Bitcoin ABC, 8% of the newly-mined coins along with 8% of transaction fees went to the protocol development fund, which is a total of 0.57 BCHA, or $12.41. Although BCHA blocks are still not being found at a normal rate, this problem is expected to subside with BCHA’s next difficulty adjustment.Unlike the political and personal drama that unfolded during the last Bitcoin Cash hard fork in 2018, BCHA’s “benevolent dictator” Sechet has been amicable in terms of acknowledging the will of the community and the likelihood of ABC’s defeat. On Nov 12, three days before the expected fork, Bitcoin ABC initiated the transfer of the bitcoincash.org domain to parties loyal to the majority Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) client implementation, in anticipation of not emerging victorious from the impending hash war.Bitcoin ABC has also said that it will continue to support both BCHA and BCHN implementations of the Bitcoin Cash client after the fork in order to serve businesses who have adopted the coin as a method of payment.Bitcoin ABC will support both BCHA and BCHN after the #BCH chain split.

Businesses have the freedom to choose between the two chains, while still being able to run battle-tested Bitcoin ABC software.https://t.co/57dlgKcpvz pic.twitter.com/zjsoe8TJE2Bitcoin Cash has faced an uphill battle raising funds for development. In August 2020, Bitcoin ABC launched 0.22.0 of their client, introducing the coinbase changes as an attempt to help ensure the continual availability of funds for developers of the protocol. The proposal has been mired in controversy from its introduction, with the development fund being regularly likened to a tax and shifting in proposed size from 15% to 5% to its current 8% over the course of the year."
517,"The latest leg of Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent rally saw its market cap push above $330 billion for the first time ever as prices rallied above $17,750 late Nov. 17.According to CoinGecko, Bitcoin’s previous record capitalization of $329.3 billion was posted on Dec. 16, 2017, amid the market’s all-time high price rally to test $20,000.However, the new record for capitalization comes despite the BTC price itself failing to break into new highs.There’s a simple explanation for that — Bitcoin’s expanding supply. While roughly 16.75 million Bitcoin existed on Dec. 16, 2017, more than 1.8 million coins have since been mined, equating to a 10.75% expansion in supply. That means Bitcoin is able to have a higher market cap despite today's lower BTC price.The combined capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has also pushed above $500 billion dollars for the first time since February 2018.According to the World Bank, Bitcoin’s market capitalization exceeds that of the combined publicly-listed companies based in countries including Belgium, Iran, Norway, Sweden and the Philippines, while it's more than double those in Denmark, Qatar, Vietnam, Colombia and Poland.Compared to companies featured in the S&P 500, Bitcoin’s market cap sits roughly $13 billion behind the 11th-ranked Procter and Gamble, and above Nvidia and JP Morgan. However, some would argue that comparing Bitcoin to companies isn’t very enlightening and that it should be likened to commodities or another asset class.Despite the all-time high milestone, some analysts are noting a lack of mainstream media coverage on Bitcoin’s recent gains.Media attention going down. Price to the moon!!

Chart shown just now on Joe @TheStalwart's show. pic.twitter.com/kXHjCtDPZ2However, according to data shared by LunarCRUSH, a firm that tracks social media sentiment regarding crypto, Bitcoin-related news volume has seen a significant spike since early November.The company tweeted a chart suggesting the volume of Bitcoin’s daily media coverage has increased by five times over the past two weeks.According to Google Trends, search volume for the keyword “Bitcoin” during November is roughly 15% of its 2017 peak, further evidencing a relative lack of retail interest in BTC compared to when the market last rallied into parabolic highs.In fact, search volume is only at its fourth-highest level for 2020, sitting behind spikes in interest that coincided with the March “Black Thursday” crash, Bitcoin’s block reward halving in May, and BTC’s break above $10,000 in May."
518,"As Bitcoin price rises toward $18,000 and traders attempt to secure a new all-time high, the surge of institutional investors jumping on the Bitcoin (BTC) bandwagon continues.This time, institutional and retail investors are both keen to accumulate Bitcoin, and data from crypto derivatives markets shows institutional investors are driving Bitcoin volumes to new highs.According to research from Grayscale Investments, a digital asset management company that currently holds over $9.8 billion in assets under management, the coronavirus pandemic may be a primary driver of Bitcoin’s current rally.According to the company’s yearly survey, 83% of all Bitcoin investors started in the last 12 months, a time when COVID-19 infections were minimal.38% of all current Bitcoin investors interviewed joined in the last four months, and among these, 63% say that the economic disruption caused by COVID-19 positively influenced their decision to purchase BTC.Grayscale’s survey also shows that Bitcoin is becoming more mainstream with the general public and investor class. The outlook among those who have yet to invest in Bitcoin has changed considerably since 2019. In 2020, 55% of the investors interviewed expressed interest in acquiring Bitcoin, a substantial increase from 36% in 2019.Nearly half of the survey participants believe that cryptocurrencies will be regarded as mainstream mediums of exchange by the end of the decade.The trend of investors being drawn to Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative is likely to increase, and it’s possible that mainstream adoption may come sooner than most pundits and investors expect. Minimal proof of this comes from a recent report from Citibank, in which the author estimates that Bitcoin price may reach $318,000 by December 2021.The question of how Bitcoin price will react to the eradication of COVID-19 is a valid question on the mind of some investors. According to Jonathan Hobbs, the author of The Crypto Portfolio and a former digital asset fund manager, the effects of the pandemic will be felt long after the disease itself has been controlled. Hobbs told Cointelegraph:Clearly, the massive economic stimulus and expanding monetary policy resulting from the negative impacts of the coronavirus have changed the economic landscape for the foreseeable future.While some analysts may overestimate how the coronavirus pandemic impacted Bitcoin’s 2020 rally, it is clear that it played a role in accelerating investors' interest in cryptocurrencies.One of the main positives identified by investors is Bitcoin’s low entry barrier and it’s demonstrated ability to gain value when there is volatility in traditional markets. These factors are likely to continue to hold, even when the pandemic ends."
519,"Bitcoin price is steamrolling toward $18,000, and excited traders are calling for the top-ranked digital asset to overtake the 2017 all-time high at $19,763. Unless you're a bear, reaching a new all-time high is great. But ideally, for a sustainable rally to maintain its pace, a staircase uptrend is more beneficial than a sudden upward climb.In recent weeks, BTC has continuously surged higher without prolonged consolidation periods or any major dips.A pseudonymous trader known as “Squeeze” specified that the lack of consolidation in Bitcoin has been a trend since late October, and he hinted that this can exhaust the momentum of the current rally.While Bitcoin's momentum has been strong, the price has also increased by nearly six-fold since the March crash. When BTC continues to increase without major corrections, the probability of a large pullback increases. The trader wrote:Peter Brandt, a popular veteran trader who also keeps tabs on BTC price action, raised a similar point earlier this week. Brandt noted that in previous bull runs, BTC saw nine corrections until the record high.In the recent uptrend, at least to date, Bitcoin has seen two major corrections. Compared with historical uptrends, BTC has seen considerably smaller corrections. He wrote:Since the Nov. 8 dip, the price of Bitcoin has increased from $14,344 to as high as $17,858 on Binance. Within merely 10 days, BTC saw a near 25% gain with a clear consolidation phase.The pattern of a rally followed by consolidation and occasional corrections is key for a prolonged rally, as it neutralizes the futures market and decreases the chance of abrupt blow-off tops.In technical analysis, a blow-off top refers to when the price of an asset suddenly and steeply falls. As an example, BTC saw a blow-off top after the 2017 peak. In the next 52 days that followed, BTC dropped by almost 70%.Since Bitcoin is nearing price discovery above $20,000, traders expect BTC to see a fall before hitting $20,000. But there is a chance that this trade is overcrowded, as many analysts seem to be anticipating a similar scenario.One variable that could see the rally continue in the short term is the funding rate. Across major futures exchanges, the BTC futures funding rate is hovering at 0.01%.Futures exchanges in the cryptocurrency market use the mechanism called “funding” to achieve balance among traders.When the majority of traders in the market are longing Bitcoin, the funding rate turns positive. If this happens, long contract holders or buyers have to incentivize sellers and vice versa.Top futures exchanges, like Binance Futures, are showing a 0.01% funding rate, which indicates that the current rally is not overheated.Ultimately, traders still expect Bitcoin will form a blow-off top as the price approaches $18,000. Meanwhile, technical analysts noted that the recent BTC price cycle shows that each rally has been followed by shorter consolidation periods."
520,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) exceeded $17,400 in a strong intraday rally. On Coinbase, BTC even came close to the $17,700 mark, setting a new two-year high. As BTC glides through the multiyear resistance above $17,000, analysts are divided on its short-term outlook. Some say that BTC is primed for a pullback as whale deposits begin increasing. Others believe there is little resistance until $20,000 and that an all-time high is likely before the next deep correction.The momentum of Bitcoin in the past month has been particularly impressive due to two key reasons. First, during previous bull cycles, as long-time trader Peter Brandt explained, BTC saw up to nine corrections. But in the ongoing rally, BTC has seen merely two 10% corrections. Second, Bitcoin has consistently recovered from areas where corrections were expected, such as on Nov. 16 when it hit $14,774 on Binance.However, calls for a pullback are also increasing as the market sentiment around Bitcoin heats up. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto data provider CryptoQuant, said that the Exchange Whale Ratio indicates whale deposits into exchanges are rising. In the near term, this could apply selling pressure to BTC. Traders also say that the current highs of BTC near $20,000 may be front-run, leading to a correction before the level is hit.When Bitcoin whales deposit BTC into exchanges, the trend typically shows an intent to sell from high-net-worth investors. According to CryptoQuant’s Tokens Transferred metric and Exchange Whale Ratio, deposits from both whales and general investors are starting to increase. This signifies that more investors are moving to exchanges to take profit on their BTC holdings. Ki said:The Exchange Whale Ratio is also hovering at a level that has historically led to a large price drop. Ki said that over the past few days, the ratio has been hovering above 85%, which puts Bitcoin in a risky position for a potential correction. Since there is virtually no resistance between $18,000 and the $20,000 peak, it would be reasonable to expect whales to take profit at around $17,000.Whales seek liquidity for both buy and sell orders because they deal with larger volumes. Selling when the price of BTC is going up is ideal for whales, as it limits the potential downside volatility. Hence, there is a strong probability that whales will look to sell between $17,000 and $18,000 as the last stop before seeing a new all-time high. As Ki added:Some pseudonymous traders have also predicted that BTC will see a short-term top before it reaches a new record high. In the medium term, even if the momentum of BTC is strong, a trader known as “SalsaTekila” said a retest of a lower BTC support is expected. He pinpointed $12,000 as the potential area where the next deep correction could lead to. Considering the historical cycles of Bitcoin, the trader also said that a six-month correction would not be unusual.Atop the favorable technical structure of Bitcoin, the noticeable spike in daily volume in the cryptocurrency market buoys the bull's case. On Nov. 17, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said the exchange saw an all-time high system load, which indicates that the demand for cryptocurrency trading is surging.Arcane Research similarly found that Bitcoin spot volume has increased by 270% in the past month. The clear increase in the volume of the cryptocurrency market in general shows that genuine demand is behind the ongoing bull run. The Arcane Research weekly report reads:Yet despite all of the abovementioned positive factors, the mainstream is not involved in the ongoing rally. Google Trends shows that the popularity of the keyword “Bitcoin” is merely 16% of what it was during the 2017 peak. A recent Bloomberg report calls the recent uptrend a rally that ""no one's talking about."" These trends show that Bitcoin has significant room to grow until the year’s end.But Matt Maley, an investor at Miller Tabak + Co. who recognizes the high institutional demand around Bitcoin, said whether individuals will return remains uncertain, as those who “got burned badly” in 2017 are likely “less excited” about BTC now. The way this would change is if Bitcoin breaks above its record-high at $20,000 and the FOMO — fear of missing out — around BTC returns. Hence, there is a high probability that if BTC hits a new all-time high, a broader rally could emerge."
521,"Bitcoin (BTC) is just a few thousand dollars away from its all-time high near $20,000 U.S. dollars. However, while much of the crypto industry watch Bitcoin’s price action in U.S. dollar terms, BTC has already achieved all-time high prices relative to numerous other world currencies.In an Oct. 22 tweet, Alistair Milne mentioned seven countries in which Bitcoin had already reached its all-time high relative to those countries' native fiat currencies. In the same tweet, he said Colombia and Russia would soon join the list.Bitcoin recently surpassed its all-time high against the Russian ruble earlier this month. The asset also broke its record high against the Colombian peso a few weeks ago, completing the list — except for his closing comment, which forecasts “all other fiat currencies” to follow.In U.S. dollar terms, Bitcoin has soared in recent weeks, leaving little room between its press-time price of $17,267 and its famed $20,000 level.Bitcoin hit an all-time high of 62,102,236 Colombian pesos over the last 24 hours. Its former high from 2017 stood at 58,226,376. The peso first broke that level on Nov. 6, reaching 59,543,988 before retracing.Crypto’s pioneering asset has also broken its previous highest-ever-price level relative to the Brazilian real, Turkish lira, Argentine peso, Sudanese pound, Angolan kwanza, Zambian kwacha and Russian ruble, as verified by information from data site Xe.Venezuela, however, yields charts for two main bolivar currencies: the VES and the VEF. The bolivar soberano, or VES, took prominence in the country in 2018. The VES replaced Venezuela’s bolivar fuerte, or VEF. The VES shows Bitcoin at record price highs. The VEF does not, although Bitcoin has continued rising in the charts.Venezuela has hosted notable Bitcoin adoption after massive inflation hit the region."
522,"The Bitcoin (BTC) price bottomed at exactly the point that gold bug Peter Schiff said that it would crash further — and proponents are reminding him of his mistake.Retweeting a now infamous Twitter post that Schiff made in mid March, popular trader “CryptoBull” noted that he had accidentally called Bitcoin’s bottom, not top.Schiff was complaining that he had lost access to his Bitcoin wallet, but that soon it wouldn’t matter, because BTC/USD would keep crashing.“With Bitcoin crashing below $4,000 I don’t feel so bad about having lost all my Bitcoin,” the tweet read.At the time, Bitcoin was trading near its 2020 lows of $3,600. On Tuesday, eight months later, CryptoBull did not mince wordsas the asset hit $17,000.“This tweet marked the exact bottom aka point of maximum opportunity,” he wrote.Bitcoin has vastly outperformed gold over the past month, with a divergence between the two assets becoming increasingly conspicuous.Bitcoin was up 375% from Schiff’s “top” at press time, challenging its all-time highs from 2017 amid fresh forecasts that it would continue climbing thereafter.“Since Bitcoin was at $11.4K a month ago, miners have been selling an average 11 BTC per hour at exchanges,” statistician Willy Woo explained regarding the current market composition driving the gains.As Cointelegraph reported, the simple supply versus demand equation firmly favors further upside for Bitcoin, this coming thanks to corporate demand from the likes of PayPal, Square and investment giant Grayscale.Paxful, PayPal’s payment handler for its cryptocurrency feature, saw a 500% volume increase over the past month."
523,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed $17,000 for the first time since December 2017, continuing its current uptrend. The rally comes after BTC broke out of the previous parabola, which initially caused concerns.Three factors likely contributed to the ongoing rally: a new parabolic trend, resilience above $16,000, and Bitcoin absorbing whales’ selling pressure.On Nov. 16, Cointelegraph reported that analysts found the Bitcoin price dipped below a parabola dating back to September.Though the trend seemed concerning, new parabolic trends could reemerge in a bull cycle. As such, when BTC dropped below the parabola, some analysts said that BTC could form a new parabolic uptrend.Typically, when Bitcoin falls out of a parabola and enters a short-term bear cycle, the price dips rapidly and can correct by as much as 80%. In the case of BTC in the past few days, it remained stably above $16,000.The stability of Bitcoin decreased the probability of a sharp near-term drop, eventually leading BTC to rally.Bitcoin maintaining stability above $16,000 following the initial drop to $15,800 on Nov. 16 was key for the latest rally.There was a strong narrative for Bitcoin to see a deep short-term correction. Gold, for example, dropped, as Moderna’s vaccine trial results were positive. BTC saw a large resistance level at $17,000 due to on-chain orders, making it a difficult area to break past.Yet, the momentum of Bitcoin was simply too strong to avoid a massive rally. When BTC was showing stability following the initial breakout of the parabola, traders said the technical pattern is optimistic.Trends that typically arise during bull cycles are beginning to show again as well. According to on-chain analytics firm Intotheblock, 99% of the addresses holding Bitcoin are profitable. The firm said:Some might argue that this metric suggests many investors could take profit and thus create a pullback. But, as Bloomberg reports, this rally has been mostly silent in terms of mainstream involvement, which makes a sudden take-profit rally less probable.Throughout November, Cointelegraph reported that whales and miners were selling large amounts of Bitcoin. This meant that there was significant selling pressure being placed on Bitcoin in the past month.Yet, Bitcoin’s price still reached $17,000 despite the immense selling pressure placed upon it by whales.On Nov. 15, Cointelegraph also reported that a whale either shorted or sold $100 million worth of Bitcoin on Bybit.At the time, the Bitcoin price was trading just under $16,000, at around $15,900. The recent price spike above $17,000 indicates that many whale sell or short orders likely got squeezed in the past several days.The combination of Bitcoin’s resilience, the making of a potentially new parabolic trend, and BTC withholding whale pressure makes the medium-term prospect of BTC optimistic."
524,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has brought 56 enforcement actions against initial coin offerings, blockchain and digital asset-related companies since July 2017.On Nov. 16, the SEC released a report on the commission’s selected accomplishments during chairman Jay Clayton’s tenure from May 2017 until November 2020.As part of the 28-page report, the regulator mentioned the SEC’s efforts to combat “cyber-related misconduct” including violations by companies involved in the crypto industry.According to the report, the SEC brought 56 cases involving attempts to defraud investors through the use of digital asset securities as well as violations of the registration provisions of the federal securities laws. The authority also halted 18 suspected fraudulent schemes involving blockchain and digital assets, the SEC noted.The SEC’s active participation in combating misconduct in the crypto industry ramped up back in July 2017 when the regulator issued an investigative report regarding the offers and sales of digital assets.In September 2017, the SEC established a dedicated Cyber Unit to combat misconduct related to the digital currency market, reflecting chairman Clayton’s priorities in these areas. In 2018, the regulator also launched a fake ICO website to increase awareness of the typical warning signs of scam ICOs and promote investor education.The SEC’s report follows news of Clayton’s upcoming departure from the commission. The SEC officially announced on Nov. 16 that Clayton will be leaving the agency by the end of 2020, noting that Clayton has been one of its longest-standing chairs."
525,"Philip Swift, a Bitcoin (BTC) analyst and the creator of Lookintobitcoin.com, laid out four reasons why BTC is headed to $22,000. Both fundamental and technical factors indicate the top cryptocurrency’s momentum is strengthening.The one-year HODL percentage, the decline of Bitcoin exchange reserves, neutral funding rates, and institutional accumulation point toward a prolonged BTC rally. Swift wrote:Since the start of the fourth quarter on Oct. 1, the price of Bitcoin rose from $10,773 to $16,730 on Binance. The Bitcoin space refers to long-time BTC holders as “HODLers.” The One-Year HODL Wave shows the growth in the number of investors holding BTC for over a year.Since the March crash, the One-Year HODL Wave rose from 59% to over 62%. It is now at an all-time high, signifying a clear accumulation trend.When the number of HODLers increases, it demonstrates an appetite to purchase and hold Bitcoin for a long time. The ongoing trend might show that investors expect a broader Bitcoin rally in the longer term.During bull cycles, the funding rates of Bitcoin can significantly spike as long holders or buyers overwhelm short-sellers.The Bitcoin futures market uses the funding rate mechanism to ensure balance in the market. If there are more longs than shorts, the funding rate becomes positive. If so, buyers have to compensate short-sellers and vice versa.The average funding rate of Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts is at around 0.01%. Throughout the past several months, the funding rate has remained at around 0.01% or sometimes below it.This shows that there is a decent balance between buyers and sellers, and the market is not overheated as of yet.As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, around 145,000 BTC has moved out of exchanges throughout the past month.The $2.3 billion monthly Bitcoin exchange outflow suggests the intent of investors to hold onto their BTC holdings throughout the long term.Investors have to deposit BTC into exchanges in order to sell their holdings. Hence, when outflows increase, it typically indicates that investors plan to hold BTC for prolonged periods.In the United States, Grayscale remains the preferable point of entry for institutional investors into Bitcoin. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is the closest investment vehicle to an exchange-traded fund, as it publicly trades in the U.S.According to Grayscale, the firm now holds more than 500,000 BTC, which, at a price point of $16,700, is worth over $8.35 billion.Institutions have continued to accumulate Bitcoin as it posts a strong recovery since early 2020. The resilience of BTC, particularly as it is consistently outperforming gold, has made the store of value proposition more compelling to institutions throughout the year."
526,"Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, said that decentralized finance is here to stay despite many DeFi projects showing signs of being in a bubble.In a Nov. 17 interview with Russia’s news agency RBC, Zhao argued that “a lot of DeFi projects are already in a bubble, and I also believe that there are some signs of a bubble in the DeFi industry, but this does not mean that DeFi will eventually disappear entirely.”Zhao went on to say that the DeFi industry has a lot of potential for growth, noting that DeFi still remains popular amid an ongoing Bitcoin (BTC) rally. The executive also stressed that initial coin offerings, or ICOs, were referred to as a bubble back in 2017, but a number of ICO-born projects — including Binance — are still doing great:However, Zhao said that some DeFi projects “may not last too long” despite the industry providing a number of incentives through DeFi yield farming and DeFi liquidity.Zhao also claimed that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are the best form of money, calling it the “money of freedom for millions of people worldwide.” The CEO predicted that the crypto market has the potential to grow as much as 100,000% as digital assets, supposedly, will become more widely adopted than fiat. While he does see a future for DeFi, Zhao has noted roadblocks to the industry attaining mass appeal. In August, he claimed that centralized exchanges will remain popular until decentralized exchanges become more user friendly. "
527,"Bitcoin (BTC) will hit $65,000 due to a combination of low supply and “tons of new buyers,” major investor Mike Novogratz says.In an increasingly popular Twitter debate on Nov. 17, Novogratz, who is well known for his prominent Bitcoin plugs, told actress Maisie Williams not to hesitate in buying the cryptocurrency.Williams had released a poll asking Twitter followers whether or not she should invest in BTC. At press time, the verdict was split, with 47% of the roughly 750,000 responses supporting an investment.The poll soon caught the attention of famous Twitter users, among them Tesla CEO Elon Musk.“I bought more BTC last night at 15,800. It’s going to 20K and (then) To 65K,” Novogratz commented.Williams did not disclose what made her suddenly consider Bitcoin, with the publicity coming on the back of near 50% monthly gains for BTC/USD. At press time, the pair circled $16,700.Other responses included podcast host Stephan Livera, Blockstream chief security officer Samson Mow, and Barry Silbert, CEO of investment fund giant Digital Currency Group. Silbert’s asset manager, Grayscale, is responsible for buying up increasingly large amounts of the Bitcoin supply, with its holdings passing 500,000 BTC ($8.37 billion) this week.As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin’s recent rise has been noticeable for the lack of associated media attention it has received.Despite being at levels not enjoyed by the token longer than two weeks in its history, Bitcoin has not yet sparked the same frenzy of publicity that accompanied its rise to $20,000 all-time highs in 2017.Behind the scenes, however, institutions that were previously unlikely supporters are coming around to the idea of a future in which Bitcoin stars as a major investment asset. Among them was Citibank this week, which forecast a December 2021 Bitcoin price of up to $318,000."
528,"Galaxy Digital, a cryptocurrency merchant bank founded by Mike Novogratz, is expanding its crypto offerings in Canada.According to a Nov. 16 announcement, Galaxy Digital has partnered with major Canadian investment company CI Global Asset Management to launch a public Bitcoin (BTC) fund in the country.The CI Galaxy Bitcoin Fund is a “closed-end investment fund” that aims to provide unitholders with exposure to Bitcoin. The fund will invest directly in Bitcoin using the fund’s holdings of the token based on prices of the Bloomberg Galaxy Bitcoin Index, the announcement notes.As part of the new initiative, CI GAM has filed and acquired a receipt for a preliminary prospectus for the initial public offering of CI Galaxy Bitcoin Fund. The fund will offer units of Class A and Class F units at a price of $10 each. While CI GAM will be responsible for managing the new Bitcoin fund, Galaxy Digital will act as its subadvisor, meaning that it will execute all BTC trading on behalf of the fund.According to the announcement, the new fund will be offered on a “best-efforts basis in each of the provinces and territories of Canada.”Apart from the CI Galaxy Bitcoin Fund, Galaxy Digital has launched a number of Bitcoin funds like the Galaxy Bitcoin Fund and the Galaxy Institutional Bitcoin Fund. The company also runs several funds based on other cryptos like EOS.The new Bitcoin fund was introduced shortly after Galaxy Digital reported a large surge in trading volumes in the third quarter of 2020. As reported, the firm saw a 75% year-on-year growth in trading volumes in Q3 2020, reaching $1.4 billion."
529,"Despite a pullback from the meteoric bull market for decentralized finance, the average DeFi token return has vastly outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum. The median performance is a different story, however.On Nov. 17, pseudonymous crypto analyst “Ceteris Paribus” shared data with his 12,000 followers compiling the YTD median and average performances of 40 top crypto assets, comprised of 38 top DeFi assets, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Around 26 of the DeFi assets are currently posting YTD gains.The analyst found that the median return sits around 148.8%, which is 15.5% above Bitcoin’s 133.3% YTD gain. So, half of DeFi tokens are above that level, and half below. Paribus said it was pretty much even:However, the 2020 average performance of 428.7% is more than triple Bitcoin’s gain.As of this writing, DeFi’s top-performing assets for 2020 are Aave (AAVE) with a 4,245% gain, Band (BAND) with 2,466% and Yearn Finance (YFI) with 1,597%. THORChain (RUNE) is the only other DeFi token to post quadruple-figure YTD, with 1,203%.The sector’s worst-performing assets for the year so far are Curve (CRV), SushiSwap (SUSHI) and Swerve (SWRV), posting losses of 88.7%, 80.1% and 79.9%, respectively.DeFi assets have produced extreme volatility in recent months, with 10 of 29 DeFi tokens posting gains exceeding 1,000% in August, while CRV was the sole asset to end August in the red.However, only Gnosis (GNO) and Hegic (HEGIC) were able to post single-digit gains for September through October, while the remaining 34 tokens were at a loss — including five tokens that fell more than 89%.November has thus far seen comparatively modest volatility, with 32 of 38 tokens gaining to post median and average performances of roughly 20% and 35%, respectively."

531,"As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to rally to a new 2020 high above $16,700, traders are pondering whether this is the start of a new bull market. Mike McGlone, senior commodities strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, believes that the main hurdle is at the all-time high near $20,000. Once that is crossed, Bitcoin could reach a $1 trillion market capitalization. McGlone anticipates the uptrend to continue in 2021, and there are a growing number of analysts who agree with his view.Veteran trader Peter Brandt also believes that if previous bull runs are considered, Bitcoin is in the early stages of its next bull cycle.In another bullish projection, Citibank managing director Tom Fitzpatrick believes that Bitcoin could rally to $318,000 by December 2021. Fitzpatrick arrived at this forecast by considering the previous bull markets in Bitcoin.Every bull phase witnesses considerable corrections on the way up, and these provide opportunities for traders to sell high and buy again during dips. However, in order to do this, traders have to time their trades, otherwise they may miss out on the move.Let’s analyze the top 10 cryptocurrencies to spot any bearish or bullish setups that could project the next possible move.In a strong uptrend, corrections usually do not last more than three days. This can be seen in Bitcoin’s rally that started in early October. The bulls have pushed the price above the overhead resistance at $16,500 and resumed the upward move.The BTC/USD pair could now rally to the next significant resistance at $17,200. Here again, the bulls may have to overcome strong selling by the bears because once the buyers clear this resistance, there is no major hurdle until the all-time highs.The rising moving averages and the relative strength index in overbought territory suggest that bulls are in control. There is no negative formation on the chart that warns of a possible top at the current juncture.Still, traders should be careful and not get carried away with strength. They can keep a close eye on the 20-day exponential moving average ($15,032) because a break below it will be the first sign of weakness.Ether (ETH) has been facing selling pressure at the resistance line of the rising wedge pattern. This line has now reached close to the overhead resistance at $488.134. Hence, the bears are likely to mount a strong defense of this level.If the price turns down from the overhead resistance and the bulls do not give up much ground, then it will increase the possibility of a breakout of $488.134. Above this level, the ETH/USD pair could rally to $520 and then to $550.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 61 suggest that bulls have the upper hand. This bullish view will be negated if the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and plummets below the 20-day EMA ($435).XRP broke and closed above the $0.26 resistance on Nov. 13. Although the bears sold the rallies on Nov. 14 and 15, they could not pull the price back below the breakout level of $0.26.This shows that the sentiment has turned positive and the bulls are accumulating on dips. The 20-day EMA ($0.256) has turned up, and the RSI has reached the overbought zone, which suggests that the path of least resistance is to the upside.The first target on the upside is $0.303746 and if this level is scaled, the XRP/USD pair could retest the $0.326113 resistance. This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down and plummets below the $0.26 support.Chainlink's LINK is currently attempting to bounce off the 20-day EMA ($12). The bulls will now again try to propel the price above the $13.28 overhead resistance. If they succeed, the altcoin will complete an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern.The target objective of this bullish setup is $19.2731. The gradually rising moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a minor advantage to the bulls.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA, the LINK/USD pair could drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($11). A break below $9.7665 will invalidate the bullish setup.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) once again turned down from the overhead resistance zone of $272 to $280 on Nov. 15. This shows that the bears are defending this level aggressively. If the bears can sink the price below the immediate support at $242, a drop to $231 is possible.The 20-day EMA ($256) is flat, while the 50-day SMA ($249) is moving up, and the RSI has been trading between 40 and 60 levels. This suggests a balance between supply and demand.Trading inside a range can be volatile and difficult to predict. Hence, it is better to trade when the price reaches the support or resistance of the range. Another possibility is to wait for the price to break above or below the range before taking large bets.If the bulls can push the price above $280, the BCH/USD pair could rally to $326.30. Conversely, a drop below $231 may sink the price to $200.Litecoin (LTC) has soared and broken out of the overhead resistance at $68.9008. If the bulls can sustain the price above the breakout level, it will signal the possible start of a new uptrend. The next target on the upside is $80, then $100.However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to fake the current breakout and pull the price back below $68.9008. If they succeed, it will suggest strong selling close to the $70 mark.If the price sustains below $68.9008, the bears will then try to drag the LTC/USD pair down to the $64 support. If they can do that, it will suggest that the upward momentum has weakened.The bears are trying to sink Binance Coin (BNB) below the tight range of $27.30 to $28.97. The downsloping 20-day EMA ($28.29) and the RSI below 47 suggest an advantage to the bears.If the BNB/USD pair dips below $27.30, the next stop could be $25.6652. This is an important support, as the bulls have defended it aggressively on two previous occasions.A strong rebound of this support will increase the possibility that the pair may consolidate in the $25.6652–$32 range for a few more days.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair rebounds off the current levels and rises above the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to push the price above $28.97. If they succeed, a rally to $30 and then to $32 will be on the cards.Polkadot's DOT bounced off the 20-day EMA ($4.36) on Nov. 12, but the bulls could not push the price above the minor resistance at $4.63. This suggests a lack of demand at higher levels.However, the bulls have again purchased the dip to the 20-day EMA and are currently attempting to push the price above the immediate resistance at $4.63. If they manage to do that, the DOT/USD pair could rally to $4.95.The marginally upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory suggest an advantage to the bulls.This positive view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the moving averages. In such a case, a drop to $3.80 is possible.Cardano's ADA slipped below the moving averages on Nov. 15, but the bulls are trying to defend the support at $0.098822. If the altcoin rebounds and rises above the moving averages, the bulls will again try to push the price to $0.1142241.A breakout and close above the downtrend line will be the first sign of strength. Contrary to this assumption, if the ADA/USD pair turns down from the downtrend line and plummets below $0.098822, it could drop to $0.0893.As the bulls had purchased the previous two declines to $0.0893, they are likely to attempt it again. Hence, a bounce off this support could extend the stay of the pair inside the range.The flat moving averages and the RSI near the halfway mark also point to a range-bound action for the next few days.Bitcoin SV (BSV) again turned down from the 20-day EMA ($161) on Nov. 14, which suggests that the bears are selling on minor rallies. If the selling continues, the altcoin could drop to the critical support at $146.The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI below 49 suggest a minor advantage to the bears. However, one positive development is the bullish divergence on the RSI. This suggests that the downside momentum may be weakening.If the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, it could clear the path for a rally to $181. The next trending move is likely to start after the bulls drive the price above $181 or the bears sink the price below $146.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

532,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new yearly high at $16,717 on Binance. Following the breakout, traders expect a larger rally to occur in the near term.There are several reasons why analysts expect a prolonged uptrend. First, Bitcoin cleanly broke out of $16,000, taking out the $16,473 peak achieved on Nov. 13. Second, there is a “sell-side crisis” brewing as more BTC gets accumulated than mined. Third, BTC rallied despite indicators showing overbought signals.Earlier today, John Bollinger, a veteran trader and the creator of the Bollinger Bands indicator, said he was wrong about a Bitcoin correction.On Nov. 10, Bollinger said Bitcoin is showing a “short-term topping pattern.” At the time, Bollinger was unsure whether this would lead to a correction or consolidation, but he said he expected the market to cool down.A number of analysts expected Bitcoin to slump, especially as it nears the weekly candle close. Yet, BTC continuously rallied, seeing intensifying momentum. Bolinger said:Derivatives traders have also pointed to the declining Bitcoin supply leading to a sell-side crisis. This trend might be causing BTC to rally even as it tests major support levels.A pseudonymous futures and options trader known as “Light” said around 3,000 BTC have been withdrawn daily since BTC hit $10,000. This trend shows that the demand for Bitcoin is high and miners are refusing to sell BTC, which is optimistic for BTC. The trader said:On Nov. 12, when Pfizer announced a highly effective vaccine for the coronavirus, the price of Bitcoin crashed by nearly 3% in a few hours.This time, following the release of Moderna’s highly anticipated vaccine results, Bitcoin has actually increased by nearly 5%. In the same period, gold has struggled, gaining a mere 0.17%.But traders say that if Bitcoin drops as it did on Nov. 12, then it would present a “dip-buying” opportunity. A popular crypto trader known as ""Hsaka"" said:The combination of technical momentum, a sell-side crisis and the sheer momentum of the rally is causing BTC to stay stable above $16,000. Considering that BTC has not dipped quickly after its upsurge, there is a strong argument to be made that $16,000 is turning into a reliable support area."
533,"Bitcoin price has been showing significant strength as Bitcoin (BTC) rallied by more than 60% in a matter of six weeks, surging from $10,000 to $16,500 and leaving many investors behind.These investors were waiting for the close of the CME gap at $9,600, which didn’t occur. However, can the markets expect a correction to happen, or is further strength likely for the markets?The daily chart shows some crucial levels to watch. If Bitcoin’s price wants to continue its upward momentum, the previous resistance zone has to flip for support.A similar example is shown through the previous breakout at $13,200. This area acted as resistance before the breakout but immediately flipped to become new support. This support/resistance flip warranted further continuation to $16,500.The $15,500–$15,700 area implies the same critical construction as the previous $13,200 area. Holding the $15,500–$15,700 area means further upward continuation is likely, while a breakdown confirms the bearish divergence that should push the price down. This downward move may even see BTC drop to the $14,000 level.The weekly time frame shows a precise resistance level at $12,000, which was broken six weeks ago. The next massive resistance zone is found between $15,750 and $16,500, which was hit last week.However, is a continuation likely after such a massive surge? One argument is that there are still many untested levels beneath the current spot price where liquidity can be found.Moreover, the sentiment has flipped from bearish to euphorically bullish as more institutions jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon, so a pullback shouldn’t come as a surprise.As the chart shows, a correction toward $12,000 could still occur, which used to be a critical level. This level broke after holding for two years. However, a retest of this zone didn’t occur.Investors and traders should watch this level as a potential entry of interest.The Crypto Fear & Greed Index measures different variables to gauge current market sentiment, which is still 90 out of 100. This level is qualified as ""extreme greed.""This level was only reached once before. This previous one marked the top of the bull run in June 2019.Of course, it’s not an entirely reliable indicator, and traders and investors shouldn’t blindly anticipate their strategy based on this one metric. Nevertheless, it gives useful insight into the current state of euphoria in the market.Given that FOMO — fear of missing out — is setting in, a correction would put everyone back on their feet again. As previously stated, such a pullback would actually be very healthy for an overheated market.The four-hour chart shows a clear uptrend since the breakout at $10,000. However, there are some crucial levels to hold to sustain this momentum.The red box identifies the liquidity above the recent high. To keep climbing higher, an apparent breakthrough in this resistance zone has to occur in which the $16,500 area immediately flips for support. Otherwise, the breakout will most likely become a fakeout and just a tap for liquidity before the market reverses.As previously discussed, the $15,600–$15,750 area has to hold for more upside, with the next significant area of resistance at around $17,500. If that area fails to hold as support, the next support zone is found at $14,800 to $15,000. A potential bearish support/resistance flip of the $15,600–$15,800 area will likely trigger more downside.If this happens, the next areas of support will then likely be $13,700 to $13,900 and $12,800 to $13,200.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

534,"Bitcoin (BTC) hitting its all-time highs of $20,000 again is not the end but the start of its explosion to a $1 trillion asset, a senior Bloomberg analyst said.In a tweet on Monday, as BTC/USD reclaimed $16,000, Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, delivered a fresh bullish forecast for the largest cryptocurrency.Bitcoin saw lower levels over the weekend, briefly dipping to $15,800 before conspicuously rising on Monday to see highs of $16,400 at press time.“$20,000 #Bitcoin Is Primary Hurdle Toward $1 Trillion Market Cap — The digital version of #gold but with more-limited supply and a history of adding zeros, appears to be in an early price-discovery stage and may simply continue its ascent in 2021,” McGlone wrote.An accompanying chart described a $1 trillion market capitalization as the “next big resistance” for Bitcoin.McGlone is known for his increasingly positive Bitcoin outlooks. As Cointelegraph reported, he argued in September that Bitcoin should, in fact, trade at $15,000 based on active addresses, something which soon became reality.McGlone is far from the only markets veteran doubling down on the lucrative prospects for Bitcoin in its current bull run.On Monday, trader Peter Brandt suggested that based on previous bull runs from 2013 and 2017, the current price performance was only the start of the cycle.“During the 2015–2017 bull market in Bitcoin $BTC, there were 9 significant corrections with the following averages: 37% decline from high to low, 14 weeks from one ATH to the next ATH,” he explained.Statistician Willy Woo likewise believes that there is far more mileage left in the current uptrend. His argument was based on Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI), which he described as “just warming up.”Beyond Bitcoin circles, a Citibank market analyst this week announced that he foresaw a $318,000 Bitcoin price by December next year.

535,"It shouldn’t come as a surprise that regulators are starting to pay close attention to cryptocurrencies this year. For instance, as the price of Bitcoin (BTC) continues to soar, it’s predicted that regulators will start taking direct action – possibly even banning Bitcoin completely. While the ban may sound extreme, regulators have recently honed in on the use of privacy coins like Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC) and Dash. For example, in September this year, the United States Internal Revenue Service offered a bounty of up to $625,000 for intelligence firms that could break the untraceable privacy coin Monero.Moreover, on Oct. 8, William Barr, the attorney general for the U.S., announced the release of a document entitled, “Cryptocurrency: An Enforcement Framework.” Produced by the attorney general’s Cyber-Digital Task Force, the publication discusses a framework to combat the “emerging threats and enforcement challenges associated with the increasing prevalence and use of cryptocurrency.”Although the document discusses cryptocurrencies in general, the report specifically addresses issues involving “anonymity enhanced cryptocurrencies,” also known as AECs or privacy coins. The document notes examples of these privacy coins to include Monero, Zcash and Dash, stating that they undermine the Anti-Money Laundering measures:Following the release of the cryptocurrency enforcement framework, ShapeShift, a Swiss cryptocurrency exchange platform that runs operations out of Denver, Colorado, has delisted the very same three privacy coins mentioned.While ShapeShift declined to comment on the matter, Ryan Taylor, CEO of Dash Core Group, told Cointelegraph that the Dash network was labeled as a privacy coin in 2014. According to Taylor, the assumptions behind this label — or even more fundamentally what the label of privacy itself even means – has never been revisited. “We aim to correct this inaccurate categorization,” he remarked.Taylor further explained that there has been no further developments made since the delisting of Dash on ShapeShift. However, he remains optimistic about partnering with the non-custodial exchange to get Dash relisted. He elaborated:Yet due to the recent regulations around privacy coins, getting relisted may be more difficult than before. Miko Matsumura, a co-founder of Evercoin — a mobile wallet and exchange — told Cointelegraph that the recent U.S. cryptocurrency enforcement framework focuses so much on privacy coins due to the notion that they enable users to evade sanctions set by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. “ShapeShift was a bit slow to adopt Know Your Customer measures in the first place, so regulatory pressure must be high,” he said.Aside from the challenges of getting relisted, other cryptocurrency exchanges may follow suit and start delisting privacy coins. Nathan Catania, a partner at XReg Consulting — a crypto-asset regulatory firm — told Cointelegraph that it’s likely many crypto exchanges will start delisting privacy coins. “This could be due to outright bans, or greater regulatory pressures for virtual asset service providers to treat privacy coins as higher risk for Anti-Money Laundering purposes,” he said.Asia’s two largest cryptocurrency exchange markets — Japan and South Korea — are already taking action to delist privacy coins. Catania further remarked that even if privacy coins are not banned, a lot more work and scrutiny would be required moving forward for crypto exchanges to interact with clients who wish to use privacy coins. Yet Catania believes that for some exchanges, the risks and costs would not outweigh the benefits of supporting privacy coins, so more exchanges are likely to delist privacy coins in the future.However, some experts beg to differ. Bill Barhydt, the CEO of Abra — a peer-to-peer payments platform that supports over 70 cryptocurrencies including Dash — told Cointelegraph that Abra works closely with third-party custody partners. He mentioned that, to his knowledge, these partners have no plans to delist any cryptocurrencies that are widely used in the marketplace today. Dash would fall into this category, as its current market cap rank is number 31 on CoinGecko, with 9.8 Million coins in circulation.In addition, many compliant crypto exchanges in the United States continue to support privacy coins. Justin Ehrenhofer, a compliance analyst at DV Chain — an affiliate of Chicago-based proprietary trading firm DV Trading — told Cointelegprah that exchanges, such as Kraken, which has a Special Purpose Depository Institution banking charter in the state of Wyoming, support many common privacy coins. He further noted that Gemini supports shielded Zcash deposits and withdrawals, pointing out that the risk-based approach Gemini takes for Zcash should apply to shielded deposits and withdrawals of other assets like Monero, too.Speculations aside, Dash Core’s Taylor ultimately believes that Dash is no more of a privacy coin than Bitcoin: “Most people would say that Bitcoin is clearly not a privacy coin, so it’s informative to evaluate where Dash would fall on this privacy spectrum compared to Bitcoin.” He went on to add: “Bitcoin is absolutely higher risk than Dash from a regulatory perspective for many reasons, both technical and in terms of its real-world use.”This notion was also specifically stated in an AML regulation report released by international law firm Perkins Coie. Taylor further expressed that the label of a privacy coin is meaningless, as different technologies provide differing degrees of privacy to different participants. According to Taylor, what is relevant for this specific case is how exchanges and other money services businesses can address the AML compliance risks for transactions for the cryptocurrencies they support.It’s also important to point out that Bitcoin continues to be the most widely used cryptocurrency on darknet markets. John Jefferies, the chief financial analyst at CipherTrace — a blockchain intelligence firm — further told Cointelegraph that the line between privacy coins and Bitcoin is not binary since privacy enhancements like CoinJoin and layer-two networks can also enhance the privacy of Bitcoin transactions."
536,"""Bitcoin has failed as means of payment"" is one of the prevalent criticisms of Bitcoin (BTC) that Fidelity Digital Assets is seeking to rebut. In a blog post published on Nov. 13, the firm took on six “persistent” criticisms, including Bitcoin's volatility, environmental wastefulness and use in illicit activities.Regarding the coin's purported failure as a means of payment for everyday transactions, Fidelity's argument is that this criticism fails to understand Bitcoin's core purpose. The currency is outperformed, Fidelity accepts, by conventional payment rails like Visa, Mastercard and PayPal, all of which can offer higher throughput. However, Bitcoin has been designed with other priorities in mind, including “perfect scarcity,” Fidelity argues. While the coin is, in theory, viable as a payment tool, its limitations mean that everyday use is not necessarily the end goal for the asset. As well as price volatility, Bitcoin's tax definition as property in some jurisdictions — meaning that users have to calculate gains and losses for every payment or purchase in Bitcoin — renders it impractical for many payments.Fidelity claims that users should be aware that the coin's design has prioritized aspects such as decentralization, finite supply and immutable settlement. These should be valued on their own terms, with the acceptance that they do come with downsides on the daily transactions front.Related to payments, Fidelity tackles the criticism that Bitcoin's extreme volatility compromises its use as a store of value. Here, Fidelity again reframes the terms of the criticism, claiming that volatility is the price paid for an “intervention resistant market”:Fidelity provides further, detailed arguments surrounding volatility as well, relating it to the asset's “perfectly inelastic supply.” The last four criticisms tackled in the blog post are environmental wastefulness, Bitcoin's use for illicit activity, the asset “not being backed by anything,” and its potential overtaking by a competitor."
537,"A recent Bitcoin (BTC) technical analysis reportedly prepared by CitiFX for its institutional clients points to a potential high of $318,000 sometime in December 2021.In a supposed note to clients seen by Twitter commentator Alex on Nov. 14,  Citibank managing director Tom Fitzpatrick looks at the long-term trend of Bitcoin price, characterized as it has been by “unthinkable rallies followed by painful corrections.”Notably, the three major bullish periods of BTC so far have been increasing in length. Initially, there was a 10-month run from 2010–2011, followed by a two-year run from 2011–2013, and finally a three-year run covering 2015–2017.Conversely, Fitzpatrick posits that the period of correction following the last two bull runs has remained stable at around 12 months.This, according to the analysis, places us squarely in the middle of a bull run which started in early 2019 and is potentially set to run for four years until late 2022.It could be argued that such an extended bull run would lead to even higher levels, and charting “what looks like a very well defined channel” over the past seven years gives Fitzpatrick his prediction of a $318,000 Bitcoin price in December 2021.While conceding that this figure may seem highly improbable, he points out that this “would only be a low to high rally of 102 times (the weakest rally so far in percentage terms) at a point where the arguments in favour of Bitcoin could well be at their most persuasive ever.”These arguments include a change in the United States Federal Reserve’s monetary policy which occurred when the coronavirus pandemic hit. This was characterized by a vast and sustained increase in new money production, with less intention to constrain this once the economy and employment pick up again.Cointelegraph has reached out to Citibank for further comment on the report but has not received a response as of publishing time.

538,"From Oct. 15 to Nov. 15, Bitcoin (BTC) exchange outflows dropped from 2.5 million to 2.355 million, the lowest levels since August 2018. Approximately 145,000 BTC, worth $2.35 billion at a price point of $16,200, moved out of exchanges.In the same period, Bitcoin miners mined around 27,000 BTC, equivalent to around $437.4 million. Since miners have been mining 900 BTC daily after the May 11 halving, 900 BTC times 30 days equals 27,000 BTC.This aggressive accumulation trend seen in the Bitcoin market shows that investors anticipate a prolonged post-halving uptrend.A block reward halving occurs every four years until the fixed supply of Bitcoin at 21 million gets reached.After each block reward halving, the number of Bitcoin miners can mine per day declines by half. This means prior to the May 2020 halving, around 1,800 BTC were mined. Until the next halving in 2024, 900 BTC will be mined per day.The amount of available Bitcoin on exchanges is significantly reduced since less BTC getting mined per day alongside rising exchange outflows.If the demand for Bitcoin continues to rise, then the decline in supply would cause the value of BTC to surge. Hence, many investors might be expecting the price of BTC to see a prolonged uptrend in the medium term.The growing hash rate of the Bitcoin blockchain is another potential catalyst for BTC heading into 2021.According to the data from Blockchain.com, the Bitcoin blockchain’s hashrate has recovered in recent weeks following the biggest downward difficulty adjustment since 2011.The 7-day average hashrate of Bitcoin recovered from 106 million terahash per second (TH/s) to 126 million TH/S between Nov. 3 and Nov. 15.The Bitcoin hash rate recovering so quickly after the rainy season is an optimistic trend because it suggests that miners are likely expecting the price of BTC to rise in the medium term.On Nov. 14, Grayscale disclosed that its net assets under management (AUM) reached $9.8 billion. The firm is a mere $200 million away from reaching $10 billion in AUM.The AUM of Grayscale is a decent metric to gauge institutional activity. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has evolved into the go-to investment vehicle for institutions that want to gain exposure to BTC.Other institution-tailored platforms, such as CME’s Bitcoin futures exchange, are nearing record-high volumes and open interest.The combination of rising capital inflows into institutional platforms and the decreasing supply of available Bitcoin on exchanges suggest that the demand for BTC is likely increasing as the price gets closer to its all-time high."
539,"The central bank for the Central Asian country of Kyrgyzstan is working on a draft law to regulate the cryptocurrency industry in the country.According to an announcement on Nov. 13, the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic is developing a draft law that would regulate cryptocurrency exchanges in consultation with industry stakeholders.The bank stated that the draft law would regulate the sale and purchase of cryptocurrencies with the aim of tackling fraudulent cryptocurrency schemes and financial crimes, as well as safeguarding consumer and investor rights.Among the expected benefits of the forthcoming regulations, the bank notes the improved development of digital financial products, favorable conditions for the business community and even the possible introduction of a formal tax regime for digital assets.However, the bank also expects crypto legislation to come with its own share of obstacles, stating that the cross-border nature of many private cryptocurrencies will make the law difficult to enforce without the proper infrastructure for monitoring and implementation.Indeed, the bank states that due to the ""lack of regulation and the chaotic nature of the cryptocurrency market,"" there is no hard data on the number of businesses that would be subject to the new law. Per the announcement, the bank expects explicit crypto regulations to provide more certainty for crypto-related businesses and attract investment without a significant effect on the government budget.The bank will accept proposals for the draft law until Nov. 27, after which they will be published on the official register by Dec. 4.Solid crypto regulations would be a long time coming for the politically beleaguered nation. In August 2019 the parliament introduced a bill to tax cryptocurrency miners, only for authorities to cut off electricity to the industry a month later due to reported overconsumption. Last summer, the parliament was still deliberating on a tax regime for cryptocurrency miners, but civil unrest has since derailed previous political initiatives, with a rump parliament electing nationalist opposition leader and former member of parliament Sadyr Japarov as acting president and prime minister on Oct. 7."
540,"Bitcoin (BTC) begins a new week with stocks rising and the U.S. dollar falling — all while trading back above $16,000. What’s next for price action?Cointelegraph takes a look at the factors which could shape how Bitcoin moves in the coming days.This week’s macro environment feels somewhat different to the last — stocks are gaining, boosted by a major Asian trade deal, while the U.S. dollar is losing ground.According to the latest data on Nov. 16, the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) has declined over the past week to hit 92.58 from post-election highs of 93.2. Traditionally, Bitcoin moves inversely with DXY, and despite this relationship becoming less pronounced recently, heavy moves in either direction can still impact BTC/USD.Asian stocks meanwhile led the way on Monday, with 15 nations signing the long-awaited Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), set to reduce trade tariffs by up to 92% between them.The mood spilled over to European and U.S. futures, with markets now on track to hit record highs across the board. The situation is curiously familiar — after the crash and subsequent rebound earlier this year, markets are once again buoyant despite the tightening noose of coronavirus restrictions worldwide.As Cointelegraph previously reported, artificial meddling from central banks remains a major cause for reservations about the true health of equities.Analyzing the status quo, macro investor Dan Tapiero argued that ongoing economic policy would nonetheless help safe havens, including Bitcoin.“Expect more liquidity injections from central banks. Short term economic activity will slow again as caution returns,” he tweeted.Bitcoin’s weekend price action has allowed it to start its third best week in history after sealing a weekly close above the seminal $15,890 area.For the weekly chart, this means that Bitcoin beat its performance from the previous week to see its third highest weekly close on record Sunday.Only two more weekly closes have been higher, but analysts continue to debate whether the market will attempt to revisit them.“The market in general is at crossroads of direction,” Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe summarized late Sunday, when BTC/USD hovered at around $15,850.Previously, trader Tone Vays said that he would be eyeing a top around $17,000 or $18,000.“I do not believe this current push is going to take us to new all-time highs,” he forecast in video analysis earlier in the week.In the event, $16,000 returned, with publishing-time levels circling $16,250 prior to Wall St. opening.Away from retail, institutional investors remain conspicuously long BTC, and according to statistician Willy Woo, capital inflows prove it.“Weekend trading setup: Shaking off some bearishness technicals (4h RSI div, 8h TD9),” he told Twitter followers Saturday.Woo was referring to the decreasing number of coins held on exchange order books, a phenomenon that has marked the recent price gains from $11,000 onwards. Rather than speculate, investors are putting coins into storage elsewhere, indicating a desire to hold for the long term.Signs of bullish change already permeate Bitcoin’s network fundamentals despite the increasing warnings of a price dip.Estimates from monitoring resource BTC.com on Monday show that Bitcoin’s mining difficulty is now set to increase by around 4% in the coming hours. The latest automated readjustment for difficulty, estimates previously forecast a drop of approximately 6%, but subsequently reversed direction.The increased competition among miners follows a sharp decline in difficulty two weeks ago, which at 16% was Bitcoin’s biggest drop since 2011.Zooming out, analysts have been keen to note that difficulty is arguably Bitcoin’s most important technical characteristic. Adjustments on long-term timeframes, combined with block subsidy halvings every four years, have consistently protected the network completely independent of external help.“The difficulty adjustment ensures that only so much flow can be dropped into the market every day. What that means for the price is interesting because it helps calm the urge to front-run the future halving events,” Preston Pysh, co-founder of The Investor’s Podcast Network, wrote in a now-popular Twitter thread published last week.Data further shows that hash rate — an estimate of how much computing power is dedicated to validating the Bitcoin blockchain — is returning to growth after its own drop.Things aren’t looking good for avoiding a Bitcoin price dip, a popular investor sentiment indicator meanwhile warns on Monday.The latest readings from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index suggest that a correction is all but guaranteed for BTC/USD.Fear & Greed uses a basket of factors to gauge the mood among BTC investors, and with a score of 90/100, it lies firmly in the “extreme greed” zone.For context, only at the height of last year’s bull run did the Index beat its current highs. As Cointelegraph reported, however, analysts argue that 2020 has produced much more “organic” and, therefore, sustainable growth for Bitcoin price."
541,"Over the weekend numerous traders pointed out that Bitcoin (BTC) price broke its parabolic uptrend which had dated back to September. Technical analysts are bracing for a pullback as the dominant cryptocurrency eyes consolidation.Bitcoin could still see a strong recovery after the weekly close if there is a continuation of the rally. But it would need to quickly re-enter the parabola or risk a potential downward correction.Since early September, Bitcoin has continuously rallied without major corrections. Typically, during bull trends, BTC historically saw 20% to 30% drops. There is a possibility that a large pullback could ensue if BTC fails to reenter the parabola.According to the 12-hour Bitcoin price chart shared by the pseudonymous trader “Altcoin Psycho,” BTC is now out of 2-month the parabolic advance.The trend does not necessarily indicate that BTC would see a deep correction in the near term. Rather, it merely signifies that a trend might form as the markets cool down.For instance, long-time technical analyst John Bollinger said that BTC is likely to pull back or consolidate. Considering that BTC is hovering at the top of the Bollinger Bands, BTC is hovering in overbought territory.But, there is always a possibility that BTC could see a stronger rally in the near term in a different technical structure.The break of the parabolic uptrend simply signifies that a new market structure would emerge. Whether this means a downtrend would emerge or a broader rally would occur remains to be seen.In the foreseeable future, Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said $15,500 holds the key. He said that if BTC drops below it, a large correction is possible. He wrote:Technical analysts are generally cautious in predicting a clear short-term direction due to the uncertainty in the market. There are strong chances that BTC could either continuously surge upwards or see a major price drop.If Bitcoin drops below $15,500, however, it would mean that the probability of BTC testing low support levels is high.On the weekly chart, the two key short-term moving averages (MAs) are found at $13,967 and $12,390. Although the weekly chart does not have to retrace to MAs, in previous bull cycles, there were instances where the weekly chart retested lower MAs.Since Nov. 10, Gemini exchange recorded unusually high deposits. This typically indicates that whales are moving to sell their holdings to take profits.A pseudonymous analyst known as “Blackbeard” said an unusually high amount of $BTC has been transferred to Gemini wallets” on Nov. 10, referring to CryptoQuant’s on-chain data.On Nov. 15, as Cointelegraph reported, Gemini deposits spiked again, which might lead to higher selling pressure in the near term.In the foreseeable future, if BTC struggles to recover, the selling pressure from whales and miners would remain as important variables."
542,"Bitcoin (BTC) has long been touted as digital gold by crypto enthusiasts. Now as the digital asset faces its first economic crisis since its birth, Bitcoin has validated the narrative and outperformed gold by a large margin in 2020. This suggests two important things, Bitcoin is here to stay and it is a better bet than gold.Some popular traditional investors have already jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon and analysts at Whalemap believe that institutions have been the primary buyers in the $12,000 to $15,000 range.The over-the-counter trading desk at Galaxy Digital also reported an increase in trading volumes by the institutional investors. The company’s CEO Mike Novogratz and head of sales Tim Plakas, both showed confidence that more traditional investors and funds could enter the crypto space in 2021.While most investors seem to be bullish on Bitcoin, on-chain data suggests that some whales believe that the rally could have topped out in the short-term, hence, they have turned into sellers.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-five cryptocurrencies to determine whether the rally may continue for some more time or is a short-term top around the corner.Bitcoin (BTC) has not closed below the 10-week exponential moving average ($15,613) since Oct. 8. This shows that the trend is strong and the bulls have been buying on every minor dip without waiting for a larger correction.The upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index in the overbought territory suggest that bulls are in control. The buyers are currently attempting to sustain the price above the immediate support at $16,000.If they succeed, the BTC/USD pair could resume its uptrend with the next target objective at $17,200.Conversely, if the pair drops below the 10-day EMA, it will suggest profit booking by traders at higher levels. There is a minor support at $14,800 but if that also cracks, the correction could extend to $14,000.The 10-EMA on the 4-hour chart has flattened out and the RSI is close to the midpoint, which suggests a balance between supply and demand. The bearish divergence on the RSI warns of weakening momentum.If the bears can drag the price below the 50-simple moving average, a drop to $14,800 and then to $14,400 is possible.Contrary to this assumption, if the price rebounds off the current levels or from the 50-SMA and rises above $16,500, the next leg of the uptrend could begin.Ether (ETH) has turned around from $478.058 on Nov. 13, which is just below the stiff overhead resistance at $488.134 where the previous rally had topped out on Sep. 1. It is usual to expect some amount of profit booking near the resistance.However, if the bulls do not allow the ETH/USD pair to give up much ground, it will increase the possibility of a breakout of $488.134. Above this level, the bears may again try to stall the rally at the psychological level at $500.If the bulls can thrust the price above the $488.134 to $500 resistance zone, the rally may extend to $550. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone, suggest advantage to the bulls.This positive view will be invalidated if the price breaks below the 10-day EMA. If that happens, the pair may drop to $420 and then to $400. Such a move could point to a possible range formation in the short-term.The 4-hour chart shows that the pair has broken below the support line of the rising wedge pattern and the RSI has also formed a bearish divergence.Moreover, the downsloping 10-EMA and the RSI in the negative zone, suggest that bears have the upper hand.If the pair sustains below the 50-SMA, a fall to $440 and then to $424 is possible. This short-term bearish view will be negated if the price turns around and rises above $478.058.XRP had been stuck in a range between $0.23 to $0.26 for over two months. The range resolved to the upside with a strong breakout of $0.26 on Nov. 13. However, the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight.The tussle between the bulls and the bears could pull the price down to the breakout level of $0.26. If the bulls purchase this dip and the price rebounds off the breakout level, it will suggest that traders are buying as they anticipate higher levels in the future.The upsloping 10-day EMA ($0.258) and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls have the upper hand. The next target on the upside is $0.30.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears pull the XRP/USD pair back below $0.26, it could catch several aggressive bulls off guard who may then have to liquidate their positions in a hurry.The ensuing panic selling could sink the pair below the 50-day SMA ($0.248) and keep it range-bound for a few more days.The moving averages on the 4-hour chart are sloping up and the RSI is above 59, suggesting the advantage is with the bulls.If the pair rebounds off the current levels, it will indicate that the bulls are buying on dips to the 10-EMA, which shows that the sentiment has turned bullish.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the 10-EMA, a retest of $0.26 will be on the cards. If the price breaks and sustains below this support, it will suggest that bears have made a comeback.Monero (XMR) had been in a correction since topping out on Oct. 26. The bulls pushed the altcoin above the downtrend line on Nov. 10 and are currently attempting to propel the price above the $118.10 to $120.7773 resistance zone.If they succeed, the XMR/USD pair could move up to $128 and if this level is also scaled, the rally may extend to $139.2885. The 10-day EMA ($115) has flattened out and the RSI is just below the midpoint, which suggests that the selling pressure has reduced.This bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance zone and plummets back below $110. Such a move could drag the price down to $104.The 4-hour chart shows the formation of an ascending triangle pattern that will complete on a breakout and close above $118.10. This bullish setup has a target objective of $132.90.On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below the support line of the triangle, it will invalidate the bullish setup and could drag the price down to $110.Both moving averages are flat and the RSI is just above the midpoint, which suggests a balance between supply and demand. The break above or below the triangle could start the next short-term trending move.Uniswap (UNI) bottomed out at $1.7563 on Nov. 5 and since then embarked on a strong uptrend. The up-move in the past few days has resulted in a rally of over 136%.The 10-day EMA ($3.27) has turned up and the RSI has risen from close to the oversold zone to the overbought territory. This suggests that the bulls are back in the game. They will now try to push the price to the psychological level of $5.This level may act as a resistance as the bears will try to stall the up-move in the $5 to $5.55 zone. However, if the bulls do not give up much ground from this zone, then the uptrend could continue.The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 10-day EMA. Such a move will suggest profit booking by the short-term traders and shorting by the aggressive bears.The 4-hour chart shows that both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone. This suggests that the bulls are in control. The immediate resistance is at $4.50 where the bears may try to stall the rally.If the bulls defend the 10-EMA on the downside, it will suggest that the momentum still favors the bulls. This positive view could be invalidated if the price turns down and sustains below the $3.50 support.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

543,"As the cryptocurrency market is in the midst of a major bull run with Bitcoin (BTC) approaching its all-time highs, the security concerns of cryptocurrency self-storage are becoming more relevant than ever.On Nov. 12, Bitcoin — the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap — surpassed a $16,000 threshold for the first time since the 2017 rally landing BTC price at an ATH of $20,000. After hitting $16,300, Bitcoin has only ever been above this price for 12 days in its entire history.As Bitcoin is now sitting at its highest historical levels and the crypto community is anticipating more records in the near future, it is important to remember that the safety of crypto holdings very much depends on the user.Here are some simple steps to ensure that your cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are safe in this bull market.1. Use paper wallet or hardware walletAs Bitcoin essentially allows to “be your own bank,” the responsibility of storing crypto mainly lies with users. A popular expression in the crypto community says “Not your keys, not your Bitcoin,” meaning that whoever holds the key phrase to a wallet, controls the coins contained therein.Wallets come in many forms: software, hardware, and paper, each with different security considerations.As their name suggests, software wallets are based on software, allowing users to access their crypto by installing applications on their mobile devices or a computer. As such, software wallets come in many different types like web, desktop, and mobile wallets.While software wallets are often free and easy to use, they are not completely safe as most of them are somehow connected to the internet, which can make them vulnerable to hacking attacks or security breaches. Users should keep their apps up-to-date in order to reduce risks of possible breaches.A paper crypto wallet is essentially a piece of paper containing a printed out crypto address and its private key in the form of QR codes generated through paper wallet websites. These codes can be scanned to execute crypto transactions. A paper wallet is highly resistant to online hacking attacks and is often considered an option to cold storage.A hardware wallet is another sophisticated method to store crypto, isolating user private keys from the internet by keeping them offline in a USB-connected device. Also referred to as cold storage or a cold wallet, a hardware wallet is often associated with an increased level of security as private keys remain completely offline, which is designed to make them immune to any type of remote hacking. Trezor and Ledger are considered the most popular hardware wallet providers.2. Check whether your 2FA verification is onDon’t ignore a key additional layer of security by forgetting to turn on two-factor authentication, or 2FA, in the security settings of your wallet account. 2FA sends an additional password request to your phone or email every time you log into your wallet. By activating 2FA, a user prevents a hacker from getting immediate access to a crypto wallet account as the hacker will also need physical access to the user's phone or email.Google Authenticator is the one of the most popular 2FA applications providing users two-step verification on a phone.3. Never share your private keysDon’t ever give your private keys or a seed phrase to anyone. By doing so, you’d be essentially giving away the keys to the castle. Remember that reputable crypto companies will never ask you for your keys even when trying to help you resolve issues.4. Be sure the recipient wallet is correctAlways check a recipient address before proceeding with a transaction. A simple one letter mistake could direct your transaction to another wallet. In contrast to some traditional financial services, most crypto transactions are irreversible. Some malware is also capable of changing the right destination of your crypto, so a double-check of transaction details is never redundant.5. Don’t fall for giveaway scamsDon’t ever fall for offers sounding like “send us Bitcoin and get double your Bitcoin back.” This type of attack is quite commonon Twitter, with attackers frequently impersonating celebrities, politicians, or crypto personalities promising to double user’s crypto fortune.As this type of attack is often associated with crypto newcomers, it might get even more exposure with an increasing crypto adoption. In July 2020, online hackers managed to collect at least 12 BTC in a high-profile hack of Twitter accounts like Elon Musk as well as 2020 U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden.6. Use smaller transactions and different exchangesDon’t send a bunch of crypto in one single transaction when you need to buy or sell crypto on a crypto exchange. If you need to transact a big amount of money in crypto, better break it up into multiple transactions to be sure that an exchange is working properly.While all of these security layers and double-checking might seem tedious, they're the key to making sure your funds remain secure. "
544,"Mark my words: Governments and central banks will never care about your wealth and your privacy as much as you do. That reality is exactly why central bank digital currencies are dead in the water already.They say if you can’t beat them, join them. That’s exactly what CBDCs are attempting to do. They want to join the party that is cryptocurrency without actually giving their citizens the privacy and democratic freedom a truly decentralized digital currency provides.In a recent article, I made the argument that regulation and law enforcement are a necessary part of crypto truly going mainstream. I definitely believe that, but that’s not what CBDCs are going to accomplish.CBDCs won’t decentralize wealth. They won’t decentralize power or ownership or control of funds. They won’t give individuals oversight or sovereignty over the value in their wallets.The institutions creating these CBDCs will openly and outwardly promote the virtues of their innovation and their ability to use the best of cutting-edge technology to make transferring value between one another more efficient. They will publicize the need to make an archaic financial system more efficient and more attuned with the times. Consider for a moment two of the countries leading the way in developing their own CBDCs.Related: Central bank digital currencies have the power to upend global financeThe Bank of Russia published a consultation paper outlining plans for a digital ruble. That’s right! The Bank of Russia is working on a digital ruble. That news is hot off the presses, just announced last month. But what has also been recently announced is that the Russian government isn’t looking so kindly on cryptocurrencies or the issuance of new tokens. In other words, Russia wants a slice of the digital currency pie, but only if the government is controlling that digital currency. That’s a fundamental problem with all CBDCs: None of them want to give the keys to the individual.Related: Could Russia lead Eastern Europe’s crypto boom?To be fair, Alexey Guznov, head of the legal department at Russia’s central bank, did say earlier this year that owning cryptocurrency will not be against the law as long as that cryptocurrency was acquired in a jurisdiction that does not prohibit that.China is already testing its digital yuan. China is also racing to try and launch its digital yuan. Trials are already running in Hong Kong’s bay area, and state-run banks are testing a digital currency wallet on a large scale. The Digital Currency Electronic Payment program that China is rolling out includes two layers: one for central banks and another for commercial banks. While commercial banks might use blockchain technology to settle some transactions, the central-bank layer will definitely be centralized.Related: China’s digital yuan CBDC is close, but many details remain unknownThat said, control is what CBDCs are all about — control over wealth, control over private citizens, and of course, control over data.The rush by central banks around the world to create their own digital currencies is not a battle between East and West. Far from it, it’s more about pitting CBDCs against cryptocurrencies that don’t have to worry about central authorities censoring or controlling anything.The point is that the two combatants are not one and the same. CBDCs are really just fiat currencies in a digital format. The format may be different, but the goal is the same: to maintain control over the broader financial system and penalize those that don’t play by the rules set out by whichever central bank or government is calling the shots.Consider for a moment that the European Central Bank is seeking input from the public on what a digital euro might look like. The ECB’s website details many benefits related to developing a digital euro — particularly, that the usability of a digital euro would shine whenever an extreme event like a natural disaster or pandemic occurs. But there is one notable, not-so-subliminal message that needs to be called out in the ECB’s description of the digital euro:Let’s face it: The synonym for the phrase “foreign digital means of payment” is Bitcoin (BTC). Central banks don’t want you to use Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) or any other decentralized cryptocurrency. They want you to use currency that can be tracked. They want to be able to decide which regulators and tax authorities get access to your financial data and which ones do not. CBDCs are not an attempt to revolutionize finance or technology.They are essentially a last-ditch effort to maintain control over the individual, even as actual decentralized currencies pull wealth, power and influence out of the hands of the old world.Keeping value decentralized and keeping the power in the hands of the individual consumer is what gives cryptocurrency its power, not government-backed digital currencies that simply use blockchain technology.Central banks can certainly use blockchain and claim that they are joining something they can’t beat, but the reality is they can’t join. We as global citizens and believers in cryptocurrency won’t let them, nor should we.Cryptocurrencies have come a long way since Bitcoin launched in 2009. In the beginning, people ignored them. Most people laughed. Now, central banks are trying to fight the cryptocurrency revolution. Eventually, the individual is going to win, and your value will be in your wallet where it belongs.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
545,"A Bitcoin (BTC) whale placed a $100 million short on Bybit, according to the pseudonyms trader CL. It comes after various on-chain data points toward a whale-driven sell-off throughout the past week.Though the momentum of Bitcoin remains strong, there are many reasons that make $16,000 an attractive area for sellers.There is significant liquidity at $16,000, primarily because it is a heavy resistance level. But the level has seen relatively high buyer demand, stablecoin inflows show. Hence, the battle between buyers and sellers at $16K makes it an area with high liquidity, which is compelling for sellers.A seller aggressively sold Bitcoin on Bybit on Nov. 15. Order flows show that there were sell orders worth around $3.5 million on average consecutively over several hours.Based on the abrupt large-scale sell order, CL suggested that this may result in two scenarios.First, the seller could get engulfed and cause a squeeze, which might cause the BTC price to increase. Second, it could continue to apply selling pressure on BTC. The trader wrote:Meanwhile, other major exchanges have spotted large deposits over the last 24 hours. United States-based cryptocurrency exchange Gemini saw a 9,000 BTC deposit, according to the data from CryptoQuant.Whales typically utilize exchanges with strict compliance and strong regulatory measures, which include platforms like Coinbase and Gemini.Considering the large Bitcoin deposit into Gemini, which is worth $143 million, a pseudonymous researcher known as “Blackbeard” said it is time to be cautious.As CL noted, Bitcoin’s current market structure is different from the previous cycle. For instance, when BTC was at $16,000 in 2017, the market was extremely overheated with extreme volatility. The trader said:This time around, the rally appears to be more sustainable and gradual. Bitcoin has continued to see a staircase-like rally over the past six months, which has allowed it to evolve into a prolonged uptrend.Rather than a sudden spike followed by another steep uptrend, BTC has seen upside followed by consolidation, and so on.As Cointelegraph reported earlier this month, various data, including Google Trends, show there is still little interest from retail investors unlike in late 2017. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence that Wall Street is starting to take notice. Hence, there is a strong argument to be made that the ongoing rally is fundamentally different from 2017 despite the current ""extreme greed"" market sentiment. Notably, the available supply has decreased due to the recent halving, as well as dwindling reserves on exchanges over the past year.The Bitcoin futures funding rates are also neutral at around 0.01%, which means the market is not as overheated or overcrowded as it was three years ago. This trend could make the downside limited, especially in the medium term."
546,"Ukraine is ranked as the world’s leader in the Global Crypto Adoption Index 2020, according to a research published by Chainalysis earlier this fall. Despite this, cryptocurrencies still remain a gray area in the economy. Since 2014, Ukrainian authorities have been trying to implement crypto legislation that would transform the country into a competitive jurisdiction for running crypto-related businesses, but the efforts did not yield any results. Finally, just a few months ago, the Ukranian government presented a new bill on digital assets to legitimize the sector — and this time, the attempt may well be successful.The fintech strategy of the Ukrainian central bank, or NBU, pledged to legalize activities using cryptocurrencies. According to the document, by 2025, crypto assets will fully enter the legislative field and a transparent infrastructure will be created to allow it to operate on the market.The first steps on this path were taken in late 2019. Since then, parliament members have passed a law on implementing the Financial Action Task Force’s standards for combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Among other things, the standards contain the concept of digital assets.The new bill seems to outline a solid action plan and delegates responsibilities. It clearly states that the governmental Ministry of Digital Transformation will be the main regulator controlling and monitoring any activity using crypto assets. As for tracking suspicious crypto transactions, the department has already agreed to cooperate with blockchain analytics firm Crystal Blockchain BV, developed by Bitfury Group.As expected, digital assets are not considered as a means of payment in the new bill. It is rather described as an intangible asset, a kind of power of attorney for property with which any operation can be performed, except for payment.The document’s authors tried to advise on all areas of usage of digital assets, ranging from initial coin offerings to initial exchange offerings (albeit belatedly) to stablecoins and other possible tokenized assets. Not limited only to this, the new bill describes all the rights and requirements related to custodians of digital assets, including exchanges, multi-signature wallets and any organization that now works and thrives in the crypto environment.Given that crypto adoption in Ukraine is growing rapidly, particularly in the decentralized finance and decentralized autonomous organization infrastructures, it is crucial that the new legislation highlights the difference between these two spaces. What is particularly interesting is the possibility of regulating the work of decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs.However, if the new Ukrainian regulations don’t cover DAO features, the voting rights given to users making decisions within a DAO may be considered illegal. This shows the importance of why processes such as voting on protocol governance should be established in the law.Since there is now a well-defined concept of a secured digital asset, the bill’s authors have a stake in the development of tokenized ecosystems. These may also include tokenized securities under the National Securities and Stock Market Commission’s jurisdiction, a government agency that will also have the authority to regulate transactions with digital assets.The most interesting projects will be related to bonds. Since Ukraine is actively engaged in issuing government bonds, a large number of brokers and banks are selling them to their clients as an alternative to deposits — the main investment instrument available to Ukrainians.Given that the NBU is the custodian of securities for government bonds, this body will also be involved in the legal process if these bonds are tokenized. Such cooperation will make it possible to create infrastructure projects, thereby reviving the securities market and making it more transparent and accessible for individuals.Although the bill is awaiting a vote, this is the first step to making Ukraine a competitive country for the crypto business, and at the very least, a favorable environment for the development of the domestic market. Thanks to the new legislative conditions, legal entities whose activities focus on digital assets will now be able to open bank accounts and work freely by exchanging and/or issuing digital assets.In addition to the possibility of launching a tokenized securities market, the strategic development of the fintech market from the NBU also suggests how national infrastructure projects will develop. According to the document, by 2025, the regulator will issue a central bank digital currency dubbed e-hryvnia. This idea is already included in the bill “On Payment Services,” and unlike today’s digital assets, the CBDC will be considered legal tender.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
547,"There are very few investments that can deliver an infrastructure-style downside case with a venture-capital-style upside. The combination of energy arbitrage with accumulating a balance sheet of Bitcoin (BTC) can deliver this. That is why we are seeing a rush of institutions pouring into the Bitcoin mining space and starting to build out megafacilities.At its peak performance in 2018, Bitmain was able to produce over 95,000 rigs per week. However, since that point, production levels have come down, a partial result of its ongoing legal battle. In the other corner, MicroBT is set to deliver hundreds of thousands machines over the course of the year.The West only receives a finite allocation of these new machines, and with 17 publicly listed mining companies and ASIC financiers and large co-locations announcing purchases weekly, you can see how that fresh supply of equipment quickly dries up. Building relationships with the manufacturers is now crucial to securing an ample allocation of new machines. How do you get in this queue? Have a big checkbook.Economies of scale stand in contrast to decentralization. Yet, like most other industries, the mining space rewards size. Large mining companies receive discounts on ASIC retail prices. With an average payback period of around 300 days for new-generation equipment, the discount can reduce it by over a month. Large miners also have to put up less down payment, in some cases around 20% compared with over 50% for retail. This allows miners to acquire more machines and build out faster.On the infrastructure side, in most cases, building out a 30-megawatt farm can be done at a much lower cost per MW than a 3 MW facility.If you want cheap power, it’s going to cost a great deal of capital for things like buying the land, building out large infrastructure, acquiring generators and other equipment, funding performance bonds, etc. While there are miners taking advantage of small sources of cheap power, in large, the most profitable miners are the big ones. They are able to put up the necessary capital to secure the best locations. And as we know, the cost of electricity is one of the significant determinants of success.Beyond sourcing cheap electricity, large miners can negotiate lower pool fees, firmware development fees and ASIC management software. They can reduce the amount of labor required per MW, drive efficiencies in their management, and improve their power usage effectiveness.Related: Cryptocurrency mining profitability in 2020: Is it possible?Mining is a capital-intensive business. It requires consistent equipment upgrades and new purchases. Filing out a 10 MW farm with new-generation equipment can cost nearly $10 million, depending on the purchase price.Access to various forms of funding such as debt, equity, equipment financing and ASIC financing is crucial for mining farms to stay large and enjoy the benefits discussed above.From 2018 to 2019, most of these mining operations were funded through a mixture of traditional company-level debt and equity. In 2020, we have seen an explosion of growth in ASIC financing. Large and reputable mining farms are now able to raise money from financiers while using their purchased ASICs as collateral. There are still a limited number of these financiers, so they prioritize the best, lowest-risk operators to loan money to.One of the first questions boards ask when presented with an opportunity to mine is around the equipment: “Where is the equipment from? Who is the manufacturer? Is there a warranty? What’s the pricing? Why is the price changing every day? When do the machines ship?”Manufacturers like Bitmian are the pioneers of the Wild West mining industry. In 2016, the arms race for who could get the most machines to market began. Left behind were the corporate policies, the details on shipping and pricing, warranties, viable repair centers, and transparency.When institutions came into the industry, the manufacturers’ mentality of production first and everything else later started to shift. Now, manufacturers must hold weekly calls with big clients, discussing their production visibility and offering more transparency in their operations. Most of the manufacturers now offer machine warranties, they have opened repair centers, and they try to be more transparent on shipping and pricing — although they have a long way to go.This trend of professionalization will likely continue with MicroBT, Bitmain and whoever else wants to compete in the West.“How do we get actually paid?” is another typical question an institution will ask. The answer is by a mining pool. Mining pools are the buyers of hash rate. So, questions arise on who this counterparty is and what the risks associated with dealing with them are.Pools have historically been a black box in the mining value chain. Institutions have helped bring more transparency to mining pool pricing, reduced the number of pools that steal from the miners, and incentivized pools to build out new feature sets. The mining pool industry is evolving rapidly, and if companies don’t keep up, they will get left behind. All of these trends will benefit institutions that are demanding better, more compliant counterparties to deal with.A wave of consolidation is on the horizon for the mining industry. There are hundreds of great companies and teams fighting for elbow room, primed to be scooped up by institutions.The main consolidation will happen at the mining farm level. These mergers and acquisitions will most likely be on a project basis rather than a corporate level, similar to the real estate industry.Other verticals such as mining pools, container manufacturers, ASIC management software, mining media, firmware developers and ASIC resellers may also be consolidated into broader offerings.Financial services companies will also be natural acquirers as they look to build an ecosystem that spans both the mining and financial value chain.In every traditional commodity industry, companies have the ability to leverage financial instruments to hedge their cash flows through futures and options, sell forward some of their production in purchase agreements or forwards, leverage up their bet, and more.To date, there are very few hash-rate-based financial instruments. The entry of institutions will change this, as they are creating demand for these types of products. The need from miners must be met by other market participants such as traders to form liquid, robust marketplaces.In 2015, if you had told the miners where we would be today, they wouldn’t have believed you: millions of ASICs securing the network, gigawatts of power being used and institutions such as Fidelity with their own mining operations.It’s hard to predict how the industry will evolve over the next five years, but I do think that institutions will continue to drive innovation in the space, creating a more secure network for Bitcoin. But this will bring new challenges such as censorship at the protocol level, more Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering, less decentralization and so forth. Legacy Bitcoin-native mining companies must work hand-in-hand with these new entrants to shape a good future for Bitcoin.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
548,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to as low as $15,670 on Binance on Nov. 15. The highly volatile drop came hours after BTC reached $16,355, demonstrating strong momentum. Three key factors likely caused the overnight drop in the price of Bitcoin. The three potential factors are a weekend shakeout, the daily moving average (MA) retest, and a retest of the parabola.As Cointelegraph reported, algorithmic traders expected a weekend drop in the Bitcoin market to materialize.There was a stack of sell orders above $16,500 which were not pulled when the price neared $16,400. This meant that the orders were genuine sell orders, applying selling pressure on the cryptocurrency market.Atop the market structure that likely encouraged traders and bots to short, on-chain analyst Willy Woo said the weekend volatility is bullish.He said that shaking off “bearish technicals” is expected, but the market still remains in the “buy the dip” territory. He wrote:On the daily chart, the drop to $15.6k confirmed a retest of the 10-day moving average. The retest was important because in the past week, following a massive price spike, BTC retested the same MA before continuation.If the price of Bitcoin continued to drop below the 10-day MA, it would have signified a further breakdown. But, the immediate recovery from the same level it recovered from on the Nov. 7 dip is relatively positive in the short term.On Nov. 7, BTC saw a similar drop, albeit in a different price range. The price abruptly plunged from $15,753 to as low as $14,344, recording a 5% drop. The dominant cryptocurrency also recovered from the 10-day MA on the daily chart at the time.In the next few days that followed, BTC went on to hit a two-year high at $16,480, confirming a strong breakout.Josh Olszewicz, a chartist and a cryptocurrency technical analyst, shared a chart that shows Bitcoin is in a parabola.During a parabolic uptrend, an asset’s momentum continues to build up as the price increases. But, if the parabolic cycle breaks, then an asset can be at risk of a large pullback.In the near term, the parabola of Bitcoin remains intact as long as BTC stays above the $15,300 to $15,500 range.Traders and technical analysts have pinpointed similar levels in the last 24 hours. Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, similarly said that the $15,500 support level remains key for BTC in the near term.In the short term, Bitcoin would need to see continuous resilience above $15,500 and ideally defend the $15,700 support as it did throughout the last 24 hours."
549,"In an interview with the ABC News program GMA3: What You Need To Know on Friday, senator-elect Cynthia Lummis again voiced her support for the popularization of Bitcoin, going so far as to say that she does “hope to bring Bitcoin into the national conversation.” In a clip that has been widely circulating on Twitter, the soon-to-be-senator representing Wyoming — possibly the highest ranking US official to ever speak so glowingly of the digital currency — cited her experience as a former state treasurer for why she believes in Bitcoin’s future.“I’m a former state treasurer and I invested our state’s permanent funds, so I was always looking for a good store of value, and Bitcoin fits that bill. Our own currency inflates; Bitcoin does not. It’s 21 million Bitcoin will be mined, and that’s it, it is a finite supply. So I have confidence that this will be an important player in store of value for a long time to come.”The Senator also appeared to brush off GMA3 host Sara Haines’ implication that Bitcoin could be used for money laundering or tax evasion, choosing not to address these charges at all.As Cointelegraph has previously reported, Lummis is an early adopter of Bitcoin, having first picked up the currency in 2013 following a tip from her son-in-law, Will Cole, who works at cryptocurrency services firm Unchained Capital. While some in Congress have tepidly embraced cryptocurrency, such as Florida representative Darren Soto, who accepted campaign contributions donated in cryptocurrency, few — if any — have been as vocal about their support as Lummis.While many outlets have noted that Lummis is Wyoming's first female representative to the Senate, many in the cryptocurrency world no doubt hope that she'll be the first true representative for Bitcoin as well.

550,"Bitcoin continues its bull run. The coin is up more than 12 percent over the last week and is now tickling $16,000. According to the Big Mac Index, a Bitcoin will now buy as many as 6,3421.26 of the giant burgers. It’s even passed the monetary base of the Russian ruble, and is on its way towards beating Canada. That will happen when Bitcoin is worth $18,000. It’s almost there. The coin already has a market cap bigger than that of Bank of America, Netflix, and Shopify. If it keeps rising, it will soon be in the top 20 assets by market cap, alongside Facebook, Tesla, and Apple. It’s no wonder that economists at the US Federal Reserve are looking harder at the value of CBDCs. They think that a central bank digital currency could be a useful way to deliver money directly to households.Not everyone is so optimistic. Eric Wall, chief investment officer of crypto hedge fund Arcane Asset, is betting a million dollars that Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow model will be broken by 2025. By “broken” he means that Bitcoin won’t have reached 50 percent of its target range. In a tweet laying out the challenge, he tagged in PlanB, the creator of the model. PlanB had predicted a Bitcoin price of $100,000-$288,000 by December 2021. David Schwartz, CTO of Ripple, won’t be taking that bet. He says that he has already lost about $300,000 trading in tokens that turned out to be “completely worthless.”The public still isn’t entirely persuaded either. Douglas Tuman, a crypto enthusiast and Monero podcaster, lost his bid for New York’s 4th District. He was running as a Republican on a pro-crypto platform. Joe Biden, though, has selected Gary Gensler to serve as an advisor, helping to ensure a smooth transition with the Federal Reserve and banking and securities regulators. Gensler was previously the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and has talked about the importance of regulation to help cryptocurrencies grow.Regulations have already landed on one Bitcoin user. Volodymyr Kvashuk, a Microsoft engineer, has been sentenced to nine years in prison for stealing $10 million of digital currency. He also told the IRS that the $2.8 million of cryptcurrency that passed through his account was a gift from a relative. That made this crime the first crypto conviction with a tax element.Looking abroad, the China Construction Bank, one of the four biggest banks in China, is selling $3 billion worth of bonds and letting buyers pay for them with Bitcoin. The World Economic Forum sees the blockchain as the key to sustainable digital finance. And ZebPay, India’s oldest cryptocurrency exchange, is launching its own NFT and starting an NFT marketplace.It’s not all good news, though. Binance has started to block US users from its platform. Users have 90 days to withdraw their funds. The blockade is the result of US regulators’ demands for the implementation of Know Your Customer and anti-money laundering requirements. And in Hong Kong, a proposal to require crypto exchanges to obtain a license and only target professional investors has met with criticism. The proposal, say some experts, will limit volume and suggest that crypto assets are speculative.Finally, while the last few weeks have been pretty eventful for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash is about to have its moment.

551,"Bitcoin being regarded as “sound money” is a common refrain among many proponents of the popular cryptocurrency. With a finite supply of 21 million and a network secured by over 120 exahashes per second of computing power, the consensus among industry commentators has often leaned toward it becoming a global monetary superpower.Barely a decade into its existence, Bitcoin’s inferred value is already the 11th-largest global monetary base. Earlier in November, Bitcoin became larger than the Russian ruble for the first time in history.While fiat currencies buckle under economic strain exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, Bitcoin (BTC) has continued on its upward trajectory for most of 2020. Even though the price fluctuations are much more volatile, BTC is up about 120% year-to-date despite the Black Thursday event, a substantial decline suffered back in mid-March.With economic recovery plans likely involving considerable stimulus packages, such cash injections are expected to cause significant devaluation in fiat currency values. If Bitcoin follows through on the parabolic advance predicted by numerous market analysts, it stands ready to move even higher up the global monetary base log.The entire record of world reserve currency history remains consistent with the fact that monetary bases rise and fall. In the six monetary epochs since 1450, no currency has maintained global dominance for more than 110 years. With the U.S. dollar standing at 95 years of being the world’s reserve currency, some are hoping this is a sign that things may change soon.Despite being the most gold-backed fiat currency in the global market, the Russian ruble now has a lower monetary base than Bitcoin. With the ruble losing further ground to the U.S. dollar and BTC jumping to the $16,000 mark, 1 BTC now equals 1.2 million rubles. Up next for Bitcoin in its assault of major currencies is the Canadian dollar. Based on its current circulating supply, a move above $18,000 for BTC would see it overtaking the CAD.As previously reported, Bitcoin is already at all-time highs against seven national currencies including those of Brazil, Argentina and Turkey. Rising inflation exacerbated by economic stagnation occasioned by COVID-19 has negatively impacted several fiat currencies.For now, Bitcoin’s all-time high remains the $19,665 attained during the December 2017 bull run. However, for Bitcoin to begin to challenge the premier global currencies like the U.S. dollar, Chinese yuan and Japanese yen, it will need to reach a six-figure price, according to John Todaro, research head at institutional trading platform TradeBlock, who told Cointelegraph:The parabolic advance required to propel Bitcoin to such heights would also place BTC firmly in the same category as gold — as a bonafide store of asset value. Several proponents of the popular cryptocurrency already identify BTC as a suitable hedge against monetary debasement and other forms of economic uncertainty.Amid interest rate cuts back in 2019, Travis Kling, founder and chief investment officer of Ikigai Asset Management, warned that the prevailing debt situation at the time was a recipe for another global financial crisis. According to Kling, central banks were propping up growth metrics to portray the impression of a healthy economy. When Kling made these comments, the world was yet untouched by the coronavirus pandemic.Bitcoin featured frequently in the discussions around possible safe-haven assets that could be used as a hedge against another global recession. Amid the COVID-19 panic of selling off assets, BTC did not escape the massive liquidation of Black Thursday, proving that it has not yet achieved that coveted status. The largest crypto by market capitalization crashed by almost 50%, bottoming out at about $3,800. However, in exactly eight months since then, BTC’s price is up over 300%.Commenting on the possibility of Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high in the short term, Todaro remarked that it will be tough to establish a sustained push toward the record before the end of 2020, adding further: “This bull cycle should bring us well beyond prior ATHs on a longer-term basis and with government spending increasing and the May halving behind us, we are set up for one of the most attractive bullish periods in Bitcoin’s history.”Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of crypto hedge fund BitBull Capital, also sees Bitcoin setting a new all-time high during this current bull run, telling Cointelegraph: “It is very likely [that Bitcoin reaches a new all-time high] since Bitcoin has now crossed $16,000, which was a key resistance level. $20,000 is not that far off from this point unless any major negative developments impact the market in the short-term.”While inflation remains a real concern for many countries, 2020 has been a pivotal year for Bitcoin in terms of supply dynamics. The May halving event saw the supply of new Bitcoin cut by half.Meanwhile, several governments in response to the economic strain induced by COVID-19 adopted proactive monetary policies including stimulus cash injections. According to World Bank estimates, global gross domestic product is expected to decrease by 5.2% in 2020 — the largest contraction in decades. Back in June, the World Bank outlined a roadmap for countries to navigate the economic problems, stating:Recognizing the declining value of cash holdings, some companies are already pivoting to Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Nasdaq-listed MicroStrategy made headlines back in August when it announced the acquisition of 21,454 BTC — valued at $250 million at the time. More interest from big traditional institutions followed soon as they sought to buy into Bitcoin as a means of reserve.Related: The next big treasure: Corporations buy up Bitcoin as a treasury reserveThe business intelligence firm doubled down on its Bitcoin adoption policy with an additional 16,796-BTC ($175 million) purchase in September. In less than two months, the company has seen the value of its BTC holdings grow by over $160 million. Similar things could be said of other non-crypto native companies that bought up BTC as a reserve.While Bitcoin retains certain characteristics pertaining to currencies, the lack of supply caps for fiat makes any attempts to draw comparisons between both somewhat problematic. If so, perhaps market capitalization makes for a better parameter in gauging Bitcoin’s growth vis-à-vis the size of other major asset bases, as DiPasquale stated:In a speech delivered on Nov. 6, Jerome Powell, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, downplayed expectation of a swift recovery from the current economic contraction: “The current economic downturn is the most severe in our lifetime. It will take a while to get back to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the beginning of this year.”Powell’s remarks echo similar warnings from the World Bank and other financial establishments. Indeed, the overwhelming consensus is that the confluence of global, regional and national economic constraints exacerbated by COVID-19 will be difficult to overturn in the short to medium term.Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer recently announced that its COVID-19 vaccine was over 90% effective in preventing the virus. While the development constitutes a bit of good news in the fight against the pandemic, market analysts say the economy is destined for a downward path regardless of a vaccine.Todaro believes that “equity markets are pricing in the COVID-19 vaccine as a savior to industrials and in-person retail companies.” However, he did add that good news alone will not kickstart economic recovery as supply and demand dynamics will need to be reestablished. Furthermore, according to Todaro, various established firms are in dire financial situations, and without additional relief by governments, they are likely to go bankrupt: “This uncertainty is starting to come back some now, with equities markets seeing a pullback.”With more pain ahead, Bitcoin appears primed to receive even greater institutional attention as big-money players look for alternative investment vehicles. Indeed, the flow of smart money into Bitcoin already has some stakeholders predicting that BTC will challenge gold as the de facto hedge asset of choice for institutional investors."
552,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has seen volatility within the past 12 hours. The top cryptocurrency fell from $16,400 to $15,750 within hours, rejecting sharply after surpassing the $16,000 resistance earlier this week.As of Nov. 14, the 20-day moving average of Bitcoin on the daily chart is at $14,600. In the near term, if a pullback occurs, the $14.6K level remains a favorable area for buyers.An algorithmic trader known as “CryptoGainz” explained that the current market structure of Bitcoin likely caused a sell-off to occur. The trader pinpointed the abundance of sell orders at $16.5K that did not subside as BTC hit $16,400.This could indicate that the sell orders at that level are not spoofed orders. Hence, it could show that sellers are genuinely attempting to take profit on BTC at around $16,500.When traders or bots try to spoof the Bitcoin market, they place fake orders at key support or resistance levels.For instance, if traders place large spoof orders near a resistance level, there is a chance that buyers would not push through the resistance. Hence, spoofing could be used to artificially pump up or restrict a market’s momentum.The “asks” or sell orders above $16,500 have not disappeared during the recent BTC rally. Considering this, the probability that $16.5K would act as a heavy resistance level in the near term remains high.When BTC was hovering at around $16,200 before the Bitcoin price drop occurred, the pseudonymous trader explained:The trader noted that algorithms could move to “hunt” stops of long contracts if it is profitable to do so. Based on the rapid decline of BTC in a short period, that is likely what happened as BTC dropped below $15,800. The trader added:The outlook of Bitcoin among traders and analysts remains mixed. Some traders say a deep pullback to the $12,000 to $13,000 range is inevitable, if not healthy, during this bull run.Cantering Clark, a Bitcoin trader, said a $13K retest could occur despite the strong momentum of BTC. He wrote:"
553,"If you talk about Bitcoin (BTC) mining, you have to talk about China. China has become a giant in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem with major mines and pools, quick, cheap labor and a majority control of the world’s hashing power. So, should you go set up a mining operation there? Do the pros outweigh the cons? Is China actually a threat to the Bitcoin ecosystem? Let’s look at the state of Chinese mining.In the beginning of Bitcoin, you could simply mine from your laptop or set up a few miners in your home to run the hashing algorithm. But as more miners started turning on and the Bitcoin mining difficulty rose, higher levels of computing power and electricity was needed to solve the equations and reap the reward.Only a finite amount of Bitcoin can be mined — 21 million tokens — so as time goes on, it will get harder and harder to mine them. Miners continue to need better and faster hardware, which requires more electricity. Today, mining operations are moving to large data centers where thousands of miners run day and night.Related: How to mine Bitcoin: Everything you need to knowWhy mention all of this? Because when mining at a large scale, electricity costs, labor costs, the speed of acquiring new hardware and sustainability come into play if generating profit is the goal — and China has the advantage in nearly all of these areas.At the end of 2019, China produced nearly two-thirds of the world’s hashing power. Even though cryptocurrency usage and exchanges are reportedly banned in China and Bitcoin mining was once in danger of being shut down, the government took an about-face and is increasingly embracing the use of blockchain technology in its major industries — and allowing Bitcoin mining to grow.Related: US Bitcoin holders worry about Chinese control of the mining networkBitcoin mining in China is a growing industry because labor costs are cheap, turn-around time is incredibly quick, and lead time and production costs are much lower, since the country is a hub for global trade. Since much of the hardware used to mine Bitcoin is made in China, miners can very quickly be upgraded. If you want to set up a data center fast with low overhead and expenses, do it in China.Low electricity costs in the form of hydropower are available as well. Because Bitcoin mining requires so much electricity between powering the miners and powering the fans to cool the miners, a data center needs to get electricity as cheaply as possible. Hydropower in the Sichuan province is reportedly as low as $0.02 per kWh during the rainy season, and the Chinese government is now encouraging mining in this province so operations can take advantage of the hydropower plants there.Related: Sichuan rainy season to give Bitcoin hash rate a much needed joltBut only some Chinese mining operations run on cleaner, cheaper hydropower. Most run instead on coal, which is a dirtier and more expensive option. Of the main power sources today, hydro is the cheapest, at around $0.01 to $0.02 per kWh, with wind being another cheap option at $0.025 cents per kwh. Gas and coal are the more expensive options, at $0.03 to $0.035 cents (plus transmission costs and taxes). So, while labor and materials may be cheap, coal usage makes mining operations unsustainable from both a cost perspective and environmental perspective. Factor in the political instability of setting up mining operations in China, and you may want to look elsewhere.Anyone wanting to set up scaled mining operations are increasingly seeking out locations in Nordic countries, Canada and the United States. While these locations may offer higher start-up expenses and maintenance costs, the availability of sustainable, cost-effective electricity is proving to be a big advantage. Additionally, these areas are more politically stable, so there is less threat that the government will one day decide to shut down all mining operations. In fact, Canada deemed mining operations as “essential services” during its COVID-19 pandemic shutdown.Related: Regulatory overview of crypto mining in different countriesThis may be the reason why the world’s hashing power is shifting locations. According to a recent report, Chinese hashing power is decreasing compared with last year yet growing in other parts of the world.Another reason for this decrease may be that Chinese mining was hit hard in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains, causing new hardware to be significantly delayed in getting to data centers. In an industry where every minute counts, using slower, older miners for even a day longer means losing money and advantage. Additionally, China’s quarantine rules prevented workers from tending to their rigs, further disrupting operations.Additionally, the third Bitcoin halving occurred this past May, cutting the mining reward in half and forcing miners to make significant upgrades to their hardware to stay competitive. Because it now takes twice as much hashing power to mine the same amount of Bitcoin as a year ago, mining operations have needed to not only upgrade, but make sure their energy costs were staying efficient. Following the halving, many miners around the world switched off because the endeavor was no longer profitable.On top of it all, this summer’s monsoon season caused excessive flooding in the Sichuan province, leading to electrical shortages that cut up to 20% of the region’s hash rate.Despite these significant setbacks, mining in China is sure to bounce back. But with other parts of the world embracing and encouraging Bitcoin mining, and with the greater sustainability offered elsewhere, we may soon see China’s place as the giant of the industry challenged.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
554," The year 2020 sucked for pretty much everyone. Unless you’re holding Bitcoin (BTC) that is.The price of Bitcoin is up 125% year-to-date, making it once again the best-performing asset just as it has been for the past decade. Strangely enough, the public seems completely oblivious to this fact. But not everyone is ignoring Bitcoin’s latest rally above $16,000. Currently, the price is just 20% shy of its all-time high. Considering the impressive year Bitcoin is having, it’s not surprising that Wall Street is now starting to realize that the world’s first decentralized cryptocurrency isn’t going anywhere.Remember 2017? That historic Bitcoin price rally was largely driven by retail traders — the average Joe — who were anticipating a Wall Street stampede alongside the frenzy of new tokens minted via initial coin offerings.  At the same time, the CME introduced their cash-settled Bitcoin futures right at the peak in December 2017 and... pop!BTC price dropped sharply in the following months and the hype fizzled into a multi-year bear market. Obituaries from the news media made the average Joe eat the loss, and many wrote Bitcoin off as just another bubble that burst.Google searches for “Bitcoin” pretty much tell the whole story.But in 2020, the public searches for Bitcoin no longer reflect BTC as its price has “decoupled.”What’s more interesting is that even Wall Street still remains largely on the sidelines suggesting that BTC may be very undervalued at $16,000 and with a market cap of $297 billion. However, the latest data suggests that this is already beginning to change. “Wall Street is not here yet,” Gemini exchange co-founder Cameron Winklevoss explained last month. Winklevoss added:As Cointelegraph reported earlier this month, it is mainly wealthy areas in New York and Silicon Valley — home to many high-net-worth individuals — that are most interested in Bitcoin right now. But while the public is largely unaware, several wealthy investors are heralding BTC as a new asset class. Paul Tudor Jones, Michael Saylor and Stanley Druckenmiller have made waves in 2020, revealing their positions in Bitcoin. Do they realize something that the public did not in 2017? Was the average Joe simply too early then?Jones said investing in BTC is like investing early in Apple stock. Saylor stated that his company, MicroStrategy, which bought up a total of $425 million in Bitcoin, will hold it for 100 years calling it “the world's best collateral.”Meanwhile, Druckenmiller, the latest big-name Bitcoin convert, now argues that “If the gold bet works, the Bitcoin bet will probably work better.”Together, these smart money investors are beginning to realize one thing. As Tyler Winklevoss put it: Gold is up just 23% in 2020 during a year of global economic upheaval, which is when this safe-haven metal was supposed to shine (pun intended). But Bitcoin, or “digital gold,” has been stealing the show by gaining 125% year-to-date and up by almost 300% from its coronavirus-crash lows in March. What’s more, BTC’s market cap is just 2.36% of gold’s, which some long-term investors see as the best asymmetric risk-reward ratio bet in history.Individuals who bought Bitcoin 10 or even five years ago would most likely agree. With its fixed supply, Bitcoin is becoming particularly attractive as a hedge against inflation, which is all but guaranteed by the United States Federal Reserve. But unlike gold, Bitcoin is absolutely scarce. Its supply is mathematically fixed and cannot be changed by any authority. What’s more, the rate at which new BTC is mined is reduced by 50% every four years, which analysts argue is one of the biggest catalysts for new bull market cycles. This event is called the halving, with the last one occurring in May 2020. Cryptocurrency trader Michaël van de Poppe believes that the Bitcoin market is now exiting the Stealth Phase and entering the Awareness Phase. No longer is BTC just digital money for buying drugs on the dark web. According to van de Poppe:In addition to the halving, the aforementioned investors have also noticed that BTC’s fundamentals, network activity, and on-ramp infrastructure (e.g. Cash App, PayPal) have all significantly improved since 2017. So it’s not surprising that this emerging asset class is starting to look like a no-brainer bet to smart money. Other investors will also eventually realize that a small allocation of capital into Bitcoin significantly boosts portfolio returns. Last month, the co-founder of 10T Holdings, Dan Tapiero, noted:At this rate, investment fund clients will begin asking questions such as: Why is my nephew’s Bitcoin stash outperforming my 401K, FAANG stocks, gold, and Warren Buffett put together? How do I gain exposure to Bitcoin?But what makes Bitcoin truly unique is that it doesn’t play by Wall Street’s rules. It’s software with its own set of rules. It is not a stock or an IPO. It’s a technology that’s open to all and voluntary to use. It has early adopters, not insiders. It has market cycles, not bailouts. It has existed for over a decade and grows stronger by the day. Despite already existing for nearly 12 years, Bitcoin is only now starting to be noticed and taken seriously by serious investors. At the same time, it maintains the lowest barrier to entry for everyone else compared to traditional finance. This is precisely why Bitcoin still presents a unique opportunity for the average Joe: to acquire BTC now at lower prices than what Wall Street will pay for it later.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

555,"Data shows that Bitcoin’s (BTC) current rally is supported by greater participation from retail and institutional investors. The CME Bitcoin futures open interest has moved closer to the previous all-time high, a sign that institutional investors are becoming more interested in cryptocurrencies. Similarly, Bitcoin’s spot volume has hit a new 52-week high, according to data from Arcane research. However, during strong uptrends, traders tend to get greedy and take on excessive leverage. Hence, large open interest on derivatives could act as a double-edged sword because even a small decline in Bitcoin could force the highly leveraged traders to close their positions. Such a move could have a cascading effect that could lead to long liquidation.While traders should be cautious, there is no need to panic as yet because the current up-move in Bitcoin has happened without any euphoria or frenzy, especially among retail traders.Moreover, several analysts have been skeptical of the rally, which is another positive sign. The top usually forms when the last bear in the market turns bullish and there is no one left to buy.This does not mean that there will be no corrections along the way. Pullbacks are necessary to periodically shake out the weak hands and this generally improves the longevity of the trend.Let’s analyze the top-10 cryptocurrencies to ascertain whether the uptrend will continue or is a correction around the corner.The bulls pushed Bitcoin (BTC) above the $16,000 overhead resistance on Nov. 12. This breakout started the next leg of the uptrend that may carry the price to the critical overhead resistance at $17,200.The upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index in the overbought territory suggest that the bulls are in command. If the momentum can carry the price above $17,200, then the bulls will have a clear shot at the all-time highs.However, traders can get cautious if the pair turns down from the current levels and drops below $16,000 once again. This will suggest that the market participants have rejected higher levels.If the price sustains below $16,000, the bears will try to sink the BTC/USD pair below the 20-day exponential moving average ($14,596). Such a move will indicate that bulls are not buying the dips as the sentiment has turned negative.The bulls are finding it difficult to propel Ether (ETH) above the resistance line of the rising wedge pattern. However, the positive thing is that the bulls have not given up much ground.The bulls will again attempt to thrust the price above the wedge. If they can do that, the ETH/USD pair may rise to $488.134. The bears may again try to stall the up-move at this resistance. If they succeed, a drop to the 20-day EMA ($426) is possible.Conversely, if the bulls can push the price above $488.134, the next leg of the uptrend is likely to begin. The first target on the upside is $520 and then $550. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 67 suggest that bears are in command.The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could result in a drop to the support line of the wedge.XRP has been consolidating near the $0.26 overhead resistance for the past two days. This suggests that the bulls are not closing their positions in a hurry as they expect the price to break above the range.The rising moving averages and the RSI above 59 suggest that bulls are in control. A breakout and close above $0.26 could start the journey to $0.30. Above this level, the up-move may reach $0.326113.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls again fail to sustain the price above $0.26, then the bears will try to pull the price back below the moving averages. If they succeed, the XRP/USD pair may drop to $0.2295.The bulls failed to push and sustain Chainlink (LINK) above $13.28 on Nov. 11. This shows that the bears are aggressively defending this resistance. However, the positive thing is that the bulls have not given up much ground in the past two days.The bulls are currently attempting to drive the price above $13.28. If they manage to do that, the LINK/USD pair will complete an inverse head and shoulders pattern that has a target objective of $19.2731.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI has risen above 58. This suggests a minor advantage to the bulls.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair turns down from $13.28 once again, the bears will try to pull the price down to $9.7665. A break below this support will invalidate the bullish pattern.The bulls purchased the dip below the 20-day EMA ($257) on Nov. 12 but could not sustain the higher levels. This has attracted selling by the bears and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has broken below the 20-day EMA.If the bears sink the price below the 50-day simple moving average ($247), the BCH/USD pair could drop to the next support at $231. The bulls have defended this support on two previous occasions, hence, a break below it may intensify selling and drag the price to $200.However, the 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is close to the midpoint, which suggests a few more days of range-bound action. The momentum could pick up if the bulls push the price above $280 or the bears sink the price below $231.Litecoin (LTC) has surged above the $64 resistance today, which shows that the bulls have overpowered the bears. The buyers will now try to sustain the momentum and drive the price above $68.9008.If they succeed, the next leg of the uptrend could begin. The next target is $80 and then a rally to $100 is possible. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 67 suggest bulls are in charge.Contrary to this assumption, if the price again turns down from the current levels and plummets below $64, it will suggest a lack of buyers at higher levels. Such a move could attract profit booking that may result in a drop to the 20-day EMA ($57.86).Binance Coin (BNB) is currently stuck in a tight range between $28.97 and $27.30. The altcoin bounced off the support of this range on Nov. 12 and the bulls will now try to push the price above the moving averages.If they succeed, the BNB/USD pair could rise to $30 and a break above this resistance may open the gates for a rally to $32.However, the downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a minor advantage to the bears.If the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below $27.30, the pair may drop to $25.6652. A break below this support will signal weakness.Polkadot (DOT) turned down from $4.63 on Nov. 11 and the bears attempted to sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($4.31) on Nov. 12 but failed. This shows that bulls are defending the moving averages.The 20-day EMA is rising gradually and the RSI is above 55, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand. However, the buyers will have to sustain the price above the immediate resistance at $4.50 to increase the possibility of a move to $4.95.Contrary to this assumption, if the DOT/USD pair again turns down from $4.50 or $4.63, the bears will try to sink the price below the moving averages. If they succeed, the pair could drop to the $3.80 support.After the bulls failed to push Cardano (ADA) higher on Nov. 10 and 11, the bears tried to sink the price below the moving averages on Nov. 12 but could not. The altcoin has currently rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($0.102) and the bulls are attempting to push the price to $0.1142241.The moving averages are rising and the RSI is in the positive zone, suggesting an advantage to the bulls. The ADA/USD pair could pick up momentum after the bulls push the price above $0.1142241.However, if the pair turns down from the current levels and plunges below the moving averages, the bears will try to pull the price down to the $0.0893 support.The next trending move may start after the bulls push the price above $0.1142241 or the bears sink the price below $0.0893.The bulls have failed to propel Bitcoin SV (BSV) above the 20-day EMA ($162) in the past three days. This suggests a lack of urgency among the bulls to buy at the current levels.The 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, which suggests a minor advantage to the bears.If the sellers can sink the price below the immediate support at $154.66, the BSV/USD pair could drop to the $146 support.This negative view will be invalidated if the bulls can push the price above the moving averages and the downtrend line. Such a move will increase the possibility of a rally to $181.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

556,"This week, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) prices reached new highs as a slew of bullish news continued to pump investors’ hope that the next crypto-bull market will mirror the one seen in 2017. Many novice traders simply follow spot prices on the major crypto exchanges to gauge the direction price might take. However, reviewing options markets data can provide additional relevant insights on market sentiment.Looking at the most recent activity in Bitcoin options, it is clear that some trades occurred on strikes that seemed improbable even for the most bullish analysts. These trades include 20 BTC CME December call options with a $70,000 strike and the 56 BTC worth of $100,000 December strikes at LedgerX.These anecdotal trades might not reflect the broader market conditions, but oddly enough, the highest Ether options contract for December 2020 stands at $1,120. This trade is undoubtedly bullish considering there are only 42 days left until expiry, but not even close to the BTC options pending 330% upside or higher.It is worth noting that Deribit also holds Ether call options for March 2021, with strikes trading up to $1,600. Although this effect might have been caused by the Ethereum 2.0 launch date on Dec. 1, its upside stands at 230%. This is considerably lower than Bitcoin’s options.As the data above shows, out of the $613 million in Ether options open interest, a mere 28% stands at $460 and higher. This situation can be partially explained by the 23% rally that occurred over the past 10 days, indicating that traders were not expecting these prices.It’s also important to remember that options until March 2021 are listed on most exchanges. Therefore, some optimism ought to be expected for the more distant dates. Buying options for prices way above the market level is relatively cheap. The $600 ETH call option for January 2021 was trading at $12 just two weeks ago.When comparing this data to the Bitcoin options markets, there’s a striking difference. BTC options are remarkably more bullish, and there are $50K call options that were placed long ago for June and December 2021.Take notice how, unlike Ether markets, there are some massive bets above $17,000. This time around, 40% out of the $3.75 billion BTC options open interest stands at $16,000 and above.Bitcoin price has increased by 18.5% over the past 10 days, so these optimistic bets would have seemed even more unrealistic back then. Thus, the recent ETH rally shouldn’t be an excuse for the lack of over-optimistic option trades.Consequently, one can only conclude that Ether traders were not as bullish as Bitcoin traders. Investors may infer that this is a good thing, as unrealistic expectations might frustrate investors.Nevertheless, Ether investors’ lack of appetite in willing to bet $17 for a 25% bull run until Dec. 25 is telling.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
557,"Data shows that institutions heavily accumulated Bitcoin in the $12,000–$15,000 range, and according to analysts at Whalemap, this is a positive trend because institutions and whales typically accumulate assets with a longer-term investment strategy in mind.The fact that larger hands are accumulating BTC instead of retail investors also explains the somewhat suppressed mainstream interest in Bitcoin, as Cointelegraph previously reported. Various metrics, including Google Trends, have shown lackluster mainstream demand for BTC despite its parabolic rally in recent months.Whalemap analysts described the recent spike in demand for Bitcoin from whales as “institutional FOMO.”FOMO, short for ""fear of missing out,"" refers to a trend wherein investors increasingly buy into an asset fearing it will continuously surge. Referring to a chart showing whale clusters and inflows into whale wallets, the analysts said:Whale clusters emerge when whale addresses — addresses that hold over 10,000 BTC — buy Bitcoin and do not move it for prolonged periods of time.This shows that whales plan to hold their most recent BTC purchases in their personal wallets. Whalemap analysts said:The aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin from whales likely occurred based on two key trends that have been present in the cryptocurrency market since October.First, there has been a sharp reduction in short-contract liquidations throughout the recent rally. In previous rallies, when BTC broke out, upward of $100 million worth of contracts were liquidated on major exchanges. This shows that the rally was not a short squeeze but an actual accumulation phase.Second, the spot market has been leading the derivatives market, not vice versa. When the price of BTC was increasing, the funding rate of BTC was rarely over the average 0.01%.The low funding rate shows that the futures market has not been majority long, demonstrating that the demand came from elsewhere.Atop the heightened involvement of whales and institutions, overall trading volume has substantially increased in the recent rally.Data from Santiment, an on-chain market analysis firm, also shows Bitcoin volume at around $31 billion and this is much higher than on Jan. 6, 2018. At the time, BTC price also was hovering at around $16,350.Santiment analysts found that the ongoing rally has more volume behind it than the 2017 rally. The analysts wrote:As Cointelegraph reported, the roadblock in the near term for Bitcoin remains whether whales will sell at the $17,000 resistance. Some analysts say that there is no clear resistance until the $18,500–$20,000 range, which means an all-time high could be much closer than most expect."
558,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed $16,000 with relative ease on Nov. 13 and has remained resilient above it. Analysts are divided on the short-term outlook on BTC because the momentum remains strong but there are concerns of an overheated rally. But there are numerous positive developments that could continue to sustain the uptrend of BTC.Generally, the cryptocurrency market has seen an increase in trading activity across all types of exchanges. Spot, derivatives, and institutional markets have all seen a noticeable spike in demand from investors. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Denis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto exchange and broker Bequant, said the overall uptick in trading volume is positive:The substantial increase in the trading volume of the cryptocurrency market has been a critical catalyst for Bitcoin throughout the recent rally. On-chain market analysis platforms, such as CryptoQuant, have reported large deposits by whales. This means that high-net-worth investors have increasingly sold BTC in the past week as its price exceeded $16,000. Still, the dominant cryptocurrency was able to sustain its momentum and rise to as high as $16,480 on Nov. 13.A large uptick in trading volume and consistent inflow of stablecoins into exchanges typically mean that the demand for Bitcoin is rising. As such, there is a strong possibility that the main impetus for the BTC rally above $16,000 was the high trading activity and newly emerging appetite for BTC from stablecoin inflows. Following the breakout above $16,000, analysts are generally bullish, particularly toward the medium-term trend of BTC. However, some remain cautious around the immediate effects.The price of Bitcoin has only been above $16,300 for 12 days throughout its history. Looking at on-chain data, analysts at IntoTheBlock noted that there is little resistance between $16,300 and $18,750. If BTC rallies toward $18,750 in the near term, that would leave a minor gap until a new all-time high above $20,000.In the near term, based on market orders and on-chain levels, the analysts said that the $15,170 area would likely emerge as the new support area. The firm found that 860,000 addresses bought 465,000 BTC near that level, which would mark it as critical support. This means that if BTC remains comfortably above $15,170, it would strengthen the foundation for the next bull run. But if it drops below it, there is a possibility for a deep pullback.While the on-chain and technical factors favor an overextended Bitcoin rally, traders have also expressed concerns. Above $16,000, the road toward a new record high is considerably straightforward. As such, traders anticipate that sellers will try to suppress the price at around $16,000, causing a consolidation phase to emerge.But technical analysts state that the momentum of Bitcoin might simply be too strong to see a sharp pullback. Kevin Svenson, a chartist who uses Cryptowatch, said that buyers with FOMO — the fear of missing out — might have taken over the market. The upside momentum of BTC is strengthening, especially as it continues to see a staircase rally.Svenson noted that BTC could see a rejection in the future. Still, the analyst said that BTC might reach $17,000 to $18,000 before a pullback occurs: “#Bitcoin is just floating upward. FOMO buyers have taken over the market... keep in mind. We may be entering an area of ‘over exuberance’ ... expect a rejection back down to crush FOMO buyers.”Other traders have similarly said that the dip Bitcoin saw on Nov. 12 to sub-$15,500 might have been “the dip.” After reaching $15,965, BTC suddenly declined by nearly 4% to $15,440. After the pullback, BTC made a run back to $16,000 and then proceeded to cleanly break out of the dreaded resistance level. Based on this price action, a pseudonymous trader known as ""Loma"" said that a large pullback in the short term is likely. The trader noted: “Guess that was the dip. I don’t think it makes sense to test $15,800 area again.”The short-term bearish scenario for Bitcoin still revolves around a positive market sentiment. Analysts still anticipate BTC to rally toward the end of the year, but in the immediate term, they expect a pullback because historically, BTC has seen corrections throughout prolonged bull cycles. In 2017, as an example, when BTC rallied toward $20,000, it regularly saw rejections of 20% to 30%.Michaël van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said that Bitcoin is in the “disbelief phase.” Short-sellers and skeptics are increasingly betting against BTC as it reaches toward its record high. Yet, Poppe pinpointed the likelihood of 20%–30% corrections during uptrends. If these pullbacks occur, they could present great opportunities, he explained:Josh Olszewicz, a Bitcoin technical analyst, referred to the Ichimoku Cloud indicator to point out that BTC is well above the cloud. This indicates that BTC is likely overbought and has rallied far beyond its support levels on higher time frame charts. The analyst said the $13,200 level would remain an area of interest for buyers.A variable for Bitcoin's price trend in the foreseeable future is the unusually low amount of short-contract liquidations. For instance, when BTC surpassed $16,000 on Nov. 13, only around $13 million worth of short liquidations were recorded on Bitfinex and BitMEX. Binance Futures and other exchanges also saw relatively low short liquidations compared with previous cycles.Vinokourov believes that the lackluster short liquidations could mean that the Bitcoin market is in a healthier position. It signifies that short squeezes are not the main catalyst for the BTC rally. Rather, genuine spot market demand and institutional appetite could be causing the price of Bitcoin to increase. When the market is less dependent on the futures market, which supports high leverage, BTC is less vulnerable to volatility spikes to the downside, as Vinokourov noted:The combination of Bitcoin’s declining dependence on the derivatives market, the clear breach of the $16,000 resistance level, and various on-chain data points that confirm $15,170 as an important support level for BTC raises the probability of a broader rally. At the same time, due to the historical tendencies of BTC to see large pullbacks even amid parabolic rallies, traders are preparing for potential sharp drops to buy the dip. Regardless, the medium-term prospect of BTC remains positive, especially heading into the year-end."
559,"Once the coronavirus pandemic is over and lockdown restrictions end, there’s one thing that will be a priority for many of us: booking a vacation.But here’s the problem — many hotel rooms are charged at eye-watering prices, with some travel websites serving as middlemen and adding hefty commissions in the process.Now, Electroneum has announced that its native digital asset can be used as a payment method on LockTrip, a site that allows globetrotters to discover secret travel deals and save up to 60% on the cost of their holiday.The crypto payments firm says it is constantly looking for new use cases for ETN, a cryptocurrency that is used by millions of people worldwide. Electroneum already allows ETN owners to top-up their electricity meters with this digital currency, and add credit to smartphones.Given how LockTrip enables its customers to book more than 2.1 million properties and flights from over 1,000 airlines in 190 countries, the partnership is set to give Electroneum’s community far more choice than what’s offered on other crypto-focused travel sites. “Electroneum is experiencing real adoption of ETN from other blockchain and crypto projects who have seen the benefits of using our crypto both for its unique instant payment system as well as its very large and engaged community,” CEO Richard Ells told Cointelegraph. “We are growing very fast. After our partnership with LockTrip, ETN is accepted by over two million businesses worldwide.”The collaboration is also good news for users of AnyTask, Electroneum’s platform for freelancers, who will have a new way to spend their earnings and treat themselves with a much-needed break away from the world of work.According to Electroneum, using cryptocurrencies to book a holiday can unlock benefits that many of us may not have thought of.First, there’s the issue of the fees charged by credit and debit card providers. The platform says transacting with ETN is far less expensive than the likes of Visa and Mastercard, meaning vacationers have a bigger budget for cocktails on the beach. Crypto can also help consumers avoid punishing exchange rates when paying for reservations that are denominated in a fiat currency different to their own.In many cases, these crypto payments can be completed by simply scanning a QR code — and this can be far safer than manually inputting credit and debit card details, too. Some LockTrip users have even claimed that they were able to secure hotel rooms that were listed as sold out elsewhere.Electroneum says that it is the first crypto startup to directly enter into a partnership with LockTrip. Now, ETN will be offered as a payment method alongside other cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum.To offer a concrete example of how LockTrip compares against fiat-focused brands, the Electroneum team performed some research. They found that using crypto instead of a debit card to reserve 14 nights at an airport hotel would save about $15 — and better still, LockTrip’s quoted price for the accommodation was $52 less than Hotels.com and Skyscanner when paying with crypto and $38 less if paying with debit or credit card.Some may wonder how LockTrip manages to offer such competitive discounts, given the old saying that there’s no such thing as a free lunch. But the travel platform is transparent about its approach — saying that it works directly with leading suppliers to secure the best deals and pursues an organic growth approach instead of relying on expensive marketing budgets.“We don't pressure-sell with warnings like 'only one room left' or present our members' special deals that are not special. We believe that respect starts with honesty,” LockTrip said.The company also allows customers and property owners to connect with each other directly. Given how popular websites such as Airbnb and Booking.com can charge accommodation providers commission of up to 30%, its approach can deliver savings to travelers while simultaneously delivering healthier profit margins for businesses.Disclaimer.

560,"With Joe Biden poised to be the next president of the United States, Cointelegraph Consulting reflects on how traditional assets have responded to the election of a Democratic candidate. Historically, Democrats have been bullish for gold, as the common perception is that more unbacked money gets printed under Democratic leadership, further debasing the dollar. In the short term, Bitcoin (BTC) has already strongly benefited, increasing by 10% since election day so far.The latest findings by Santiment, published in Cointelegraph Consulting’s biweekly newsletter, indicate that long-term Bitcoin holders’ average profits are sitting at a 14-month high, increasing the likelihood that they may exit the positions and take profit.Market Value to Realised Value, or the MVRV ratio, is an indicator that tracks the average profit or loss of a certain group of holders in an effort to understand whether they are in a position to sell at a profit. Shortly after breaking $15,000 on Nov. 5, Bitcoin’s 30-day MVRV ratio — or the average ROI of all addresses that have acquired BTC in the past 30 days — shot up by 18.8%, indicating that short-term BTC holders were averaging close to 20% profit on their initial investment.Other on-chain metrics show that Bitcoin whales have been accumulating BTC in the run-up to the latest push past $15,000. The collective balance of addresses holding 10 to 100 BTC hit a 6-month bottom on Sept. 20 before starting to bounce back, and has grown by 37,800 BTC since, implying renewed confidence in the asset.Other news from around the legislative and enterprise blockchain world showed  one of China’s largest banks launching a new blockchain-based bond that uses tokenized certificates.

561,"Belarusbank, the largest financial institution in Belarus, is reportedly launching a cryptocurrency exchange service.According to a Nov. 12 report by local news agency Prime Press, Belarusbank is rolling out a service allowing users to exchange cryptocurrency using a Visa payment card. As reported, the new service enables trading crypto against fiat currencies like the Belarusian ruble as well as the United States dollar and the euro.Belarusbank executives reportedly said that the launch of the new crypto service comes in line with the company’s digital transformation program that was announced a few years ago.The new service is reportedly available to citizens of Belarus and Russia. The bank is also planning to extend the list of countries supporting the service as well as the list of supported cryptocurrencies in the near future, the report notes.According to the report, the new feature is a result of Belarusbank’s partnership with local crypto payment operator Whitebird. Prior to introducing the new service, the two companies reportedly partnered to jointly explore the crypto industry in 2018.Belarusbank is apparently one of the first banks in Belarus pushing its own crypto service. The bank initially announced its plans to set up a crypto exchange in early 2019.The development of crypto business in Belarus has been encouraged by local crypto-friendly regulation. As previously reported, Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko signed a draft decree legalizing the use of digital currencies in late 2017."
562,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been highly volatile in recent weeks, rallying above $16,000 for the first time in three years. But the futures market’s open interest indicates that a large volatility spike is likely very close.The term “open interest” refers to the total sum of contracts that are actively open in the futures market. If the open interest is high, it means there is a high number of traders betting on Bitcoin price action.Currently, as of Nov. 13, Bitazu Capital founding partner Mohit Sorout pointed out that the open interest of Bitcoin futures is at an all-time high. This means that the chances of heightened volatility in the near term should not come as a surprise.Sorout said that the “liquidation fest” has not started, referring to Bitcoin’s tendency to see cascading liquidations following large price movements. He said:Bitcoin futures contracts typically offer high leverage of up to 125x. Traders can gain access to anywhere between 1x to 125x leverage depending on the platform.When the leverage of a position is high, it means the liquidation price is closer to the entry price. As an example, if a trader places a 20x Bitcoin long at $16,300. With a 20x leverage, a trader can trade $200,000 with $10,000 worth of capital.But the high leverage means that the liquidation price ranger is tighter. In the case of the 20x long at $16,300, if BTC drops below $15,600, the position would get liquidated.If a position gets liquidated with a stop-loss in place, the trade would wipe out the entire position. Hence, if a $10,000 long ($200,000 position) on 20x gets liquidated, then $10,000 would be lost completely.As such, when a major price movement occurs and the open interest of the futures market is high, Bitcoin tends to see massive volatility spikes.Whether this trend would have a positive or a negative impact on Bitcoin’s near-term price cycle remains uncertain. If long contracts get squeezed, then the BTC price drops, and if short contracts get liquidated, it increases.Across major futures exchanges, the average funding rate of Bitcoin is 0.01%. This means that the market is relatively balanced, and neither buyers nor sellers are overwhelming the market.The rest of the Bitcoin derivatives market is similarly seeing an increase in trading activity and open interest.Deribit, the top cryptocurrency options exchange, shared Skew’s chart showing total Bitcoin options open interest also reached a record high in the past few days.The timing of the options market’s open interest soaring is noteworthy because theoretically, options open interest should peak toward the end of the month.The monthly BTC options contracts expire on the fourth Friday of each month, and as such, open interest tends to spike in the last week of every month.But, as Cointelegraph reported, data shows that bulls are not fazed by the upcoming $525 million options expiry. As long as BTC remains above $15,500, the large options expiry won’t likely have a major impact on the price."
563,"The Bitcoin (BTC) price, which is currently sitting at $16,320, has only been at this level or higher for 12 days in the coin’s entire 4,332-day history, representing just 0.28% of the cryptocurrency’s life.Crypto analytics platform Messari published data stating that the closing price had exceeded $16,320 only on 12 other days, 10 of which occurred from Dec. 7 to 20 in 2017, with the highest close occurring on Dec. 16 at $19,378. Any investor who bought at the all-time high of $20,089 would still be down 18.35%. In contrast, investors who bought at this cycle’s low of $3,126 on Dec. 15, 2018, would be up 424%.Of the other top 10 coins, only Chainlink (LINK) comes remotely close to Bitcoin, with the coin sitting above the current price of $12.70 for 2.7% of its life.By contrast, the majority of altcoins are yet to enter proportionally rare price ranges. Ether’s (ETH) current price of $464 has been exceeded 201 days in the past, representing more than 10% of the entire 1,933 days since the Ethereum network went live.XRP, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Binance Coin (BNB), Polkadot (DOT) and Cardano’s ADA prices all vary between 9.7% and above 30%. BCH exceeds all other coins sitting above the current price of $258 for at least one-third of its life.Bitcoin’s strong rise past $16,000 has also seen record volumes recently. With more than $5.5 billion in Bitcoin trading volume recorded on Nov. 5, only nine days have seen stronger volume in Bitcoin’s history.Compared to this day in previous years, investors have seen profits of 88%, 2,275%, 4,326% and a staggering 5,833,991% for the years of 2019, 2016, 2013 and 2010, respectively.In other words, investing $1 into Bitcoin on November 13, 2010, would have increased to $58,339 today."
564,"Crypto payment services provider BitPay has launched BitPay Send, a new blockchain-powered mass-payout platform for businesses.BitPay Send allows organizations who do not want to handle or own crypto themselves to process crypto payments en masse. It can be used to complete payroll payments, pay contractors or affiliates, and process customer cashback and rewards programs. Available in 225 countries, all recipients need to pass the Know Your Customer procedure and have a cryptocurrency wallet.BitPay claims the platform cuts processing time from days to minutes.The service has already been adopted by advertising platform AdGate Media in order to pay affiliates around the world. AdGate president Dan Sapozhnikov explained that many of their affiliates are located outside of North America and Europe, where access to bank accounts can be difficult, so they want “to be paid in Bitcoin.” But he said that the firm “did not want to buy and hold crypto,” adding:BitPay CEO Stephen Pair said the ease of sending global transactions via crypto is a big attraction for businesses:BitPay is a U.S.-based company that launched in 2011. It processed almost 100,000 transactions per month in 2020, the majority of them being in Bitcoin (BTC). The firm is backed by multiple investment firms including Founders Fund, Virgin Group, Index Ventures, and Aquiline Technology Growth, having raised more than $70 million in funding."
565,"Within the last hour, the Bitcoin (BTC) price surged through the $16,200 level to secure a new 2020 high at $16,473. The 6.62% move brings the top-ranked digital asset closer to closing a CME gap in the $16,465 to $16,570 zone and a growing number of analysts expect the price to break above the $17,200 level if the CME gap is closed.Despite the excitement surrounding Bitcoin’s surge to a new multi-year high, Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe pointed out that Bitcoin has rapidly ascended to new highs without establishing strong supports.Van de Poppe said:The analyst also said that the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has reached the “Extreme Greed” level, which can be interpreted as a sell signal.Bitcoin’s impressive rally to $16,465 comes as the Dow and S&P 500 closed the day in the red with a 1.08% and 0.97% loss.While stocks had initially surged after President Elect Joe Biden was declared the winner of the U.S. election, coronavirus infections across the country have risen to a record 150,000 infections per day over the past few days, which in turn has made investors fearful that a new phase of economic shutdowns could be announced.It’s also possible that President Trump’s refusal to concede the election and the prospect of divided government under a Biden administration could be negatively weighing on investors’ confidence in the future of traditional markets.Bitcoin has largely ignored the downturn in stocks and the increasing spread of COVID-19, with the token’s price up 26.78% in November and 127.7% year-to-date.Bullish news like PayPal’s announcement that it had nixed its waiting list for clients looking to trade cryptocurrencies is surely working in Bitcoin’s favor.According to PayPal, crypto payments will soon be available to 26 million merchants globally, and the payments giant also raised the trading cap for U.S.-based customers from $10,000 to $20,000 per week.Given PayPal’s immense user base, analysts are watching for an influx of new Bitcoin investors, as the implementation will likely result in increased demand and push the price even higher.In other news, the DeFi revival continued as Uniswap again saw a strong surge in liquidity, bringing the figure to a record $3.2 billion.Data from DeFi Pulse also shows that the total value locked in DeFi platforms has soared to $13.65 billion. This is another sign that investors are reigniting their interest in DeFi tokens, farming projects and many of the other opportunities that exist in the sector.While Bitcoin price and volumes on an assortment of DeFi platforms have been on the rise, altcoins have seen marginal gains. Ether (ETH) moved up 1.29% to trade above $460 again, and Cardano (ADA) added 7.97%. Chainlink (LINK) was one of the stronger performers, rallying 12% to trade at $12.65.According to CoinMarketCap, the overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $466.5 billion, with Bitcoin’s dominance rate at 65.4%."
566,"Bitcoin (BTC) price is proving to be relatively stable at around the $16,000 level, heavily outperforming both safe-haven and risk-on assets, including gold and stocks. But in the near term, the digital asset faces a major roadblock in the form of whales.On Nov. 12, the price of Bitcoin reached $16,199, a level not seen since the famed 2017 rally. Although BTC dropped to $15,600 within a few hours, it quickly recovered and at the time of writing it looks like the digital asset will attempt to overtake the intraday high.Bitcoin has been shown resilience above $16,000, which has historically been a pivotal reversal point. Due to BTC surpassing this crucial area, the market sentiment around the top cryptocurrency has become overwhelmingly optimistic.However, this could leave the cryptocurrency and wider market vulnerable to a sell-off from whales. High-net-worth individual investors who hold large amounts of BTC, described as whales, prefer to sell when there is high liquidity.In most cases, periods with the most liquidity are when the price of BTC is increasing with significant market optimism.Whales are holding more BTC than usual and there has been an increase in whale deposits to major exchangesThese two data points show that the probability of a sell-off led by whales in the near term is high.When the Exchange Whale Ratio indicator surpasses 85%, it indicates that a correction is likely. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju explained that 85% is correction-level and 90 is dumping-level for the indicator.Since the Exchange Whale Ratio is at around 85%, Ki said “mass-dumping” is not likely but minor corrections would likely occur.This data coincides with the report from Santiment which found the number of large Bitcoin whales hit a yearly high.The analysts at Santiment suggested that the number of whale Bitcoin addresses holding over 10,000 BTC hitting 111 is a validation of whale confidence.While this is true, it also means that the Bitcoin market currently has an unusually highest number of whales. Hence, if whales begin to take profit, it could cause a pullback in the foreseeable future. Santiment analysts wrote:Alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) are now in a precarious position due to Bitcoin’s current price cycle.If Bitcoin goes up, then it would continue to suck the volume out of the cryptocurrency market. Consequently, altcoins would underperform against Bitcoin and possibly against the U.S. dollar.Alternatively, if Bitcoin breaks down, it could rattle the market, which would lead to a major altcoin market correction. A pseudonymous cryptocurrency derivatives trader known as “CoinMamba” wrote:"
567,"Bitcoin (BTC) has had a great November so far, and many analysts believe the future remains bright for the top-ranked cryptocurrency.Currently sitting at $16,000, its price has surged by 23% since the start of the month, rallying mostly after the completion of the United States presidential election. Now, Bitcoin spot volume has passed all previous records in 2020, showcasing the growing demand for acquiring BTC.The strong rally to $16,200 led Bitcoin spot volumes to rise by more than 270% in the past month. According to a recent report from Arcane research, the daily volume on Nov. 5 was the highest since the Black Thursday crash that brought BTC price below $4,000 on March 13.Market sentiment is also reaching record-breaking numbers, and this is clearly reflected in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which is currently at 86, a reflection of extreme greed in the market.Many seasoned investors counter-trade the signal coming from the index, as ""extreme greed"" is reflective of FOMO —the fear of missing out — or euphoric sentiment in the market and a sign to take profits.Not only is spot volume for Bitcoin reaching 2020 highs, but institutional interest has also been rampant throughout November, with multiple high-profile companies and high-net-worth individuals investing Bitcoin.Open interest for Bitcoin futures at CME also surged to near all-time highs last week at $934 million. The figure has been growing since the start of October and increased by 169% in the last month.According to Arcane Research, the growth in the number of participants may be the main reason for the steep increase in open interest. Reports from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission show that there are now 102 large traders holding positions (the minimum size is 25 BTC), and this is a 126% increase from the average figures seen throughout 2019.Increasing participation in both spot trading and regulated Bitcoin products is clearly impacting Bitcoin's current bullish trend and possibly altering how the digital asset is perceived by institutional and traditional retail investors.As volumes at top tier exchanges and regulated derivatives markets continue to grow, it is possible that a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund will finally be approved, and this would really open the gates for institutional investors to engage with Bitcoin and other crypto assets."
568,"Strategic investor Lyn Alden believes Bitcoin’s growing network effect coupled with favorable macroeconomic factors may bring its market capitalization to $1 trillion in the next few years. Back in 2017, Alden was skeptical toward Bitcoin (BTC), as the network effect of the main cryptocurrency was still relatively weak:Three years later, Bitcoin has not only retained its market dominance but also its network effect is set to grow further. In fact, some analysts have sa, PayPal’s latest cryptocurrency integration may triple Bitcoin’s user base.The macroeconomic environment generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Alden, also favors Bitcoin.In particular, central bank money-printing and interest rates at historic lows are increasing the appeal of scarce assets that retain their value in an inflationary environment, such as gold and Bitcoin. That is why Alden has predicted a significant capital spillover from traditional assets into the leading cryptocurrency in the years to come.“If Bitcoin ever reaches $1 trillion, that's still 10% the size of gold. [...] Could it reach 10% of the gold market cap? I think so,” she said.Check out the full interview on our YouTube channel, and remember to subscribe!"
569,"Bitcoin (BTC) is still showing strength with multiple attempts to break through $16,000 on Nov. 12. A new yearly high was established throughout the day, with BTC price peaking at $16,150. This yearly high is more than 300% higher than the yearly low in March at $3,800. This is impressive momentum, particularly as the life is being drained from altcoins.Even Stan Druckenmiller acknowledged this week that he bought Bitcoin, expecting BTC to continue to outperform gold. This is yet another big-name institutional investor jumping on the ""digital gold"" bandwagon.However, is a further continuation upward warranted, considering such euphoria? The Fear & Greed Index is at record highs, making a correction almost inevitable in the short term.The weekly chart for Bitcoin shows an apparent resistance zone in the $16,000 region. It’s the first time in nearly three years that this level was reached. Back then, Bitcoin’s price was rejected at around $16,000.Furthermore, the sixth green weekly candle is currently being printed, which is certainly a bullish sign.However, many levels beneath the current price are untested on the weekly timeframe. A healthy way to build up a new cycle is the backtesting of previous resistance levels as new areas of support.This retest didn’t occur at the $12,000 area, for example. Hence, this is a level that traders should be watching because this may become a critical pivot area. The daily time frame shows a potential breakout above $15,600. Such a breakout is likely going to occur with a large volume, which would indicate major strength.The current breakout lacks volume, however, setting up a potential bearish divergence and a top construction at this level.In that regard, if Bitcoin’s price breaks south and loses the $15,600 level, a further correction seems inevitable.If a further correction occurs, the levels to watch on the daily time frame are $14,100, $13,100, and the zone around $11,600 to $12,000. The latter is also a potential support area on the weekly chart.The Fear & Greed Index is still at extremely high levels, as the current level is 87 out of 100, the highest since June 2019, which marked the top of the previous bull cycle.The Fear & Greed Index is a useful tool for gauging market sentiment.When peak levels of 80 and over are reached, a correction becomes more likely than a further continuation upward. This euphoria is frequently short-lived, as the market often moves in the opposite direction than the majority of traders expect.While institutions jumping into Bitcoin or big-name investors stating that they own BTC are very bullish signals for the market in general, this doesn’t mean that a correction can't occur. In fact, such bull cycle corrections are often considered healthy for the Bitcoin market.In the previous bull market cycle in 2017, BTC/USD saw multiple drops of 30% that resulted in retests of previous resistance levels, which then became springboards for the next leg up.

570,"The behavior of crypto market participants often depends on political and economic factors: the price of crypto assets, regulations in a specific country, or political events. For Chinese miners, however, the factors differ somewhat. For several years, Chinese mining operations have been largely reliant on climate. While Western crypto companies fear falling stock prices and regulators, the survival of many crypto mining operations in China depends on rain.Chinese miners have recently migrated from the southern regions to the north, where electricity prices can be as low as $0.01. This migration has led to a surge in the Bitcoin (BTC) hash rate by more than 40% in two days. While the migration occurs annually, the wet season closing out may not be the only contributing factor this year.The migration of Chinese crypto miners is a common practice that is mainly affected by the climate determining electricity costs. Eddie Jiang, chief operating officer and partner of mining pool ViaBTC Group, explained to Cointelegraph that from April to October, China’s southern provinces see abundant rainfall, creating a surplus of hydropower and subsequent cheap electricity prices.According to Dejun Kenny Ge, founder of Zhongda Jinfu Finance and co-founder of Shanghai-based investment platform Dd.finance, when moving from China’s north to its southwestern regions, miners can save about $0.18 per kilowatt (12 yuan per kilowatt). When the wet season in southern regions ends in late October, the price of electricity rises to about $0.054/kWh. At this time, miners shift their rigs to facilities in northwestern regions such as Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and Qinghai, where electricity typically costs about $0.05/kWh.Low temperatures in the northern regions are another factor contributing to the relocation of Chinese miners from the south. Calling this process the “great miner migration,” Alejandro De La Torre, vice president of crypto mining pool Poolin, explained: “It is cold in Northern China, so mining farms don’t need to spend on cooling for the mining rigs.”However, not all miners adhere to this principle. Wishing to remain anonymous, a local crypto miner spoke to Cointelegraph on the matter, saying that while China has two mining hubs — one in Sichuan province (southwest China) and one Inner Mongolia (North), Chinese miners rely more on southern capabilities. He also noted that many Sichuan miners are now sticking to their locations rather than relocating to the North: “Our mining capacity in Inner Mongolia currently generates only about 20%–30% of our overall hash rate.”Taras Kulyk, senior vice president of blockchain business development at Core Scientific, a digital asset mining infrastructure provider in North America, revealed that Chinese miners have come to realize that the mass migration of units every season is not the most sustainable model.Some sources claim that Chinese miners are migrating this year not only because of climatic changes, but because of tightening regulation in the country and pressure on crypto organizations by the government. Earlier, it was reported that the co-founder of the OKEx exchange was arrested by the Chinese police. Zhongda Jinfu Finance’s Ge noted that in China, mining facility operators have been the hardest hit by recent, tighter regulations:Since 2017, the Chinese government has increased the number of inspections conducted at crypto farms, many of which have since closed. As Jiang noted, local governments check the compliance of mining electricity consumption every year. “For mining farms that use non-compliant electricity, the regulatory authorities will require rectification until they meet the requirements.” He then went on to add: “This year, some local governments have set up compliant consumptive electricity, and mining farms can apply to use it for mining. I think this has made greater progress in policy supervision.”Still, few local miners relate the mining operation closures to stricter regulation. In fact, according to some, changes in the mining market in China are, to a greater extent, associated with the insufficient production capacity of mining machine manufacturers and the institutionalization of the industry, with funds, listed companies and private equity firms starting to replace retail miners. According to Jiang, the increased number of institutional miners significantly affects the operation and maintenance requirements as well as investment decisions of original miners.According to Ge, the mining market is entering an era of large-scale operation, increased specialization and financialization, so it has become challenging for smaller mining facilities to attract miners, as he told Cointelegraph: “Back in 2019, China accounted for more than 70% of the world’s crypto mining market.” However, he also added that following the bear market in 2019 and a sharp price decline in 1Q 2020, many miners with high-consumption rigs have exited the market. Overall, “the sentiment in the Chinese crypto mining market remains neutral,” he said.So far, local companies do not see a significant reduction in the number of large farms. Some even talk about an increase in production. De La Torre agreed that the number of farms in China and globally have increased, adding: “The mining industry in China is not facing any big challenges at all, as we can see by the global hashrate increase in the last couple of years and especially in the last year.”Meanwhile, according to Jiang, the mining sector’s expansion may once again be attributed to the entrance of institutions, which have set up larger mining farms.While local miners claim that “everything is as usual,” some experts suggest that China may soon lose its mining dominance. Among the reasons, Ge highlighted the growing share of international mining operations as well as overseas institutions such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust increasing their Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) long positions: “In the near future, there could be an increasingly fragmented and distributed market globally.”In search of alternative conditions for placing their mining capacities, Chinese miners are now considering even drastic measures such as moving operations to other countries such as Kazakhstan or Russia. Speaking with Cointelegraph, a crypto miner from Changzhi noted that Russia is one of the most attractive countries for Chinese miners:Other miners seem to be choosing North America, which, due to its stable energy infrastructure, financial resources and evolving regulatory clarity, is now becoming a viable option. Kulyk believes that Chinese miners are seriously researching the prospect of diversifying operations by moving them to North America. He added that Core Scientific is currently working with several Chinese players to move a portion of its hardware to North America, further explaining:Derek Boirun, CEO and co-founder of peer-to-peer trading platform Realio, and Bitcoin mining pioneer Marshall Long shared the opposite view with Cointelegraph:So it seems, one can hardly speak of large-scale migrations in the short term. However, local miners do not intend to leave the market en masse, and it seems that they have already provided for several working scenarios to continue their business. In response to the closure of coal plants, Chinese miners have started connecting to hydroelectric power plants, moving to colder regions at the end of the rainy season, and coping with rises in electricity costs by using cheaper equipment."
571,"Cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift recently delisted three privacy coins: Dash, Zcash (ZEC) and Monero (XMR). This was an unexpected move to say the least, given the exchange’s historic commitment to privacy.As a noncustodial platform, Shapeshift did not impose user identification requirements on traders in its early days, although this began to change with the gradual introduction of a mandatory membership model, compliant with Know Your Customer rules, as of 2018.Why then, did it move to delist Dash, Zcash and Monero, even as other exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US still list these coins? In a statement shared with Cointelegraph, the chief financial officer of Dash Core Group, Glenn Austin, said he found the delisting “particularly frustrating because [it] could have been entirely avoided by a simple 10–15 minute call.” Austin believes the delisting boils down to “an educational issue.” While the reasons for the delisting have not been officially clarified, Austin has speculated that the move may be influenced by the currency having been mentioned twice in the Department of Justice’s recently published “Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework.” In both cases, Dash was cited alongside Monero and Zcash as an example of an anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrency. The DoJ identified the use of such currencies as a “high-risk activity indicative of possible criminal conduct.”Dash’s argument is that its currency is not truly a privacy coin. The group cites major law firm Perkins Coie’s assessment in September 2019 that “the widespread perception that Dash is a ‘privacy-coin’ is likely a legacy of its former ‘Darkcoin’ moniker and does not accurately reflect its actual functionality.” Perkins Coie has argued that Dash has the same functionality in this regard as Bitcoin (BTC). Austin explained:Chainalysis, a leading blockchain analytics firm, agrees that from a technical standpoint, privacy coin is “a misnomer for Dash.” The firm, which offers investigation and compliance support for the Dash Core Group, has emphasized that ""independent wallet software provides more advanced forms of CoinJoin that are being used with major cryptocurrencies not labeled as privacy coins, such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin.""Austin goes even further with this argument. Beyond his emphasis on misconceptions surrounding Dash, he argues that the support of off-chain transactions with Bitcoin via Lightning Network as well as Bitcoin’s prevalence in darknet markets make it a higher risk from a regulatory perspective. Moreover, software such as Chaumian CoinJoin, which can be used with Bitcoin wallets but not Dash ones, are an even more sophisticated means of obscuring data from other participants in the network, he says.“We did present all of this information to FinCEN but it appears the message never filtered through to the DoJ,” Austin said. The company has also reached out to ShapeShift and says it will continue to pursue the matter until it has been resolved."
572,"Ray Dalio, the billionaire hedge fund legend, doesn’t see digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) succeeding the way other people do. He expects authorities to clamp down on cryptocurrencies when they see “material” growth.Meanwhile, BTC has hugely outperformed Bridgewater year-to-date. Barry Silbert, CEO of Grayscale — a cryptocurrency investment firm with over $9 billion in assets under management — said:Bitcoin and Bridgewater cannot be directly compared, of course. The former is a decentralized, digital currency with a market cap of $291 billion. The latter is a hedge fund that manages $148 billion in assets under management as of September 2020.Nevertheless, the contrast in performance shows Bitcoin has a lot more risk-reward potential, particularly as its market capitalization today is only 2.36% of gold.Ultimately, Dalio’s skepticism toward cryptocurrencies comes down to the regulatory threat against them.If cryptocurrencies see material growth, Dalio said governments would likely ramp up their efforts to restrict them, though he did not specify at which BTC price threshold governments will start taking direct action. He also said:Dalio’s skepticism has also been shared by government officials. United States President Donald Trump released a statement regarding Bitcoin in July 2019. At the time, he wrote on Twitter:However, former U.S. President Barack Obama described Bitcoin as a “Swiss bank account,” alluding to the fact that nation-states won’t be able to fully ban something that is not only global but also something that can be easily secured by individuals. During a keynote at the South by Southwest festival in 2016, former president Barak Obama said in relation to cryptocurrencies:At its core, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer software protocol. Governments could move toward restricting the use of cryptocurrencies by outlawing on and off-ramps into cryptocurrencies. But that would simply make Anti-Money Laundering initiatives less practical, as users will simply go underground or move to friendlier jurisdictions.Furthermore, when cryptocurrencies move to the grey market and people start trading crypto assets in a peer-to-peer manner, it gets more difficult to crack down on illicit activity.As such, a strong argument can be made that it’s not in the best interest of governments to outright ban Bitcoin.Moreover, more billionaires have started to show support for Bitcoin in recent months. As Cointelegraph reported, the frenzy around Bitcoin among institutions and smart money comes from the properties that make it an efficient, but perhaps more importantly, unconfiscatable store of value.Bitcoin is liquid, decentralized, easy to trade, transfer and store securely. These characteristics allow it to operate as a practical safe-haven asset and a hedge against inflation with a low barrier to entry.As DeFi developer Julien Bouteloup noted, Dalio has offered skepticism toward Bitcoin in the past. In 2017, before BTC hit an all-time high at around $20,000, Dalio described BTC as a bubble.During his interview with Yahoo Finance, Dalio also emphasized that he would not prefer Bitcoin over gold.Yet, despite Bitcoin’s abrupt 60% crash in March, the digital asset has massively outperformed gold throughout 2020.Year-to-date, gold has seen gains of around 23%. In the same period, BTC recorded a 119% gain, rising from $7,165 to over $15,700."
573,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $16,000 today, Nov. 12, for the first time in nearly three years. The momentum of the dominant cryptocurrency is strengthening due to three key major factors.The main catalysts behind BTC’s rally are the non-overheated derivatives market, repeated retest of $16,000, and the $14,900 whale supply zone.On Nov. 10, the price of Bitcoin abruptly declined to as low as $15,072. The market drop occurred merely 24 hours after it saw another major dip to $14,805, which turned traders cautious.But the drop benefited Bitcoin for two key reasons. First, it allowed whales to take profit on their positions at around the $15,000 support level. Second, it neutralized the futures market by flushing out late buyers or long contract holders.Resetting the futures market and the funding rate for Bitcoin futures contracts was critical for sustaining the ongoing BTC rally.Futures exchanges in the cryptocurrency market use a mechanism called “funding” to achieve balance in the market. When the majority of the market is buying Bitcoin, buyers need to incentivize short-sellers. The vice versa is also true: When shorts make up most of the market, sellers need to pay buyers.Prior to the drop on Nov. 10, the funding rate of BTC was hovering above 0.01%. This indicated that the market was heavily longing or buying Bitcoin, making it overcrowded.After the minor correction to the $15,000 support level, BTC futures contracts neutralized as funding rates stabilized.Even until late Nov. 11, the $16,000 area served as a heavy level of resistance for Bitcoin. Traders pinpointed the presence of large sell orders at the resistance, indicating that whales are likely targeting this level.According to Edward Morra, a Bitcoin trader, there is an abundance of sell orders near $16,000. He said:Despite the filing of large sell orders at $16,000, Bitcoin pushed through it due to repeated retests throughout the past week, which eventually weakened the resistance.Cointelegraph has consistently reported throughout this week that $14,900 has become a whale support area.Data from Whalemap shows that whale clusters form when high-net-worth individuals buy BTC and do not move it. The price at which those purchases cluster is then considered a support level.Despite extreme market volatility influenced by macro factors such as Pfizer’s vaccine development, Bitcoin comfortably remained above $14,900. The trend has shown that it has become a stable support level for BTC.Cameron Winklevoss, the billionaire co-founder of major Bitcoin exchange Gemini, emphasized the importance of BTC holding above the $14,900 to $15,000 support range. He said:"
574,"Bitcoin (BTC) is at the start of its next “main bull run” and the price peak won’t hit until the end of 2021, well-known analyst Willy Woo believes.In one of many recent Twitter discussions on Nov. 11, the creator of statistics resource Woobull produced fresh evidence that Bitcoin’s price gains are only just beginning.Uploading a chart showing Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI), Woo noted similarities between the metric’s current behavior and that of early 2017.“Green circle denotes where we are in this macro cycle. Start of the main bull run (in case it isn’t already obvious),” he commented.RSI looks at price behavior over a specified period. Its calculation involves the ratio of average closes higher and lower over that period.Woo was using his own 365-day RSI chart, and its readings follow on from its position during a previous update in July. At the time, Bitcoin was ending a period of so-called RSI compression, which accompanied a series of higher lows and lower highs for the BTC price.In July, Woo predicted that the bull run would begin in Q4 of 2020 and run into 2021 — something that has so far become a reality. Now, he suggests that the new bullish phase will only top out in around a year’s time.“My pick is December 2021, gotta sell to pay taxes like last time,” he responded when asked about a likely peak.As Cointelegraph reported, Woo is far from alone in claiming that Bitcoin’s performance in recent weeks is an anomaly, which will later correct downward.Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal and Gemini exchange co-founder Tyler Winklevoss have both stated that a new all-time high for BTC/USD will come no later than Q1 next year.The technical issues that accompanied the rise to $16,000 have meanwhile dissipated thanks to Bitcoin’s automatic mining difficulty readjustment, with fees nosediving and unconfirmed transactions dropping to near zero this week.A further downward readjustment, estimated at 6%, is due in around four days’ time."
575,"Pakistan’s government is working on a framework for regulating cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC).The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, or SECP, has published a consultation paper on regulating digital assets. Issued on Nov. 6, the paper outlines major concepts for the growing digital finance market in Pakistan and examines the existing regulatory frameworks developed by other global jurisdictions.In the document, the SECP emphasizes that digital assets are the “start of a new era of digital finance.” According to the regulator, the new era of digital finance “could only be possible by initiation of a new era that re-invents regulatory regime [or] measures as they are known to the regulators globally today.”The SECP noted that the consultation paper focuses exclusively on private crypto assets and does not include remarks on a central bank digital currency, or CBDC.Distinguishing several types of digital assets, the SECP pays particular attention to security tokens and utility tokens. According to the regulator, one of the key advantages of security tokens is the ability to fractionalize each asset, which enables benefits like lowering barriers for investment by retail investors. Other advantages include transparency, improved liquidity, improved clearing and settlement mechanisms and more automation tools, the paper reads.The SECP will continue to engage with market players and welcome industry feedback in developing a regulatory framework for crypto.Pakistan has been slow to adopt new frameworks for digital money and cryptocurrencies. Last year, the country was planning to introduce new digital currency regulations for electronic money institutions. In April 2019, Pakistan’s central bank announced plans to issue a CBDC by 2025."
576,"The Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin (BTC) mining company Bit Digital has announced it will issue $13.9 million in shares in exchange for mining hardware.According to a Nov. 11 announcement, Bit Digital has inked asset-purchase agreements with non-U.S. investors to issue 4,344,711 shares valued at $3.20 each in exchange for Bitcoin miners boasting a combined hash power of 1,000 petahashes per second, or 1 exahash per second.Bit Digital launched its BTC mining business in February 2020, quickly amassing 1,250 PH/s in power by October. The additional miners will nearly double Bit Digital’s operational hashing power once installed.The company also expects to install 2,000 previously purchased MicroBT Whatsminer M21 ASIC miners by January 2021, adding a further 6.2 PH/s in operational hash rate.With a projected hashing power of more than 2.3 exahashes per second, Bit Digital’s decision to exchange $13.9 million in shares for miners will help the company rank alongside North America’s top mining firms by hash rate.Last month, Nevada-based Marathon Patent Group announced it plans to command 2.56 EH/s by July 2021. The announcement has Marathon on-track to surpass the hashing power of Riot Blockchain, which is targeting 2.3 EH/s by July of next year.With the Bitcoin network currently producing 121 EH/s in total, Bit Digital, Marathon, and Riot Blockchain aim to command more than 1.9% of the current global hash rate each.In February, the Peter Thiel-backed Layer1 Technologies also revealed it is planning to secure 30% of the global hash rate before the end of next year."
577,"Apple should invest a portion of its massive cash reserves in Bitcoin, Toroso Investments’ portfolio manager Dan Weiskopf posted earlier today on the ETF Think Tank website.The lead ETF strategist’s call follows in the footsteps of MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor and former Goldman Sachs hedge fund manager Raoul Pal, who both predicted Apple would make a large scale investment in Bitcoin in the upcoming years.Saylor retweeted and endorsed Weiskopf’s piece with the comment that the tech giant could see a $100 billion gain in market cap by integrating Bitcoin with their products and adding it to their holdings.With a market cap north of $2 trillion, Apple is the world’s most valuable company and has nearly $192 billion cash on hand, according to an earnings report released on Oct. 29.Weiskopf laid out the case that an investment in Bitcoin  between $10 billion and $20 billion would be more profitable in the long term than Apple’s plan of carrying on with “risky and expensive” stock buybacks. He said it would also be a prudent hedge against inflation.“I get that certain institutional shareholders might get twisted up by the purchase of Bitcoin, but we need to work through the math and the opportunity versus the stock buyback,” he wrote.Being substantially larger in both reach and market cap than Bitcoin, Weiskopf argues that Apple can help Bitcoin reach true levels of mainstream adoption, to the benefit of both.As an aside, the price of BTC would need to rise 545% — roughly $100,000 per BTC — in order to approach Apple’s current market cap of $2.03 trillion."
578,"Blockchain analytics platform BlockSeer has launched the private beta version of a new Bitcoin (BTC) mining pool — Blockseer Mining Pool — that censors transactions from blacklisted wallets.The pool will use BlockSeer and Walletscore’s labeling data, among other verified sources such as the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, blacklist for crypto to identify BTC transactions it does not wish to process. The pool also requires all miners to pass Know-Your-Customer protocols. DMG’s chief operating officer, Sheldon Bennett, stated:Former Monero lead developer Riccardo Spagni suggested on Twitter this could be the start of a slippery slope. He speculated that transaction censorship from Bitcoin mining pools may become widespread as a result of regulatory pressure and said the concern was of “regulators looking at this and thinking it’s a good idea ‘for extreme cases like the OFAC crypto list’, then it becomes enforceable.”“Adding more privacy to Bitcoin would prevent this,” Spagni suggested, adding:P2pool is a decentralized Bitcoin mining pool that was established in 2011. The Stratum V2 draft, by Braiins, is a complete overhaul that implements BetterHash, a secondary protocol that enables mining pool constituents to decide the composition of the block they will mine, instead of pools having control over which transactions to include in each block. This should make pool censorship impossible. According to Braiins co-founder Jan Capek, the draft still needs formal review but will receive grants from Square Crypto for further development.The founder of website Wallet Scrutiny, Leo Wandersleb, suggested the “slippery slope” of censorship “will lead to a soft fork"" where pools following this approach will reject building ""on blocks that don’t use their filters.”This slippery slope will lead to a soft for where pools following this approach will reject to build on blocks that don't use their filters. Let them have their US coin.In August 2019, Bitcoiner Eric Voskuil predicted that government pools will mine at a loss in order to censor, while black market pools will harvest black market fees.Not all are not convinced that transaction censorship is enforceable without the majority of miners supporting it. BlockTower chief information office Ari Paul said that even if just one miner does not comply, then there is the possibility for blacklisted transactions to be included, but added:Erik Voorhees believes the time will come when transaction censorship poses a serious threat to Bitcoin:"
579,"On Nov. 13, a total of $525 million in Bitcoin (BTC) options open interest is set to expire. This is similar to last week when $470 million in options open interest also expired. This presents somewhat unusual activity, as most volume goes through monthly and quarterly options.On Nov. 5, put (sell) options open interest was 30% larger than call (buy) ones. Deribit exchange holds $431 million open interest for this Friday’s expiry and Bit.com has $72 million.Before coming to quick conclusions on whether this figure is bullish or bearish, it’s important to take a more detailed view in order to gauge the potential buy and sell pressure near expiry.For example, an $18,000 call option holder has not much to gain in pushing up the Bitcoin price to $16,500 with less than 32 hours till expiry. These options are already deemed worthless by the market. The same can be said for a put (sell) option down to $14,000.Thus, by excluding call options above $16,700 and put options below $14,400, traders can attain a more realistic view of the current market conditions.Deribit exchange holds 5,915 BTC call options ranging from $14,000 to $15,750. Bit.com has 1,050 BTC and OKEx currently holds 490 BTC. Therefore, there is an immediate $117 million in open interest supporting current levels.Meanwhile, the put options ranging from $15,250 to $16,500 amount to 2,130 BTC at Deribit, followed by 860 BTC at Bit.com, plus another 100 BTC at OKEx. Thus, the immediate sell-side pressure amounts to $48 million open interest from put options.The reason behind this difference is that most put options have been depreciated and have no market value. This movement excludes 84% of the $298 million put options open interest.Therefore, when analyzing just the option strikes closer to market levels, there is a sizable $69 million imbalance favoring the buy side. Similar to the previous week, there have been some large bearish trades likely related to the United States elections.Regardless of the market having enough strength to break the $16,000 resistance, those short-term options are currently supporting $15,500 and higher.OKEx, Bit.com and Deribit weekly contracts mature on Nov. 13 at 8:00 am UTC.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
580,"Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller became the latest famous name to disclose a Bitcoin position. Although Druckenmiller did not specify the quantity he had purchased, he did say that Bitcoin will outperform gold a lot more “because it’s thinner, more illiquid, and has a lot more beta to it.”Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller, and Bill Miller are some of the most successful traders and investors on Wall Street. A stamp of approval from them is likely to attract several other investors who may want to diversify their portfolio and outperform the markets.In further validation for the crypto space, controversial Australian politician Cory Bernardi has called Bitcoin (BTC) “the millennial’s version of gold.” Even though Bernardi said that risks remain, he believes they are similar to that of any other asset class.Alex Saunders, founder of the crypto education site Nuggets News, views the endorsements for cryptocurrencies by high-profile figures as a sign of changing times and earlier this week the analyst predicted that Bitcoin price will reach $1 million by 2030.These fundamental points are long-term positives for cryptocurrency prices. However, let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out the path of least resistance in the short-term.Bitcoin (BTC) had formed an inside day candlestick pattern on Nov. 10, which showed indecision among the bulls and the bears. The uncertainty has been resolved to the upside today with the bulls attempting to push the price above the $16,000 resistance.If the bulls succeed, the BTC/USD pair could start the journey towards the next target objective at $17,200. This level is likely to be the last stop before the pair retests the all-time highs.The rising moving averages and the relative strength index in the overbought zone suggest that bulls are in command.Contrary to this assumption, if the price fails to sustain above $16,000, then the pair could remain range-bound between $14,000 and $16,000 for a few more days. A break below the 20-day exponential moving average ($14,242) will be the first sign of weakness.Ether (ETH) formed inside day candlestick patterns for three consecutive days from Nov. 8 to 10. This uncertainty has today resolved to the upside, which suggests that the bulls have absorbed the selling and have established their supremacy.If the bulls can sustain the price above the resistance line of the wedge, it will invalidate the bearish setup. That will open the gates for a retest of the critical overhead resistance at $488.134. A breakout and close above this level could resume the up-move.The first target on the upside is $520 and if the ETH/USD pair can ascend this level, a move to $550 is possible. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls are in command.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($418), it will signal that the bears are aggressively defending the wedge. They will then try to pull the price down to the 50-day simple moving average at $382.The bulls pushed XRP above the overhead resistance at $0.26 on Nov.10 but failed to sustain the breakout. This suggests selling at higher levels, but the positive thing is that the bulls have not allowed the price to break below the moving averages on the downside.Repeated jumps above a resistance level tend to weaken it. The bulls are currently again attempting to propel the XRP/USD pair above $0.26. If they succeed in sustaining the price above this level, a new uptrend is likely.The first target on the upside is $0.30. The RSI in the positive territory and the gradually upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.248) suggest that bulls have the upper hand.This positive view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below the moving averages. Such a move could drag the pair down to the support at $0.2295.Chainlink (LINK) has been trading close to the overhead resistance at $13.28 for the past few days. A tight consolidation near a resistance usually ends with a breakout favoring the bulls.If the price closes above $13.28, it will complete an inverse head and shoulders pattern that may signal the start of a new up-move. The target objective of this setup is $19.2731.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls are in control.This bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down sharply from the current levels. Such a move could result in profit-booking by short-term traders. A break below $9.7665 will signal a possible deeper correction to $7.30.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is struggling to rebound off the 20-day EMA ($257). This suggests a lack of urgency among the bulls to buy at these levels as they may not be confident that the altcoin will rise above $280.The bearish divergence on the RSI also suggests that the momentum may be weakening. If the 20-day EMA support cracks, the BCH/USD pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($245) and then to $231.This negative view will be invalidated if the pair rebounds off the current levels and breaks above the $272 to $280 resistance zone. The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI close to the midpoint suggest a range-bound action in the short-term.The intraday range in Binance Coin (BNB) is narrowing, which suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. The flat moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint also suggests a balance between the bulls and the bears.If the range expands to the upside and the bulls push the price above the moving averages and the overhead resistance at $30, the BNB/USD pair could rally to the $32 to $33.3888 zone.Conversely, if the range expansion happens to the downside, the bears will try to sink the pair below the $25.6652 support.The next trending move could start after the bulls push the price above $33.3888 or the bears sink the price below $25.6652.Polkadot (DOT) is currently stuck close to the midpoint of the $3.80 to $4.95 range. However, as long as the price sustains above the moving averages, the bulls will try to push the price to the resistance of the range.The gradually upsloping 20-day EMA ($4.29) and the RSI in the positive zone suggest a marginal advantage to the bulls. A break above $4.95 could push the price to the next resistance at $5.5899.Conversely, if the price again turns down from $4.95, the DOT/USD pair may remain range-bound for a few more days. A break below the moving averages will be the first sign that the bulls have surrendered the advantage to the bears.Litecoin (LTC) has bounced off the 20-day EMA ($56.75), which suggests that the sentiment remains positive and the bulls are buying on dips. The bulls will now try to push the price to the overhead resistance at $64.Traders can keep an eye on the RSI as it has formed a symmetrical triangle. A breakout of the triangle will increase the possibility of a break above $64 while a break below the triangle could pull the price below the 20-day EMA.Currently, the upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that bulls have the upper hand. This advantage could shift in favor of the bears if the support at $56.50 gives way. Such a move could drag the LTC/USD pair to $51.Cardano (ADA) has been sustaining above the moving averages for the past few days. The bulls are now likely to attempt to push the price above the overhead resistance at $0.1142241.If they succeed, the ADA/USD pair will complete a double bottom pattern that has a target objective of $0.1391. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest an advantage to the bulls.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from $0.1142241, the pair may remain range-bound for a few more days.The advantage will tilt in favor of the bears if the price reverses direction and breaks below the moving averages. If that happens, the pair could drop to the critical support at $0.0893.Bitcoin SV (BSV) remains range-bound but the failure of the bulls to push the price above the moving averages suggests a lack of demand at higher levels. The bears will now try to sink the price to the critical support at $146.Both the moving averages are flat and the RSI is just below the midpoint, which suggests a balance between supply and demand. Even if the BSV/USD pair dips to $146, the bulls are likely to defend this level.A strong bounce off the support of the range could extend the stay inside the range. Contrary to this assumption, if the BSV/USD pair turns up from the current levels and breaks above the downtrend line, then it can move up to $181.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

581,"Historically, when a Bitcoin (BTC) monthly candle closes above previous candles, the digital asset has seen a prolonged rally.Atop this high time frame pattern, Bitcoin’s monthly candle in September closed above $13,000 for the first time since 2017. Furthermore, the dominant cryptocurrency has shown signs of a clear breakout throughout the past two months.In terms of the ""BTC rally"" narrative, the timing for a new Bitcoin rally makes sense. First, and perhaps most importantly, Bitcoin is currently in a post-halving cycle.Every four years, Bitcoin undergoes a block reward halving which reduces the pace at which new BTC is mined by 50%.The price of BTC typically peaked 14 to 16 months after the halving in the past two cycles. Hence, a peak for the next major rally in mid-2021 would be historically relevant.Second, as Cointelegraph reported, there is a low level of interest coming from the mainstream and new retail investors. The majority of the demand for Bitcoin is seemingly coming from whales, high-net-worth individuals and what analysts describe as “smart money.”As shown in the chart above, this increased participation can also be seen in the rising volumes across Bitcoin derivatives markets like CME, Bakkt and LedgerX and centralized exchanges offering futures trading. In 2017, Bitcoin saw massive inflows of new retail money flowing in the U.S., South Korea and Japan. Consequently, spot volumes exploded within a short period, taking BTC to $20,000.This time, although spot market volume is rapidly growing, according to data from Digital Assets Data and Arcane Research, mainstream interest is nowhere close to 2017.As such, there is headroom for a broader rally in the foreseeable future, especially if retail interest spikes.Three years ago, there was a mainstream frenzy around Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general because they surged significantly higher than stocks and other risk-on assets.New retail investors were allured by the unprecedented volatility cryptocurrencies provided, causing Bitcoin to rally to a new all-time high.Currently, Bitcoin is demonstrating a parabolic uptrend wherein on the weekly and monthly charts, it is rising without major pullbacks. The sheer momentum of BTC, if it continues to increase without a large correction, could cause the resurgence of mainstream interest.As traders and analysts point out, investors' perception of Bitcoin is noticeably improving as a growing number of large companies and billionaires add BTC to their portfolios.Most recently, as Cointelegraph reported, billionaire hedge fund investor Stan Druckenmiller became the latest high-profile investor to disclose his investment in Bitcoin.Based on this trend, Michaël van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said that the market sentiment would likely remain bullish. He wrote:Bitcoin price is showing resilience after achieving $15,000 for the first time since 2017. Following the large uptrend, historical evidence suggests a broader rally may occur in December."
582,"Measured in Big Macs, Bitcoin’s (BTC) purchasing power is approaching its highest level since the 2017 bull market, offering yet another indicator of the digital currency’s rapid appreciation.The global Bitcoin purchasing power index, or PPI, which measures how many McDonald’s Big Mac hamburgers you can buy with 1 BTC, rose 0.2% to 6,341.26 on Wednesday. Put differently, on average globally, a whole Bitcoin can buy you 6,341.26 Big Macs.In the United States, based on current prices for both, you can get 3,274.91 Big Macs for 1 Bitcoin.The last time Bitcoin’s purchasing power was this high was during the 2017 bull market, when the digital currency peaked near $20,000. On Dec. 17, 2017, 1 Bitcoin was worth 6,358.5 Big Macs. During the depths of the 2019 bear market, the Bitcoin PPI reached the low 1,200s.The Bitcoin PPI is based on the famed Big Mac index that was developed by The Economist in 1986 as a way to gauge purchasing power parity across currencies. Purchasing power is a useful way to measure how many goods and services one unit of money can buy. Although the Big Mac index began as something of a joke, it has become a leading indicator of purchasing power and has been used in dozens of academic studies. Bitcoin’s PPI is up more than 41% since the beginning of October. Over the same period, Bitcoin’s price has appreciated 39%, according to TradingView data. Year-to-date, Bitcoin price is up by 128%.Bitcoin’s store-of-value characteristics are perhaps its most compelling use case. The digital currency has emerged as a reliable inflation hedge — a fact that is further underscored by the PPI. "
583,"As the global crypto economy continues to prosper, with Bitcoin (BTC) currently occupying the $15,500 region, questions regarding the overall safety and security of digital assets continue to persist, especially in the wake of a new scam whereby hackers made use of a phishing email to direct users to a fake Ledger website. According to various reports, victims were scammed to the tune of 1,150,000 XRP, worth approximately $290,000.Dave Jevans, CEO of blockchain intelligence firm CipherTrace and chairman of Anti-Phishing Working Group, told Cointelegraph, “Ledger should clearly have a more aggressive defensive domain acquisition strategy, as look-alike domains were used by phishers in an attempt to trick Ledger users.” He explained further that an illegal money-making scheme employed the use of a homoglyph in the company’s official URL — in this case, a letter that looked like the letter “e.” He added:Earlier this year in July, the Ledger team revealed that it had been on the receiving end of a data breach, as a result of which nearly a million email addresses were compromised, along with the personal details of a subset of 9,500 customers. Furthermore, back in 2018, scammers were able to devise a copy of the Binance website (complete with an SSL certificate), which remained active for some time before being taken down.Lastly, some miscreants were able to rake in a sizable 1.4 million XRP tokens in March by making use of a scammy Google Chrome extension that replicated Ledger’s likeness. In fact, the extension was live on the Google app store for nearly a month. Speaking on the various security protocols that the company employs, a spokesperson for Ledger told Cointelegraph:It goes without saying that wallet operators need to be on top of their security game when it comes to protecting the assets of their customers. However, phishing attacks are a common occurrence, not only within the crypto space, but with any online service that involves a means of payment.Speaking on the issue, Pavol Rusnák, co-founder and chief technology officer of SatoshiLabs, the firm behind the Trezor wallet, told Cointelegraph that it’s of prime importance that crypto owners are careful and double-check every piece of information they receive in relation to their digital assets, be it from their wallet providers or the internet in general:A similar outlook was shared by Jevans who believes that matters related to customer security and privacy need to be viewed with a lens of “shared responsibility,” such that hardware wallet operators as well as crypto owners work in sync with one another to ensure the optimal safety of their assets from third-party threats.Jevans encouraged users to take reasonable safeguards to protect their value and take responsibility for their actions by using practices that are steeped in individual data safety, adding: “Deploy two-factor authentication as well as never click on a ledger link unless they specifically requested their password reset. Users should always type the URL themselves when visiting the Ledger site directly.”Despite being revolutionary in design and technological potential, crypto continues to remain a foreign concept for most. However, by providing people with monetary self-sovereignty, the technology has also burdened them with a lot of personal responsibility, especially in terms of individual financial security. As a result, it stands to reason that companies in the blockchain and crypto space need to educate their users about the security implications of their actions.Rusnák believes that the industry still has some ground to tread regarding security. He pointed out that a number of companies operating within this domain today tend to make gross oversimplifications, such as, “Your coins are safe because your wallet has a secure element,” or, “Your coins are safe because our exchange is insured.” To this, he added, “This is not helping with the matter, making people believe something which is not true, rendering them defenseless.”Statistically speaking, around 85% to 90% of crypto owners seem to fall prey to very common crypto theft schemes, typically fake investment scams rather than phishing traps, according to data provided to Cointelegraph by CipherTrace. As a result, Jevans believes that it would be in the best interests of major hardware wallet operators to use their platforms to educate their users about what to look for when it comes to phishing attempts, particularly when these scams invoke the wallet provider’s name:While companies like Ledger and Trezor do have dedicated information related to phishing and other similar, scammy tactics on their websites, these pages are not easily accessible and are usually buried deep within troubleshooting FAQ sections. Therefore, it seems reasonable to expect that e stablished wallet providers do more in terms of providing customers with streamlined access to high-quality education that centers around security.On the issue, Rusnák is adamant that transparency and education are the keys when it comes to maximizing the security of one’s funds. He opined that users can’t really be safe unless they actually take time to sit down and understand the nitty gritty of crypto security and personal wallet safety.On a more technical note, he explained that the core operational design of Trezor’s various wallet options are fully open-source and that the company is completely transparent about all of its various operational agreements with its customers, to avoid all legal monetary issues encountered later down the line: “It will take some time until every company in the cryptocurrency space understands this, but it’s also our job to demand transparency and openness from service providers we use.”"
584,"With Bitcoin (BTC) price sentiment continuing to remain bullish following the uncertainty brought on by the United States presidential election, institutional investors seem to be getting more interested in betting on the markets. In the seven-day period ending on Oct. 27, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, run by Grayscale Investments, saw a record inflow of $215 million (15,907 BTC), which surpassed all of its weekly inflows seen since inception.At the current rate, it is estimated that Grayscale is on track to hold 500,000 BTC by the end of 2020, which is 2.7% of the circulating supply of Bitcoin. By 2021, it could hold up to 5%. According to Grayscale’s “Digital Asset Investment Report” for the third quarter, the average weekly investment into Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust was up 40% to $55.3 million from a 12-month average of $39.5 million. Additionally, companies such as MicroStrategy, Square and Stone Ridge have bought into Bitcoin as a treasury reserve, which is driving their revenue growth in 2020.The increase in institutional investing in Bitcoin is seen in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as well. Cointelegraph discussed this aspect with Tim McCourt, global head of equity index and alternative investment products at CME Group, who told Cointelegraph: “We have seen an increase in large open interest holders (LOIH), which could be suggestive of increased institutional participation in our bitcoin futures markets.”According to CME, LOIH are entities that hold more than 25 CME Bitcoin futures contracts, with each contract containing 5 Bitcoin. This means that an entity would need to hold at least 125 Bitcoin — i.e., approximately $1.9 million in value. Ahead of the election, the number of LOIH grew to an all-time high of 102.Because Bitcoin futures are indicative of the institutional interest in the asset, McCourt further elaborated on how the metrics for Bitcoin futures fared leading up to the U.S. election night: “Overnight trading volume of 6,700 CME Bitcoin futures contracts (33,500 equivalent Bitcoin), 75% more than average in 2020 to date.” He further added that open interest was also up 20%.Explaining the factors leading to this rise in institutional interest in Bitcoin, Jay Hao, CEO of crypto exchange OKEx, told Cointelegraph that macroeconomic factors such as a second wave of countrywide coronavirus-related lockdowns would have an inflationary impact: “This is leading to massive money printing and there is a growing concern over the eventual harmful effects that inflation will have on fiat currencies especially the dollar.”In addition to these major recent developments, PayPal announced that it will be launching crypto payment services in early 2021. Even JPMorgan Chase has turned bullish on Bitcoin, saying that the asset has “potential long-term upside"" if it competes more closely with gold as an alternative asset, with millennials growing to become a more important aspect of the investor universe.As Grayscale’s investment funds see investments dominated by hedge funds, it’s indicative of the fact that Bitcoin is also becoming a hedging instrument, like gold, to protect investors from market uncertainty and is increasingly used to capture the arbitrage spread. Hao further pointed out how Bitcoin’s performance has created a demand from clients to investment firms and hedge funds:Various other events have also caused this change in perspective from major corporations. Companies like Microstrategy, Square and Stone Ridge buying Bitcoin as a treasury reserve will pave the path for other firms to follow suit, especially considering the significantly positive business impact these investments have yielded, as has been the case with MicroStrategy and Square, becoming the major driving force behind their revenues. Hao believes that “This will start a major trend as we continue this year and move into 2021 that will be very bullish for Bitcoin. We have also seen regulation tilt in bitcoin’s favor as US banks are now able to custody it.”Considering the turbulent times resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to growing unemployment rates throughout the world, it’s possible that retail investors are slightly hesitant to invest funds into assets they aren’t familiar with due to the lack of mainstream media coverage of blockchain technology and its products.However, institutional investors seem to be taking the lead by capitalizing on the high returns that the digital asset class has to offer. John Todaro, director of research at TradeBlock — a cryptocurrency investing platform — is of the opinion that this bull run is indeed led by institutional investors:This is also evident in the open interest and the average daily volumes of futures traded on CME, the platform often used by institutional investors to access this market. Open interest is up 20% in November when compared with October, which, in turn, was significantly higher than the average open interest in September. Because institutional investors tend to trade in larger U.S. dollar notionals and in big blocks, it’s presumably them that have caused the rise in the price of the underlying asset, Bitcoin.In addition to supporting the liquidity and price stability of Bitcoin, there are various ways in which an exchange can optimize its offerings to better suit traditional and institutional investors. Because many of these investors have never taken interest in Bitcoin as an asset class in their portfolio before, it seems essential that the crypto market move in the direction of providing products that institutional players may be familiar with. Todaro outlined why this could be a game-changer:Furthermore, even though the hype around decentralized finance seems to have cooled off recently, it’s highly likely that the innovation and products seen in the domain will have a positive impact on the asset class by getting more investors interested through their use cases and applications. Hao further hinted at the possibility for collaboration between centralized finance and DeFi:Todaro agreed that the DeFi market has an important role to play in the development and growth of the institutional market: “As long as the industry continues innovating through DeFi, launching new products, as well as providing ample liquidity to ensure continued institutional activity, then we should continue to rise.”Even though the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has clarified that banks operating in the U.S. are allowed to provide custody services of cryptocurrencies, there so far doesn’t seem to be much interest from the government and regulators to make a clear framework that would enable even more institutional investors and firms to indulge in crypto and blockchain."
585,"Cuba is seeing an influx of cryptocurrency activity amid an apparent absence of related regulation in the country, according to senior executives at local crypto firms.In early November, Cuba recorded a major spike in Bitcoin (BTC)-related Google queries, indicating an increase in crypto activity in the country. Founders of major local crypto exchanges Qbita and Bitremesas told Cointelegraph that their platforms have seen increased activity in recent months.Erich Garcia, the creator of Bitremesas, told Cointelegraph that the platform has been steadily growing this year, seeing a notable influx in user activity. “By now, the use of the service is increasing at 200% every month,” Garcia said.“Bitcoin usage and volume in Cuba is exploding right now,” said Mario Mazzola, founder of the Qbita exchange. According to the executive, Qbita’s trading volumes in October were equal to the total volumes of July, August and September combined.However, the regulatory status of crypto-related activity is not yet defined in Cuba, both executives noted. Amid this regulatory uncertainty, a number of entrepreneurs are moving into crypto, Garcia claimed:Qbita’s Mazzola said that cryptocurrency in Cuba is “totally deregulated,” while at the same time, the local government has endorsed crypto as a means to circumvent sanctions. He said:As there is still no concrete legal status for crypto in Cuba, the operation of local crypto exchanges could raise regulatory questions, but Qbita’s founder is confident that local crypto businesses are not in danger because there is also no law explicitly prohibiting them from operating.“Such P2P transactions are perfectly legal because in Cuba there is no law that forbids people to buy, hold, use and sell Bitcoin to another person,” Mazzola said.According to Mazzola, local monetary reforms could be one of the major reasons behind rising crypto interest in Cuba. The Cuban government plans to eliminate its dual currency-based economic model, removing the Cuban convertible peso and keeping the Cuban peso. Mazzola said:As previously reported, growing crypto interest in Cuba is also partially a response to the lack of digital financial services in the country. Major companies like PayPal and Stripe do not provide services for Cuban nationals due to sanctions by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC.  The limits on Cuba’s access to financial services extend not only to traditional payment firms, but also global crypto companies like Paxful and LocalBitcoins. Jukka Blomberg, chief marketing officer at Finland-based LocalBitcoins, said:"
586,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has reclaimed $15,500 on Nov. 11 after whales sold the highest amount of BTC since March. In past cycles, the dominant cryptocurrency typically rallied after a sell-off from whales.On March 12, for instance, the All Exchanges Inflow Mean (MA7) indicator hit 3. At the time, BTC declined to as low as $3,596 on BitMEX after seeing cascading liquidations.Since then, the MA7 has never increased above 1.7. On Nov. 11, for the first time since March, the MA7 neared 2. This indicates that whales sold a significant amount of BTC in the past few days.Bitcoin whales, or high-net-worth individuals who hold large amounts of BTC, do not necessarily short BTC because they are bearish.Many whales prefer to take profits amid a bull run and build up positions along the way. This is because whales trade substantially larger positions than most retail traders. As such, they seek liquidity and high buyer demand to sell or adjust their positions.Bitcoin tends to rally after a whale-induced sell-off because it decreases selling pressure on the cryptocurrency in the short to medium term.While the Bitcoin market has become more evenly balanced among retail traders, institutions and whales, high-net-worth individuals still impact the market.Ki Young Ju, CEO at CryptoQuant, emphasized that Bitcoin has historically rallied after “victim whales” deposit BTC to exchanges. He wrote:Bitcoin has seen extreme volatility in the past week, possibly as a result of whales taking profits. However, every major dip was aggressively bought up by other whales and retail investors.BTC recorded large drops on Nov. 8, Nov. 10 and Nov. 11. Bitcoin recovered from every pullback with strength, rebounding to previous support levels within a matter of hours.Atop the favorable technical structure of Bitcoin, on-chain fundamentals signify an overall bullish outlook.According to Glassnode’s data, the number of active Bitcoin addresses achieved a multi-year high. Elias Simos, protocol specialist at Bison Trails, said:Daily active addresses is an important on-chain metric for Bitcoin because it could indicate two key trends.First, retail investors might be increasingly accumulating BTC and transferring to personal wallets. This shows an intent to hold Bitcoin for a prolonged period.Second, there could be an increase in over-the-counter deals, particularly among whales and high-net-worth individuals.The combination of positive technical and fundamental trends raises the probability of a broader rally before the end of the year. With the halving occurring just six months ago, the chances of a more sustainable uptrend remain high."
587,"China Construction Bank has partnered with a Labuan-based fintech to issue the first-ever blockchain-based digital security issued by a Chinese financial institution.One of the “Big Four” banks in the People’s Republic of China, CCB is ranked the second-largest bank worldwide by total assets as of fall 2020.The megabank’s plan with the new blockchain-based debt issuance is to raise up to $3 billion in total, starting with a tranche of $58 million, from individuals and institutions. The digital bonds will be issued through an offshore branch of CCB in Labuan, Malaysia, at a minimum of as little as $100 each, and will have a tenor of three months. They pay an annualized interest of Libor plus 50 basis points, or roughly 0.75%.The innovation is that these bonds are being used as tokenized certificates of deposit on the blockchain, which supports the issuance of such small-sum bonds; non-blockchain-based bonds are typically sold at higher minimums, and are therefore limited to professional investors or other banks. Moreover, the tokenized certificates of deposit will be tradable on the Fusang exchange. The exchange, which is regulated in Labuan, will launch live trading of the bonds on Nov. 13. Notably, as Fusang supports cryptocurrency trading, traders will be able to exchange Bitcoin (BTC) for U.S. dollars in order to purchase the bonds. The transactions will be charged at a commission.Fusang’s CEO Henry Chong has told reporters that if the bonds are popular, the digital exchange intends to initiate similar products denominated in other currencies. The bonds’ 0.75% annualized interest is higher than most U.S. dollar bank-deposit rates, as the Wall Street Journal has emphasized.Tax residents of the United States and China, as well as entities or persons in Iran and North Korea, will not be able to purchase the digital security. All proceeds from the issuance will be deposited at the CCB’s offshore Labuan branch. Labuan is a small island described by the Wall Street Journal as a tax haven.CCB is “not dealing in bitcoin or cryptocurrencies,” but rather “taking bank deposits, which is our core business,” CCB Malaysia’s chief operating officer Steven Wong stressed. The offering is nonetheless being heralded as a big innovation. This is “the first publicly listed debt security on a blockchain,” said Felix Feng Qi, the CEO of CCB’s offshore Malaysian business and principal officer of the CCB Labuan branch."
588,"The Bitcoin network mempool shrank to its smallest size since mid-October this week after the network’s hash power soared.The clear mempool meant that that thousands of stuck transactions pending confirmation were included in recent blocks, leaving very few unconfirmed transactions still outstanding.The spike in hash power has been attributed to the re-activation of China-based miners who migrated from Sichuan after the end of the province’s rainy season. Bitcoin’s hash rate increased by 42% over a two day period, Nov. 9 and 10.A smaller mempool is good news for regular Bitcoin users, as it reduces competition among fresh transactions to get included in upcoming blocks. Reduced competition in the mempool helps to drive down Bitcoin transaction fees, as miners can potentially include all transactions in the mempool irrespective of their individual fee amounts.Mempool cleared for the first time since October 20th in the weee morning hours. pic.twitter.com/JWMs3NsK7vAverage Bitcoin transaction fees reached a peak of $13.16 per transaction on Oct. 30, when more than 140,000 transactions were pending in the mempool. The influx of new hash power over the weekend allowed Bitcoin blocks to be found faster than the benchmark speed of 10 minutes per block due to the network’s relatively low mining difficulty. This allowed miners to reduce the number of unconfirmed transactions to zero on Nov. 9.As of this writing, there were approximately 6,000 transactions in the mempool with a median fee of 3 satoshis per byte or roughly $0.11. Some users have reported fees as low as 1 sat/byte for transactions that have confirmed within a few hours.Mining difficulty was expected to increase upon the next adjustment to account for the network’s increased hash power, which would mean the current respite from high fees may be short lived. However the hash rate is currently volatile and has dropped 37 exahashes per second in the past day.The mempool has cleared. Send 'em if you got 'em.#Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/XDmDquaUzSBitcoin transaction fees had been comparatively low through the second half of 2020. During the last week of October, the price of BTC consolidated above the $13,000 mark for the first time since December 2017 — coinciding with a massive increase in transactions being sent to the mempool and resulting in a backlog of unconfirmed transactions.With network activity subsiding over the course of a bullish week, Bitcoin users are being encouraged to take advantage of current conditions by performing transactions that may be too expensive to perform with higher fees, such as opening Lightning Network channels and consolidating inputs."
589,"For the past two days, Bitcoin price has traded within the $14,800–$15,500 range, but the top digital asset has struggled to flip $15,500 to support. A positive is that Bitcoin (BTC) continues to make higher lows, and at the time of writing, the price is trying to break from the range but still encountering resistance at $15,500.While BTC price has bounced back and forth, altcoins and select DeFi tokens have capitalized on the consolidation phase and turned bullish.DeFi having a day

Top 3: $YAX + 73%$MTA + 35%$BZRX + 19% pic.twitter.com/km4jqZuSCXAs Messari pointed out earlier today in a tweet, DeFi tokens such as Yearn.finance's YFI, Aave's AAVE, Balancer's BAL and Uniswap's UNI are all up by double digits. Most notably, YFI has gained roughly 160% after bottoming at $7,444 on Nov. 5, and in the past two days, AAVE went on an absolute tear as the token rallied 175% from $25.87 to $70.91.Aside from these tokens, a handful of tokens with smaller market capitalizations on decentralized exchanges are also racking up gains, and data from Dune Analytics signals that investors are beginning to become more active in the DeFi space again.As DEX volumes increase, so do the number of daily active users, and today, the sector reached a new record as DeFi Pulse noted that the total value locked in DEX platforms has surged to $12.87 billion.While it is probably too early to call for an alt season, Ether (ETH) has turned bullish again, and within the last three hours, the altcoin broke through its pennant structure and rallied to $466.60.Analysts have also noted that the ETH/BTC pair broke from its downtrend and is currently climbing higher toward the 0.32323 sats resistance.Historically, altcoins tend to rally when Bitcoin price is sideways, and Ether’s strengthening fundamentals could be a sign that DeFi and altcoins may be on the verge of a trend change.For the short term, traders will be watching to see if BTC can turn the $15,500–$16,000 level to support, as this is likely to pull a few bullish altcoins higher. Alternatively, if BTC price remains sideways over the coming days, there could be a continued advance from the top DeFi tokens and a handful of altcoins."
590,"Mainstream U.S. media outlet CBS is airing a documentary tonight on the takedown of the Silk Road dark web marketplace.It features an interview with Julia Vie, former girlfriend of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht who claims 'Dread Pirate Roberts' wasn’t motivated by money — to the point where he didn't even own a car — and that he was not a drug pusher.In 2015 Ulbricht was found guilty of charges including aiding and abetting the distribution of narcotics, fraudulent ID trafficking, and money laundering in 2015 and received two life sentences plus 40 years.There are calls for his release in an ongoing campaign popular with some in the crypto community. Proponents claim that he should be freed as he was a first-time offender, and all charges were non-violent in nature.The FBI Declassified: The Dangerous Journey on the Silk Road’ aims to bring viewers closer to the FBI investigation that took down the illicit marketplace that brought Bitcoin into public consciousness as the primary method of payment.In the documentary FBI special agents discuss how the Silk Road was used for all kinds of illicit activity such as the sales of drugs, weapons, poisons, computer hacking services, and even discussion on murders-for-hire.Julie Vie says in excerpts released from the documentary that she remembered him coming up with the name.She added that he spent ""practically 24/7"" on his computer and their relationship fell apart soon after Ulbricht launched Silk Road. Stating that she knew it was something shady, but had no idea it was as big as it was, Vie continued;FBI agents working on the case cited drug addiction and deaths as the primary reason the government wanted to shut down Silk Road. After several failed attempts, they finally got lucky through a ""coding error on the site"" that ultimately led them to Ulbricht.In the interview, Vie stated that Ulbricht was not street smart, adding;Last week the United States Department of Justice seized around $1 billion in Bitcoin and a handful of other cryptocurrencies from a  Silk Road wallet that had been untouched since 2015."
591,"New data from Whalemap suggests that in order to maintain bullish momentum, the Bitcoin price needs to hold above the $14,914 level.Whale clusters, like the bubbles shown on the chart below, form when high-net-worth investors purchase Bitcoin and do not move them. This indicates that whales accumulated BTC at that level and suggests that it will likely remain as a support area in the event of a correction.As such, in the near term, it is crucial for Bitcoin to remain above $14,914 for a prolonged period. It would signify consolidation under a multiyear resistance at $16,000 and stability above a major support level.Throughout the past week, Bitcoin has seen unusual price action and been quite volatile in a broad range.From Nov. 6 to Nov. 9, BTC tested the $16,000 level twice and fell to as low as $14,350. This short-term volatility was likely connected a range of macro events, including the contested U.S. election results. There have been a number of big risks in the market since early November. The election risk noticeably benefited Bitcoin as investors sought out safe-haven assets. Then, Pfizer’s vaccine breakthrough became an unexpected variable, causing Bitcoin and gold to plunge.Despite these uncertainties, Bitcoin has remained comfortably above $13,600, a level which Whalemap analysts pinpointed. They wrote:In the short term, the $13,600 to $14,914 range remains the most important for Bitcoin’s rally to continue. So far, the momentum of BTC has been relatively strong, considering that miners have been selling.As Cointelegraph previously reported, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said in an interview that miners have been selling Bitcoin. Based on the resilience of BTC, new buyer demand likely countered the selling pressure coming from miners.Bitcoin is seeing massive volatility because the market is uncertain. Some on-chain indicators are signaling that BTC is entering an oversold zone where investors could take profit. Philip Swift, a cryptocurrency analyst, wrote:But other fundamental metrics indicate that Bitcoin is still in the early phase of a bull run. For instance, HODLing activity is continuing to increase and research suggests that smart money has been fueling most of the uptrend.The lack of clarity in the direction of Bitcoin is being shown by both the unusual price action and the mixed messages of on-chain data points. Nonetheless, as long as the top cryptocurrency stays above $14,914, at least In the short term, the outlook remains cautiously optimistic."
592,"Thousands of different cryptocurrencies have arisen in the since Bitcoin’s (BTC) 2009 genesis block. Even though newer assets come with different technology and new bells and whistles, Bitcoin still has an upper hand in a key category, according to a November report from crypto data firm Coin Metrics. Due to its relatively older framework, people sometimes compare Bitcoin to early, outdated versions of other technological innovations such as dial-up internet, the report explains: Technological ability is important. Cryptocurrencies, with their underlying blockchains and ecosystems, however, also serve as forms of money or value in addition to their technological undergirding. Therefore, asset distribution plays a key role in the equation, the report notes. Cryptocurrencies have visited countless headlines over the last decade, especially in 2017, when many alternative crypto assets posted tremendous gains for holders. Many people and teams have produced their own digital assets, some of which compete against Bitcoin’s value proposition.When Bitcoin became a more well-known name, however, organic asset growth became difficult. Once people saw viability for new assets, what stopped them from allocating different amounts of their created asset to certain groups, including specific friends or investors? Essentially, since some type of financial worth is expected at the start of any freshly created asset now, such new assets lack even distribution among people. Coin Metrics’ report peers into centralization seen in cryptocurrency holdings via data from those assets’ respective blockchains. “Cronyism, amongst other unfair supply distribution models, inescapably result in incredibly centralized monetary bases,” the report explains. “Through on-chain data, we can identify ownership structures antithetical to Bitcoin’s and quantify the degree of wealth centralization within their digital economies,” the report adds. Essentially, Bitcoin started as an experiment unlike anything before its time. Very few people understood how the asset worked at its outset. “There wasn’t even an exchange rate for the earliest of adopters to begin to fathom valuing their Bitcoins,” Coin Metrics explained: Through charts and examples, the report explains Bitcoin’s early journey, which yielded vast coin distribution. Mining activities have also impacted the asset’s dispersion. The data in the report, however, relies heavily on crypto wallet address analysis. Participants sometimes use a number of wallets and addresses, so accuracy of the results remains questionable. Crypto analyst, trader and YouTuber Tone Vays has also expressed similar points in the past about Bitcoin’s decentralization. Last month marked the 12-year anniversary of Bitcoin’s white paper release. "
593,"Typically, traders become skeptical after Bitcoin (BTC) ""completes"" a strong performance like the stellar move from $12,000 to $15,950 seen over the past few weeks. The 35% gain over the past 30 days led some traders to conclude that BTC is over-extended and in need of a pullback. On the other hand, there are plenty of traders who are confident that the current bull run can continue.Generally, the market is displaying mixed signals as Bitcoin price fluctuates between $15,000 to $16,000, so many traders are left to rely on their bias to confirm their investment decisions, and this is a dangerous place to be.Take, for example, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which currently displays 90, a reflection of “90, Extreme Greed.” Many traders countertrade the index when it shows polar extremes, meaning ""extreme greed"" is a signal to take profits or go short, as it usually “means the market is due for a correction,” according to the webpage.Adding to this, both on-chain and crypto exchange outflow data has led analyst Willy Woo to conclude that “a blow-off top is unlikely to happen.” To settle this data dispute, an investor could take a closer look at exchanges of top clients (or top traders) long-to-short ratio.Take notice how top traders at Binance have been reacting after Bitcoin’s movements. The chart suggests traders are responding to price it rather than trying to predict it. One should expect this movement from more novice traders who buy the local tops and sell the dips.It is worth noting that each exchange treats top traders' data differently, as there are multiple ways to measure clients' net exposure using derivatives. Therefore, any comparison between different providers should be made on percentage changes instead of absolute numbers.Interestingly, OKEx data shows a different approach by top traders as Bitcoin rallied above $15,800. Instead of blindly following price movements, those investors seem to be waiting up to two days before changing their strategy.Although, this strategy seems smarter, at first sight, adding long positions as Bitcoin failed to sustain the $15,600 level. There seems to be less desperation compared with the reactive behavior of Binance traders. Despite this, there still are no signs of confidence in OKEx long-to-short positioning.Regardless of the success rate of these strategies, the long-to-short ratio at both exchanges shows traders do not feel too confident about Bitcoin’s current price action. Although both seem to be currently sitting at a slightly net long position, their stance changes as the market sentiment moves.When facing mixed signals, traders should avoid trying to find further evidence to corroborate their views. Doing nothing sometimes is the best decision one can make, especially when even pro traders seem to be changing their positions after small trend changes.On-chain analysis, exchanges’ net flows, and indicators such as the Fear and Greed Index are useful. Nevertheless, they should not be excluded from one’s analysis when providing conflicting messages.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
594,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has seen extreme volatility in the past 24 hours. After the Dow Jones Industrial Average abruptly rose by more than 800 points, BTC plunged in tandem with gold. Within five hours of achieving a four-day peak at $15,840, the dominant cryptocurrency abruptly plummeted 6.5%. Following the correction of BTC, analysts and traders remain divided on its near-future prospects.The short-term pullback of Bitcoin, which happened within several hours, was beneficial for BTC for three key reasons. First, it neutralized the derivatives market, which is no longer overheated. Second, it led to a healthy rejection of the $16,000 resistance level. Third, it showed that even after a major price drop, overall buyer demand remains intact.On Nov. 9, Bitcoin saw a sharp drop from $15,840 to $14,805, which occurred shortly after Pfizer announced its optimistic COVID-19 drug trial results, having tested nearly 44,000 individuals and demonstrated 90% effectiveness. Subsequent to the announcement by Pfizer, major U.S. stock market indices rallied by around 3%.The highly anticipated breakthrough in the vaccine’s development caused Bitcoin and gold to rapidly drop. Capital flew out of safe-haven assets and stores of value to risk-on assets, like stocks, in a short period. Consequently, gold recorded an intraday 4.5% drop, which is rare for an asset of its size. It sparked the appetite for stocks and other risk-on assets, which gave Bitcoin whales a narrative to sell.When Bitcoin initially started dropping, whale inflows into cryptocurrency exchanges began to increase. This meant that high-net-worth investors holding large amounts of BTC were selling. Since Bitcoin recovered back above $15,300 within six hours, whales likely bought back at a lower price. Based on the trend, it’s probable that whales used the narrative of the vaccine-induced correction to sell at resistance and buy at a lower price.Speaking to Cointelegraph, Bitcoin technical analyst Eric Thies said that Bitcoin has essentially been fluctuating between two levels: the $14,500 support and $16,000 resistance. Bitcoin rejected heavily as it approached $16,000, indicating that there are large sell orders present at the $16,000 resistance area. If BTC sees some consolidation under $16,000, Thies noted that it would be beneficial for buyers:The short-term drop of Bitcoin was also critical to reset the futures market. Prior to the drop, the funding rate of BTC futures contracts across major exchanges was well over the average 0.01%. This meant that the vast majority of the market was heavily longing or buying Bitcoin. After the correction, the funding rate returned back to 0.01%, showing that the futures market is no longer overheated.According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, the long-term prospect of Bitcoin remains positive. Ki told Cointelegraph that the exchange inflow mean shows the Bitcoin market is “still in a strong buy zone.” The exchange inflows show the amount of BTC that traders and investors are transferring to exchanges. When this figure remains low, it typically indicates lower selling pressure on exchanges.However, Ki said that after Bitcoin’s drop, BTC inflows from whales have been spotted. While this is an ostensibly bearish trend, the analyst noted that whales tend to sell BTC regularly during bull trends. Since whales seek liquidity, they prefer to sell when the price is going up to ensure there is enough buyer demand in the market. Although the trend could be bearish, depending on one’s perception, Ki said it’s unlikely to be a market sentiment reversal, for now:Analysts and traders are generally echoing a similar stance in that large dips during Bitcoin bull trends are normal. Thies explained that he expects Bitcoin to achieve a new all-time high at $20,000 in January 2021 or February 2021. Still, Thies emphasized that large dips have always occurred during previous bull cycles. Even during the 2017 rally, when BTC neared $20,000, BTC saw several short-term 20%–30% drops.If Bitcoin continues to consolidate with decent momentum, Thies said buyers are safe from a major drop. Unless BTC sees a lower low formation, which occurs when BTC drops below the most recent bottom, the technical analyst said BTC could avoid a deep correction:Various on-chain data metrics show that both miners and whales have been selling BTC. The Miners’ Position Index on CryptoQuant hit a yearly high on Nov. 5, indicating rising selling pressure from miners. Yet, the price of Bitcoin has stayed relatively stable above $15,000 throughout the past week, apart from several days.This trend shows that new buyer demand is offsetting the selling pressure coming from whales and miners. According to analysts at Santiment, around $365 million worth of Tether (USDT) has moved to exchanges daily in the last seven days. Since most of the sidelined capital within the crypto market is stored in stablecoins, it suggests that new buyers are entering the market.In the short term, however, one concerning metric that could cause Bitcoin to consolidate for longer is the relative unrealized profit/loss indicator. Philip Swift, the creator of educational platform Look Into Bitcoin, said BTC is hovering in the “greed” zone on the indicator, which, basically, measures how much unrealized profit investors currently hold."
595,"Cryptocurrency-related crimes have slowed down in 2020, but some sectors within the crypto industry have become a new hotbed for criminal activity, a new report says.Citing major crypto analytics firm CipherTrace, Reuters reported on Nov. 10 that total losses from crypto thefts, hacks and fraud dropped from $4.4 billion in 2019 to $1.8 billion over the first 10 months of 2020.CipherTrace CEO Dave Jevans said that the general decline of criminal activity in the crypto industry is a result of increased security measures:Despite a major decline in crypto crimes this year, CipherTrace reported a notable growth of hacking incidents in decentralized finance, or DeFi. While DeFi hacks were “virtually negligible” in 2019, they now account for 20% of crypto losses from thefts and hacks, CipherTrace analysts found. “The surge in DeFi was what ultimately attracted criminal hackers, resulting in the most hacks for the sector this year,” the report states.Jevans said that the DeFi industry has also become a “haven for money launderers.” Since DeFi projects are permissionless by design, they often lack the security verification tools of centralized projects. Jevans stated:CipherTrace’s latest analysis confirms previous reports that cryptocurrency hacks have been on the decline in 2020. In late October, VPN provider Atlas VPN released a study claiming that the number of blockchain-related hacks in the first half of 2020 dropped more than three times compared to the same period in 2019."
596,"United States’ retail giant Overstock is expanding its blockchain wing tZero with new hires in Ireland.The Utah-based e-commerce company is seeking to hire software and devops engineers to work on its blockchain and security token subsidiary tZero, local tech news agency Silicon Republic reported on Nov. 10.As reported, the new hires for tZero are part of a new team at Overstock’s headquarters in Sligo in western Ireland. The online retail company already employs 90 people working in AI, research and development, and machine learning.Amit Goyal, chief technology officer at tZero, told Cointelegraph that Ireland is the only country outside the United States where the firm has a presence. Goyal said that tZero has already made its first hire in Ireland; a principal software engineer. Senior development manager at Overstock John Forde said that tZero operates in a “fast-growing digital securities market,” stating:According to Overstock’s Q3 2020 earnings report, tZero increased its revenue by 97% year-on-year to $11.1 million in the first quarter of 2020. However, tZero was still unprofitable, losing $12.3 million in Q3.Overstock was one of the first major mainstream companies to announce Bitcoin (BTC) support. After launching tZero security token exchange in late 2016, Overstock also completed a $134 million initial coin offering for tZero in August 2018."
597,"Billionaires have been increasingly accumulating Bitcoin (BTC) in recent months. Following Paul Tudor Jones’ lead, hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller became the latest billionaire to publicly disclose his Bitcoin investment.There are four main reasons Bitcoin is becoming more compelling to high-net-worth investors. The reasons are Bitcoin’s effectiveness as a portfolio diversifier, inflation hedge, gold alternative and large risk-reward potential.Gold is an important store of value and a safe-haven asset for institutional investors. It serves as a hedge against inflation and as a hedge against a potential market downside.Investors consider gold as more of a method of insurance to protect a portfolio from market corrections and macro uncertainty. As such, safe-haven assets typically do not return large gains in the short to medium term.Bitcoin has the potential to achieve both, as it is evolving into a safe-haven asset with massive growth potential.Gold’s market capitalization is estimated to be around $9 trillion. In contrast, Bitcoin is valued at $285 billion, leaving a large gap between the two assets’ valuations.In an interview with CNBC on Nov. 9, Druckenmiller emphasized that the brand of Bitcoin as a store of value only improves as time passes. He said:During his interview, Druckenmiller noted that he owns “many many more times gold” than Bitcoin. But the billionaire investor emphasized that if gold rises, Bitcoin would also see massive gains and “probably work better.”Compared to gold, the dominant cryptocurrency is “thinner” and “more illiquid,” the investor said. Hence, there is larger upside potential, even if Bitcoin composes of a smaller percentage of a portfolio than gold.Bitcoin also goes through a block reward halving every four years. Since the cryptocurrency has a fixed supply of 21 million, the rate at which BTC is mined daily reduces by 50% after each halving.If the supply of Bitcoin declines but the demand for it increases, it could cause a supply squeeze in the long term, resulting in higher prices.The price of Bitcoin is often inversely correlated with the U.S. dollar index. Like gold, when the dollar drops, BTC tends to increase.Over the long term, investors including Tudor Jones consider Bitcoin as an ideal inflation play. Particularly after the Federal Reserve introduced the average 2% inflation target strategy, BTC has become more attractive to institutions hedging against inflation.Bitcoin does not have to be a singled-out investment. It has historically performed well as a portfolio asset, returning decent gains to a balanced stock-based portfolio. Last month, Dan Tapiero, the co-founder of 10T Holdings, wrote:The combination of the abovementioned four factors are making Bitcoin an increasingly attractive portfolio asset for money managers.Raoul Pal, the CEO of Real Vision Group, further noted that investors like Druckenmiller longing Bitcoin should not be understated in what may be a watershed moment. He said:"
598,"Altcoin traders continue to feel the pain as Bitcoin (BTC) gains, while Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hits new all-time lows. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and other sources show that as of Nov. 10, BCH is worth less in BTC terms than ever before.At press time, BCH/BTC traded at 0.017 BTC, comfortably beating its previous record low of 0.0245 BTC seen in December 2018.The hard fork of Bitcoin has seen little attention this year, as investors focused on Bitcoin and then the decentralized finance phenomenon. The announcement of another hard fork of the Bitcoin Cash network, set for Nov. 15, has done little to buoy the coin’s prospects, data shows.In USD terms, Bitcoin Cash has spent the past three months fluctuating in a corridor between $230 and $280, while Bitcoin itself has increased by a third in value.Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin proponents took a dim view of the upcoming hard fork, something which has sparked a familiar tussle between businesses opting to support or reject the resulting new coins.“Hopefully this election drama will clear up before the next scheduled shitcoin drama: T minus 10 days to the next bcash fracture!” CasaHODL co-founder Jameson Lopp summarized on Twitter last week as the hard fork was confirmed.For Litecoin (LTC), price data shows a similar story. LTC/USD traded at 0.0038 BTC on Nov. 10, increasingly close to its extant bottom of 0.003 BTC from March 2017.On the weekly chart, the pair printed its lowest close in history this month.Noting the lack of performance by both Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash since PayPal confirmed that it would support both assets along with Bitcoin from 2021, one popular Twitter account summed up the mood among those who favor BTC.“We think it’s a bad business decision and also morally and ethically bankrupt for PayPal to allow retail customers to purchase BCH and LTC,” it wrote on Nov. 5.Some traders continue to forecast the return of “alt season” next year, although prospects remain bleak for the near term. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s market cap dominance has reached 64%, its highest since June."
599,"The hash power of the Bitcoin (BTC) network has jumped by roughly 30% over the past 24 hours, which, if sustained, suggests a major difficulty adjustment may soon be incoming.According to Coinwarz, Bitcoin’s hash rate currently sits at 157.5 exahashes per second, or EH/s, after briefly pushing above 160 EH/s. As of this writing, BTC hash power has increased by 42% in two days.The spike follows a sharp decline in hash power in late October, which many analysts attributed to the end of the rainy season in the Chinese mining hub of Sichuan. The province’s abundant and cheap hydroelectric power is estimated to attract around 80% of Chinese miners during the wet season. In December, CoinShares estimated that Sichuan accounted for 54% of global mining activity.Quantum Economics analyst Jason Deane speculated that the sudden increase in Bitcoin hash power could be a sign that many Chinese miners have completed their migration from Sichuan and restored operations in other local mining hubs such as Xinjian and Inner Mongolia.Whoa! big jump in #bitcoin hash rate over last 10 hours (+29.7% trough to peak) Large number of machines just came online somewhere, relocated Sichuan region miners possibly? pic.twitter.com/UKahgQ37TmThe sudden spike in mining activity suggests the network is likely to produce another significant difficulty adjustment. A major upward adjustment would come at the chagrin of non-Chinese miners who have been enjoying boosted profits after October’s apparent migration from Sichuan resulted in a 16% negative difficulty adjustment — the second-largest downwards adjustment in Bitcoin’s history.Earlier this week, the world’s largest generator of hydroelectric power for the private-sector, Russian firm En+ Group, announced it would be launching a cryptocurrency mining venture in partnership with local company BitRiver."
600,"A former Microsoft engineer has been sentenced to nine years for stealing more than $10 million in digital value from his past employer in the form of “currency stored value,"" or CSV, including gift cards.Volodymyr Kvashuk, a 26-year-old Ukrainian citizen residing in Washington, used the accounts and identities of his fellow employees to steal and then sell the CSV — making it appear as though his co-workers were responsible for the fraud. Kvashuk also used a Bitcoin (BTC) mixing service to further obfuscate the paper trail, telling the Internal Revenue Service that the $2.8 million worth of crypto that passed through his accounts gifts had been sent from a relative. According to the United States Department of Justice:Kvashuk worked at Microsoft from August 2016 until being fired in June 2018.According to IRS special agent Ryan Korner, the sentencing is “the nation’s first Bitcoin case that has a tax component to it.” Korner asserted that the sentencing highlights the increasing sophistication of the agency’s criminal division in identifying unreported crypto asset transactions:Brian Moran of the U.S. Attorney’s Office said: “Stealing from your employer is bad enough, but stealing and making it appear that your colleagues are to blame widens the damage beyond dollars and cents.”Kvushuk has been found guilty of 18 federal felonies including six counts of money laundering and two counts of filing false tax returns. The Ukrainian used the stolen funds to purchase a $1.6 million lake-front home and $160,000 Tesla vehicle.Tax evasion charges have been leveled at numerous criminal schemes throughout U.S. history. Prohibition-era gangster boss Al Capone famously spent seven years in federal prison from 1931 after being found guilty of evading taxes."
601,"As Bitcoin (BTC) blasted through the $14,000 level, its market capitalization surpassed the monetary base of the Russian ruble. This measure includes both physical currency and bank reserves, both of which are typically held by a country’s central banks.The above chart may seem complicated at first glance, but it simply compares gold, silver, Bitcoin and the remaining global monetary bases. We can see that the U.S. has $4.9 trillion physical notes, coins, and bank deposits parked at the Federal Reserve. By dividing this number by the current 18.5 million outstanding BTC, we reach the $263,000 stated above.In order for Bitcoin’s market capitalization to match the U.S. base money figure, the price would need to surpass $263,000. Although this might seem far-fetched, BTC has already eclipsed multiple sovereign currencies like the Brazilian real, the Swedish krona and the South Korean won.This move is no small feat for a cryptocurrency that is only 11 years old. According to Fernando Ulrich, the economist behind Crypto Voices, the top 30 base money competitors cover 95% of GDP. Aside from the Euro covering many countries, some of the top 113 peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar.Researchers at Crypto Voices concluded that:The researchers elaborated by saying:Some might interpret the analysis as bearish, but it’s actually the opposite.The researchers at Crypto Voices infer that, so far, central banks and governments have maintained their ability to print money regardless of their gold holdings. Therefore, there is no pressure to seek a new “gold standard” or anything remotely similar.As the researchers perfectly summarize, inflation depreciates fiat currencies little by little. This caused Bitcoin to surpass a number of currencies as they succumbed to excessive printing. In fact, 2020 had the most extensive global base money expansion ever registered.As clearly shown above, the global money supply increased by $5.5 trillion in 2020. That’s a 28% expansion, while Bitcoin has maintained its halving calendar, cutting its issuing by 50%.The big question on the minds of investors is whether Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow model will prevail. According to some critics, there are several flaws in the assumption that BTC will reach $100,000 and higher in 2021 and beyond.The ruble has fallen, as have many other sovereign currencies, so now all eyes are on the Canadian dollar. As shown in the fiat base money supply chart, the Canadian dollar’s base money stands at $335 billion, which is equivalent to an $18,000 Bitcoin price.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

602,"Bitcoin’s long-waited bull run and the recent wave of corporate and institutional investors allocating significant portions of their reserves to Bitcoin (BTC) are all signs that the pace of crypto’s mainstreaming is rapidly accelerating: But has the path to mass adoption come at the cost of privacy and decentralization? Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering laws have forced the majority of cryptocurrency exchanges to become more transparent about who their users are, and those who refused have had to limit the jurisdictions in which they can offer services.In order to operate legally in many countries, many exchanges have had no choice other than to abide by strict AML procedures, and aside from Monero (XMR), swathes of privacy coins have been delisted from most major exchanges.Recently, regulators have begun to crack the whip and jurisdictions around the world continue to propagate further measures to ensure investors disclose their crypto holdings and pay taxes on their profits.And this is all happening as the United States Department of Justice arrested the co-founder of BitMEX and the CFTC charged its owners with running an illegal crypto derivatives exchange.Roughly a week later, the Financial Conduct Authority, the United Kingdom’s top regulatory watchdog, went as far as to ban investors from derivatives trading at all crypto exchanges.All of these maneuvers are designed to force compliance on crypto service providers, and while they may eventually assist with furthering mass adoption, many crypto ideologues are looking for alternatives to press their case for financial self-sovereignty.A growing number of investors feel that centralized crypto exchanges essentially operate in the same manner as traditional banks. As a response to this, decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap, 1inch, Curve Finance and Balancer grew in popularity throughout 2020.For more sophisticated investors, decentralized exchanges offering derivatives trading have also become available. Similar to traditional derivatives, crypto exchanges offering the service essentially act as the broker, but the process is marginally different on decentralized exchanges. This is because they utilize smart contracts in place of a broker, and the derivatives contracts are settled when the contract terms have been met.At the moment, Synthetix is one of the most popular decentralized derivatives exchanges, and in 2020, it saw its total value locked rise to $1 billion before a sharp sector-wide correction led to a drop in TVL and daily active users at the majority of DEXs.The exchange allows users to create an instrument called a synthetic asset “Synth” that can track gold, fiat and cryptocurrencies. It also allows the creation of assets that track the price of assets inversely.Platform users can also stake the native SNX token as collateral in order to mint new synths, and similar to Uniswap, those who provide liquidity are rewarded by earning a portion of the exchange’s transaction fees.Those familiar with DEXs like Uniswap will know that literally, anyone can list a new asset, which, in the case of derivatives, means any underlying asset can be transformed into a derivatives instrument.These platforms allow users to trade derivatives without the need to deposit funds in any centralized platform, and they are not required to complete any KYC procedures.While some investors shun KYC and tax compliance, this is a serious matter for crypto service providers. According to Molly Wintermute, an anonymous developer credited with founding Hegic DEX, compliance is more of an issue for centralized crypto service providers, not DEXs.When asked how DEXs can remain compliant with financial regulators, Wintermute bluntly explained in a unique vernacular that:Wintermute further explained that decentralized derivatives are alluring to a particular subset of investors because:According to Wintermute, the number of investors actually using DEXs is quite small, compared to the total number of crypto investors. To Wintermute, this means the FCA derivatives ban and the recent legal actions taken against BitMEX are completely irrelevant and non-applicable to decentralized finance protocols.Wintermute said:After being pressed to elaborate on the chance that the SEC, FCA or other regulators might not attempt to shut down a platform such as Uniswap and arrest its founders, Wintermute said:Wintermute also appeared to shake off the recent BitMEX scandal, sharply replying that:Ultimately, Wintermute believes that “Bakkt/CME & other wall s--- guys r so angry that no one uses their s----- products that they now takin’ crypto entrepreneurs & tryin’ 2 send them 2 jail.”The anonymous developer then explained that in her view, the “meta game is 2 ban every cool crypto products & try 2 cannibalize on their user base but with compliant s----- products.”While there may be merit to some of Wintermute’s bold assertions, the arm of the law is quite long, and as we have seen with the now-defunct ICO era, bringing those who violate securities laws takes time.In 2020, the total value locked in DeFi platforms has risen to $12.6 billion, and data from Dune Analytics shows that Uniswap processed $11.2 billion in volume in October. These massive figures are sure to catch the eye of U.S. and international regulators so it may only be a matter of time before legal action is taken against DEXs.In addition to addressing privacy concerns and restoring decentralization to the crypto sector, DEXs also provide a sandbox for layer-two developers to play in. As has been thoroughly reported by Cointelegraph, scaling within the Ethereum network has been a persistent challenge.When the network becomes congested during high demand periods, gas fees increase exponentially, and transaction speeds grind to a halt. With Ethereum 2.0 in perceptual “development,” a number of DEXs have begun to experiment with integrating layer-two solutions to provide users who are willing to forgo the Ethereum network with cheaper, faster options.Project Serum is probably one of the better-known success stories for a non-Ethereum based DEX.The decentralized derivatives-based project is built on the Solana blockchain instead of the default Ethereum network that most DEXs operate on, but it is also fully interoperable with ERC-20-based assets and Bitcoin.FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and his team are the brains behind Project Serum, and according to Bankman-Fried, the project is designed to circumvent the privacy and safety concerns of centralized exchanges by giving users a permissionless method to invest with leverage and swap assets.The project also provides a cheaper alternative to the high gas fees and slow transaction speeds that frequently plague the Ethereum network during periods of high traffic.Bankman-Fried said:According to Bankman-Fried, technical issues such as congestion and high fees can make or break an investor. Regarding high fees, he said:Bankman-Fried also agreed with Wintermute’s claim that hardly anyone is using DEXs, as “the vast majority of derivatives volume is on centralized exchanges,” but he suggested that in theory, “composability and self-custody” should be incentives for more users to join the movement.Currently, investors have shifted their attention back to Bitcoin as the digital asset pursues a new all-time high, and data from Cointelegraph and Digital Assets Data indicate that DEX trading volume and daily active users continue to decline.While this is likely disappointing to investors, it at least provides developers some quiet time to focus on properly integrating layer-two solutions to DeFi protocols.The trend of major cryptocurrency exchanges becoming more centralized is unlikely to change anytime soon. This means that the first DEX to successfully provide a platform with low fees, privacy protections and a fast user-friendly interface will rule supreme once investors make the choice to invest in decentralized finance and decentralized derivatives again."
603,"Professional traders are often perceived to be the smartest, as they weigh the risks before investing in an asset class. Opposite to that, most retail traders only keep an eye on the possible profits and disregard the risk before investing.Therefore, the increase in the number of Bitcoin (BTC) addresses holding more than 100 Bitcoin to a seven-month high, at 16,271, could be considered as a bullish sign. Furthermore, the low search volume for the keyword “Bitcoin” suggests that the current rally lacks the frenzied retail buying seen during the previous bull market in 2017.PlanB, the creator of the stock-to-flow model, has maintained his bullish stance on Bitcoin, as he expects the price to at least rally to $100,000 by December 2021. If that happens, Bitcoin would command a market capitalization of about $2 trillion.While crypto analysts are voicing bullish forecasts for Bitcoin, noted economist and Bitcoin skeptic Nouriel Roubini remains bearish, as he anticipates central bank digital currencies to start a big revolution in about three years. Thereafter, “Not only you don’t need crypto, you don’t even need Venmo,” said Roubini in a recent interview.In other news, U.S. equity markets surged higher on the positive news that Pfizer is recording success in its COVID-19 vaccine trials. As the news broke, gold and Bitcoin prices corrected sharply, but it appears that crypto investors are viewing the dips as buying opportunities.Let’s take a look at the top crypto assets to see how they are performing today.Bitcoin (BTC) is in an uptrend but is currently facing stiff resistance near $16,000. The failure to rise above the overhead resistance could attract profit-booking from the short-term traders and shorting by the aggressive bears.If the BTC/USD pair breaks below $15,650, it could drop to the critical support at $14,000. The 20-day exponential moving average ($13,935) is placed just below this support; hence, the bulls are likely to defend this level aggressively.A strong bounce off the 20-day EMA will indicate accumulation by the bulls at lower levels. The price could remain stuck between $14,000 and $16,000 for a few days before starting the next trending move.If the bulls can push the price above $16,000, a rally to $17,200 and then to all-time highs is possible. Conversely, a break below the 20-day EMA could result in a fall to the 50-day simple moving average ($12,137).The bulls are struggling to push the price above the resistance line of the rising wedge pattern. Ether (ETH) formed an inside day candlestick pattern on Nov. 8 and is currently trading in a tight range. This suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears.If the bears sink the price below $432, the possibility of a drop to the 20-day EMA ($409) increases. A break below the support line of the wedge will indicate an advantage to the bears.However, the upsloping 20-day EMA and the relative strength index in the positive zone suggest an advantage to the bulls. If they can push the price above the wedge, the ETH/USD pair could rally to $488.134.A breakout of this resistance could resume the uptrend with the next target at $520 and then $550.XRP attempted to break out of the range on Nov. 7 but the bears pushed the price right back in. The bulls are currently attempting to defend the moving averages. If they succeed, another attempt to push the price above $0.26 is likely.If the price sustains above $0.26 for a day, the XRP/USD pair could start a new uptrend with the first target objective at $0.30.However, the flat moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. If the price slips below the moving averages, the pair could remain range-bound between $0.26 and $0.2295 for the next few days.A break below the $0.2295 to $0.219712 support zone will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) broke above $272 for the past two days but could not sustain the higher levels. The repeated price rejection shows that the bears are aggressively defending the $272–$280 resistance zone.If the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($257), the BCH/USD pair could drop to $242 and then to $231. Such a move will indicate the possibility of a range-bound action between $231 and $280 for a few days.However, the upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest a minor advantage to the bulls. If the bulls can push the price above the overhead resistance zone, a rally to $300 and then to $326.30 is possible.The bulls tried to propel Chainlink's LINK above the $13.28 resistance on Nov. 7 but failed. However, the positive thing is that the altcoin bounced off the 20-day EMA ($11.46) and the bulls are again trying to push the price above the overhead resistance.If they succeed, it will complete a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern that has a target objective of $19.2731. The 20-day EMA ($11.46) has started to turn up gradually, and the RSI is in the positive territory, which suggests a minor advantage to the bulls.However, if the price again turns down from the overhead resistance, the bears will try to sink the LINK/USD pair below the moving averages. If they succeed, a drop to $9.7665 is possible.Binance Coin (BNB) has been stuck between $32 and $25.6652 for the past few days. The bulls attempted to push the price above the moving averages on Nov. 7, but they failed.The downsloping 20-day EMA ($28) and the RSI in negative territory suggest that bears have the upper hand. If the price sustains below the moving averages, a drop to $25.6652 is possible.A bounce off this support could extend the stay inside the range for a few more days, while a break below it could start a new downtrend.This negative view will be invalidated if the BNB/USD pair turns up from the current levels and breaks above $30. Such a move could result in a rally to $32.Litecoin (LTC) once again turned down from the stiff overhead resistance of $64 on Nov. 7. Barring the breakout on Aug. 17, the price has turned down from this resistance on three occasions.The RSI is forming a bearish divergence, which suggests that the momentum may be weakening.If the LTC/USD pair turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and plummets below the 20-day EMA ($56), it will increase the possibility of a drop to the 50-day SMA ($50).On the other hand, if the pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above $64. If they succeed, a rally to $68.9008 is possible.Polkadot's DOT is currently trading inside a small range that has resistance at $4.95 and support at $3.80. The price turned down from $4.8586 on Nov. 7, which shows that the bears are aggressively defending this level.However, the bulls are trying to keep the price above the moving averages, and the RSI has also taken support at the 50 level. If the RSI can break out of the downtrend line, it will indicate an advantage to the bulls.If buyers can push the price above $4.95, a rally to $5.5899 is likely. The bears may again defend this level aggressively, but if the bulls can thrust the price above it, a new uptrend could begin.Cardano's ADA turned down from the $0.1142241 resistance on Nov. 7, which shows that the bears are aggressively defending this level. However, the positive thing is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the moving averages.The strong rebound off the moving averages on Nov. 8 shows that the sentiment is to buy the dips. The bulls will again attempt to push the price above the overhead resistance. If they can pull it off, the ADA/USD pair could rally to $0.128 and then to $0.1445.On the contrary, if the price again turns down from $0.1142241, then the range-bound action may continue for a few more days. A break below the moving averages will signal weakness, and the bears will then try to sink the pair below $0.0893.Bitcoin SV (BSV) continues to trade inside the broad range of $146 to $181. The price has been oscillating above and below the moving averages for the past three days, which shows that traders are undecided about the next move.The flat moving averages and the RSI close to the halfway mark suggest a balance between supply and demand. If the price sustains below the moving averages, the bears will try to sink the BSV/USD pair to the critical support at $146.A rebound off this level could extend the range-bound action for a few more days. The trend will shift in favor of the bulls if they can push the price above the overhead resistance at $181.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

604,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) rose to as high as $15,840 before crashing to $14,800. Just five hours after reaching an intraday top, the dominant cryptocurrency dropped over 6%. This massive spike in volatility was likely caused by three major factors.The three catalysts for the abrupt downtrend were the recovery of the dollar, the decline in gold price as Pfizer announced that its COVID-19 vaccine trials are producing positive results, and whales dumping BTC.According to the Associated Press, Pfizer announced that the third phase of its vaccine trials is going well. The pharmaceutical giant said its vaccine is currently proven to be 90% effective in COVID-19 prevention.To date, Pfizer has tested the vaccine on  44,000 participants, and if it proves effective, the next step would be for the United States Food and Drug Administration to conduct its own tests before approving the vaccine for mass production and distribution.After the vaccine announcement, the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1,000 points, leading to a strong U.S. stock market rally. As the U.S. dollar and stocks triumphed, Bitcoin and gold dwindled simultaneously.Michaël van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, pinpointed the recovery of the U.S. dollar index and suggested that alternative stores of value, like gold and Bitcoin, are priced against the dollar. As such, when the dollar recovers, the price of BTC could fall steeply alongside precious metals.Van de Poppe explained:When the drop occurred, CryptoQuant, an on-chain market analysis firm, found that whales were selling Bitcoin.Traders, like the pseudonymous investor “Byzantine General,” found a similar pattern. As Bitcoin dropped in a whale-induced pullback, retail investors were continuously longing BTC.Whales had several attractive reasons to sell BTC at $15,800. First, it is a major resistance area right below a pivotal level at $16,000. If the $16,000 level breaks, technical analysts have said BTC would likely position for an all-time high.When whales sell, the market often sees a strong reaction. Whether whales would begin to take profit on their shorts and attempt to resume the bull trend remains unclear. For now, the pullback has stalled, with BTC recovering above $15,100, indicating a short-term trend reversal to the upside.Despite the heightened level of volatility in the market, cryptocurrency trader Cantering Clark emphasized that long-term investors are unlikely to be fazed. He said:In addition to the factors mentioned above, analysts at Glassnode noted that the current short-term holder activity is reminiscent of previous bull trends. As such, if BTC recovers strongly from the recent drop, the chances of a rally continuation could increase. Glassnode said:"
605,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell sharply in price this morning as pharmaceutical company Pfizer, in collaboration with biotech company BioNTech, announced a breakthrough in its COVID-19 vaccine.Bitcoin fell approximately $1,000, over 6%, between 12:00 pm and 3:00 pm UTC today on the vaccine news, from $15,800 down to a daily low near $14,815, based on TradingView data. Crypto's pioneer asset bounced slightly by the time of publication, sitting near $14,908. Earlier this morning, Pfizer publicized a statement claiming its COVID-19 vaccine has shown to be roughly 90% effective. The company said its numbers come after testing 43,538 subjects. The vaccine, however, still awaits final approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration: Bolstering Bitcoin's narrative as a hedge or noncorrelated asset, traditional financial markets rose as various media outlets covered the COVID-19 vaccine news. The S&P 500 bolted up almost 4% in price at market open this morning. Meanwhile, gold, another store-of-value asset, has fallen more than 5% over the last several hours, suffering continued carnage as of publication time. In addition to gold and BTC, a number of businesses that posted notable gains during pandemic lockdowns saw their company valuations fall today. Video conferencing platform Zoom watched its stock decline by approximately 19%, while Netflix fell almost 10%. Even e-commerce giant Amazon dropped more than 5%. Many expect Bitcoin to rebound at some point, just as it did after the original COVID-19 pandemic news in March."
606,"The Bitcoin (BTC) price rally halted the moment Joe Biden was announced as the projected winner of the 2020 United States presidential election during the weekend, with the price dropping from $15,500 to $14,400.However, Bitcoin is still continuously showing strength as it’s once again facing the final resistance zone at $16,000.This final resistance zone is the last major hurdle before a potential run at a new all-time high. However, a pullback is becoming increasingly likely, with the Fear & Greed Index currently at levels similar to the peak high in the summer of 2019.The Bitcoin weekly chart shows the $16,000 level as the final resistance zone before a new all-time high can be tested.The weekly chart also shows support levels if the price of Bitcoin starts to correct. A correction would be relatively healthy if it flips previous resistance levels to become new support.If a correction occurs, the weekly level of around $11,600 to $12,000 should be watched as a potential support zone. Such a correction would mean a drop of approximately 30% for Bitcoin’s price. A correction of 30% is quite normal, as this happened a few times during the previous bull cycle in 2017.The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a useful indicator to measure the current market sentiment. In extremely depressed periods, the index uses the color red to mark the overall sentiment.However, once the overall market sentiment reaches peak high bull phases, including euphoria, the number gets closer to the maximum value of 100. The current number is 90, or “extreme greed.” This level has only been seen once in the history of this indicator, which was on June 27, 2019.That date was the actual top for the year, as Bitcoin’s price reached $13,700 and has corrected by 50% since.Therefore, multiple indicators and areas identify potential resistance zones, suggesting that a correction should not come as a surprise.Bitcoin dominance continues its climb as it always does in the fourth quarter of the year.Historically, the Bitcoin dominance tops out in December, after which the first quarter of the year is an excellent period for altcoins.Based on this historical fact, it’s still time to be cautious on altcoins, despite the slight relief rally in the past few days. If Bitcoin decides to consolidate toward the $11,600–$12,000 area, there’s almost no chance that altcoins will go up inverse to BTC.In that perspective, Bitcoin has to establish a range-bound construction giving altcoins some room to catch up.A very likely scenario would be a corrective period after this impulse wave. Such a remedial period would mean stabilization and a natural build-up for the markets, rather than a continued parabolic move.In that perspective, a massive drop in one wick, which would be quickly bought up, is not unlikely. After that, range-bound and sideways continuation resulting in compression and a build-up toward a strong bullish breakout would be the ideal scenario for the bulls.The best period to anticipate a potential bullish move for altcoins would be when Bitcoin has finished correcting. Historically, the best period to get into altcoins is December and January, so traders should keep an eye on a possible BTC pullback in the coming weeks, should history repeat itself.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

607,"Bitcoin (BTC) is continuing to show strong momentum even after a major rally. Key data points show that the uptrend has likely been fueled by smart money in recent months. This means retail or mainstream investors have been largely on the sidelines as BTC price surpassed $15,000 this month.In 2017, when the price of Bitcoin hit an all-time high at $20,000, the retail demand was at its peak. Google Trends data soared, mainstream media coverage noticeably increased, and spot exchange volumes exploded across major markets, especially in South Korea and Japan.This time, the Google Trends interest is relatively low for the keyword “Bitcoin” while on-chain data shows smart money is accumulating BTC.Moreover, according to on-chain analyst Willy Woo, it has been mostly high-net-worth investors who have been purchasing Bitcoin.When whales buy Bitcoin, they mostly facilitate the deals through the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Over time, spot and derivatives markets trail the OTC market as whales lead the upsurge. Woo said:The trend of whales frontrunning retail investors is optimistic because it shows Bitcoin is still in its nascent bull phase. Large capital from new retail and mainstream investors is yet to enter the cryptocurrency market.Another Glassnode metrics paints a similar trend. The number of Bitcoin addresses holding more than 100 BTC hit a seven-month high at 16,271.Whales consistently buying Bitcoin over the past few months is optimistic in itself. But, Woo emphasized that the number of new whales has also increased.If the number of addresses containing large amounts of Bitcoin increases, analysts consider it as an overall spike in new whales.The rise in more high-net-worth individuals accumulating Bitcoin coincides with the start of the recent institutional frenzy around BTC.Following Square’s BTC purchase worth $50 million, the number of high-net-worth investors in the Bitcoin market noticeably increased. Woo explained:Google Trends data is indicating a similar narrative as on-chain data points. The search volume for the keyword “Bitcoin” is currently less than 10% compared to the 2017 top.Nevertheless, while the search volume for Bitcoin remains low, there is a particularly high interest coming from states like Hawaii, California, Nevada and Washington.Interestingly, California and Hawaii rank as the third and fourth highest in per capita income by state in 2020.Moreover, San Jose/San Francisco in California i.e. Silicon Valley is ranked as the top metro region for Bitcoin interest. Silicon Valley is, of course, home to many high-net-worth investors and entrepreneurs."
608,"Nouriel Roubini, an award-winning economist and known skeptic of Bitcoin (BTC), is confident that central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, are the future of money.According to Roubini, global CBDCs like the digital yuan are capable of replacing major financial services and cryptocurrencies in the near future. “They're gonna be crowding out digital payment systems, or in the private sector, starting with cryptocurrencies that are not really currencies,” the economist said in a Nov. 7 interview with Yahoo Finance.Roubini predicted that a CBDC-powered “revolution” is coming in as soon as in three years:Furthermore, the world-known economist is confident that cryptocurrency itself is a “misnomer,” because a currency needs to provide a unit of account. “Nothing is priced in Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency,” Roubini argued, claiming that crypto does not provide either a “single numerator,” or a “scalable means of payment.”However, Roubini did admit that Bitcoin could serve as a store of value, which is a major function of money alongside a unit of account and a medium of exchange:Roubini has also criticized decentralized finance, one of the major trends in the crypto market in 2020. “DeFi was vaporware from its onset,” the economist argued in late September 2020, adding that the industry is “totally faltering as blockchain was always the most over-hyped technology in human history.”"
609,"PlanB, the creator of the stock-to-flow (S2F) model, reiterated on Nov. 8 that Bitcoin (BTC) is well on its way to hit $100,000. The pseudonymous analyst expects the dominant cryptocurrency to achieve the $100,000 to $288,000 range by December 2021.Bitcoin would have to increase by around 545% from the current price to surpass $100,000. At that price point, the market capitalization of BTC would near $2 trillion, or roughly the same as Apple, the world’s most valuable company. The S2F model attempts to predict the long-term price trend of Bitcoin by evaluating its supply. Namely, it takes into consideration its fixed supply and the block reward halving, which reduces the rate at which new BTC is produced or “mined.”The theory behind S2F is that as the supply of Bitcoin decreases over time and inflation would continuously rise. These two factors could theoretically amplify the uptrend of the top cryptocurrency.Based on Bitcoin’s supply curve and the halving cycles, S2F puts the expected valuation of BTC at $5.5 trillion. The model predicts Bitcoin to reach a multi-trillion-dollar valuation before 2024. The model reads:In a tweet, PlanB said he remains confident the S2F model’s $100,000 price projection for Bitcoin would materialize.2021 is particularly important for Bitcoin because it follows a highly anticipated block reward halving in May 2020.Six months ago, Bitcoin experienced its third halving in history. This decreased the number of BTC mined each day by half, which would cause the circulating supply to drop over time. The analyst wrote:So far, following the halving, Bitcoin has increased from $8,700 to $15,500, recording a 78.1% rally in six months.On-chain analysts like Woobull.com creator Willy Woo say that the total supply of Bitcoin is lower than often thought.While the total supply of Bitcoin is 21 million, there is a high number of BTC that is lost or dormant that can no longer be accessed. Woo said:As such, PlanB expects Bitcoin to follow the S2F model as the available supply and the amount of new Bitcoin mined decreases over time. "
610,"Bitcoin (BTC) is starting what will be likely a hectic week for markets as the United States begins its two-month presidential transition.After Joe Biden was declared the projected winner of the U.S. presidential elections during the weekend, Bitcoin fell, but managed to avoid major losses — what’s next?Cointelegraph takes a look at the factors set to influence BTC price action over the coming week.Attention remains firmly fixed on Washington as the aftermath of a highly contentious election begins to play out.Experts had warned that market volatility was all but guaranteed once the result was in. Since this occurred over the weekend, Monday’s Wall St. open will be a source of interest for market participants.At press time, Japan was leading the gains, with its stock market hitting a 29-year high on what the press is calling the “Biden bounce.”Bitcoin, on the other hand, has stopped short of continuing last week’s gains and at one point hit $14,400 — $1,590 off its recent peak. Since then, BTC/USD has rebounded considerably, circling $15,250 at press time Monday.Incumbent president Donald Trump has vowed to challenge vote counts and could yet cause further issues for Biden, leading to confusion over policy, which could yet rattle sentiment.Zooming out, however, analysts frequently argue that in the long run, Bitcoin and gold as safe havens will ultimately win from the election, regardless of which candidate leads the U.S. going forward. The reason, among other things, is inflation.As Cointelegraph reported, a speech last week by Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, saw demands for further financial stimulus to enter the U.S. economy, raising debt and debasing the dollar.“Bitcoin is the dominant crypto network - engineered to host the ideal safe haven asset & preserve monetary energy over long periods of time without power loss,” Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, summarized in a tweet on Monday.Accompanying the election fallout is the continued turmoil over nation states’ handling of the Coronavirus.Europe and the U.S. have recently diverged in this respect, with the former succumbing to a wave of new lockdown measures that have met with considerable pushback from the population.After showing off buoyant recovery statistics for Q3, many governments will soon be drawing another altogether less savory picture of their economies for Q4 as economic activity dives for a second time in 2020.This opens up the possibility of history repeating itself for Bitcoiners. After March’s cross-asset crash and first lockdowns, Bitcoin bounced back from $3,600 to circle five figures in under two months.As governments themselves repeated the controversial responses to the virus, analysts were already forecasting a strong year for Bitcoin in 2021. Among them, as Cointelegraph reported, Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal and Gemini exchange co-founder Tyler Winklevoss both predicted a new all-time high for BTC by Q1 next year.In terms of current investor sentiment, however, warning bells are sounding as Bitcoin stays above $15,000.According to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures market sentiment using a basket of factors, a correction is more than overdue.Compiled as a score out of 100, the Index reached its highest reading since June 2019 on Monday — the time when Bitcoin circled its yearly highs of $13,800.For Comparison, two weeks ago, the Index measured under 60 — firmly “neutral” territory — before the latest price rises upended sentiment.The closer its score is to 100, the more likely it is that the market will correct thanks to a wave of selling, dragging the price down.Noting the Index on Friday, Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe advised Twitter followers that he was eyeing a market entry point as low as $11,600.“Decent weekly close, but below $16,000,” he added on Monday.Bitcoin closed Sunday with its third-highest weekly close in history.Despite the volatile conditions of the past week, however, the weekend managed to avoid a significant “gap” opening up in Bitcoin futures markets.These “gaps” appear when the end of one futures trading session is markedly different in price to the start of the next after a weekend.Bitcoin has traditionally risen or fallen from its Monday position to revisit, or “fill,” such gaps. This weekend provided only a small one — between $15,455 and $15,635 — and BTC/USD moved quickly to fill it in early Monday trading.CME Group’s Bitcoin futures meanwhile have seen record open interest in recent days, hitting $934 million on Friday with $764 million daily trading volume.Enthusiasm has been tempered, however, by the latest commitments of traders (COT) report released Friday, which showed hedge funds being record short BTC at current prices.At the same time, institutional investors remained record long, building on previous bullishness from late October.Bitcoin’s run to $16,000 meanwhile opened up an increasingly popular narrative, which predicts further price rises based on a surprisingly simple and well-known equation — supply and demand.After a wave of corporate buy-ins and increased sales from heavyweights such as payments network Square, attention is focusing on the fact that there is just not enough BTC on the market to satisfy incoming demand.The situation will likely be exacerbated by PayPal, analysts say, which already has a waiting list for Bitcoin buyers for when it begins offering cryptocurrency facilities early next year.Square alone, as Cointelegraph reported, already buys more BTC than miners produce. Going forward, the resulting supply squeeze can only realistically drive up the USD value of a Bitcoin.As Saifedean Ammous, author of the popular book, “The Bitcoin Standard,” summarized on Saturday:"
611,"This week Bitcoin (BTC) price nearly hit a new multi-year high at $16,000 and legendary investor Bill Miller told CNBC that the law of supply and demand favors BTC. While the supply is increasing by about 2.5% a year, “the demand is growing faster than that.” Miller expects every major bank, high net worth firms, and investment banks to “eventually have some exposure in Bitcoin.” Although Bitcoin’s volatility remains high, Miller expects investors to focus on the staying power of Bitcoin as the risk of it ever going to zero is much lower than before.At the current market capitalization of over $284 billion, Bitcoin would rank 18th when compared with publicly listed U.S. companies. Only Mastercard, JPMorgan Chase, and Visa are ahead of Bitcoin in terms of market cap.However, after multiple media outlets announced Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 Presidential election, the uncertainty of a long-contested ballot counting process have ended. Now market participants can focus on the first few decisions of the President-elect before aggressively buying or selling crypto assets.If the bullish sentiment sustains, these top-five cryptocurrencies could outperform in the short-term. Let’s analyze the charts to spot the critical support and resistance levels on each of them.Bitcoin (BTC) is currently in a corrective phase within a strong uptrend. When the sentiment is positive, traders view dips to strong support levels as a buying opportunity because it offers a low-risk entry point.The correction on Nov. 7 pulled the relative strength index down from deeply overbought levels, suggesting a shakeout of weak hands. However, the upsloping moving averages suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside.As the BTC/USD pair has run up sharply in the past few days, it may consolidate the gains by entering a range-bound action for a few days. Such a move will help the pair to form a strong base needed for the assault on the all-time highs.Hence, the possibility of the pair remaining between $14,000 to $16,000 for the next few days is high.A break above $16,000 could resume the uptrend with the next likely stop at $17,200 while a break below the 20-day exponential moving average ($13,793) may tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.The correction from $15,956.26 took support just above the 50-simple moving average on the 4-hour chart. The bulls are currently attempting to resume the up-move but have hit a wall at the downtrend line.If the price turns down from the downtrend line, the bears will again try to sink the price below $14,000. However, the bulls are likely to step in and buy this dip.Conversely, if the bulls push the price above the downtrend line, a retest of $15,956.26 is possible. A breakout of this resistance could start the next leg of the uptrend.Ether (ETH) is currently trading inside a rising wedge pattern. The bulls attempted to push the price above the wedge on Nov. 7 but failed to sustain the higher levels.However, the positive thing is that the bulls have not given up much ground and are currently attempting to resume the up-move. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($405) and the RSI above 66 suggests that the bulls have the upper hand.If they can push and close the price above the resistance line of the wedge, it will invalidate the bearish pattern.The sellers may attempt to stall the rally at $488.134 but if the bulls can propel the ETH/USD pair above this resistance, a rally to $520 and then to $550 will be on the cards.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair turns down from the resistance line of the wedge, the bears will try to pull the price back to the support line of the wedge. A break below the wedge may tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls have defended the 20-EMA, which is a positive sign. This shows that the sentiment is bullish and the buyers are accumulating on dips to strong support levels.If the bulls can push the price above $455, the pair will then try to resume the up-move by breaking above $468.This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and plummets below $424. Such a move could drag the price down to $395.Chainlink (LINK) has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern that will complete on a breakout and close above the overhead resistance at $13.28. This bullish setup has a target objective of $19.2731.The 20-day EMA ($11.36) has started to turn up and the RSI has risen into the positive zone, which suggests that the path of least resistance is to the upside.The bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the overhead resistance. If they succeed, the uptrend could resume.This bullish view will be invalidated if the LINK/USD pair turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and plummets below $9.7665. Such a move could signal an advantage to the bears.The bulls had pushed the price above $13.28 but they could not sustain a breakout, which shows that the bears are defending this level.However, the positive sign is that the bulls purchased the dip to the 20-EMA. This suggests that the sentiment is to buy the dips. If the bulls can drive the price above $13.28, the next leg of the up-move could begin.If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, a few days of range-bound action is possible. A break below the 20-EMA will be the first sign that the upside momentum has weakened.Unus Sed Leo (LEO) had repeatedly turned down from $1.29 levels in the past few weeks. This shows that the bears aggressively sell when the price reaches this resistance.The bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the resistance and sustain it. If they succeed, the LEO/USD pair could start the next leg of the up-move that can carry it to $1.35 and then to $1.46.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that the bulls have the upper hand.However, if the pair fails to sustain above $1.29, the bears will try to pull the price back below $1.23. Such a move could open the doors for a fall to $1.16.The 4-hour chart shows that the bears have dragged the price to the 20-EMA. If the pair rebounds off this support, it will indicate buying on dips. If the price sustains above $1.29, the first target objective on the upside is $1.35.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the 20-EMA, a drop to the 50-SMA is possible. If this support also gives way, the price could extend its decline to $1.23.NEM (XEM) soared above the moving averages and reached the overhead resistance at $0.126 on Nov. 6. The bears have defended this resistance for the past few weeks and they again tried to pull the price down on Nov. 7.However, the positive thing is that the bulls did not allow the price to dip below the 50-day SMA ($0.111). This suggests that lower levels are attracting buying as traders anticipate the rally to extend in the short-term.The 20-day EMA ($0.107) has turned up and the RSI has jumped into the positive zone, which suggests that the bulls are back in the game.If the buyers can propel the price above the $0.126 to $0.132 resistance zone, a rally to $0.140 and then to $0.160 is possible.This bullish view will be invalidated if the XEM/USD pair once again turns down from the overhead resistance and dips below the moving averages. Such a move will suggest that the bears are aggressively defending $0.126.The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls had pushed the price above $0.126 resistance but they could not sustain the bear onslaught. As a result, the price dropped down to the 20-EMA.However, the strong rebound off the 20-EMA shows that the bulls are aggressively buying at lower levels. They are currently trying to push the price above $0.126. If they succeed, a move to $0.132 is likely. The bears may again try to defend this level.If the price turns down from the current levels or $0.132, the bears will try to pull the pair below $0.11. On the other hand, if the bulls drive the price above $0.132, the momentum could pick up.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

612,"As tempting as it can be to buy altcoins using perpetual futures, there are a few hidden traps that one should monitor closely. Over the past few years, numerous exchanges began to offer altcoin futures quoted in Tether (USDT) and stablecoin pairs, which eventually became the standard. This change is more convenient for most traders but still presents some serious issues for those willing to keep long positions open for more than a couple of weeks.Before opening any trade at an exchange offering perpetual futures, traders should be aware that stronger wicks can run stop losses, investors lose the ability to stake their altcoins for lucrative yields, and the variable funding rate can significantly increase the costs of carrying a trade.Regardless of how liquid a market is, leverage will result in stronger wicks. Even though these moves usually don't lead to forced liquidation, it might run an investors’ stops.Therefore, the possibility of errant wicks are the main reason traders should avoid carrying futures positions for more extended periods.Futures liquidation engines use a price index composed of multiple spot (regular) exchanges to avoid price manipulation. Thus, the system will only close positions with insufficient margin once an index reaches its stops.Take notice how ETH had a $326 low on Coinbase, while simultaneously Binance futures faced a $302 low. This change might seem small, but this certainly triggered traders' stop orders.There's a way to avoid such issues, simply by setting one's stop orders trigger to Mark Price (Index) instead of Last Price.Making this simple change will avoid getting liquidated if futures contracts monetarily decouple from its index. The big issue is that not every exchange offers this possibility.Buying altcoins using futures does not allow one to use them for staking or lending. For investors willing to carry a position for a longer-term, this is another factor to consider.There are numerous platforms offering staking and lending services, including the top centralized exchanges. Some of the altcoins offering 30-day contract annual percentage yields (APY) that can range from 7% to 18% are Polkadot (DOT), Tron (TRX), Cosmos (ATOM), and Cardano (ADA).Decentralized (DeFi) mining pools are another way to generate income by holding altcoins. Users should beware of this sector’s inherent risks, especially those pools with impairment loss occurring between two different cryptocurrencies.Thus, by opting for perpetual futures, one will not be able to partake in staking and yield farming. It might not impact the decision for those betting on short-term price swings, but it weighs more as the weeks go by.Perpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate that usually charged every eight hours. Funding rates ensure there are no exchange risk imbalances. Even though both buyers and sellers open interest is matched at all times, leverage can vary.When buyers (longs) are the ones demanding more leverage, the funding rate goes positive. Therefore, those buyers will be the ones paying up the fees. This issue holds especially true under bull run periods, when usually there's more demand for longs.The above chart shows the late July bull run and it is clear to see that as Ether (ETH) hiked from $230 to $380, so did its perpetual funding rate. After averaging 1.8% for three weeks, this negatively impacted buyers' gains.Again, it might not be harmful for those carrying short-term positions, but it adds up over the months.To avoid this shortcoming, one might opt for margin trading instead of futures contracts. Borrowing will usually cost between 0.5 and 1.4% per month, while maximum leverage ranges from 3x to 10x.Similar to the perpetual futures, investors also need to deposit margin to access such markets.It is worth noting that some exchanges will let users manually pick rates and set periods for borrowing. This method is far superior as it avoids surprises that will naturally occur during heavy buying activity.While perpetual futures trading is an excellent tool, it comes with shortcomings. Among those, stronger wicks running stop losses, the inability to stake, and the variable funding rate.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
613,"One of the most discussed topics within the crypto community recently has been PayPal’s announcement that its customers will be able to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. The service is expected to be fully rolled out early next year.The company’s goal “to increase consumer understanding and adoption of cryptocurrency,” as stated in its press release, seems to be a needed step in cryptocurrency popularization. Mainstream awareness of crypto still remains very low. As data from a Statista survey indicates, Bitcoin (BTC) use in countries with developed economies is below 10%, with the lowest levels in Sweden, Denmark and Japan. Meanwhile, some optimistically predict that this number will grow to 90% of the U.S. population by 2030.Related: PayPal’s crypto integration means Bitcoin could triple its user basePayPal’s president and CEO, Dan Schulman, said that “The shift to digital forms of currencies is inevitable, bringing with it clear advantages in terms of financial inclusion and access; efficiency, speed and resilience of the payments system; and the ability for governments to disburse funds to citizens quickly."" Similarly, the former prime minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, told the General Assembly of the United Nations in 2018 that cryptocurrencies were the “inevitable future of money.”Related: PayPal’s baby steps into crypto aren't dampening the hype for adoptionPayPal will begin by offering its services for users with Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and the company has acquired from the New York State Department of Financial Services what it claims to be a “first-of-its-kind” conditional BitLicense — a license required to operate a digital currency business in New York — and partnered with United States-based stablecoin operator Paxos to enable this service for its customers.Considering that PayPal had a reported 346 million active users in the second quarter of 2020 — a figure that has since increased in the third quarter to 361 million, according to its latest quarterly report — the decision to offer its customers services related to cryptocurrencies seems to be a significant step toward mainstream adoption. Last year, Cointelegraph asked experts in the crypto and blockchain industries for their opinions on crypto mass adoption. This time, the question was: Could PayPal’s recent announcement of beginning to offer crypto payments possibly force the mass adoption of crypto?Cristina Dolan, founder and CEO of InsideChains and vice chair of the MIT Enterprise Forum:Dominik Schiener, co-founder of the IOTA Foundation:Jay Hao, CEO of OKEx:Jimmy Song, instructor at Programming Blockchain:Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics:Roger Ver, executive chairman of Bitcoin.com:These quotes have been edited and condensed.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors’ alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
614,"In 2013 the world saw the debut of the first-ever Bitcoin ATM when a company called Robocoin placed a machine in a Vancouver coffee shop. Allowing customers to trade Bitcoin for cash, and vice versa, the machine saw $10,000 in BTC transacted on its first day.Now that we are a month away from the end of 2020, the estimated number of crypto ATMs around the world that allow customers to buy and sell Bitcoin (BTC) and other altcoins for cash is about 11,665 ATMs, according to CoinATMRadar.This reflects a remarkable rise in the number of crypto ATMs compared to last year. The number of crypto ATMs at the end of 2019 was estimated at 6372 machines; now, as we near bidding farewell to 2020, there has been a nearly 80% increase.CoinATMRadar also shows that the number of crypto ATMs is constantly increasing by an average of 23 machines every day, or nearly one new ATM per hour.The United States recorded the fastest spread in the world of crypto ATMs, and it acquired the largest share of crypto ATMs within its territory. The number of crypto ATMs located in the United States increased from 4,213 ATMs in 2019 to 9242 ATMs in 2020, an increase of more than 50%. The United States currently accounts for about 79.2% of the total number of crypto ATMs in the world.There is also a growing diversity of the spread of crypto ATMs within the United States, with locations in small shops, shopping centers, transportation hubs, and even one in the Tesla Gigafactory.Rounding out the top five is Canada, ranked second with 880 ATMs; the United Kingdom at third with 268 machines; Hong Kong in fourth with 62 machines; and finally Colombia, which recently showed great interest in establishing crypto ATMs with 59 machines.As for Africa, South Africa occupied the leadership of the continent with 6 machines, but it should be careful, as Nigeria, the largest economy in the continent, has shown growing interest over the last year.At the level of companies that manufacture crypto ATMs, Genesis Coin ranked first in the world, with the San Francisco-based company spreading 4000 crypto ATMs around the world, followed by General Bytes with 3442 ATMs.The significant growth in the number of crypto ATMs in 2020 demonstrates the growing interest from both retail buyers and financial institutions, including financial behemoth Paypal."
615,"Decentralized finance is a fairly new, nuanced concept for mainstream audiences. At its core, DeFi promises a revamped global financial system equipped with savings, loans and inventive yield-earning opportunities that enable innovative financial products without centralized gatekeepers. Since Jan. 1, this promise has been met with a demand that has exceeded $11 billion in total value locked, representing a more than 1,550% increase in year-to-date value.DeFi applications require the on-chain logic of smart contracts. Today, a lot of experimentation and early traction for DeFi applications is happening in the Ethereum ecosystem, using the JavaScript-like language Solidity.Related: Programming languages used in blockchain, explainedWhile we have seen Ethereum-powered projects such as Uniswap, Aave and Compound champion the DeFi space, the community is beginning to show signs of demand for solutions that incorporate Bitcoin (BTC).Bitcoin is the largest digital asset by market capitalization, but it largely remains a passive asset. To actively deploy Bitcoin in DeFi products, custodians such as BitGo have begun tokenizing Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). Wrapped Bitcoin takes Bitcoin’s value and couples it with Ethereum’s programmability, giving investors a way to earn additional yield from their Bitcoin investments without cashing out. In the past two months alone, more than $1 billion worth of WBTC has been brought onto the Ethereum network, indicating a demand for Bitcoin as an actively deployed financial asset.Bitcoin is the strongest sovereign blockchain and is well on its way to becoming the first truly sovereign currency of the world. Bitcoin has the most robust blockchain security and the most mainstream name recognition. Right now, the use of BTC in DeFi is at a very early stage.There are two ways that Bitcoin can be used in DeFi products: Wrapped representations of BTC can be used on separate blockchains (like WBTC on Ethereum) or native smart contracts can come to the Bitcoin blockchain itself. Directly building DeFi products on Bitcoin is something that makes practical sense but has been difficult because of the limited scripting language of Bitcoin and scalability concerns. Bitcoin has traditionally been thought of as a medium of exchange and a store of value. However, Bitcoin’s recent move onto Ethereum as a wrapped asset signals market demand for BTC in DeFi. In the process, people are finding unique, albeit unnatural and potentially dangerous, ways of doing so.Bitcoin’s limited scripting language has long been considered a feature, not a bug, because it keeps the base blockchain secure. Smart-contract logic can be added on top of Bitcoin through sidechains like Liquid, connected chains like Stacks, or merged-mined chains like RSK. Moving BTC from the main Bitcoin chain to such adjacent chains can be easier and more secure than issuing wrapped assets on disconnected chains.In order to fully bridge the gap, Bitcoin will have to undergo the transformation from a passive asset to an active, yield-generating asset. One hurdle is the tribal nature of cryptocurrency users. Many Bitcoiners don’t recognize Wrapped Bitcoin as Bitcoin. In my opinion, this is because Bitcoiners and the Ethereum community share different philosophies.Ethereum has created a culture that celebrates experimentation and testing in production. However, daring experimentation is not a trait that Bitcoiners share. Bitcoiners, by nature, are careful, healthy skeptics who take good care not to lose their assets. Wrapped Bitcoin is one of several DeFi innovations that invite danger by mixing these two philosophies. Taking a valuable asset like Bitcoin and putting it in a smart contract such as an ERC-20 token that shares the security properties of Ethereum can be an uneasy concept for Bitcoin holders. There should be a more secure solution for bringing BTC into DeFi’s orbit.By recognizing the opportunity to build on Bitcoin, I believe that we may see a future where Bitcoin continues to be the king of blockchains. As DeFi continues to grow, it’s entirely possible that Bitcoin will remain the center of gravity for crypto and that smart contracts around Bitcoin will natively unlock innovation and $250 billion in Bitcoin capital.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
616,"In early September of this year, the market capitalization of Bitcoin (BTC) was hovering at around $190 billion when the BTC price was hovering around $10,000.In the past two months, however, the price of Bitcoin rose from to over $15,000. With it, the market cap of Bitcoin surged from $190 billion to around $280 billion. This now makes Bitcoin more valuable than most major U.S. companies.If Bitcoin’s valuation is compared to publicly-listed firms in the U.S., it would match the 18th biggest firm.The 17th largest company in the U.S. is Home Depot with a market cap of $306 billion. Verizon falls behind it with a $242 billion valuation, leaving a large gap in between.Since the market cap of Bitcoin is currently around $280 billion, it is larger than all of the companies in the U.S. outside of the top 17.Companies that Bitcoin surpassed in recent months include some big names such as Netflix, PayPal, BofA, Coca-Cola, Salesforce and Disney.Bitcoin is still behind the three largest financial institutions in the U.S. by valuation, namely Visa, Mastercard and JPMorgan. For the top cryptocurrency to surpass all three, it would need to hit $23,000, or a market cap of $426 billion. However, the price of BTC must reach somewhere around $120K for Bitcoin to catch up to Apple, the most valuable company in the world with a market cap of $2 trillion.Meanwhile, analysts anticipate BTC to rally throughout 2020 and in early 2021, expecting BTC to enter price discovery and hit new all-time highs.In 2017, Bitcoin reached a new record-high 15 months after the 2016 block reward halving. BTC saw its latest halving in May 2020, so the chances of a new peak in mid-2021 remain high based on historical cycles.Over the long term, cryptocurrency investors and analysts say the perception of Bitcoin as a durable store of value would push its valuation.Tyler Reynolds, a former Google and Morgan Stanley alumni, said the fixed supply of Bitcoin makes it compelling as a hedge against government spending. He wrote:Other notable investors, such as the billionaire Wall Street hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones, called Bitcoin an ideal inflation play.Bitcoin is particularly attractive to institutions because it could act as a hedge within a diversified portfolio but also give investors exposure to Bitcoin's asymmetric risk-reward potential.The relatively low market cap of Bitcoin compared to companies like Visa and safe-haven assets such as gold indicate there is significant room for further growth in the next decade."
617,"In 2017, when everything concerned with cryptocurrency and blockchain still looked fresh and interesting, it seemed that there would be no day without a new “revolutionary” project or idea. Decentralized financial system, decentralized torrent tracker, decentralized office documentation system. Decentralized, decentralized, decentralized.The overuse of terms like “transparent,” “distributed” and “blockchain-based” soon made most press papers look generic. The closer we got to the peak of the Bitcoin price at the end of 2017, the more absurd the names of new projects became: “Ethereum-based payment system for slaughterhouse industry workers,” “decentralized blockchain-based dwarf horse breeding platform,” “peer-to-peer personal banking service for divorced blind people,” and so on.Who would ever need any of that, one might ask. Well, in many cases, nobody. Of the several thousand cryptocurrencies launched since the spread of blockchain technology, only about 30 are currently of any investment interest.Following cryptocurrencies, many crypto exchanges launched on the wave of blockchain popularity are dying — they just have nothing to trade anymore. The situation is especially visible on review platforms, which store cards of hundreds of closed projects, often together with angry user reviews.Let’s take a look at a few projects and analyze the reasons for their failure.In late 2017 to early 2018, it was first reported that Telegram was planning to launch its own blockchain platform and native cryptocurrency.Also known as Grams, the TON coins were intended to be based on Telegram Open Network, with the TON blockchain at the core of the platform. In the project white paper, the developers presented this future coin as a potential standard cryptocurrency that could be used for the regular exchange of value in daily life.It was stated that while Bitcoin (BTC) was considered “digital gold” and Ethereum was a platform for token crowd sales, this new TON cryptocurrency would be a substitute for traditional money and traditional payment systems such as Visa and Mastercard. According to the white paper, other cryptocurrencies lacked the qualities required to attract a mass consumer. In its turn, Telegram would be able to implement a system eligible for mass use, given its expertise in encrypted distributed data storage, experience in creating user-friendly interfaces, and an enormous user base.While the company did have a point in part of its claims, to me all of it looked like a huge PR campaign. Why should Telegram implement this new financial system and not some corporation with experience in the financial services industry? How would it be able to distinguish this new currency from other, similar products? How would it be any better than traditional financial systems being implemented by a large centralized company?No answers were given. However, the Telegram initial coin offering, launched in 2018, was a huge success. The company was able to raise $1.7 billion from investor funds in two private token sale rounds, and that was really promising.Related: Exclusive: New report reveals details of Telegram’s TON blockchainBut it didn’t end well. On May 12, 2020, Pavel Durov announced that Telegram would officially terminate its involvement with the project after a long legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Surely, the company didn’t have the legal resources necessary for implementing such an ambitious idea. Most likely, technical difficulties and strong competition on the market also played a role.Related: SEC vs. Telegram: Part 1 — Key takeaways for nowFor me, this case epitomizes the whole cryptocurrency hysteria of 2018 — a company that gets involved in an enterprise for which it is not ready, either legally or technologically, without a clear positioning of the product. The end result is failure.Petchains was presented as the future global information management system and trading platform for the pet market. According to its press papers, the system would allow its users to maintain and keep data of the animals living in homes and shelters. The presented project goal was to create a community of pet owners, experts, professionals, institutions, service providers and volunteers. The system was intended to be developed using blockchain and big data technologies as usual. The initial funding was going to be gathered through the process of an initial coin offering.It’s a good question if the world really needs a blockchain-based information and trading platform for the pet market. I wouldn’t say there are many problems with over-centralization there. Pet shops are usually chosen by customers after analyzing brand reputation and online presence.Some problems that customers on this market may face include unreliable information about the acquired animal’s health or previous owners. However, these difficulties comprise not a technical, but a legal problem that is unlikely to be solved using blockchain technology.Moreover, since animal welfare laws vary between different countries, creating a unified international platform in this field is a legally challenging task, hardly suitable for a small technological startup.The Petchain project team consisted mainly of no-names who had no proven experience in any serious projects. It was not even possible to say for sure whether these were real people — some of the project advisors turned out to have been presented with fake photos.Despite some marketing efforts, no serious funding was attracted to the project. At the moment, the official website of the project is inactive and its social media accounts haven’t been updated for more than a year. The link that used to lead to the project’s white paper now contains a text describing in general terms the reasons for failures in the cryptocurrency industry.One more dead project with an incoherent, not thought-through idea at the base of it.Wiki token (WIKI) was an Ethereum-based, ERC-20 compatible token designed to be used as a means of payment at the so-called Crypto University. This future platform, built around the Bitcoin Wiki project, was described as a totally independent, decentralized, censorship-free educational system.The learning courses for Crypto University were meant to be created by members of the project community. For writing articles and creating courses, these members would get the previously mentioned ERC-20 Wiki tokens. These tokens would be listed on various crypto exchanges and could be spent on other Crypto University courses.I first noticed this project in 2018, and it didn’t make much sense right from the beginning. First of all, what kind of secret knowledge is there in the cryptocurrency industry that it should be distributed using token-based payment systems? How would it compete with other content, available for free?Theoretically, it’s possible to create a platform similar to Coursera based on blockchain. Crypto University, like Coursera, could become a platform that brings together creators and consumers of educational materials. But here, some difficulties arise.The value of an educational product is usually based on the reputation of its creators. Most of the courses at Coursera are university education programs created by well-known, highly reputable institutions. These courses include interaction with a teacher, who is also a well-known education professional. Upon completion of a course, students usually receive certificates recognized by companies and educational institutions. All these factors add up to the value of the course, and it’s thanks to them that people are willing to pay for it.In its turn, the Wiki token project could hardly offer any of the above. No collaboration with large institutions or renowned educators. Moreover, the highly specialized area of expertise (cryptocurrency and blockchain) chosen did not imply the presence of educational professionals who could potentially create valuable educational content. Why would it be any better than free YouTube videos or easily searchable internet articles?What we see here is just another technical embodiment of a dubious business idea. Having neither a well-thought-out concept nor a product, the team rushed to implement it using fashionable technology. The result is a technical wrapper with no content and no interest outside of blockchain hysteria.As of October 2020, the project’s website is no longer available and its social media accounts have been dead for a couple of years.The projects listed above did not in fact offer anything except technical execution that was fashionable at the time. Hastily launched on the wave of blockchain popularity, with no market or audience research, they were unable to offer any meaningful value to a potential customer.One of the key marketing rules: Sell the problem to be solved, not the product you offer. Product developers should always think about consumer needs first. Otherwise, they risk ending up in the same way as the developers of the projects mentioned above — creating only product packaging that has no intrinsic value.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
618,"On Nov. 7 several major media outlets announced that after 4 days of rigorous vote-counting in key battleground states Joe Biden had managed to secure enough electoral votes to become the 46th President of the United States.As the excitement over an incredibly close election starts to abate, analysts will take a closer look at how a Biden presidency may impact traditional markets and Bitcoin price. Three key factors to consider are the eventual passage of a new round of economic stimulus, a strengthening U.S. dollar, and the possibility of a stock market recovery.Prior to the election, U.S. President Donald Trump said he intended to delay stimulus discussions until after the election. Consequently, the Democrats and Republicans struggled to come to a consensus on a deal.The election of Biden brightens the prospect of a stimulus package by the year’s end. Democrats in the U.S. Congress already proposed a $2.2 trillion stimulus bill in October, but it failed to gain support in the Senate.The second round of stimulus could positively affect Bitcoin because it significantly relaxes the financial conditions in the U.S. It would also uplift the U.S. economy, and in turn, stimulate investor appetite for high-risk assets.The perception of Bitcoin has evolved from a risk-on asset to a safe-haven asset and an inflation play in recent months. Despite this, there are still multiple instances where Bitcoin price moves in tandem with the stock market so in the absence of appetite for risk-on assets, Bitcoin price can still rise.If the Biden administration approves a stimulus package, then the U.S. dollar will rise. The eurozone, as an example, saw the euro rapidly surge after passing a major stimulus proposal.The U.S. dollar has been underperforming against reserve currencies since March. Consequently, it aided the recovery of gold, Bitcoin, and other alternative stores of value, as they are priced against the dollar.As such, there is a possibility that a second round of stimulus and improving investor confidence could initially have a positive impact on the price of Bitcoin. It is also important to note that over time, the strengthening dollar could apply additional selling pressure on Bitcoin and gold.Analysts also anticipate the U.S. stock market to recover following the confirmation of the election result.Although many analysts believe Biden's tax and environmental policies may eventually lead to a stock market slump, there is a high probability that stocks may rally in the short-term.The stock market fell steeply throughout August and September as analysts warned against a contested election. The speculation around the result of the election is unlikely to have fueled a sell-off across risk-on assets.Rather, the fear that the election would drag on without a clear winner caused the markets to rattle.Following the conclusion of the 2020 race, there is less uncertainty in the markets and this could allow stocks to recover alongside other risk-on assets.In terms of regulation, Compound Finance’s general counsel Jake Chervinsky said Biden has not expressed any public stance towards crypto. He wrote:While the media has announced that Joe Biden is the winner of the 2020 election, President Trump has yet to concede and it is widely expected that Trump's legal team will dispute the results and attempt to force a recount in each battleground state. If this occurs, fear and volatility could quickly re-enter the markets and lead to a pullback in stock and crypto prices. "
619,"Bitcoin has been one of the best-performing assets on the planet since its launch in 2009. The digital coin rose nearly 9 million percent in price between 2010 and 2019. Simply holding or averaging into Bitcoin (BTC) positions yields a certain profit benchmark. Finding an investment or trading strategy that outpaces Bitcoin's performance can prove difficult, but a financial fund known as Off The Chain Capital has claimed to do just that. The fund has also outpaced the S&P 500, a popular mainstream financial market index, although the S&P stands as a less formidable opponent in terms of price gains. ""It's easy to outperform the stock market because if you look at Bitcoin relative to other assets like dollars, gold, stocks and bonds, Bitcoin is sucking in all the value out of those,"" Brian Estes, the fund's founder and chief investment officer, told Cointelegraph. Bitcoin naturally provides greater profit than other mainstream financial assets, such as stocks and gold, he explained, adding: ""The hard part is to outperform Bitcoin."" Estes created Off The Chain Capital in 2016 as a financial fund open only to his friends and family. A number of years later, the fund began letting other members of the public invest, Estes explained. ""We have over 90 partners now in the fund,"" he noted. ""The reason I decided to open up the fund to outside investors was I finally figured out how to outperform Bitcoin.""CT: Can you explain how the fund works? Such as what is in the fund and what your mindset regarding that is?BE: What I figured out was that the best way to outperform Bitcoin is to buy Bitcoin below what other people could buy it at or sell Bitcoin above what the spot market is. We found ways to buy Bitcoin at a discount, and we found ways to buy Bitcoin at spot prices and then sell it for above to people who are willing to pay us a premium for Bitcoin — and that's pretty much all we do in the fund. So, we're a value investor in Bitcoin and blockchain assets.CT: When you buy below and sell above, are you talking more about long-term action or are you talking about short plays?BE: We don't trade. Our average holding period is over 12 months, so we're not traders. We don't use leverage. We're not leveraging up the portfolio to outperform Bitcoin. We're using a traditional, Graham-Dodd, Warren Buffett value method to buy Bitcoin for cheap.Those assets inside of a claim are 0.1785 Bitcoin, 0.18 Bitcoin Cash and there's about $784 of just cash, like currency, in there. When you add all that up, there is about $3,000 worth of value. Like I said, our average cost is about $1,000. These claims will eventually get paid out over the next few years, and when these claims get paid out, even if Bitcoin doesn't move, we're almost tripling our money because we're buying this Bitcoin at a discount through these claims. Mt. Gox started as one of the earliest Bitcoin exchanges. The marketplace operated from 2010 to 2014, ultimately ending in disaster. The exchange suffered an infamous hack in which nefarious parties reportedly pilfered roughly 850,000 BTC, leading to the exchange's demise in 2014. Fast-forward to 2020, and authorities are still sorting through the rubble and aftermath of the affair. Part of the process has seen victims who lost funds from the Mt. Gox ordeal submit claims for compensation for their losses. Entities such as Off The Chain Capital look to buy these claims for profit, albeit in the form of delayed gratification.Essentially, due to the red tape involved and legal processes around Mt. Gox, these claims do not pay out right away and have suffered many delays. Mt. Gox rehabilitation trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi oversees the ordeal. The payout for the claims has seen a number of delays. Kobayashi must provide the courts with a plan of action. Most recently, the proposal's due date was moved from Oct. 15 to Dec. 15. In addition to the Mt. Gox claims, Off The Chain Capital employs other strategies, although the firm does not divulge these tactics to the public, Estes explained. Off The Chain Capital is not the only player interested in this type of financial play, however. Fortress Investment Group stands as another example of a party that has expressed interest in buying Mt. Gox claims.Buying these claims also helps the victims of the Mt. Gox ordeal. They can receive compensation for their losses sooner, albeit at a discount, through selling their claims.CT: So, the Mt. Gox claims: The reason you're getting the discount is because you are not being paid out until the future, correct?BE: Exactly, yeah. So, we're giving people liquidity. They have a claim, so they get liquidity, and they get $1,000 per claim. What we get is value. We get $3,000 of value, but we get the illiquidity. So, these are illiquid investments until the Japanese trustee decides to distribute the Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and currency out. When that happens, we become liquid. We're willing to be illiquid for the return — for a three-times return. That's a good trade-off for us.It benefits the people selling the claims too because they've been sitting on these claims for almost seven years. Most of the people selling these, they have life events that happened to them. They need the money, so they're happy to sell them and to have someone to sell them to. They're getting married, having a baby, buying a new house or they wreck their car, and they need liquidity.CT: Is there any idea of when the claims will be paid out? Will they all be paid out at once, or are they being paid out every couple of months?BE: On Oct. 15, the Japanese trustee was supposed to update the distribution plan. They postponed it until Dec. 15, so on Dec. 15, we'll have more clarity. It's kind of anyone's guess. Some people are thinking six months, but we're planning for about two years, hoping that it'll be a year or less, but it could be another three to four years. No one really knows. This interview was condensed and edited for clarity."
620,"After rejecting at $15,960 on Nov.6 Bitcoin (BTC) price has been defending the $15,000 support level with strength. Based on four on-chain data points, analysts believe the rally might continue beyond $16,000.Analysts have pinpointed lower Bitcoin exchange reserves, unmoved supply, a rise in “stronger hands,” and unrealized profits as factors for the rally to continue.Recently, Delphi Digital, an independent cryptocurrency research and consulting firm, released a report on the outlook of the Bitcoin market.Paul Burlage, an analyst at Delphi, said that on-chain metrics generally portray strong momentum for Bitcoin.Since Feb. 11, Bitcoin exchange reserves dropped from 2.96 million to 2.41 million. In dollar terms, a drop of 550,000 BTC is equivalent to $6.36 billion.Falling Bitcoin exchange reserves is an optimistic occurance because it means fewer sellers are depositing BTC to exchanges. Burlage said:While fewer sellers have been moving their funds to exchanges, the unmoved supply of BTC remains high.On Sept. 9, Burlage explained that the percentage of unmoved supply for BTC hit an all-time high at 63.5%. Since then, it has declined slightly to 62%, but considering that price has risen substantially, it is a positive metric. He explained:This shows investors are increasing “HODLing” BTC despite the recent rally, not taking large profits just yet.The number of “weak hands” or speculative buyers have noticeably declined in recent weeks, while stronger hands strengthened.The flush out of short-term buyers and the entrance of long-term “HODLers” indicate that Bitcoin could see a prolonged rally.This trend coincides with the resilience of Bitcoin above $15,000 and shows that the once heavy resistance level is close to evolving into a support area. Burlage noted:In July 2019, the price of Bitcoin peaked at around $14,000. At the time, Glassnode chief technical officer Rafael Schultze-Kraft said Bitcoin’s Relative Unrealized Profit hit 0.64.Currently, despite the price of Bitcoin being above $15,000, the Relative Unrealized Profit is at 0.53. This shows BTC has the potential to see a broader rally before a strong pullback."
621,"Despite Bitcoin's (BTC) steep rally in November, the price is consolidating above $15,000 as on-chain analyst, Willy Woo says a blow-off top is unlikely for three main reasons.The three factors are the growing outflow of funds from exchanges, increase in “HODLers,” and data showing that investors already took profit.According to the data from Glassnode, a large amount of Bitcoin has been moving out of centralized exchanges in late October.Woo says this metric is optimistic because it shows investors are transferring funds from trading platforms to personal wallets. This indicates that users are holding their BTC with a long-term investment strategy.The analyst noted that Bitcoin saw the highest number of Bitcoin moved out of exchanges in a single day in the past five years. He explained:In the cryptocurrency market, analysts refer to long-time Bitcoin holders as “HODLers.” They tend to hold onto BTC for prolonged periods, oftentimes for over a year.Before the steep Bitcoin rally began that resulted in new multi-year highs, Woo said the number of Bitcoin HODLers was significantly increasing. It recorded the biggest spike since October 2017, which was just a few months before BTC rallied to its all-time high in December. Woo noted:The high number of HODLers is an important metric because it shows genuine retail demand behind the uptrend. A BTC rally could become vulnerable to a major pullback if it is primarily led by the futures market.The Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) is an indicator that shows whether investors are taking profit on their unrealized profits.Glassnode’s data shows a fairly high number of investors took profit in the past week. This shows the threat of a major profit-taking pullback is lower because investors have already started to realize their profits as these coins have been absorbed by market buyers. Based on the three data points, Woo emphasized that he does not see a blow-off top occurring. The term blow-off top refers to a technical formation wherein an asset’s price declines steeply after hitting a heavy resistance level. Woo wrote:In the short term, the risk to the ongoing Bitcoin rally remains the overcrowded derivatives market. As such, analysts anticipate some consolidation but not a deep correction, at least for now."
622,"Satoshi Natakmoto’s anonymity and powerful mining-incentive mechanism are key examples of what made Bitcoin (BTC) unique and led to its unparalleled success. But for truly democratized money and finance to be achieved, it is worth reminding enthusiasts that Bitcoin was an iteration in a series of trials and errors that go back as far as the 1980s.David Chaum conducted research as early as 1982 that laid the groundwork for the invention of “Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups.” Other cryptographers — including Adam Back, Hal Finney, Nick Szabo and Vitalik Buterin, to mention just a few — have also been hugely influential in pushing the groundbreaking technology forward. Thanks to these early pioneers, we are now embarked on a journey that will continue long into the future as experts and tinkerers relentlessly look for ways to improve on the existing and solve real-world problems.Popularizing technologies like Bitcoin is equally reliant on the evolution of the infrastructure and devices that allow them to function. Satoshi’s 2008 white paper coincided conveniently with the invention of the iPhone and the wider proliferation of smartphones, which has allowed mobile-app developers to put wallets and other crypto-focused tools into the hands of millions of people worldwide.Bitcoin’s close cousin, Ethereum, has experienced colossal growth in recent years and is widely agreed to have been the driving component behind 2017’s controversial, but unquestionably disruptive, ICO craze. That year, we saw the global cryptocurrency market capitalization rise meteorically to over $800 billion, bringing the technology to the attention of political and financial leaders globally in an abrupt fashion.Ethereum is now inarguably the de facto standard for all non-Bitcoin experiments. Identity management, prediction markets, supply chain management and real estate are just a few areas that have been subject to ideation and experimentation on the Ethereum platform since its creation. However, the latest big push for innovation is in the world of decentralized finance.Open-source projects like Uniswap, Compound, Yearn.finance and Synthetix have exploded in 2020. An impressive $11 billion has been locked into smart contracts, according to the data, providing liquidity for a plethora of financial services and instruments in lending, payments, insurance, derivatives and decentralized exchange.Unlike legacy banking infrastructure, what excites industry participants and enthusiasts about DeFi is that it allows anyone to build and launch financial products in a way that is permissionless. Breaking with the inertia that has been characteristic of global banking for decades, this is set to strip centralized actors of monopolistic power and leverage over time. Many are hoping that DeFi will allow financial services to be built in a way that is more equitable, unlocking economic growth for individuals and communities that have until now been underserved.In the corporate world, long-term company visions are built top-down, starting in the boardroom and cascading through management to employees.In contrast, many of the latest DeFi projects are being built with the intention of quickly decentralizing governance to the wider community of tokenholders to form bottom-up structures. This is done by relinquishing control of key components such as treasury management, code changes and legal entities to eliminate single points of attack by nation states or malicious actors.Combatting mounting wealth inequality, political corruption and the monopolization of technology by companies in innovation hubs like Silicon Valley are all a part of what motivates many actors in this industry. A culture of radical decentralization has developed within large factions of the crypto community. However, it remains debatable whether this extreme approach is the most effective way to solve societal problems.Discouraging disproportionate control or influence from centralized actors is an unquestionable priority. Nonetheless, leading predominantly with an ethos of “decentralize everything,” at all levels of the industry and technology stack, can potentially lead to inefficiency.The rapidly evolving nature of DeFi is the very thing that makes the future so difficult to predict. Will on-chain liquidity provision become institutionalized? Will billions of people across the world connect to their own chosen yield-earning pools? What is the future of centralized exchanges with game-changing innovations such as Uniswap and Loopring now taking centerstage? As liquidity moves away from centralized systems, what is the future of payments?In this limitless new world of smart contracts and “augmented money,” what creative new ways will be invented to secure networks, ensure rapid transaction speeds and provide attractive incentives for businesses and consumers to take part?The way to find out is by taking part in the innovation process. Opportunities to contribute and disrupt are endless.The latest progress in DeFi has shown that a lot was missing and that a lot still needs to be achieved. Many more people will enter the arena in the coming years to help advance the technology and its use cases by building and testing concepts around digital assets that have not been previously thought of. Solving problems that have plagued legacy banking for years should be at the forefront of the innovation agenda — building products and services that allow participants at all levels, from the consumer upward, to benefit from economic activity and growth.Participation need not be limited to those with programming knowledge. WordPress has been hugely influential over the past 20 years in widening access to website creation, today powering more than 35% of the entire web. It is used by some of the most well-known websites but also by smaller actors who have been able to try out ideas thanks to an easy-to-use, point-and-click interface that makes the software accessible to any computer-literate person.Frictionless, low-cost tools that require little or no coding expertise allow innovators to rapidly experiment and will lead to the creation of a truly robust DeFi ecosystem.It is believed, according to one study, that the technology has still only reached around 1.2% of the global population. The transformation in money that we are witnessing is part of a much greater trend in which cash is slowly becoming obsolete while open-source software simultaneously removes barriers for innovators to collaborate, conceptualize and build quicker than ever.Credit cards and internet banking were game-changing technologies when they were adopted. We have also seen an explosion in fintech companies in recent years that further enhance the user experience through components such as Know Your Customer technology that, for example, allows customers of challenger banks like Revolut and N26 to open an account in minutes from the comfort of their own homes using their mobile device.Nevertheless, these innovations remain intricately linked to platforms that were initially built for cash. This new blockchain infrastructure can put institutional-grade banking products into the hands of everyday people and solve ""the last mile problem"" by completely bypassing legacy banking systems.The most profound changes happen when new infrastructure enables new consumer behavior. This, in turn, provides previously unimaginable support for increased economic activity and improves the lives of everyday people. The current trend in DeFi is focused on the 1% of speculators, but the end game is to reach the remaining 99%.This article was co-authored by Mark Smargon and Aly Madhavji.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors' alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
623,"Bitcoin price (BTC) appears to be taking a short breather after reaching a new 2020 high at $15,960 on Nov. 5.The 1-hour and 4-hour timeframe show the price compressing within a flag and throughout the majority of the trading day, the $15,500 level has held as support. $15,750 is the level Bitcoin needs to break in order to pursue another stab at $16,000. Within the last hour, a dragonfly doji candle formed as the price swept low to test the lower support of the bull flag at $15,166, and as the formation approaches its terminus traders will look for a breakout which will push through the $15,500 to $15,600 level where a high volume VPVR node lurks.Clearly, there is a small tussle taking place between bulls and bears, and flipping the $15,600 level to support with a 4-hour close will increase the possibility that BTC will make a third run at the $16,000 mark.The RSI also continues to rise above 70, a bullish signal, but daily purchasing volume has tapered off a bit after some traders secured profits as BTC surged to $15,900.Alternatively, a drop below the flag support at $15,100 opens the door for a touch of the 20-MA at $14,680. The swift, nearly vertical breakout that occurred from Nov 4 - 5 occurred without establishing any ‘new supports’, and as the volume profile, visible range shows there is a gap extending from $13,900 to $15,500.In the event that the price falls below $15,100 and buyers don’t perceive this as a dip-buying opportunity, there is the possibility of a retest of the $14,000 to $13,800 level as support.While a 9%, $1,400 drop is un-nerving, lower support retests are perfectly natural and healthy after strong rallies like the one seen this week.As Bitcoin price searches for direction, altcoins have regained a smidgen of the vast territory lost over the past two months. Ether (ETH) is the most notable leader of the past few days as the altcoin rallied to $447 and is currently attempting to break through resistance at $450.Yearn Finance (YFI) also made a strong move as it rallied more than 30% to $11,100. Uniswap’s UNI token also made waves at it added 15.5% and currently trades at $2.53.According to CoinMarketCap, the overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $444.6 billion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 64.7%."
624,"The United States Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently said that additional fiscal stimulus could result in a stronger recovery. He also emphasized that the Fed had enough tools to support the economy.After the winner of the U.S. election is announced, the focus of lawmakers could shift to the next stimulus package. However, additional money printing will only worsen the existing national debt which is currently at $27.2 trillion.Even though a new round of stimulus measures may be required in the short-term to reduce the impact of the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, analysts believe that the Fed may not be able to roll back the measures in the future.For this reason, apprehensive institutional investors have been hedging their portfolio with gold and a few others like billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones have advocated buying Bitcoin (BTC).Galaxy Digital CEO and investor Mike Novogratz believes that Bitcoin is in a bull phase. Hence, he recently advised Bitcoin HODLers to sit on their hands and lock away their phones to counter the emotion to book profits after the recent rally.While long-term investors could HODL their positions, short-term traders will have to be alert lest they may give back a large part of their unrealized gains.Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to see whether the rally has topped out or if it can extend further.Bitcoin (BTC) closed above $14,000 on Nov. 4 and followed the move with a strong rally on Nov. 5. The price reached an intraday high of $15,956.26 today, which is currently acting as a resistance.However, the trend is clearly in favor of the bulls and any dip is likely to be viewed as a buying opportunity.Although the relative strength index has invalidated the negative divergence, it has risen deep into the overbought territory, which suggests that a few days of consolidation or a correction may be around the corner.If the bulls buy the next dip to $14,000, it will suggest that the previous resistance has flipped to support and this level may act as a floor during future declines.Sometimes, during a buying frenzy, the RSI can remain deeply overbought for a long time. Hence, if the bulls can push the price above $16,000, a move to the $17,000–$17,200 resistance zone is possible. This is the final hurdle before a shot at the all-time highs.However, vertical rallies rarely sustain and they usually end with sharp declines. Hence, traders should exercise caution even if the uptrend continues.The bullish view will be invalidated if the BTC/USD pair turns down and plummets below the $14,000 support.Ether (ETH) picked up momentum after the bulls pushed the price above the downtrend line on Nov. 4. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($395) and the RSI close to the overbought zone suggest that bulls are in control.The next target on the upside is $450 and if the bulls can push the price above this resistance, the ETH/USD pair may reach $488.134. Even if the bears offer resistance at $450, the bulls are likely to buy the dips as the sentiment has turned positive.The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA and the advantage will turn in favor of the bears if the 50-day SMA ($374) cracks.XRP has largely been range-bound between $0.2295 and $0.26 for the past few weeks. The failure of the bears to break below the range on Nov. 3 attracted buyers who have pushed the price to the resistance of the range.If the bulls can push and sustain the price above $0.26, the XRP/USD pair could start a new uptrend that may result in a rally to $0.303746. The RSI has risen above 60 for the first time since August, which suggests that the bulls are making a strong comeback.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair turns down from the current levels or fails to sustain above $0.26, then a few more days of range-bound action is likely. The trend will turn in favor of the bears if the pair plummets below the $0.2295 to $0.219712 support zone.The rebound off the $231.93 support has reached the 20-day EMA ($255) where the bears may offer resistance. If Bitcoin Cash (BCH) turns down from the current levels, the bears will again try to sink the price below $231.93.Conversely, if the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair could rise to the overhead resistance zone at $272 to $280.The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has risen to the midpoint, which suggests a possible range-bound action in the near term.A breakout of $280 could signal the start of an up-move that may rise to $326 while a break below $231.93 could result in a fall to $200.The long tails on the candlesticks of the past three days show that the bulls accumulated on dips below the uptrend line. They have currently pushed Chainlink (LINK) above the downtrend line, which suggests that the correction may be over.The bulls will now try to push the price to the next overhead resistance at $13.28. A breakout and close above this resistance could complete a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern.However, the flat moving averages and the RSI just above 55 suggest a range-bound action in the next few days.This view will be invalidated if the LINK/USD pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below $9.7665.Binance Coin (BNB) reversed direction from $25.6652 on Nov. 4 and the bulls are currently trying to sustain the price above the 20-day EMA ($28.83). This move suggests that the bears are losing their grip.If the price sustains above the moving averages, the bulls will try to push the BNB/USD pair to the overhead resistance at $32.However, if the pair turns down from the current levels, the bears will once again attempt to break the $25.6652 support.The flat moving averages and the RSI close to the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. This could result in a few more days of range-bound action between $25.6652 and $32.The successful retest of the breakout level of the inverse head and shoulders pattern on Nov. 3 and 4 attracted strong buying from the bulls who have pushed Litecoin (LTC) above $60.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, which suggests that bulls are in control.If the bulls sustain the momentum and drive the price above $64, the LTC/USD pair could rally to $68.9008.However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They are currently attempting to stall the up-move at $64 but unless they pull the price back below $60, the advantage will remain with the bulls.The failure of the bears to sink Polkadot (DOT) below $3.80 on Nov. 3 and 4 attracted buying and the bulls have pushed the price above the moving averages.The DOT/USD pair is currently range-bound between $3.80 and $4.95. If the bulls can push the price above $4.6112, the pair may attempt to break above $4.95. If that happens, then a rally to $5.5899 is possible.Both moving averages are flat and the RSI has risen into the positive territory, which suggests a minor advantage to the bulls. However, if the price turns down from $4.6112 or $4.95, the pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.The rebound off the $0.0893 support picked up momentum after the bulls pushed Cardano (ADA) above the moving averages. The altcoin is currently attempting to rally to the overhead resistance at $0.1142241.If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the ADA/USD pair could remain range-bound between $0.0893 and $0.1142241 for a few days.However, the flat moving averages and the RSI above 60 suggest that the bulls are attempting a comeback. If the buyers can push the price above $0.1142241, a rally to $0.128 and then to $0.1445 is possible.This positive view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels and plummets below $0.0893.The bulls purchased Bitcoin SV (BSV) on dips to the $146.20 support on Nov. 3 and 4 as seen from the long tails on the candlesticks. The rebound picked momentum on Nov. 5 and the altcoin has currently risen above the moving averages.If the bulls can sustain the price above the moving averages, the BSV/USD pair could rally to $180.63. The bears may defend this level aggressively as the pair had reversed direction from this resistance on three previous occasions.Both moving averages are flat and the RSI has risen to the midpoint, which suggests that the range-bound action is likely to continue for a few more days.Contrary to this assumption, a trending move could start if the bulls push and sustain the price above $180.63 or the bears sink the pair below the $146.20 to $135 support zone.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

625,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is nearing $16,000 after achieving $15,960 on Binance. Following the dominant cryptocurrency's rally, analysts are now looking toward Ether (ETH). The Ethereum blockchain's native token has seen heightened momentum in the past week. After underperforming against BTC in October, the probability of a new ETH rally is beginning to increase.There are two key reasons why analysts expect Ether to perform strongly in the near term. First, the capital in the Bitcoin market could move into ETH following the announcement of Ethereum 2.0. Second, ETH recently tested a critical resistance level, raising the chances of a broader rally. Given that the altcoin market has historically rallied after an initial Bitcoin upsurge, the timing of an ETH uptrend is ideal.Since Oct. 21, the price of Bitcoin has increased by around 33%. It broke out of important resistance areas, one after another, starting with $13,000. When Bitcoin initially surpassed $13,000, large whale clusters formed at that level. It showed that whales began to actively accumulate BTC, causing $13,000 to evolve into a support zone.After BTC reclaimed $13,000 as a support level for the first time since July 2019, it continued to surge upward. Over time, it confirmed $13,500 as the next support level, followed by $14,000 and, most recently, $15,000. When Bitcoin started climbing upward, analysts said it was negative for altcoins, as it began to suck most of the volume from the crypto market. Consequently, as Bitcoin rallied, many altcoins declined in value against both Bitcoin and the U.S. dollar.The overwhelming strength of Bitcoin from October to early November took a hard toll on the altcoin market, but Bitcoin's price action has shown that the bullish market sentiment around crypto has returned. As such, a clean breakout above $15,000 could trigger more capital to diverge into higher-risk plays, which include Ether.Denis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto exchange and broker Bequant, told Cointelegraph that capital from Bitcoin could cycle into Ether and the Ethereum ecosystem. In the last 48 hours, the decentralized finance market has performed particularly strong after stagnating since early September.DeFi tokens, such as Yearn.finance's YFI and Uniswap's UNI surged by almost 30% after Ether’s abrupt recovery. Hence, Vinokourov emphasized that the broader Ethereum ecosystem could soon benefit from Bitcoin's rally:Atop the historical tendency of Ether to soar following a Bitcoin rally, crypto traders have said that ETH could soon rise against Bitcoin. Michaël van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said the ETH/BTC trading pair has hit a major support area. Van de Poppe stated, “It took ages, but $ETH reached the 0.026 area we've been discussing a lot,” referring to it as a big support zone for ETH.The release of Ethereum 2.0 in the imminent future is critical for the momentum of Ether, as the network upgrade would significantly increase the transaction capacity of ETH. This would allow the new DeFi cycle, if it emerges, to last for a long period because it would reduce the risk of network clogs and high transaction fees. Since Ethereum 2.0 supports staking, allowing users to allocate 32 ETH to the network in return for incentives, it could decrease the circulating supply of ETH across exchanges.According to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin's blog post titled ""Why Proof of Stake,"" staking on Ethereum will reward users with a 15% return. Because the rate of return is based on ETH holdings and not the U.S. dollar, if the price of ETH continues to increase, then the staking incentives increase with it. As such, analysts expect more investors to accumulate ETH to stake it, which would decrease the sell-side pressure on it.The market and the community have anticipated Ethereum 2.0 for several years, but challenges have delayed its release. Ethereum 2.0 has required several testnets with an immense amount of testing due to the complexity of the upgrade. Developers behind Ethereum 2.0 wrote on the Medalla testnet's Github page:The sentiment around Ether has become increasingly bullish because the launch of Ethereum 2.0 coincides with various favorable catalysts for ETH. A pseudonymous cryptocurrency trader known as “Loma” pinpointed the fact that Ethereum 2.0 will remove about $1 billion from the market. While supply drops, the rally of Bitcoin is bringing significant capital back into the cryptocurrency as the ETH/BTC trading pair is forming a bottom formation.The excitement around Ethereum 2.0 has intensified after Buterin's personal wallet sent 3,200 ETH to an Ethereum 2.0 deposit address. According to the official Ethereum 2.0 release notes by coordinator Danny Ryan, if there are 16,384 deposits of 32 ETH seven days prior to Dec. 1, the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade can commence. After years of research, testing and implementation, there is finally a hard date for the release.The confluence of Ethereum 2.0 nearing, which would benefit the entire Ethereum and DeFi ecosystem in terms of scaling, and the strength of the ETH/BTC trading pair makes a rally in November and December more likely. There is also the narrative that ETH surged significantly in January 2018 to its all-time high of $1,419, almost a month after BTC reached its record-high at $20,000."
626,"While the United States’ election is still undecided, Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing a major rally, as BTC price nearly reached $16,000 today, the highest level since January 2018.Other asset classes have also been doing well, such as Nasdaq, which saw gains of more than 7% in recent days. In the cryptocurrency markets, Ether (ETH) has started to climb as well, with ETH hitting $445.The weekly chart of Bitcoin is showing the final hurdle before the new all-time high can be reached, as it’s facing the resistance zone between $15,800 and 16,800.The probability of a breakthrough in one go is not high, given that the price of Bitcoin has already surged by more than 50% in recent weeks.Since the rally may now be overextended, as several indicators suggest, it’s unlikely to anticipate further continuation. In other words, traders will likely be taking some quick profits after such a huge rally in a short period of time.Therefore, the most likely support zone based on the weekly chart is found at the $11,600–12,000 area. This zone has been a crucial resistance to a breakthrough in the previous years, as Bitcoin’s price has been constantly rejected in this area. A support/resistance flip in this area would be relatively healthy.The Fear and Greed Index is currently showing a value of 90, which is classified as extreme greed and warning traders that a correction should not come as a surprise.The last time this sentiment level was reached was during the summer of 2019. This rally ran from $3,200 to $13,800 and ended in a correction of more than 50% in the following months.The total cryptocurrency market capitalization is showing a clear breakout above the recent high of $390 billion.This breakout looks likely to continue rallying toward $500 billion — the next resistance zone found on this chart. However, to sustain such a rally, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has to hold above $390 billion, as that would potentially result in a bullish support/resistance flip for more upside.Bitcoin’s daily chart shows the BTC price approaching a higher timeframe resistance area at $16,000.The support levels to watch are shown on the chart. The first support area is found between $14,000–$14,200, which traders should keep an eye on in the short term.On the daily chart, the levels between $12,800–$13,100 and around $11,600 should be a trigger point for potential buy-the-dip entries in case of a correction (after failing to break above $16,000, for instance). All in all, the sentiment is heavily bullish at this point, with the price at multi-year highs and only one major resistance level remaining at $16,000 before a new all-time high comes into play.

627,"Bitcoin (BTC) resurgence is continuing to sap capital from the altcoin markets as other cryptocurrencies are struggling to catch up to BTC.The DeFi Composite Index, first launched by Binance Futures in late August, is seeing its second month of strain, trading down from its all-time highs of close to $1,200 to under $400, a decline of roughly 60%.In fact, most DeFi tokens have erased 70% to 90% of their gains since early September, as Binance’s Nov. 5 report notes. In early October, Cointelegraph reported on the index’s already stark decline to $507. Its all-time high had been $1,189 on the first day of trading in late August.As the report outlines, only eight DeFi tokens, AAVE and UNI, showed a neutral correlation with Bitcoin over the 45 days running up to Nov. 1. Eight other DeFi tokens had a wholly negative relationship. In addition:This week, the decentralized exchange, or DEX, UniSwap has seen $1.8 billion in volume, accounting for the lion's share of DEX trading, with monthly volume for all DEXs combined standing at roughly $2.8 billion.Bitcoin market cap dominance, meanwhile, has climbed steeply in recent weeks with the rising price, now being up nearly 10% since early September.Binance notes that there is a significant uptick in Bitcoin trading volume dominance as well, arguing that it has been ""suppressed in prior months"" due to the media's preoccupation with ""alt-season.""By October, however, the market sentiment “completely reversed” in Bitcoin’s favor with traders shifting to BTC as the altcoin sector declines.Binance nonetheless takes the line that the underlying fundamentals of the DeFi market are solid. Even despite these bleak retracements across the board, the total value locked in the DeFi sector has kept above $11 billion in the past 30 days."
628,"According to Tether’s official transparency data, the USDT market cap crossed a $17 billion mark for the first time, hitting over $17 billion in total assets.Tether’s market cap has been growing exponentially in 2020. As of mid-September, Tether’s market cap had seen nearly a four-fold increase since the beginning of the year, surging above $15 billion from around $4 billion.According to data from crypto analytics firm Messari, USDT saw a notable increase from August 2020 to date. As such, USDT added more than $5 billion in market cap over the past three months.Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market, is seeing a massive influx in its market capitalization, which is likely fueling the current Bitcoin (BTC) price rally.According to Ki Young-Ju, CEO of crypto data platform CryptoQuant, the latest crypto rally is being driven by an increased amount of deposits in stablecoins such as USDT. On Nov. 5, he pointed out:Ki Young-Ju previously drew attention to this correlation in October, noting that the influx of stablecoin deposits was “helpful to predict the BTC surge at the end of July.”Data from CryptoQuant also shows stablecoin inflow transactions hitting new 2020 highs on Oct. 18, exceeding 60,000 transactions. The number of such transactions has fallen since, however, accounting for about 30,000 by the end of October."
629,"The United States Federal Reserve is still unintentionally advertising Bitcoin, as Chair Jerome Powell argues for more money printing.In a tweet on Nov. 6, Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini, said that Powell’s latest speech this week was “code for buy Bitcoin.”Powell was addressing a news conference, which followed the Fed’s Nov. 5 meeting on the state of the economy and future measures.As before, he reiterated that the central bank had not exhausted its range of tools for supporting the economy. These have so far included heavy interventions in stock markets, financial stimulus measures and direct payments to Americans.“I just would say that I think we’ll have a stronger recovery if we can just get some more fiscal support, when it’s appropriate… the size Congress thinks is appropriate,” he said, quoted by Reuters.Bitcoin proponents have long warned about the long-term impact of short-term meddling in the economy by central banks that is represented by the huge increase in public debt seen in the U.S. and elsewhere in 2020.The Fed’s balance sheet stood at $7.14 trillion on Friday, near record highs. U.S. national debt has topped $27.2 trillion, a figure never before seen in history.In what some this week described as a clear demonstration of simple supply and demand at work, Bitcoin — with its fixed supply — continued climbing as Powell delivered his speech.The largest cryptocurrency has gained over 15% since the start of the week, rising to levels not seen since the end of 2017.According to quant analyst PlanB and others, this is to be expected, as six months after its block subsidy halving cut the supply of new Bitcoins in half, investors have bought up the slack.These have included existing corporate buyers who have upped their requirements, among them payment gateway Square, which saw 80% of its Q3 revenue come from Bitcoin.“There is virtually no BTC left for sale,” the popular Twitter account Girevik summarized, noting large buyer support on exchanges at levels below $13,000. Sellers have yet to impact the market, even at close to $16,000."
630,"As the Bitcoin (BTC) price is reaching its highest levels since January 2018, Bitcoin mining is getting more profitable due to a number of factors.According to data from Blockchain.com, BTC miner revenue has soared to levels not seen since Bitcoin’s third halving in May 2020, which reduced the miner block reward from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.As such, BTC miners’ revenue hit $20.8 million on Nov. 4. According to Blockchain.com, this is the highest point recorded since September 2019, when the miners’ block reward was twice as much as now.A spike in BTC miner revenue levels is coming from the Bitcoin price doubling since May’s halving. On Nov. 4, the price reached a new 2020 high at $15,950, jumping more than 20% over the past seven days.The jump is also due to the simultaneous rise in Bitcoin transaction fees. As reported by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin transaction fees surged by nearly 200% in late October. As such, the percentage of BTC miner revenue from fees has significantly increased, accounting for $4.15 million or roughly 20% of total miner revenue.Amid parabolic growth in revenue, some miners are likely to start cashing out at this point.According to analysts at CryptoQuant, some miners may be compelled to start selling BTC since the Miner’s Position Index is currently at around 4. Values above 2 indicate that most miners are selling.Additionally, there is also a noticeable spike in transactions from miners to exchanges as the price crossed above $15,000. However, the amount is still relatively small compared to pre-halving outflow levels. “Insurance,” CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, commented on the spike in outflows, suggesting that while miners are being cautious, most are still likely anticipating the price of Bitcoin to go higher. "
631,"Bitcoin has just powered up to its highest price since Jan. 8, 2018, knocking on the door of $16,000 as FOMO grips the markets once again.In a move upward that has added more than 12% over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin prices touched their highest levels in 33 months, reaching $15,980 during early trading in Asia today on Nov. 6, according to Tradingview.com.The $16,000 level may form resistance since there were two weekly closes at $16,100 in early January 2018, so if this week’s candle can hold on to these levels, there could be a push higher toward that elusive all-time high. Chart patterns are currently reminiscent of those in late November 2017 when BTC made a rapid push from $7,000 to top $16,000 in just three weeks.Analysts have noted that the price of Bitcoin is now 80% of its all-time high, the closest it has ever been to full recovery, which has only taken 12 days on average from these levels to ATH historically.On the flip side, traders may start to take some profit here, which could result in a pullback.The Fear and Greed Index is currently cranked over into the “extreme greed” zone at 90. The last time it was this high was in June 2019, when it reached 92 as Bitcoin powered to its highest price for that year at just under $14,000.Experienced investors such as billionaire and former hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz advised against emotion-based selling in a recent tweet.The U.S. election results may have been the catalyst for this week’s rally as Joe Biden extends his lead over Donald Trump with the counting almost concluded. At the time of press, Biden was leading by 264 to 214 in the race to 270, with just five states left to go. Square has also just reported record-breaking revenue and profit from Bitcoin sales on its Cash App."
632,"Cash App, the Bitcoin-friendly mobile payments app from U.S. financial services firm Square, has reported Bitcoin (BTC) has overtaken all other revenue sources, making up almost 80% of its entire revenue in the third quarter.In Square’s third-quarter report, Cash App’s Bitcoin-derived revenue of $1.63 billion in Bitcoin marked a massive increase of more than 1,100% when compared to the same period in 2019.Bitcoin revenue was by far the largest component of Cash App’s overall revenue generation of $2 billion, with all other revenue streams totaling $453 million, or 22% of the total.Cash App functions as a broker for Bitcoin purchases, buying it on behalf of the user, and adding a small fee.The report notes that some of the increased Bitcoin sales were due to the app’s Auto-Invest tool, launched in May this year, which allows users to recurring daily or weekly purchases of stock or BTC.Bitcoin revenue produced $32 million in gross profit for the third quarter, an increase of 15 times from the previous year’s profit of $2.1 million in the same period.Square’s total Q3 revenue was more than $3 billion, up 140% from 2019 — of which Bitcoin comprised more than 50%. The total Bitcoin revenue for all of 2019 was $338 million with a gross profit of $5 million.Hours after the report was released, Square’s share price rose 6% during after-hours trading to sit at $184, eyeing off the previous all-time high of $190 earlier this month. At the same time, Bitcoin rose by a similar amount to hit a two-year high of $15,880.In the report Square also noted its $50 million Bitcoin (4,709 BTC) investment as a treasury asset, which is now worth $74.8 million. The company’s purchase was based on the belief that “cryptocurrencies are an instrument of economic empowerment and align with the company’s purpose,” adding:Despite Square’s large investment, the company ranks seventh in terms of publicly trading company’s Bitcoin holdings."
633,"In the last 24 hours, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) rose by more than 10%, breaching the $15,000 handle for the first time since January 2018, and reaching a new 2020 high at $15,950. Data from Cointelegraph Markets shows the BTC/USD pair briefly rose to $15,950 before retracing to $15,500. According to crypto analytics platform Messari, Bitcoin has now spent more than 20 days above the $15,000 barrier and 19 days above $15,109. This represents roughly 0.4% of the crypto asset’s life since it was created in 2009.“People will never again say Bitcoin is dead,” said Grayscale CEO Barry Silbert in response to the recent price movement.Bitcoin’s bullish behavior comes amid breaking news that the United States Department of Justice will be seizing more than $1 billion in Bitcoin from an unnamed hacker who breached a Silk Road wallet.Cointelegraph reported on Wednesday that the anonymous crypto user had moved more than 69,370 BTC — roughly $1.08 billion at current pricing — marking it the first time anyone had transferred assets associated with the darknet market since 2015.At the time of writing, U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden is six electoral votes away from victory, with officials continuing to count ballots in Georgia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, and Nevada. Many industry experts are predicting continued volatility among cryptocurrencies and the stock market until a winner is determined."
634,"Historically, traditional market analysts and old school investors tend to look at Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with a wary eye, and when crypto pundits attempt to make comparisons between the two these investors say it's an apples to oranges argument.Take, for example, Warren Buffett, who many a time has said Bitcoin is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme as it does not produce anything and therefore has no value.According to these traditionalists, comparing Bitcoin to Apple, Tesla, or a bank stock like JPMorgan is irrational as the latter employ workers, produce products, and generate revenues and dividends which are distributed to shareholders.Despite these arguments, a simple fact remains. Bitcoin has had a strong year and the digital asset is outperforming financial stocks in 2020 due to a considerable increase in institutional demand, investors' belief in BTC's exponential growth potential, and its asymmetrical price action in the face of global economic uncertainty.As shown in the chart below, the majority of top U.S. banks posted record results in Q2 as the entire market roared back from the COVID-19-induced sell-off in mid-March, but significant threats to the stock market and global economy remain. At the same time, Bitcoin massively outperformed the financial sector, particularly in the fourth quarter.Since the start of the fourth quarter, the price of Bitcoin has increased from $10,773 to as high as $15,366 on Binance. This is an impressive 42% increase in less than two months and a show of the digital asset's strong momentum.The strength of Bitcoin’s rally can partially be attributed to the growing perception that is an alternative store of value. Earlier in the year billionaire Wall Street investor, Paul Tudor Jones . The overall positive sentiment around BTC as a potential safe-haven asset is clearly buoying its momentum.In comparison to other sectors, bank stocks have performed relatively well since the March crash. The shift in consumer demand from in-store purchasing to online shopping severely affected businesses that lacked a digital footprint. But relaxed financial conditions, massive economic stimulus from the Fed, and the government's business-friendly stance led banks to beat quarterly estimates and perform strongly.JPMorgan, for instance, recorded a 32.63% rally since the March 23 low. In the fourth quarter, the $319 billion banking giant is up over 8%.In the second quarter of 2020, from bond trading, wildly outperforming analyst estimates. At the same time, investment banking and equities trading revenues also soared.Other major banks, including Goldman Sachs, . Goldman’s trading division recorded a revenue of $4.55 billion. The bank exceeded Wall Street expectations with ease, posting a 29% year-over-year increase.While each of these is a commendable performance, especially considering the high levels of uncertainty and economic downturn brought about by the coronavirus pandemic, Bitcoin's price action has dwarfed that of banks and other risk-on assets for the majority of 2020.Bitcoin has consistently seen a unique combination of surging institutional demand a steady increase in mainstream awareness.According to a survey released by Grayscale, more than half of U.S. investors are interested in investing in Bitcoin. The study said:Businesses, investment banks, and retail investors have all recognized that there is great growth potential in Bitcoin, and this possibly why companies like PayPal and Square, have decided to support cryptocurrency.Coincidentally, financial institutions that have actively supported cryptocurrencies have performed especially well in recent months.PayPal stock, as an example, rose 12% in the past three days, demonstrating optimistic momentum since it that it would integrate crypto buying and selling.As 2020 comes to a close, investors of all levels will be keeping a close eye on Bitcoin's () price to see if it continues to heavily outperform equities markets.The fact that major bank stocks like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Bank of America are falling behind a 'small-cap' cryptocurrency is a significant occurrence and this is likely to draw more curious investors to the crypto sector."
635,"As votes came in on the night of Nov. 3, the day of the U.S. presidential election, Bitcoin's (BTC) volume soared on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or CME. ""Overnight, before 9:00am NYT over 6,700 Bitcoin futures contracts traded (33,500 equivalent Bitcoin), 75% more than what has been observed YTD [year-to-date] and more than double the volume observed since launch,"" a CME Group spokesperson told Cointelegraph on Wednesday.6,700 BTC CME Bitcoin futures contracts traded between 5 PM CST on Nov. 3 and 8 AM CST on Nov. 4. CME Bitcoin futures trade 23 hours per day, between 5 pm and 4pm. Each contract is worth 5 BTC. That means that overnight during the U.S. presidential election, the CME hosted 33,500 Bitcoin in trading volume, equal to approximately $462 million, based on a rough estimate of Bitcoin's average price during that window. Such volume stands 75% higher than the exchange's average action hosted during that same time window on any other night over the past year, the spokesperson clarified. Additionally, the exchange hosted more big players than ever before. ""Ahead of the election, the number of Long Open Interest Holders (LOIHs, large traders as defined by the CFTC) to a new record, 102,"" the spokesperson said. November also started off hot, showing an increase in the number of Bitcoin positions participants held, known as open interest, or OI. ""Average daily futures OI over the first two days in November is up 20% over October to 11,929 contracts,"" they noted. November's early action logically came with little surprise, given the building trading interest seen near last month's end, expressed in average daily volume, or ADV. The spokesperson said:The CME is looking back on a positive year for Bitcoin trading, while Bitcoin itself has yielded a tremendous run thus far, especially given its March 2020 low near $3,800. The asset has reached prices not seen in nearly three years.  "
636,"On Nov. 4, the open interest on Bitcoin options reached a new all-time high. As this occurred, an even more curious case emerged. On Nov. 6, a total of $470 million in open interest is set to expire. This is rather unusual, as usually, monthly and quarterly concentrate the liquidity.At the moment, Deribit holds 75% of the open interest, followed by Bit.com with 13%. Oddly enough, on both exchanges, put options represent 65% of the outstanding notional. This ratio is the exact opposite of the Bitcoin (BTC) options aggregate market for the remaining dates, which favors call options by a wide margin.On a more granular view, 6,050 BTC call options are ranging from $13,500 to $14,750. Bit.com adds 1,130 BTC, and OKEx adds another 430 BTC. Therefore, there's an immediate $114 million open interest supporting current levels.Meanwhile, the put options from $13,250 to $14,750 amount to 4,700 BTC at Deribit, followed by 1,320 BTC at Bit.com and OKEx with 480 BTC. Thus, the immediate sell-side pressure amounts to $98 million open interest from put options.In reality, most of the put options have been depreciated, with no market value. With less than 16 hours till expiry, a right to sell BTC at $12,500 and lower is worthless. This excludes 60% out of the $300 million put options open interest.Therefore, when analyzing just the option strikes closer to market levels, there is a slight $16 million imbalance favoring the buy-side. It seems like there had been some large bearish trades meticulously prepared for the U.S. elections, negatively impacting the price.Fortunately for the buyers, the opposite movement appears to be taking place, causing bearish short-term options to get wasted.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

637,"Bitcoin (BTC) hit $15,000 on Nov. 5 as excitement over the United States election spilled over from macro markets. Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView showed BTC/USD tackle the $15,000 barrier repeatedly throughout the day, finally breaking it to post press-time highs of $15,200.The move seals a hectic day for Bitcoin, which just 24 hours ago traded below $14,000. The last time that BTC/USD saw $15,000 was in early January 2018.Reacting, many well-known Bitcoin figures noted that it was high time for the largest cryptocurrency to make a decisive move. Macro investor Dan Tapeiro in particular praised the price models of quant analyst PlanB.“Now enterring what is called the ‘moment of realization’ for Bitcoin,” he tweeted.As Cointelegraph reported, some expected $15,000 to pose major resistance that would temporarily quash Bitcoin’s $1,000-plus daily gains.Others argued that technically, there was very little standing in the way of new all-time highs once Bitcoin overturned resistance at $14,000 and then $14,500.“I have seen this show before,” PlanB added, referencing the bull runs of 2013 and 2017."
638,"Amid the ongoing rally in cryptocurrency markets, Bitcoin (BTC) has secured another milestone by hitting a new all-time high against Russia’s national currency, the ruble.According to data from major crypto tracking website CoinGecko, Bitcoin has broken another historic high against the ruble, crossing its previous ATH of around 1,157,000 rubles. According to the CoinGecko, Bitcoin was worth over 1,160,000 as of 16:00 UTC .Bitcoin’s new ATH comes amid a major rally in the crypto market, with Bitcoin crossing $14,700 for the first time since early January 2018 earlier today. The rally continues to gain momentum as Bitcoin is now passing $15,000, according to data from CoinGecko.As the ruble has weakened against the dollar, the new ATH is not only based on Bitcoin’s massive growth. The previous ATH of Bitcoin’s price against the ruble was recorded back in 2017, when Bitcoin hit its record high of $20,000. At the time, the United States dollar cost about 59 rubles. Following a major decline against the ruble amid the United States presidential elections, one dollar is now worth around 77 rubles.The Russian ruble is not the only fiat currency facing new Bitcoin all-time highs amid the ongoing crypto rally and rising inflation. According to entrepreneur and market commentator Alistair Milne, Bitcoin price hit a new record high in seven national currencies like Brazil, Turkey, and Argentina in October 2020. On Oct. 22, Milne predicted that Bitcoin will soon hit a new ATH in local currencies of Russia and Colombia."
639,"From November to December in 2017, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a parabolic uptrend to a new all-time high at $20,000.There are three reasons Bitcoin might see a similar trend in the upcoming months. First, the post-halving cycle is coming into effect. Second, the relative strength index (RSI) shows room for a bigger rally. Third, the rally is not overheated, at least in the derivatives market.PlanB, the creator of the Stock to Flow (S2F) indicator, shared a long-term RSI chart of Bitcoin. The indicator, which measures whether an asset is overbought or oversold, shows BTC is still at a neutral level.Although Bitcoin has rallied from $10,500 to $14,600 within a month, the RSI shows there is room for more upside.For instance, in December 2017, the RSI of Bitcoin surpassed 95 points. When the RSI exceeds 75 points, traders start to consider the asset to be overbought. Currently, the long-term RSI of BTC shows it is under 70 points.In 2017, one of the primary narratives around the upsurge of Bitcoin was its halving in 2016. A block reward halving, which occurs approximately every four years, causes the rate at which BTC is produced by miners to drop by half.The slower production of Bitcoin leads to an overall drop in BTC inflows into exchanges, leading the supply to drop.The latest halving occurred in May 2020, and in 2017, Bitcoin started to rally months after the activation of the halving. The ongoing rally of Bitcoin goes in line with its previous macro rallies.Throughout the past five days, the funding rate of Bitcoin has stayed negative on major exchanges, particularly on Binance Futures. This shows that the majority of the futures market has been shorting BTC.A rally is considered overheated when the futures funding rate begins to increase beyond the average rate, which is 0.01%. In recent weeks, the funding rate of BTC has been hovering between -0.01% to 0.01%, showing a rather neutral derivatives market.In addition to the uncrowded futures market, there are also fewer sellers in the spot market. According to TensorCharts, there are some sell orders at $15,000, but no major sellers at that level and above it.Since there is little resistance between $15,000 and $20,000, this raises the probability of hitting a new record-high in the coming months.If the same post-halving cycle as 2017 follows, then Bitcoin would theoretically reach its peak in the second quarter of 2021. If that is the case, there is a chance that BTC could far exceed $20,000.The ongoing rally depicts an immensely strong momentum for Bitcoin because miners have started to sell BTC. This shows the market is absorbing the selling pressure from miners."
640,"Taiwan-based cryptocurrency exchange Cobinhood is making significant adjustments to its customer service practices in 2021.According to an official announcement on Nov. 1, Cobinhood will change its customer service policy to get rid of real-time interactions with clients.Starting Jan. 1, 2021, Cobinhood’s customer support will only communicate with clients through email. “During the whole process, no service specialist will be engaged for real-time conversation and everything will be done by email,” the announcement notes.As part of the upcoming customer service change, Cobinhood will also prohibit its customers from changing account passwords and the original registered email address. The exchange’s customer service will only reply to requests by sending emails to originally registered email addresses.The current status of Cobinhood’s operations remains unclear, as earlier this year, the exchange announced it would be shutting down and auditing all account balances from Jan. 10 to Feb. 9. The exchange promised to resume operations on Feb. 10, but online data about the exchange shows that Cobinhood has been mostly inactive.Major crypto market data providers like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko show no trading volume on Cobinhood. Furthermore, Cobinhood’s official Telegram channel and Twitter account have been silent since 2019. However, the Nov. 1 announcement claims that the exchange intends to “provide more effective service.”Cobinhood did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.Launched in 2017, Cobinhood used to be one of the world’s biggest crypto trading platforms. In order to launch the exchange, Cobinhood’s founders raised $10 million in an initial coin offering in Oct. 2017. At publishing time, Cobinhood’s token COB is trading at $0.0005 with a market cap of $238,276, down from about $400 million in early 2018."
641,"En+ Group, the world’s top producer of low-carbon aluminum and the largest private-sector generator of hydropower, has entered its first crypto mining joint venture.The new venture, called Bit+, will focus on creating facilities that support crypto mining with a low carbon footprint. En+ Group’s partner in Bit+ is the Russian company BitRiver, which provides hosting services and turnkey solutions for large-scale, institutional crypto mining operations.BitRiver currently operates the largest data center offering colocation services for Bitcoin (BTC) mining in the Russian Federation and offers similar services across the country and to CIS neighbors. The first result of the Bit+ venture is the installation of a new facility close to BitRiver’s existing data center in Bratsk, located in the Irkutsk region of the Russian Federation. En+ Group has committed 10MW of electricity to the facility, which is composed of modular crypto mining units and is already operational. The companies have plans to scale the facility’s capacity to roughly 40MW.For its initial phase, the facility is composed of 14 modular units, each of which is a converted shipping container that is as large as a full-scale crypto mining data center. Each unit can accommodate up to 400 of Bitmain’s S19 Pro miners.In an official statement, En+ Group provided some context regarding the choice of the Irkutsk region and its apparent viability for lower-carbon solutions to cryptocurrency mining:As reported, high energy consumption remains an Achilles’ heel for the crypto sector, particularly for coins such as Bitcoin, whose consensus algorithm is computationally intensive and thus demands exceptionally high levels of energy to maintain.Several energy experts have attempted to reorient the energy debate surrounding Bitcoin away from energy consumption. They have instead focused on analyzing where that energy is produced and how it is generated, and have argued that it is most important to ensure that less harmful choices are made at the power generation stage. With financial and geopolitical actors now entering the endgame of global climate politics, it remains to be seen how far greening crypto’s energy consumption, instead of aiming to reduce it, will be enough to make the sector truly sustainable."
642,"Sam Bankman-Fried, the CEO of Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency derivatives exchange FTX, donated $5.2 million to Joe Biden’s presidential campaign.As the Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 28, Biden’s presidential campaign received a total of $79.5 million from the top 100 donors describing themselves as CEOs. Bankman-Fried is reportedly the second-largest “CEO-contributor” to the campaign after Michael Bloomberg, a co-founder of the eponymous financial and media company, who donated $56 million.The major contributions by CEOs to both Biden and current president Donald Trump are still only a drop in the bucket. Both campaigns together with their outside backers raised $2.2 billion dollars.While Bankman-Fried is a “relative newcomer to political spending,” according to the Wall Street Journal, FTX has already dabbled in the arena.In February 2020, FTX set up a futures contract designed to allow traders to bet on Trump’s reelection in 2020. Dubbed Trump token, the contract expires to $1 if Trump wins the 2020 U.S. presidential general election, and $0 if he loses. According to the latest recorded data, the majority of traders have put their bets on “Trump Lose.”  FTX subsequently launched a similar futures contract for Trump’s rival Biden.At publishing time, votes for the American presidential election are still being tallied, with no declared winner so far.

643,"Bitcoin (BTC) hit $14,500 for the first time since early January 2018 on Nov. 5 as crucial support held at $14,000.Data from Cointelegraph Markets and TradingView showed Bitcoin’s gains continuing in Thursday trading, amid market tension over the U.S. election result.At press time, highs of $14,560 had appeared on major exchange Bitstamp, with BTC/USD subsequently returning to fluctuate around $14,500 amid volatile conditions.Daily gains for the pair stood at 6.5% as election turmoil produced solid gains for both Bitcoin and traditional safe-haven gold.Meanwhile, Cointelegraph Markets analyst Keith Wareing identified a critical resistance level to overcome in order to seal Bitcoin’s path higher.“Waiting for Bitcoin to break $14,400 or get rejected. For me this is the level to get passed before a relatively clear run to $17K,” he summarized late Wednesday. However, the next major resistance now appears to be at $14,500, as can be seen in the orderbook heatmap below.“Something I’m watching here on the 1-hour timeframe on the Bitcoin chart,” popular social media trader “The Moon” tweeted earlier today, continuing:As Cointelegraph reported, analysts widely agreed that Bitcoin would be in line for significant gains should $14,000 flip from resistance to support.The level had held since the early days of 2018 — just after BTC/USD railled to all-time highs of $20,000 — and became the resistance level that capped Bitcoin’s 2019 rally."
644,"The World Trade Organization and Trade Finance Global have published their latest taxonomy of blockchain projects in international trade, arranged into what they present as a “periodic table” for the industry.The original rendition of the periodic table was published in winter 2019. Since then, a lot has changed: despite the pandemic, several indicators used in the table show that blockchain trade innovation projects worldwide are reaching ever greater maturity. On a scale of one to five, projects’ maturity was assessed as being 2.3 on average in Dec. 2019. As of this month, the same figure stands at 3.3. To translate it into non-numerical terms, these projects are now “between the early stages of production and being live and running,” according to the WTO and TFG.According to the report, blockchain — also known as distributed ledger technology or DLT — has two main benefits from the perspective of international trade. First, it enhances transparency, supporting what the analysts also refer to as “track-and-trace” capacity, which is useful for ensuring products’ authenticity and thereby enhancing trust on the customer end.The other benefit of DLT is trade digitalization: streamlining trade documentation, processes, and the secure exchange and monitoring of data. Here, the report identifies what it believes remains the “weakest link” in the chain:Latin America is a forerunner on the customs front. The report positively cites the development of a DLT project called Cadena by ICT specialists from Mexico, Peru, Chile and Costa Rica in cooperation with Microsoft and IDB. Cadena is targeted at customs agencies and supports mutual recognition agreements between what are defined as “authorized economic operators,” all within a framework set by the World Customs Organization.Elsewhere, progress is being made with proofs-of-concept and pilot concepts for customs by the United States Customs and Border Protection Office for NAFTA/CAFTA, as well as Shanghai’s “Single Window” project, the Korean export clearance project, and the European Union DG Taxud ATA carnet proof-of-concept. Aside from this, the DLT-based TradeLens project has increasingly been integrating customs authorities, and a DLT trade documentation digitalization project from Avanza Innovations has integrated with Dubai Customs. Nonetheless, the report is straightforward about the limitations to blockchain trade optimization:"
645,"On Nov. 4, crypto data market aggregator CryptoQuant published a chart indicating Binance’s Estimated Leverage Ratio (open interest divided by Bitcoin (BTC) reserves) has pushed into new all-time highs.The record was set on Nov. 3 after a spike in open interest pushed Binance’s ELR above 0.18 for the first time. The spike in ELR came shortly before Bitcoin established a double-bottom at roughly $13,400.New data suggests Bitcoin’s bullish push into 2020 highs above $14,000 may have been fueled by leverage, which could mean markets will continue to see significant volatility in the short term.However, Binance also recorded its largest daily BTC outflow on Nov. 3, with 58,861 Bitcoin worth $816 million exiting the exchange in 24 hours.Binance was not the only platform to experience a recent spike in open interest, with data from Skew indicating combined open interest in BTC futures is testing all-time highs in the upper-mid $5 billion range.The growing open interest also comes despite BitMEX’s recent decline in market share, with the exchange currently facing money laundering charges levied by the United States Department of Justice.According to Messari, the boost in open interest may indicate “bullish sentiment,” provided it is being driven by long positions. The research firm also notes the data suggests new capital may be entering crypto:The increasing open interest also comes as the number of BTC on exchanges has been steadily dropping since May, suggesting that buyers are accumulating Bitcoin from exchanges and placing them in cold storage as longer-term investments.Long positions on Bitfinex have also steadily been gaining since the start of October, pushing up from 25,000 to 29,000 as of this writing. While shorts have also spiked since Oct.20, doubling from 3,250 to 6,770, the bulls appear to be firmly in control of the markets.Over the last couple of hours, BTC has pushed into new highs for 2020, above $14,300."
646,"Hardware wallet manufacturer Trezor drew criticism after it announced Bitcoin Cash (BCH) holders hoping to receive an airdrop with the hard fork expected for Nov. 15 will have to transfer their coins elsewhere.In a Nov. 5 announcement, Trezor’s parent company SatoshiLabs asserted it will wait for the community to determine which Bitcoin Cash implementation will dominate the network moving forward:Once the fork has taken place, SatoshiLabs will “monitor whether the forked chain has sufficient support to justify supporting it,” and will support whichever implementation secures majority support from the community.SatoshiLabs will also assess whether the minority chain has “sufficient support to justify supporting it.”Bitcoin Cash is set to split in two with its next scheduled upgrade on Nov. 15. Internal tensions flared in August when Amaury Sechet, the lead developer of Bitcoin ABC — the historically dominant implementation of Bitcoin Cash — published an update that would introduce a new “coinbase rule,” diverting 8% of block reward to a development fund in his control.The conflict sparked the rival implementation, Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN), which has since secured support from more than 75% of BCH miners.Bitcoin ABC’s implementation is controversial, as it includes an 8% “tax” on all block rewards going to a wallet controlled by Sechet.Trezor’s decision not to support coin-splitting during the fork means that users who hold Bitcoin Cash in their hard wallet will need to move them to an exchange or some other wallet in order to get their BCHN coins in the fork.The move left many Trezor users perplexed, with Twitter user John Moriarty saying he was “very disappointed”:Moriarty’s thread was praised on Reddit’s /r/BTC subreddit, with user u/AD1AD calling it “Pretty embarrassingly unprofessional behavior” and calling the company’s statement misleading. Other users were also unhappy with the move:In the last seven days, only 1% of all BCH blocks signaled support for Bitcoin ABC, meaning the hash power supporting ABC’s proposition has been quite small. Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) has received backing from miners since its inception, with 75.3% of blocks mined currently signaling for its support.The fork’s Nov. 15 date also signifies the two-year anniversary of the Bitcoin Cash split with Bitcoin SV (BSV) that occurred during the last Bitcoin Cash hard fork — an example where both chains of the fork managed to survive after going down irreconcilable paths. Last month, the price of BCH hit fresh lows against BTC, with the upcoming fork unlikely to improve morale among an already fractured community."
647,"The open interest on Bitcoin (BTC) options contracts has reached a new all-time high at $2.9 billion. Interestingly, this feat happened only five days after the October expiry, which liquidated $400 million worth of options.Over the past six months, the options market has grown three-fold, causing investors to grow more curious about the potential impact upcoming expiries will have on the Bitcoin price.Data from Cointelegraph and Digital Assets Data also show that monthly Bitcoin transaction volume and BTC futures volume has been on the rise since the end of October.When analyzing options, the 25% delta skew is the single-most relevant gauge. This indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options side-by-side.It will turn negative when the put options premium is higher than similar-risk call options. A negative skew translates to a higher cost of downside protection, indicating bullishness.The opposite holds when market makers are bearish, causing the 25% delta skew indicator to gain positive ground.Oscillations between -10% (slightly bullish) and +10% (slightly bearish) are considered normal. This hasn’t been the case since Oct. 19, when Bitcoin broke the $11,600 level and never looked back.This indicator is the most substantial evidence a trader interested in derivatives needs to recognize Bitcoin options’ current sentiment.To further investigate how those instruments are being used in traders’ strategies, one must dive into the put-to-call ratio. Call options are generally used on neutral and bullish strategies, while put options are the opposite.By analyzing the open interest ratio between put and call options, one can broadly estimate how bearish or bullish traders are.Put options open interest have been lagging the more bullish call options by 30%. After the October expiry, this difference increased as the indicator reached its lowest level in three months.Based on the current conditions shown by the skew indicator and put-to-call ratio, there is little reason to worry about the growing options open interest.The market has been signaling bullish intentions, and the liquid derivatives markets are allowing larger players to hedge and enter the spot market.From the BTC options perspective, everything is clear for the current bull run to continue.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
648,"Today Bitcoin (BTC) price briefly pushed through the $14,100 resistance to achieve a new 2020 high at $14,259 before pulling back to retest $14,100 as support. Although this level represents a critical resistance, data suggests that Bitcoin whales are not closing their positions in a hurry as they expect the current rally to continue. This strong show of confidence is occurring even as there is heightened uncertainty over the result of the U.S. presidential election shows that market participants expect Bitcoin price to move higher regardless of who wins the election.Another bullish sign for Bitcoin is the record inflow of $215 million into Grayscale Bitcoin Trust last week. This shows that along with the whales, institutional investors are also bullish on the prospects of Bitcoin.If investors continue to pour money into Grayscale at the current rate, the fund may hold about 2.7% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply in approximately three weeks.During the 2017 bull market, the main driver of Bitcoin price action was the spot market. However, since then, crypto derivatives volumes have surged, according to Kraken’s November report.The spot volumes hit a high of $570 billion in Q1 2018 but dropped off “to a low of $104 billion nearly two years later,” but “derivatives notional volume exploded from below $6B in Q2 2017 to over $1.7T by Q3 2020,"" the report added.While data suggest greater participation by the professional traders and institutional investors, do the technicals project further upside for Bitcoin and altcoins?Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.The bears could not even sink Bitcoin (BTC) to the 20-day exponential moving average ($13,057) in the past few days, which showed that the bulls were in no hurry to book profits. This could have attracted another round of buying that has pushed the price to a new 2020 high at $14,259 levels today.The upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index in the overbought zone suggest that the bulls are in control. If they can sustain the price above $14,102, the next leg of the up-move is likely to begin. The next major resistance is close to $16,200.However, the RSI is still showing signs of negative divergence, which usually acts as a reliable warning sign that the momentum may be weakening. But in a strong uptrend, the divergence may turn out to be a fake signal unless the price turns lower.This bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels and the BTC/USD pair plummets below the 20-day EMA.Such a move will suggest that the bears are attempting a comeback and they are likely to gain strength if the pair dips below the $12,460 support.The bulls bought the dip to the uptrend line on Nov. 3 and have followed it up with a breakout of the downtrend line and the $395 resistance today. This suggests that the short-term correction in Ether (ETH) could be over.The 20-day EMA ($388) has started to turn up and the RSI has jumped into positive territory, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand. If they can push the ETH/USD pair above $420, the rally may extend to $450 and then to $488.134.This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and drops below the 50-day simple moving average ($372).The bulls again purchased the dip to the $0.2295 support on Nov. 3 but they could not propel XRP above the moving averages. This suggests that the bears are aggressively defending this resistance.The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.244) and the RSI in the negative territory suggest that the bears are in control.If they can sink the price below $0.2295, the XRP/USD pair could drop to $0.219712. A break below this support may resume the downtrend, with the next support at $0.19.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair rebounds off the current levels and rises above the moving averages, then a few more days of range-bound action is likely.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) plunged to $231.93 on Nov. 3 but the bulls purchased this dip as seen from the long tail on the candlestick. Today again, the buyers stepped in and bought the decline to $230.90.This strong rebound suggests that the bulls are attempting to defend the $231.93 support aggressively. However, the downsloping 20-day EMA ($255) and the RSI below 42 suggest that bears are in command.Hence, the bears are likely to sell on rallies to the 20-day EMA. If the BCH/USD pair turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and plummets below $231.93, the decline could extend to $210 and then to $200.This negative view will be invalidated if the pair picks up momentum and rises above the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the pair could again rally to the $272 to $280 resistance zone.Chainlink (LINK) broke below the uptrend line today but the bulls purchased the dip to the $9.7665 support. However, the bears will try to stall the pullback at the 20-day EMA ($11) and then at $11.199.Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI has slipped below 44, which suggests that bears have the upper hand. If the bears can sink the price below $9.7665, the LINK/USD pair could drop to $8.3817 and then to $6.90.This bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls build upon the current bounce and push the price above $11.199. Such a move will increase the possibility of a rally to $13.28.Binance Coin (BNB) closed below $28.43 on Nov. 2, which completed a double top pattern. This setup has a target objective of $24.86 but the bulls are currently attempting to defend the support at $25.6652.However, the downsloping 20-day EMA ($28) and the RSI below 37, suggest that the path of least resistance is to the downside. If the bears sink the price below $25.6652, the down-move could resume, with the next major support at $22.This bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls buy the current dip and push the BNB/USD pair back above $28.43. Such a move will open up the possibility of a rally to $32.The bulls aggressively purchased Litecoin (LTC) on dips to $51.2027 on Nov. 3 and have again bought the dip to $51.6109 today, as seen from the long tails on the candlesticks. This suggests that the bulls are defending the $52.36 to $51 support zone.If the buyers can sustain the price above the 20-day EMA ($53), a rally to $56.50 is possible. However, the flat 20-day EMA and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.If the LTC/USD pair turns down from the current levels, the bears will again try to sink the price below the support zone. If they succeed, the selling may intensify and the pair could drop to the next support at $46.The bears are attempting to sink Polkadot (DOT) below $3.80. If they can do that, the altcoin could drop to the critical support at $3.5321. A break below this support could start a new downtrend.Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI continues to trade in the negative zone, which suggests that the bears are in control. On a break below $3.5321, the decline could extend to $2.60 and then to $2.00.This bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls defend the $3.80 to $3.5321 support zone and push the price above the moving averages. Such a move could keep the DOT/USD pair range-bound for a few more days.The long tail on the Nov. 3 candlestick shows that the bulls are buying Cardano (ADA) on dips to $0.0893, but today’s price action suggests that they are not able to sustain the momentum at higher levels.The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.0990) and the RSI in the negative zone suggest that the bears have the upper hand. Hence, they may attempt to sell the pullback to the 20-day EMA. If the ADA/USD pair breaks below $0.0893, it could drop to $0.0755701.This negative view will be invalidated if the bulls can push the price above the moving averages. In such a case, a move to $0.104044 and then to $0.1142241 is possible.Bitcoin SV (BSV) bounced off $145.20 on Nov. 3 and the bulls are again attempting a rebound off the $146.12 level today. This suggests that the bulls are accumulating on dips to the $146.20 to $135 support zone.However, unless the bulls push the price back above the uptrend line and the moving averages within the next few days, the bears will again try to sink the BSV/USD pair below the support zone.If they succeed, the pair could start a new downtrend that could result in a decline to $100. The downsloping 20-day EMA ($164) and the RSI in the negative territory suggest that the path of least resistance is to the downside.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

649,"Binance saw its biggest Bitcoin (BTC) outflow in history on Nov. 3, according to data from CryptoQuant. A total of 58,861 BTC were withdrawn on a single day, equivalent to $816 million.The significant spike in outflows could suggest two things. First, it might show that whales could be bracing for a rally in the near term. Second, an over-the-counter deal could have occurred, causing whales to move their funds.In addition to the unprecedented increase in outflows on Binance, whales are increasingly moving their funds.Researchers at Whalemap, an on-chain market analysis firm that tracks Bitcoin whale activity, said large volumes have been spotted. The analysts explained:When whale funds move in profit to other whale wallets rather than exchanges, this often indicates that whales foresee an uptrend.Whales and high-net-worth investors generally store their funds in non-custodial wallets. These are addresses that holders have direct control over, which are usually kept offline for security purposes.Hence, whales tend to transfer their funds into exchanges when they are preparing to sell their holdings. If outflows increase, then it means whales do not intend to sell in the near term.In response to questions on whether the recent whale activity indicates a bullish trend, Whalemap analysts wrote:There are three possible reasons that whales might be increasingly moving their funds off exchanges.First, the appetite to sell Bitcoin above $13,000 has become lower. On higher time frames, like the weekly and monthly charts, BTC has seen a clean breakout. Above $14,200, there is little resistance until the all-time high at $20,000.Second, there are large whale clusters above $13,000, particularly in the $13,000 to $13,300 range. Whales might be confident that a major drop will not occur as a result.Third, there could be a growing demand for OTC deals as whales seek liquidity outside of exchanges for large orders. Since exchanges could trigger massive volatility, the OTC market could be practical for major deals.Bitcoin has been retesting the $13,850 to $14,259 in the past 24 hours, despite the risk of the U.S. elections inducing volatility. The price briefly rose to $14,066 on Nov. 4 before quickly plummeting to $13,525 and within the last hour Bitcoin price reached a new 2020 high at $14,259.The ideal scenario for Bitcoin in the near term is to stay above $13,850 and remain stable on top of this level. This would indicate that BTC flipped an important resistance level as support, which would provide a stronger foundation for a sustainable rally.Until BTC convincingly stays above $13,850 and consolidates under $14,200, it remains at risk of seeing a minor pullback."
650,"While most investors and traders anticipated massive volatility to occur through the election hours, little has happened. Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is still relatively stable and hovering under the crucial resistance of $14,000.At the same time, Bitcoin’s price has been moving in tandem with equity markets over the past 24 hours.The weekly chart is showing a very healthy setup, as the price movements look natural and organic, testing all previous support and resistance levels before continuation occurs.As the chart shows, this structure was established with the $10,000 level, after which the price of Bitcoin rallied toward the current price levels of $13,800.In that regard, a correction toward the $11,500 region would be relatively healthy for the markets, which could see another support/resistance flip.These support/resistance flips are quite common, as they also occurred at the start of the previous cycle in 2016.During this year, a significant number of range-bound constructions were seen. This occurs until the price of a certain asset enters price discovery, resulting in possible parabolic movements.An interesting perspective is that the current run-up of Bitcoin is similar to the one in 2016. In the weeks before the election of 2016, the U.S. Dollar Currency Index dropped substantially. This drop caused the price of Bitcoin to run from $600 to $740, a rally of more than 20%.However, not much volatility occurred during the election itself. The volatility started to kick off when the election results were confirmed, as the vertical red line shows. The price of Bitcoin moved by 6% in a few hours, while the U.S. Dollar showed weakness.The primary question will remain whether the election results will trigger volatility as the markets hold their breath.Therefore, the big moves for Bitcoin and markets in general may occur after the election results are confirmed similar to four years ago.The current pre-election chart is showing many similarities with the pre-election movements of 2016. A similar drop in the U.S. Dollar Currency Index has been pushing the prices of assets up.This meant an increase in the price per Bitcoin from $10,600 to $13,800, a rally of 30% in a matter of weeks. The significant difference currently is the stabilization of the U.S. dollar, while Bitcoin is still being resilient and continuing its upward momentum.However, the 4-hour chart is showing the possibility of a bearish divergence to emerge on the charts. Bitcoin’s price has frequently been pushing toward the $14,000 barrier, just taking liquidity above the high.These breakouts don’t entirely show strength, as they continue to get rejected. In that regard, the crucial breaker would be the area between $13,850 and $13,975 for any continuation of the price. If that breaks, a potential target of $15,000 is on the table.However, if it fails to break, a range support test at $13,000–$13,200 seems inevitable. As discussed previously, a further correction wouldn’t be unhealthy for the markets, as that may warrant a very healthy build-up for the bull cycle itself.The 5-day chart shows a likely scenario in the case of a lower timeframe breakdown. Thus, if the $13,900 area continues to hold as resistance, a correction to the $11,500–$11,800 area would not come as a surprise.Such a correction would grant another support/resistance flip and further compression before the next impulse wave can start.Once the price of Bitcoin is done with the accumulation and compression, a shot toward new all-time highs may come quicker than expected.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

651,"Bitcoin (BTC) has officially beaten a new record as BTC/USD trades above $10,000 for 100 days, and major gains should come next.As voting in the United States’ presidential election ended on Nov. 3, Bitcoin saw a landmark moment of its own — 100 days straight trading in five figures.The achievement is not just impressive as a record for $10,000-plus prices. According to previous data, once Bitcoin trades above these significant price levels for 100 days, BTC/USD swiftly increases by an order of magnitude.As Cointelegraph reported last week, the length of time has differed depending on the price level involved, but the result has been the same — major gains.Adding strength to the argument of Bitcoin staying higher going forward, quantitative analyst PlanB noted that the largest cryptocurrency’s untested 200-week moving average has now crossed $7,000 for the first time.Should historical patterns repeat themselves, Bitcoin could now gain more relative to the 200 WMA the closer it gets to its next block subsidy halving in 2024.On the topic of history repeating itself, Bitcoin could go “parabolic” next year if it follows its behavior after previous halvings, a well-known analyst has forecast.In a tweet on Nov. 4, Mike McGlone, senior commodity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, became the latest figure to suggest that next year would be hyper-bullish for BTC.The reason, he said, is a simple balance of supply and demand — Bitcoin’s supply reduced at the latest halving in May, while buyer demand for new coins is only increasing.“Bitcoin may undergo a parabolic 2021, as it did in 2013 and 2017, if previous patterns play out again,” he wrote.McGlone was likely referring to recent corporate buy-ins, along with the promise of PayPal users queuing up to use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on the platform from next year.At the same time, existing large-volume supporters such as asset manager Grayscale and payment network Square are only adding to their positions in 2020."
652,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) suddenly fell by 3% within hours on Nov. 4 to $13,566 after briefly rising above $14,000. Coincidentally, the U.S. dollar, gold and stocks all fell together in tandem.Analysts are pointing to uncertainty surrounding the election as the catalyst for the sharp correction.When the mainstream media was actively reporting the vote count, the price of Bitcoin and stocks rallied. Yet, after the vote count ended for the day, all risk-on and risk-off assets went into the red, including S&P 500 futures.Tracy Alloway, a financial journalist at Bloomberg and co-host of the Odd Lots podcast, said this was a likely outcome due to President Donald Trump’s statement. She said:The recent drop of Bitcoin is noteworthy given that it dropped simultaneously with the dollar. Typically, when the dollar drops, Bitcoin and gold tend to rally, since both stores of value are priced against the dollar.As Cointelegraph reported, BTC saw a low correlation with other assets including stocks in recent weeks. As such, the collective correction among most major assets comes across as an unexpected market response.According to data from CryptoQuant, the Estimated Leverage Ratio of Bitcoin futures on Binance hit an all-time high. This indicates that there are more traders in Binance’s BTC derivatives market than ever before.Ki-Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, warned traders on Nov. 4 about heightened volatility caused by cascading liquidations. If there is an abnormally large number of contracts in the market, it can cause massive price movements.In the short term, given the repeated rejection of BTC at $14,000, traders are leaning toward a market drop.There are several key support levels in the foreseeable future for Bitcoin. First, the $13,300 area has been defended with strength over the past week. If BTC continues to hover above $13,300, it would indicate resilience from buyers.Second, the $13,000 level has been supported with whale clusters since early November. This means whales have accumulated large amounts of BTC at that level, which makes it an area of interest for buyers."
653,"A new report by on-chain analytics provider CoinMetrics suggests that miners’ considerable influence on the Bitcoin network is slowly diminishing.The research analyzed miner and pool addresses and spending in order to determine whether their influence over the network as a whole had changed over time. As miners receive newly issued Bitcoin rather than buy it, they are natural net sellers of the asset.Measuring the net flows from two types of addresses associated with block rewards revealed that there has been a gradual reduction in miners’ effect on liquidity:Operating costs such as power and rent are fiat-denominated, which adds pressure to sell BTC for fiat. The research found that the percentage of the supply held by miners has generally decreased over time.The addresses that receive the block reward, as well as the ones that receive immediate transactions from them, have both seen a decline in the number of coins held.When viewed in the context of total supply, the gradual reduction in supply held by miners and pools is even clearer. That said, the report confirmed that miners and pools still control a “substantial chunk” of the total supply.Miners, especially those active in the network’s early days, control a significant amount of BTC.

But the number of coins held by miners has generally declined throughout the network’s history.

Read more in @karimhelpme's piece in this week's SOTN:https://t.co/UcZy04pACn pic.twitter.com/zqjqmMO7toThe percentage of total supply held by pool and miner addresses has declined from around 25% in 2015 to approximately 18% today, according to the chart. Lower holdings means that miners have less BTC to dump on markets, which diminishes their impact on prices.Net flows were volatile in the network’s early days as the amount sold varied wildly, along with prices. However, volatility has gradually decreased over time, likely due to halving events and reductions in block rewards.Several other on-chain metrics have also been in decline recently such as hash rate, which has dropped due to seasonal changes in China, where most of the mining is conducted. The recent difficulty adjustment has also been noted as its largest single downward adjustment during the ASIC era, according to CoinMetrics."
654,"Grayscale’s Bitcoin (BTC) Trust is on track to reach 500,000 BTC by the end of 2020. Last week, Grayscale saw a record inflow of $215 million (15,907 BTC) that surpassed all previous investments into the trust. The firm now holds $6.7 billion (481,711 BTC) as of the time of writing.Should the firm continue last month’s growth rate of 32,000 BTC, Grayscale in on-track to hold 500,000 BTC (2.7% of the circulating supply) within three weeks. By the end of next year, if the rate is consistent, Grayscale could control 926,600 BTC — equal to 5% of Bitcoin’s total current supply.The trust, created in September 2013, has seen explosive growth this year, with its assets under management, or AUM, growing from $1.9 billion to $4.7 billion in the first nine months of 2020. Since Grayscale’s Q3 report, the AUM of its Bitcoin Trust has grown by an additional $2 billion.Almost 70% of Grayscale’s total weekly inflows were invested into its Bitcoin Trust over the past three quarters. Bitcoin Trust weekly inflows grew from a 12-month average of $39.5 million to more than $55 million in Q3, 84% of which was attributed to institutional investors.Last week, Grayscale published its second Bitcoin Investor Study, in which the firm found U.S. investors that were interested in investing in BTC had grown from 36% in 2019 to 55% in 2020.Grayscale holds vastly more Bitcoin than any other listed company (although a fund isn’t directly comparable with a company holding BTC as a reserve asset). As of Oct. 13, the remaining 12 companies combined hold approximately 150,000 BTC, with notable holdings from Microstrategy (38,250 BTC), Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital (16,551 BTC) and Jack Dorsey’s Square (4,709 BTC).Not only @Square, in 2020 there are more than 10 Public Companies investing in $ BTC, with a total value of over $ 6 billion, equivalent to nearly 600,000 BTC.$BTC #BTC pic.twitter.com/7zxX94Clwx"
655,"Jakov Dolic, co-founder of the U.S.-based Bitcoin (BTC) mining company Layer1, has filed a lawsuit against his former business partner, Alexander Liegl.According to court documents filed on October 30, Dolic claimed that Liegl had ultimately failed to raise funds for the company. As a result, Dolic said that he had to pay $16.24 million out of pocket to purchase a power plant for the mining firm. He also claimed to have spent an additional $3.5 million expanding the plant.Dolic felt short changed for his investment, noting that Layer1 took full legal possession of the assets in question. When Dolic later confronted Liegl for moving Layer1’s funds without authorization, Liegl allegedly forced him out of the firm.With the lawsuit, Dolic hopes to “vindicate his rights to the properties that he bought directly from the seller.” The court documents posit that, although Layer1 technically holds the title, the power plant and its expansion “rightfully and equitably belong to Dolic.”Layer1 CEO Alexander Liegl responded to the allegations, stating, ""The complaint is completely meritless and contains numerous allegations that are demonstrably and categorically false. The company will be responding quickly to seek legal sanctions against Dolic and his counsel for making false allegations that lack a reasonable basis. There are simply no plans, and there never were any, to sell the substation.""This is not the first time that Dolic has been involved in a legal case within the crypto industry. On September 30, 2019, Digital Capital, a London-based payments company, sued Genesis Mining — another company that Dolic co-founded.The suit alleged that Genesis Mining failed to pay for the development and maintenance of its credit card software. The company's unpaid invoices amounted to approximately $3.1 million. In March, Genesis Mining Iceland argued in a court hearing that Digital Capital failed to deliver software with capabilities beyond “peripheral functionality.”"
656,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been on a tear and there’s no escaping it. But the majority of high-cap altcoins are seemingly suffering at the hands of this bull run, leading to the question: have we had our altseason already? Is it over or is there more to come?BTC/USD 12-hour chart. Source: TradingView Bitcoin has been eating up multi-year resistance levels like Pacman on an amphetamine-induced rampage lately, smashing through $11,300, then $12,400 then $13,100 before being rejected around the $14,000 level.  After $14,400 there isn’t much in the way of resistance until $17K before a new all-time high can be printed for the king of cryptos. But the question is can Bitcoin run out of steam?  Well the BTC dominance has been on a massive rip since September, suggesting that altcoins are being sold off to pile into Bitcoin to push past this last major level of resistance.  Market cap Bitcoin dominance 4-hour chart. Source: Tradingview The 4-hour chart for BTC market cap dominance shows that it’s currently resting around 64.8% with very little resistance between 67.80%, representing a 4.44% increase and 68.98%, representing a 6.34% increase.These numbers may seem small, but the adverse effect this has on major altcoins is crippling bag holders of some of the most popular projects in the space.  LINK 1-day chart. Source: TradingView It was only a few months ago that people were cheering for Zeus Capital to get liquidated in a $20m short when LINK was trading under $10. The price pulled a similar stunt to Bitcoin in December 2017 by rocketing past the expected $10 price and overshooting all the way up to $20 before correcting.  The most recent bounce price for LINK was around $7.50. If that figure shows its face again, I think the “marines” will start to lose their love for their beloved LINK as a price of $6.50 looks more likely by the day based on previous support and resistance levels. The whales are likely in the know too, as 400,000 LINK was sent to Binance earlier today.If we cast our minds back to what happened to Bitcoin at $20K, it's taken a good three years to start to return to those levels. So the smart money could be piling out of coins like LINK to load up on Bitcoin before the next big leg up. I’ll be watching this closely to see where it bottoms. But for now, it seems another large altcoin may have already done so, which could pave the way. ETH 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView I’ve seen a lot of people calling for $300 ETH in the short term, but I personally don’t see it. In fact, it seems Ether has continued to print higher lows since the end of August and has been ranging nicely in an ascending channel.  The support of the channel has remained intact for several months and held at $370 after its rejection at $400. Should this pattern continue and break past the mid-level resistance around $400, then I expect a clear run to $440 in the near term.  Should Ether lose the lower channel support, I’d expect there to be support at $350 and $310, which represents the 0.236 and full fib retracement levels that are shown below.ETH 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView BTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: TradingViewSimilar to Ether, Bitcoin is also currently trending in the lower part of an ascending channel with three levels to be aware of: BTC/USDT 1-hour heatmap chart. Source: TensorchartsThe picture for the ascending channel is supported by orderbook heatmap data from Binance, showing a triple layer buy-wall at the lower channel support level, followed by some weaker sell-walls at the mid-level resistance level and upper resistance levels of $13,800 and $14,000, respectively.  What concerns me about this data is that I have seen a big triple block on a heatmap before, and it vanished as it was hit, tricking knife-catchers into longing what looks like solid support when in fact there’s layered buy walls all the way down to $12,800.  If I were a whale, I would probably be playing a similar game of casting uncertainty to afford me time to unload my heavy bags of altcoins into BTC, and the last 48 hours there’s been a lot of heavy bags flagging up on whale alerts suggesting that this could very well be happening. This includes the $400m in Tether flowing to Huobi. Something is brewing, and I’d like to think it’s bullish for Bitcoin. I fully expect Bitcoin to pull back to around $13,300 in the very short term. If this level fails to hold, the last level of meaningful support I would expect to see is $12,800.   Should we lose $12,800, I would look to reevaluate my bias from bullish to bearish. Closing above the mid-level resistance of around $13,800 would be considered bullish. From here, the last level of resistance to clear would be that $14,400 area to confirm that we’re going to $17,000 very soon.

657,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing a volatile time. After achieving $14,100 for the first time since 2017, a sharp pullback followed. Yet, key on-chain data and whale clusters show that high-net-worth individual investors are holding onto their positions.This trend shows that whales are not expecting a major pullback in the near term. A low level of activity from whales is a positive metric following a large uptrend. It shows that whales are not interested in selling BTC just yet and are likely anticipating a broader rally.In the near term, the support areas of Bitcoin are found at $12,900 and $13,300. The stability of the dominant cryptocurrency above the two levels despite various macro factors is an optimistic trend. The United States election is ongoing, and while BTC saw a 4% drop, it has been relatively resilient.Two key on-chain indicators show that whales and retail investors, in general, are not actively selling Bitcoin. First, the BTC estimated leverage ratio shows that trades in the derivatives market are not decreasing. This shows that investors are not proactively closing their positions or trades amid the uncertainty around the U.S. presidential election.However, after the election results come out, the high BTC estimated leverage ratio poses a risk of increased volatility. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, told Cointelegraph: “The BTC Estimated Leverage Ratio on derivative exchanges is increasing till the election day. It might cause high volatility on BTC price due to cascade liquidations.”The term “cascading liquidations” refers to a situation where futures contracts get liquidated consecutively in a short period. As an example, if short-sellers are increasingly betting against Bitcoin, yet BTC price increases, it can cause shorts to be liquidated one after another. When that happens, it causes cascading liquidations, causing volatility to surge.Second, there are fewer whales selling on exchanges in the U.S. that are typically used by whales, such as Coinbase Pro and Gemini. According to data from CryptoQuant, there is a low inflow of Bitcoin into exchanges in the U.S., meaning there is a lower risk of short-term selling from whales in the foreseeable future. Ju explained:On Oct. 12, for example, inflows into U.S. exchanges suddenly spiked over the danger zone. As soon as they did, Bitcoin fell steeply in a short period. Throughout the past two weeks, exchange inflows have been considerably below the danger zone. This decreases the probability of an abrupt correction in the near term.Whalemap found that there are two technical levels in the near term that serve as important areas. Based on whale clusters, the $12,987 and $13,650 levels are critical. Whale clusters form when newly purchased BTC stays in place. Clusters show areas where whales bought Bitcoin previously and are often considered to be support levels.Because the price of Bitcoin is hovering below $13,650 as of Nov. 3, reclaiming $13,650 and staying above it would confirm it as a support level. Hence, in the short term, rising past $13,650 is important for buyers to continue the rally. Bitcoin has established a positive technical trend in the past week by defending the $13,000 macro support area. As long as BTC remains above the $13,000–$13,500 range, the short-term bull trend is intact.In technical terms, Whalemap explained that the daily chart of Bitcoin indicates the cryptocurrency is oversold. The relative strength index, or RSI, is an indicator that measures the momentum of Bitcoin and whether it’s overbought or oversold. On the daily candle log chart, the RSI shows BTC is currently oversold, Whalemap said. “Monthly candle sweeped 2019’s high and closed below it. Blue areas [$16,000] signify important macro fibs. I am expecting big guys to be taking profits there.”Based on the daily chart, the $13,000–$14,000 range is an area of interest to sellers. As such, if Bitcoin remains stable above $13,000 and reclaims $14,000, the next resistance level is $16,000. For the short-term bull case of BTC to strengthen, the daily chart marking a close above $14,000 is critical in the month of November. If that occurs, as in December 2017, BTC could hit a new all-time high in December.Since mid-October, Bitcoin miners have increasingly sold large amounts of Bitcoin. During the rainy season in northern China, which usually begins during the fall, miners increase their capacity to take advantage of cheaper electricity. Because areas like Sichuan rely on hydropower, the rainy season results in lower electricity costs. But when the rainy season comes to an end, many miners abruptly stop mining BTC.According to data from ByteTree, miners have sold a lot of Bitcoin in the past week. In the last seven days, there was a miner net-inventory change of negative 1,060 BTC, meaning miners have sold 1,060 BTC more than they have mined, placing significant selling pressure on the market. Consequently, Bitcoin saw its second-biggest negative mining difficulty adjustment change in history as miners stopped mining BTC en masse. Glassnode wrote:There is a possibility that the lower selling pressure coming from miners could allow the momentum of Bitcoin to strengthen. Atop the likely drop in miners selling BTC, the U.S. election will start having more of an impact. Analysts, including Alex Krüger, have said that a Democratic sweep of Congress or the election of Joe Biden would likely buoy the sentiment around Bitcoin.If Biden is elected, Krüger said that gold, Bitcoin and safe-haven assets would likely increase in value on the back of significant uncertainty in the stock market, which would brace for additional regulation and potentially higher tax rates.If President Donald Trump gets reelected, it would cause risk-on assets to rally, which might cause BTC to surge in tandem as well. Barry Silbert, CEO of Grayscale — a cryptocurrency investment firm — said that both a Trump or a Biden win would benefit Bitcoin."
658,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) rose by 2% in just 30 minutes right as the United States' stock market rang its opening bell on Nov. 3. During pre-market, the Dow Jones surged by over 350 points as the U.S. election day triggered massive volatility.The four reasons that likely led to a Bitcoin uptrend in such a short period are the election, a stocks upsurge, negative funding and rising exchange outflows.The U.S. election is today, but the result is not a foregone conclusion. Polls suggest Joe Biden has a lead in major swing states.The election is positive for Bitcoin for two reasons. First, either a Biden or a Trump win would benefit BTC in the short term, according to industry figures.Tyler Winklevoss, the CEO of Bitcoin exchange Gemini, said:Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors said stocks might rally 10% with a Biden win. In that case, risk-on assets would likely rally, eventually benefiting Bitcoin. But, if Trump wins, Lee said stocks might see even a bigger rally of 15% to 17%.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs issued a note earlier this month suggesting that ""a blue wave would likely prompt us to upgrade our forecasts."" Although experts are divided on the potential impact of the election on the stock market, it seems both scenarios would be beneficial for BTC by the year's end.As the Dow Jones saw a 350-point upsurge in the pre-market, BTC price surged from around $13,500 to $13,730 within 30 minutes.Although Bitcoin has shown dwindling correlation with U.S. stocks in recent weeks, during an uptrend, BTC and stocks are likely to increase in tandem. While Bitcoin is viewed as a store of value, both BTC and stocks are still risk-on assets.A rising stock market could mean the markets are ambivalent about the eventual winner of the election.When the abrupt Bitcoin upsurge occurred, the funding rate of BTC futures on Binance Futures was below 0%.Cryptocurrency futures exchanges implement a mechanism called “funding,” which incentivizes the minority of the market. If the number of short-sellers is higher than buyers or long holders, then sellers have to pay buyers fees every eight hours.But when the price of Bitcoin goes up and there is also added incentive to long or buy BTC, a short squeeze could occur. Considering that BTC rose by 2% in under an hour, the dominant cryptocurrency saw a large short squeeze.According to the data from CryptoQuant, an on-chain market analysis firm, exchange outflows just recorded the biggest spike this year at roughly 30,000 BTC.Traders deposit Bitcoin into exchanges when they want to sell their holdings. Hence, when capital flows out of exchanges, it means traders, whales and retail investors intend to hold their BTC holdings for a prolonged period.The combining factors of a short squeeze, election uncertainty, a stock market uptrend and rising exchange outflows contributed to the sudden BTC price spike."
659,"Cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase, Paxful, Gemini and BitFinex have all joined the Anti-Human Trafficking Cryptocurrency Consortium, or ATCC. Launched in April 2020 by the Anti-Human Trafficking Intelligence Initiative, the consortium is a nonprofit focused on intelligence sharing, best practices and the development of tools to fight trafficking. The ATCC brings together crypto exchanges, blockchain intelligence firms and law enforcement to combat human trafficking and child sexual abuse material, also known as CSAM.Aaron Kahler, chair and founder of the Anti-Human Trafficking Intelligence Initiative, told Cointelegraph that thought leadership and information-sharing within the cryptocurrency space are vital to building awareness for anti-human trafficking corporate social responsibility:Specifically speaking, the four exchanges that are members of the ATCC will be monitoring crypto transactions to detect characteristics associated with human trafficking. This information will then be shared among all ATCC members as well as including intelligence firms, advisory members and law enforcement officials to help combat illicit activities.Lana Schwartzman, chief compliance officer at Paxful — a peer-to-peer over-the-counter exchange — told Cointelegraph that she is personally working on a keyword initiative for Paxful that includes specific terms associated with human trafficking and child exploitation:The keyword initiative from Paxful mirrors a best-practice implemented by traditional financial institutions participating in anti-trafficking programs. Schwartzman noted that Paxful and the other exchanges have a unique advantage when it comes to monitoring transactions due to the transparency associated with cryptocurrency:Echoing Schwartzman, John Kothanek, senior director of global intelligence at Coinbase — a digital currency exchange headquartered in San Francisco — told Cointelegraph that no matter how technologically proficient bad actors may be, motivated and determined people in law enforcement and the private industry will eventually find them. Kothanek mentioned that Coinbase supports consortiums like the ATCC, noting that the initiative’s efforts align with Coinbase’s ethos of removing bad actors from the crypto economy:Kothanek further expressed that contrary to popular misconceptions, crypto is by and large a clean business. However, he is well aware that bad actors do exist. To put this into perspective, ATCC member Chainalysis, a blockchain intelligence company, published a blog post in April this year to demonstrate the impact that crypto transactions have on human trafficking.According to Chainalysis’ findings, about $930,000 worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) transactions were sent to addresses associated with CSAM providers in 2019. This demonstrates a 32% increase from 2018. Interestingly, between January and March this year, a little less than $250,000 worth of BTC and ETH payments have been traced back to CSAM providers.While these numbers may sound high, it’s important to note that human trafficking is a business that generates over $150 billion per year. This demonstrates that the percentage of activity involving cryptocurrency transactions remains relatively low compared to traditional payments.However, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued an advisory on human trafficking on Oct. 15 this year stating that “convertible virtual currency” is being used by human traffickers to hide illicit proceeds.The document even cites a case study in which a group of human traffickers purchased Vanilla Visa prepaid credit cards which were then used to purchase Bitcoin on Paxful. The group’s Bitcoin transactions have been linked with the purchase of prostitution ads on one of the largest human trafficking marketplaces, Backpage, which was seized in April 2018. Use cases such as this demonstrate the importance of information sharing between crypto exchanges, blockchain intelligence firms and law enforcement.Pamela Clegg, director of financial investigations and education at CipherTrace, a blockchain intelligence firm and an ATCC member, told Cointelegraph that information-sharing between different blockchain intelligence companies and exchanges will ultimately help provide additional steps for understanding where information tied to human trafficking comes from:According to Clegg, the crypto exchanges will monitor and determine unusual characteristics commonly seen with human trafficking transactions, serving as the focal point. “This is the first step,” she said. The blockchain analytics companies involved, such as CipherTrace and Chainalysis, then work side-by-side with law enforcement to combat illicit activities. “This is the same method as in traditional finance, where banks detect human trafficking movements and then alert the FBI,” she remarked."
660,"Bitcoin (BTC) is a recommended hedge against fiat currency inflation along with gold, one of its well-known critics now says.In an appearance on Rosenberg Research’s webcast series on Nov. 2, Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of investment management firm DoubleLine, produced rare praise for Bitcoin.Gundlach, informally known as the “Bond King,” is no stranger to discussing Bitcoin, but had previously made it clear that he would not invest.In an interview with Business Insider last month, the billionaire called Bitcoin a “lie,” building on previous claims that he did not believe it was “unhackable.”“I don’t believe in bitcoin. I think that it’s a lie. I think that it’s very tracked, traceable. I don’t think it’s anonymous,” he told the publication.Nonetheless, Gundlach insisted that he was “not at all a Bitcoin hater” — a comment which he appeared to strengthen this week.Telling listeners that they should own something to hedge against inflation, he mentioned gold and Bitcoin as good possibilities.That perspective marks the closest that Gundlach has come to reversing his hands-off stance and advocating that investors actually buy Bitcoin.Gold, meanwhile, is set to increase markedly over time, he continued, in line with other proponents of the precious metal currently forecasting major gains after the United StatesS. presidential election.Data shows the extent of Bitcoin’s returns versus gold and other macro assets. Collated by on-chain analytics resource Skew, year-to-date figures were 88% as of Nov. 3, with gold on 24% and the S&P 500 just over 2%.Against a backdrop of intensifying coronavirus lockdowns and associated reduced economic activity, Bitcoin is tipped to continue its rapid gains in the near- to mid-term.As Cointelegraph reported, some expect new all-time highs to appear within the next three months, while statistician Willy Woo has argued that the cryptocurrency is already diverging from the path of other macro assets, including gold."
661,"Bitcoin (BTC) saw its biggest negative difficulty adjustment in almost 10 years on Nov. 3 as the network flawlessly takes care of itself.Data from monitoring resource BTC.com shows that the Bitcoin difficulty automatically readjusted by 16% on Tuesday.Estimates had previously suggested that the adjustment would be around 13%, but it was the second-highest in Bitcoin’s history. Only in 2011 was there a larger difference — 18%, which also came at the end of October.Difficulty adjustments happen automatically every 2016 blocks, and allow Bitcoin to remain as “hard” money regardless of any external factors impacting miners.Such a reduction incentivizes more mining participants to compete for block subsidy rewards, with the result that the difficulty then begins to rise again.At press time, however, estimates put the next adjustment at another -16%, indicating that the effect of Tuesday’s event had not yet been felt.For users, the downward adjustment will reduce fees and decrease block times, along with reducing the size of unmined transactions in Bitcoin’s mempool. According to estimates from Earn.com, the optimal Bitcoin transaction fee remains high, at 80,000 satoshis ($11).Commentators appeared only a little fazed, instead praising Satoshi Nakamoto’s design for protecting network and funds integrity.“There is no more beautiful aspect of #Bitcoin than the difficulty adjustment. Just flat out gorgeous mechanism design,” summarized Travis Kling, founder of asset manager Ikigai.Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s network hash rate appeared to be u-turning on its own descent Tuesday, with estimated weekly average values beginning to trend up.Hash rate provides a look into how much computing power is being dedicated to Bitcoin transaction validation. Weeks ago, the metric was at an all-time high, but lost around 25% in the second half of October.At publishing time, little impact was noticeable on Bitcoin’s price performance, with $13,000–$13,300 remaining as support and BTC/USD hovering at $13,500."
662,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has declined by more than 3% in the past two days. The pullback of the dominant cryptocurrency comes amid growing regulatory pressure in China and Hong Kong.On Oct. 16, top Bitcoin futures exchange OKEx suspended withdrawals after one of its private key holders was reportedly arrested.A mere 17 days later, speculation emerged that Huobi, a Singapore-based exchange with an office in Hong Kong, might face regulatory pressure after data showed massive Bitcoin and Tether withdrawals on Nov. 2.However, Huobi Global reaffirmed that the exchange is operating normally, and deposits and withdrawals are “operating as expected.”Today, Reuters reported that Hong Kong regulators will propose all cryptocurrency exchanges be regulated and apply for a Securities and Futures Commission, or SFC, license as opposed to the previous opt-in approach, which many exchanges declined to do.It comes a year after the Hong Kong government released rules for cryptocurrency exchanges. Ashley Alder, chief executive of the SFC, said on Nov. 3:Despite the subtle wording of the SFC’s statement, industry experts said it is essentially a declaration to end Bitcoin’s honeymoon phase. Leo Weese, the co-founder of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, said:Kelvin Koh, a partner at the Asia-based cryptocurrency investment firm Spartan Group, said the timing is not a coincidence. It comes after the pilot launch of China’s Digital Currency Electronic Payment system, which has already processed over four million transactions. He explained:Bitcoin price has reacted with a minor price drop, falling from $14,100 at the month’s peak to below $13,500. Albeit the reaction has been minimal, a further drop could have negative implications for the short-term trend of BTC.Technically, the short-term support of Bitcoin is at $13,300. Below it, there is the $12,900 support area and the $12,200 level, which is the five-day moving average on the monthly chart.On Nov. 2, before the drop of Bitcoin occurred, full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange Michael van de Poppe said the $12,700 to $12,900 range is a strong short-term support area. He said:So far, the response of Bitcoin to the regulatory crackdown rumors has been minor. If BTC can remain above $13,000 in the short term, the outlook would likely stay positive."
663,"Twitter CEO and major Bitcoin (BTC) bull Jack Dorsey will keep his role at the company, according to a recent decision by a Twitter board committee.As Bloomberg reported on Nov. 2, the committee officially reviewed Twitter’s leadership as part of a March 2020 agreement with activist investor Elliott Management and private equity firm Silver Lake. Both companies gained seats on Twitter’s board of directors through investments earlier this year.Citing a company filing on Nov. 2, Bloomberg reports that the independent board panel concluded that the existing management structure is sufficient. The filing reportedly reads:Alongside Dorsey keeping his role, the committee also proposed a plan to reduce the terms of Twitter’s directors from three years to one. The move could make it easier for investors like Elliott to replace board members in an effort to take control of the firm, the report notes.After co-founding Twitter in 2006 with Evan Williams and Christopher Stone, Dorsey initially servedas CEO of Twitter until 2008. In 2008, Dorsey became chairman of the board, returning as CEO in 2015. In February 2020, Paul Singer — founder of Elliott Management — pushed for the removal of Dorsey as CEO of Twitter, expressing concerns about Dorsey’s time being split between Twitter and payment platform Square.Turning outward from the referendum on its own leadership, Twitter has recently joined PayPal and Ripple in an alliance encouraging free and fair voting in the United States. Firms within the so-called “Civic Alliance” reportedly encourage their employees to vote with paid time off and flexible work schedules on election day. In late October, Dorsey participated in a hearing before the United States Senate Commerce Committee. Alongside Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google’s Sundar Pichai, Dorsey addressed the committee’s concerns about transparency and accountability in social media content practices, particularly in regard to hate speech and freedom of political expression."
664,"The co-founder of crypto data aggregator Markets Science, Twitter user “Bitdealer,” has shared a chart  indicating negative correlations between 11 top DeFi tokens and Bitcoin (BTC) over the past 45 days up to Nov. 1, with AAVE showing neutral correlation and UNI showing confluence of less than 0.1.Seven of 13 DeFi tokens were also found to have negative correlations with Ethereum (ETH), despite Ethereum powering much of the DeFi ecosystem.With many decentralized finance tokens struggling while Bitcoin surged in price this week, analysts have identified a longer negative correlation between DeFi tokens and BTC.However, the sector found its speculative plateau by the end of August, with Binance’s DeFi Composite Index crashing 64% from $1,100 at the start of September to less than $400 as at the time of writing.TokenSet’s DeFi Pulse Index (DPI) has also shed more than half its value since launching at $130 in mid-September. DPI tokens last traded hands for just $61.55.Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price has increased by more than a third in the past month, rallying to tag $14,000 at the end of October after global payments giant PayPal announced it was entering the crypto sector.Google payments engineer Tyler Reynolds believes the bullish action in the Bitcoin markets is drawing speculative capital away from DeFi, noting that “major DeFi players” including Three Arrows Capital and Qiao Wang have recently pushed “a narrative of a hard rotation into BTC.” Reynolds estimates up to $50 million may have left the DeFi market, weakening buy-side pressure in the markets.Crypto trader “Flood” made a similar point on the Coinist Podcast, saying that he didn’t have “as much exposure as [he] would’ve liked on this move up,” and that he thinks of this as “a representation of the market as a whole”Trade activity on decentralized exchanges also appears to have reversed, with monthly DEX volume falling from close to $26.3 billion in September to roughly $19.4 billion last month.Only a handful of DEXs have a significant share of the sector’s volume, with Uniswap and Curve representing 75% of decentralized trade in September. The past three months’ worth of Uniswap volume equates 45% of the total DEX volume since November 2019."
665,"The digital asset industry as a whole looks significantly different than it did three years ago. A Wild West-esque year, 2017 boasted astronomical asset price increases and booming fundraises amid underdeveloped regulation. Some elements of 2017, such as initial coin offerings, have largely died off. Other niches, such as derivatives trading, have since experienced watershed growth, as noted in a recent report from United States crypto exchange, Kraken. ""Beginning with pioneers like Crypto Facilities, BitMEX, Deribit, BitVC (now HuobiDM), and OKEx, deriviatives trading in crypto markets really took hold in 2017, dovetailing the entrance of traditional incumbents like the CME and CBOE,"" Kraken's November report,  ""The Tail Wags the Dog: An Evolution of Bitcoin Futures,"" said. The report found that ""Derivatives are now at least 4.6x the size of spot volume, and we believe the trend will likely continue."" Spot Bitcoin (BTC) is actual BTC, bought and sold at the going market rate, transferrable off exchanges. Derivatives are trading products on exchanges. They essentially act as bets on the future price of Bitcoin. Demand for crypto derivatives has flourished in recent years. Capitalizing on the trend, platforms such as BitMEX have grown, new players such as Bybit have surfaced, and existing exchanges such as Binance have added their own derivatives products.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or CME, added Bitcoin futures in 2017, subsequently adding Bitcoin options trading in 2020. The Chicago Board Options Exchange, or CBOE, also opened BTC futures in 2017, although the entity closed said product in 2019. ""The growth in derivatives volumes is stark in contrast with that of spot volumes,"" Kraken's report detailed. Spot crypto trading has declined since the height of the industry's last euphoric bull market, while derivatives trading has taken the spotlight:As far as growth rationale is concerned, Kraken believes that leverage plays a part. Derivatives traders can essentially borrow large sums of capital for trades, based on the amount they hold in their accounts.Although derivatives have boomed since 2017, regulation is catching up; most crypto derivatives platforms have banned U.S. customers in recent years. U.S. authorities also went after BitMEX for alleged regulatory violations. "
666,"China’s central bank governor Yi Gang has said that the nation’s digital yuan pilot projects have processed transactions worth over $299 million without any major problems. This suggests that China is much ahead of its competitors in developing and studying the central bank digital currency (CBDC).However, the European Central Bank does not want to be left behind. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has invited comments from the public on whether they “would be happy to use a digital Euro just in the way they use a Euro coin or a Euro banknote.”Another central bank that is trying to keep pace is the Reserve Bank of Australia. The central bank has partnered with banks, financial institutions and software companies to study the “implications of a CBDC for efficiency, risk management and innovation in wholesale financial market transactions,” said RBA Assistant Governor Michele Bullock.The news of several nations contemplating the launch of a CBDC is a long-term positive but this news may not affect the short-term price action, which is dictated by market sentiment.Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out whether the sentiment is to buy the dips or sell the rallies.Bitcoin’s (BTC) failure to rise and sustain above the $13,973.50 overhead resistance in the past few days could have attracted profit booking from some short-term traders and shorting by aggressive bears.However, the positive sign is that the bulls are not allowing the bears to have their way. The long tail on the candlestick suggests buying at lower levels.If the BTC/USD pair rises from the current levels, then the bulls will make one more attempt to drive the price above the $13,973.50–$14,101.91 resistance zone. If they succeed, the uptrend could resume.Although both the moving averages are sloping up, the bearish divergence on the relative strength index suggests that the momentum has weakened. A break below the 20-day exponential moving average ($12,819) will be the first sign of strength for the bears.If the bears can capitalize on this strength and sink the pair below $12,460, then a deeper correction to the 50-day simple moving average ($11,567) is possible.The bulls had pushed Ether (ETH) above the downtrend line today but they could not sustain the higher levels. This suggests that the bears are selling on minor rallies. The bears have currently dragged the price back to the 20-day EMA ($386).A break and close below the 20-day EMA could drag the price to the uptrend line. The 50-day SMA ($371) is close to this support, hence, the bulls are likely to defend this level aggressively.If the ETH/USD pair rebounds off the uptrend line, the bulls will once again try to propel the price above the downtrend line and the $405 overhead resistance. If they succeed, it will increase the possibility of a rally to $420 and then to $450.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the uptrend line, a fall to $360 and then to $333 is possible.The flat moving averages and the RSI close to the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. This suggests an equal opportunity for the bulls and the bears in tilting the advantage in their favor.The rebound from the $0.2295 support in XRP hit a barrier at the moving averages and the price has turned down from there. The bears are currently attempting to sink the altcoin below the $0.2295–$0.219712 support zone.If they succeed, the XRP/USD pair could start a new downtrend that may reach $0.19. The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.24) and the RSI below 38 suggest that the bears are in control.However, if the bulls can defend the support zone and push the pair back above the moving averages, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. In such a case, the pair may remain range-bound for a few more days.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has once again turned down from the $272 resistance and the bears are currently attempting to pull the price below the 20-day EMA ($258.58) and the immediate support at $253.14.If the bears manage to do that, the BCH/USD pair could drop to the next support at the 50-day SMA ($240.57).Although the moving averages are still sloping up gradually, the RSI has broken down from a symmetrical triangle and has dropped close to the midpoint. This suggests that the bears are attempting to make a comeback.This bearish view will be invalidated if the pair bounces off the 20-day EMA and breaks above the $272–$280 resistance zone.The bulls pushed Chainlink (LINK) above the 20-day EMA ($11.21) on Nov. 1 but they could not build upon this momentum. Today, the price has again dipped back below the 20-day EMA and the bears are currently attempting to break the support at the 50-day SMA ($10.51).LINK/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewA breakdown and close below the uptrend line will be the first sign that the bears are back in action. There is minor support at $9.7665 but if the bears can sink the price below it, a drop to $8.3817 will be on the cards.This bearish view will be invalidated if the LINK/USD pair turns up from the current levels or bounces off the uptrend line and rises above $12. Such a move could result in a rally to $13.28.The flat moving averages and the RSI below the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. Hence, neither the bulls nor the bears have a clear advantage.Binance Coin (BNB) has been trading near the 50-day SMA ($28) for the past three days, which suggests that the bulls are attempting to defend this support. However, the bears are unlikely to give up their advantage easily.They sold the rally to the 20-day EMA ($29) today and are currently attempting to pull the price below the $28.42–$27.51 support zone. If they can pull it off, the BNB/USD pair could decline to $24.86.The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI below 43 suggest that the bears have the upper hand. However, if the bears fail to capitalize on the advantage, the bulls will again try to push the price above the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could move up to $32.Litecoin (LTC) has once again turned down from just above the $56.50 level today, which suggests that the bears are defending this resistance. The sellers will now try to sink the altcoin below the $52.36–$51 support.If they can do that, then the LTC/USD pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($49) and if this support also cracks, the decline may extend to $46.However, the bulls are likely to buy the drop to the support zone. The flat 20-day EMA ($53) and the RSI just above the midpoint suggests a range-bound action for a few more days.The advantage will tilt in favor of the bulls if they can push and sustain the price above $56.50.The bounce from the $3.80 support in Polkadot (DOT) fizzled out at the 20-day EMA ($4.22). The bears will now try to sink the price below the immediate support at $3.80. If that happens, a drop to $3.5321 will be on the cards.The 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is in the negative territory, which suggests a slight advantage to the bears.If the bears can sink the price below $3.5321, the DOT/USD pair may start a new downtrend that could reach $2.60 and then $2.0.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls defend the $3.80–$3.5321 support zone, the pair may remain range-bound between $3.5321 and $4.6112 for a few more days.The failure of the bulls to push Bitcoin SV (BSV) above the 20-day EMA ($166) in the past three days shows a lack of demand at higher levels. This has attracted selling by the bears who are currently attempting to sink the price below the uptrend line.If they succeed, the BSV/USD pair could drop to the $146.20–$135 support zone. A breakdown of this zone could result in panic selling that may start a new downtrend. The next support on the downside is at $100.However, if the bulls defend the support zone, the pair could remain range-bound between $146.20–$180.63 for a few more days.The rebound from the $0.0893 support in Cardano (ADA) has turned down from the 20-day EMA ($0.10).

Source: TradingViewIf the bears sink the price below $0.0893, the ADA/USD pair could drop to the critical support at $0.07555701. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative territory suggest that the path of least resistance is to the downside.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair again rebounds off the $0.0893 support, it will suggest that bulls are accumulating closer to this level.

667,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has pulled back substantially since its yearly high at $14,149 a few days ago. Yet, there are five signs that the real rally is only just starting.Rising “HODLing” activity, record-high fundamentals, low retail interest, higher time frame breakout and technical indicators suggest that a bigger bull run may be brewing. Bitcoin has dropped over 6% from its local peak at over $14,000, a level it hasn’t tested since 2017.But on the weekly and monthly time frames, it recorded a clear breakout. It saw its weekly and monthly candles close above $13,000 for the first time in nearly three years.As Cointelegraph previously reported, the monthly chart shows Bitcoin is far above key moving averages. Technically, that means the momentum is still intact, but a healthy pullback could be beneficial.During the peak of a bull run, Google Trends activity for the keyword “Bitcoin” skyrockets as retail demand floods in. When market sentiment becomes euphoric, whales tend to take profit, causing the market to decline.In the past several months, despite the strong rally of Bitcoin, Google Trends activity has been low. This indicates that not a lot of retail investors are searching about the dominant cryptocurrency on Google.Additionally, according to data from The Tie, the monthly tweet volume of Bitcoin in October only rose 7.8%. The lack of retail interest despite the price being at multiyear highs indicates BTC might be in an early bull market phase.According to the Mayer Multiple, historical Bitcoin price cycles show the current BTC rally is not overheated.The Mayer Multiple analyzes the price of Bitcoin based on its 200-day moving average, which evaluates its long-term price trend. If the multiple is above 2.4, it indicates that the rally is likely overheated. In 2017, when BTC hit $20,000, as an example, the multiple rose to around 3.8.Currently, as of Nov. 2, the Mayer Multiple is hovering at around 1.27. This shows the rally is not overheated or overcrowded, despite BTC’s uptrend from $3,600 to $13,350 since March.During autumn, the northern areas of China undergo the rainy season. Major mining hubs that rely on hydropower can gain access to cheaper electricity, which allows them to mine Bitcoin more efficiently.When the rainy season came to an end, there was a mass exodus of miners in the Northern area of China. Consequently, the hash rate of Bitcoin fell steeply in a short period.Yet the 30-day average hash rate over the past year shows that the Bitcoin hash rate is still near its record high. Currently, it is hovering at roughly 132 million terahashes per second. In January, the hash rate was well below 100 million TH/s, by comparison.Based on HODL waves, which evaluate the trend of long-time Bitcoin holders, more investors are increasingly holding BTC for longer periods.HODLing activity has increased since March when the price of BTC briefly dropped below $3,600. Since then, investors have been steadily accumulating BTC.The increasing holding of BTC put together with strong fundamentals, a favorable high time frame technical structure and positive technical indicators have strengthened the overall market sentiment that may eventually trigger an even bigger rally for Bitcoin."
668,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) declined by 2% in under an hour in a sharp correction on Nov. 2, catching traders off guard. Coincidentally, the CME Bitcoin futures market opened with a new gap, making $13,100 an area of interest for sellers.Three technicals reasons likely fueled the abrupt decline in the price of Bitcoin: CME gap, major resistance and monthly moving averages (MAs).The CME Bitcoin futures market closes during the weekend and on holidays. This means that if BTC sees a large price movement during those days, a gap between CME and cryptocurrency exchanges emerges.While there is no comprehensive theory as to why traders move to fill CME futures gaps, historically, most CME Bitcoin gaps have filled.Since October, Bitcoin has seen a strong rally. During the weekend, the volume of BTC tends to drop as the market becomes less active. But in the case of the last several months, BTC has continuously moved upward without a dip in volume.Consequently, this led to the formation of four CME gaps in a row. Every weekly candle in the past month led to a new CME gap, which is rare for Bitcoin. It means that BTC has moved so fast even during the weekends that new consecutive gaps have been formed.The gaps are found at $13,100, $12,970, $11,505, and $11,100. These areas could be considered levels of interest for sellers. Coincidentally, the $12,970 to $13,100 range is an important area in terms of moving averages.On the monthly chart of Bitcoin, the next short-term moving average is the 5-day moving average at $12,203. Throughout history, even during bull markets, at least one short-term moving average on the monthly chart was hit before the continuation of a rally.Bitcoin has rallied quickly since early October, rising by more than 25% from $11.775 to $13,500. The pace of the uptrend meant BTC was not able to establish clear support levels on higher time frame charts.In the past two months, Bitcoin has repeated the pattern of rallying followed by a short period of consolidating. On the daily chart, this created clear support and resistance levels, making the rally sustainable compared to previous ones.On the weekly and monthly chart, however, Bitcoin is still far from notable short-term moving averages. The closest MA is the 5-day MA at around $12,200.Bitcoin tested the $14,000 resistance level on Oct. 31 for the first time since December 2017. After such a major rally and a key retest, a sharp pullback was expected.Some traders said they were surprised by the intensity of the Bitcoin price drop when it occurred. But, when they saw the high open interest of the futures market, the traders said the move made more sense.“Once in a while I'm actually surprised by a move,” a pseudonymous trader known as CL said. Later on, CL added that the open interest was high enough to justify such a move. “Actually nvm, I miss read how much open interest was rising earlier, this makes sense."""
669,"Cuba is apparently seeing an influx of Bitcoin (BTC)-related activity as Bitcoin interest is on the rise in the country.According to data from Google Trends, Cuba now ranks second in terms of Bitcoin interest over the past 30 days. The island nation follows Nigeria, which has remained as the top country searching for Bitcoin on Google since April 2020.The rest of Google’s top five regions searching for Bitcoin comprise the African countries of South Africa, Cameroon and Ghana.Cuba’s rise in Bitcoin-related searches comes amid reports of Cubans increasingly turning to Bitcoin to circumvent sanctions imposed by the United States and gain access to digital financial services. As major digital payment firms like PayPal and Stripe are reportedly not available for Cuban nationals, the coronavirus pandemic-fueled travel restrictions have made local payments even more complicated.In late October, a local programmer and YouTuber Erich García called on the nation to use Bitcoin for cross-border remittances, claiming that anyone who wants to send payments to the island should buy Bitcoin and send it through a Cuban crypto exchange called BitRemesas:In April 2020, Italian-Cuban entrepreneur Mario Mazzola launched Cuba’s first decentralized Bitcoin exchange, Qbita. According to Mazzola, the new exchange aims to allow Cubans to buy and sell Bitcoin as major crypto services like LocalBitcoins and Paxful are not accessible in the country."
670,"Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week and month just dollars away from its highest monthly close in history — what’s in store next?Cointelegraph takes a look at five price factors which may influence BTC/USD as the U.S. goes to the polls and coronavirus sparks new Europe-wide lockdowns.This week contains a geopolitical event which traditionally plays havoc with markets: the U.S. presidential election.Coming at a time when coronavirus angers and restricts daily life for many U.S. citizens, markets will be keenly watching the result for clues as to the incoming president’s future policy.The implications are not just social. Economic firsts have accompanied the virus, with consequences including companies ditching fast-inflating cash for Bitcoin.As Cointelegraph reported, analysts believe that regardless of who wins, the result will be a boon for safe havens such as gold. Bitcoin, despite becoming less tied to macro markets in general, may yet react to moves in the strength of the U.S. dollar.On Monday, the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY), an indicator with which BTC/USD has shown inverse correlation, continued a week-long climb to rise above 94.“Asia stocks climbed buoyed by upbeat China factory activity in volatile start to crucial week spanning US election & Fed meeting, events that could set tone for markets for rest of 2020,” analyst Holger Zschaepitz summarized on Twitter Monday.Zschaepitz had noted over the weekend that Bitcoin was rising in tandem with negative-yielding debt volumes worldwide. Global bonds with negative yields — where the lender literally pays the borrower — had fallen from a record $17 trillion to $12 trillion by late 2019, only to rise again this year.“Negative yields are good for Bitcoin, which does not yield any interest itself,” he explained.Beyond the U.S., the situation for markets in Europe looked bleak thanks to coronavirus lockdowns returning across the continent.Amid fresh warnings of contractions in economic activity due to the measures, markets began shrugging off even bullish signs in favor of reducing potential election fallout.Zschaepitz noted that German stocks alone lost $4.1 trillion in value last week, the most since the March crash.For Bitcoin proponents, the time was as right as ever to buy, as the European Central Bank (ECB) confirmed more stimulus and more money printing.On the topic of Germany’s new lockdown, popular trader MMCrypto urged Twitter followers to reduce fiat exposure.“The crazy news is that the businesses which have to close will get up to 75% of their revenue in freshly printed money,” the trader highlighted.Focusing on Bitcoin-specific price triggers, the weekend’s action allowed yet another so-called “gap” to open up in futures markets.Gaps are formed when the end of one week’s trading is at a different price point to the start of the next. Historically, BTC/USD moves to revisit the levels left out by the weekend, whether those are higher or lower than Monday’s spot price.As noted by market analyst Zack Voell, four small gaps have appeared on CME Group’s Bitcoin futures market — every weekend for the past four weeks has produced one.“CME bitcoin futures opening with a gap up for the fourth consecutive week. That's pretty bullish,” Voell commented. A subsequent shift down during Monday trading closed a gap in the low $13,700 range.As Cointelegraph reported, only a small gap at $16,000 remains higher up on the historical Bitcoin price chart, while lower down, a gap at $9,600 failed to get filled the last time that Bitcoin briefly dipped below $10,000.On the topic of institutions, analysts remain bullish over Bitcoin’s monthly close, despite the largest cryptocurrency narrowly missing out on setting an all-time high.As Cointelegraph reported, BTC/USD closed out October just dollars away from its highest end-of-month level ever.For veteran trader Peter Brandt, who correctly forecast various Bitcoin price events before they happened, the results were more than promising.Specifically, institutions would see the monthly close figure as an essential tool for reinforcing bullish sentiment. Bitcoin began October trading at around $10,750.Brandt tweeted:On the weekly chart, meanwhile, $14,000 remains as clear resistance, with only a brief wick over the weekend providing any clues of strength to flip the level to support. Beyond $14,000, very little remains in the way of Bitcoin rising towards its “ultimate” resistance at all-time highs near $20,000.As Cointelegraph noted last week, Bitcoin network fundamentals are seeing upheaval currently.Difficulty, a measure of the competition and economic health of miners and an essential part of Bitcoin’s self-maintaining ecosystem, is set to drop by the most since March on Tuesday.At -14.27% according to publishing-time estimates, the difficulty will mimic its losses following the cross-asset crash induced by the coronavirus.The phenomenon is not necessarily bad. Lower difficulty means easier participation for smaller miners, while increased participation overall will lower Bitcoin transaction fees and decrease block times, both of which have risen sharply over the past two weeks.Like difficulty, the network hash rate also continues to decline, down from a record weekly average of 146 exahashes per second (EH/s) to 107 EH/s at press time."
671,"Bitcoin (BTC) has rallied about 90% year-to-date and has risen close to 191% from its March lows. The rise has been gradual without much fanfare, which suggests that crypto believers are the ones who have been buying in 2020.October’s monthly close at $13,798.99 is the highest ever, surpassing the December 2017 close at $13,789.68. The strong performance of Bitcoin may now attract the momentum players and the speculators who look to benefit from the strength.If that happens, then Bitcoin could pick up momentum and surprise investors to the upside. This could result in traders selling their altcoins to invest in Bitcoin. Hence, the altseason looks to be over in the short-term.Three of the top-five cryptocurrencies analyzed today may offer a trading opportunity to the upside while the other two may continue to decline further. Let’s watch the critical levels that may indicate the start of a trending move.Bitcoin rose above the $13,973.50 overhead resistance and reached an intraday high of $14,101.91 on Oct. 31. Although the bulls failed to sustain the price above the resistance, they have not given up much ground to the downside.This suggests that traders are not closing their positions in a hurry because they expect another attempt by the bulls to propel the price above the resistance.Both the 10-day exponential moving average ($13,309) and the 50-day simple moving average ($11,505) are sloping up and the relative strength index is in the overbought territory. This suggests that the bulls are in command.If the BTC/USD pair closes above $14,000, the next leg of the uptrend could begin that can reach $16,500.However, if the bulls again fail to sustain the price above $14,000, then the short-term traders may dump their positions and the bears could initiate short positions. A break below the 10-day EMA will be the first sign that the momentum has weakened.The bears are likely to gain an upper hand if the pair drops and sustains below the critical support at $12,460.The pair is currently attempting to hold above the 10-EMA. If that happens and the bulls succeed in pushing the price above the $13,973.50–$14,101.92 resistance zone, a new uptrend is likely.However, the bearish divergence on the RSI suggests that the upside momentum is weakening. If the sellers can sink the pair below the 10-EMA, a drop to the 50-SMA and then to $13,000 will be on the cards. The strong support in the $12,750–$13,000 zone could attract buyers.Binance Coin (BNB) broke below the $28.50 support on Oct. 30 but managed to bounce from the intraday lows and close above $28.50. However, the doji candlestick pattern on Oct. 31 suggested indecision among the bulls and the bears.The bears are currently attempting to resolve the indecision to the downside and gain the upper hand. If the BNB/USD pair breaks and closes below $27.50, it will increase the possibility of a drop to $24.86.The downsloping 10-day EMA ($29.47) and the RSI in the negative zone suggests that the path of least resistance is to the downside.Contrary to this assumption, if the price reverses direction and rises above $28.50, then it will suggest a few more days of consolidation.The 4-hour chart shows that the recovery from $27.5111 is facing stiff resistance at the 10-EMA. A break below $28 could challenge the $27.50 support, which if broken, the next stop could be $26.50.Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is close to the oversold zone, suggesting an advantage to the bears.This view will be invalidated if the pair turns around and rises above $29. Such a move will suggest accumulation at lower levels and will increase the possibility of a rise to $30.50.Cardano (ADA) broke below the bearish rising wedge pattern on Oct. 26 and plunged to the $0.0891 support. The bulls are currently attempting to defend the support and push the price above the moving averages.However, the downsloping 10-day EMA ($0.988) and the RSI below 43 suggest that bears are in control. Therefore, the bounce is likely to face stiff resistance at the moving averages.If the ADA/USD pair turns down from this resistance, the bears will again try to break the $0.0891 support. Such a move will open the gates for a decline to the next support at $0.0755.This bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the moving averages. Such a move could result in a rally to $0.11.The bulls have pushed the price above the 10-EMA on the 4-hour chart. The pair could now move up to the 50-SMA where bears may again step in and sell.Although the 50-SMA is still sloping down, the 10-EMA is attempting to turn up and the RSI has risen to the midpoint, which suggests that the selling pressure has reduced in the short-term.However, if the pair turns down from the current levels or the 50-SMA, the bears will once again try to sink the price below the $0.0891 support. If they succeed, the next leg of the down move could begin.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has formed a symmetrical triangle, which usually acts as a continuation pattern. However, as this setup suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears, it is better to wait for the price to break above the triangle before taking a directional bet.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is above 59, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand. If the bulls can push and sustain the price above the triangle, the BCH/USD pair could move up to $280 and then to $296.87.Contrary to this assumption, if the price breaks below the triangle, the BCH/USD pair could drop to the critical support at $242. The 50-day SMA ($239) is placed just below this support, hence, the bulls may buy a drop to this zone.The bulls had pushed the price above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle but they could not sustain the higher levels and the bears have dragged the price back into the triangle.However, if the pair bounces off the 50-SMA or the 10-EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to propel the price above the triangle. If they succeed, the momentum could pick up and a rally to $280 is likely.This positive view will be negated if the price breaks below the moving averages and drops below the symmetrical triangle.Chainlink (LINK) has been trading inside an ascending channel for the past few days. Although the pace of rise has been slow, the altcoin has been making successive higher highs and higher lows.The LINK/USD pair is currently correcting after turning down from the overhead resistance at $13. Both moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is close to the midpoint, suggesting a balance between supply and demand.The bulls are likely to purchase the drop to the support line of the channel. If the price rebounds off this support with strength, the bulls may again attempt to push the pair above $13.This positive view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the channel. Such a move could drag the price down to $8.3817 and below that to $7.2869.The bulls are currently attempting to defend the uptrend line. If they can push the price above the downtrend line, the pair could start its journey towards $13.However, the 10-EMA has flattened out and the RSI has been trading in the negative territory, which suggests that bears are attempting a comeback in the short-term.If the bears can sink the price below the uptrend line, the pair could drop to the support line of the channel. The bulls will attempt to defend this support and if they succeed, the pair may rise to the downtrend line.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

672,"Warren Buffett has a message to young investors: dollar-cost average into major stock market indices. However, data shows that the same strategy has worked quite well for Bitcoin (BTC) too over the past decade.The term dollar-cost averaging or DCA refers to a strategy when an investor divides up the total amount to be invested into periodic purchases of the given asset. The theory behind this investment strategy is that when an asset goes up or down, investors can benefit from both reducing the negative impact of price volatility.Buffett has long expressed his optimism towards dollar-cost averaging into stock market indices. Specifically, the ""oracle of Omaha"" likes the S&P 500 index funds and dollar-cost averaging into the index.But data indicates that the same strategy has proven efficient for Bitcoin in the past several years. For five years in the last decade, Bitcoin recorded 100% gains per annum. What's more, 98% of Bitcoin addresses are currently in a state of profit.As an example, if an investor cost averaged $100 into Bitcoin since January 2014 and spent $35,700 in total, it would have returned 1,648% or around $589,000.Additionally, on Aug. 6, the price of Bitcoin was at $11,744 on Binance. At the time, researchers at CoinMetrics said that if an investor dollar-cost averaged into BTC since its $20,000 high, it would have returned a 61.7% gain. They wrote:Since then, the price of Bitcoin has increased from $11,744 to $13,840, by 17.9% in three months. The average return of an investor who dollar-cost averaged into BTC since the $20,000 peak is now substantially higher.There are several reasons why investing in Bitcoin over a long period has worked regardless of price volatility. One of these includes Bitcoin being a nascent store of value that is minuscule compared to gold.Throughout 2020, Bitcoin has seen a considerable increase in institutional demand. BTC is compelling to institutions because it is a hedge and a potential investment that could bring exponential growth simultaneously.Dollar-cost averaging has worked for Bitcoin because BTC can have extreme corrective phases. But, during bull runs, when infrastructure and fundamentals significantly improve and an institutional craze occurs, its value can increase rapidly.For instance, in March 2020, the price of Bitcoin abruptly dropped to as low as $3,600 across major exchanges. As of Nov. 1, BTC’s price is above $13,800, up more than three-fold since.Analysts at Glassnode found that 98% of all Bitcoin addresses are profitable. They find this statistic by analyzing when BTC first enters an address and evaluates the price at which BTC was bought. They explained:With an asset that has the potential to see exponential growth, high-risk strategies could become difficult to manage. As such, dollar-cost averaging is typically a practical and efficient way to approach BTC."
673,"The people of India are awaiting access to crypto banking services, as British-based fintech firm Cashaa has collaborated with India’s United Multistate Credit Cooperative Society to launch a crypto-centric banking company called Unicas that will initially open 34 branches in Northern India and plans to have expanded to 100 branches by next year. Considering that India is largely a savings-driven economy, Unicas will also offer crypto saving accounts that pay interest on deposited crypto. This could act as a catalyst for co-operative credit societies in India to enter the market and make the most of this opportunity.But overall, the Indian crypto industry has seen enormous growth both in volumes and new clients since its Supreme Court removed a two-year ban on banks servicing cryptocurrency exchanges in March 2020. Nischal Shetty, founder of WazirX — a crypto exchange based in India — told Cointelegraph:Ashu Swami, the chief technology officer of Apifiny — a cryptocurrency liquidity and solutions provider based in New York — attributes this growth to the increasing evidence of Bitcoin (BTC) becoming a safe haven and the ease of making inward remittances to the country with cryptocurrencies. “Senders are realizing that virtual currencies are a more efficient medium,” hence the growth in demand. He further added:As a result of these factors, according to statistics provided by Apifiny, almost all of the major international crypto exchanges have reported a traffic increase from five to 10 times from Indian users in 2020. Meanwhile, local crypto exchanges in India have reported a tenfold increase in registrations in 2020, which is 2.5 times the global average of 400% year-over-year growth.With Binance having acquired WazirX, Bain & Company funding CoinDCX, and Polaris Capital beginning to invest in the crypto market in India, it’s evident that big players have recognized the underlying potential that the Indian market has for crypto and have begun to allocate capital to participate in this growth.Even Tata Consultancy Services, an Indian multinational information technology and consulting firm, launched its Quartz Smart Solution earlier this year in July that aids financial institutions to offer cryptocurrency trading. Shetty believes it all adds credibility to the industry: “TCS works with large companies as their clients. We anticipate large financial institutions probably starting a pilot with this to go full-fledged with their own crypto offering to their clients.”This indicates that mainstream Indian banks are interested in entering this industry the same way DBS Bank, Singapore’s largest commercial and retail bank, did: by launching cryptocurrency and custody services. Even PayPal announcing that it will start allowing cryptocurrency payments in 2021 is bound to increase the number of investors in India.In the past, PayPal didn’t have a smooth entry into India even with fiat-based payments. Technically, the Reserve Bank of India has never prohibited the company from operating in India, but in 2010, PayPal shut down its services. According to Swami, this was due to Indian Know Your Customer standards and licensing regulations being too onerous and thus a hindrance to its ease of customer use. In 2017, PayPal launched a new India-friendly version, but the market was already saturated by indigenous startups. Swami believes crypto could present a new opportunity for PayPal:The thriving crypto industry in India is also driven by innovators who develop new products for Indian investors inline with their savings-oriented investment behavior, offering them more lucrative returns than the traditional asset classes. Gaurav Dahake, CEO of BitBNS — an Indian cryptocurrency exchange — told Cointelegraph: “Trading is one aspect of it. But the other interesting aspect is new development and new product launches.”Additionally, the first Indian business-to-business exchange, DigiTx, launched on Oct. 27, which may also push more businesses to indulge in the cryptocurrency market either directly or through their various subsidiaries.The only factor holding back the industry at the moment is perhaps the most important one: the lack of a clear regulatory framework, within which crypto firms can operate. Although the recent “leaked” information of another incoming ban from the government has been criticized by experts close to the matter, there still seems to be no word on how the government or the RBI sees this industry despite various efforts by crypto firms to indulge in this conversation and even assist in every way possible.WazirX is a part of the Internet and Mobile Association of India and is continuously pushing this conversation with governing bodies. Shetty further elaborated on this:In addition to WazirX, CoinDCX and a few other exchanges are also proactively implementing KYC verification and regulatory controls to disprove the RBI’s statement, which implied that virtual currencies can only be used for nefarious purposes such as drug trafficking and terrorism financing. Currently, the Indian governing bodies seem to be turning a blind eye to the thriving crypto industry with no plans to discuss its future in India. What’s more, it isn’t even featured on the list of agendas up for discussion in the winter parliament session beginning in November.Related: Indian Banks Act Slow to Accept Crypto Industry Despite RBI’s ApprovalSwami is of the opinion that the government is looking for ways to reap benefits from this industry without being subject to any of the risks involved: “Our hopes are limited from this section. We are more hopeful of the market forces and industry to prevail.”Crypto exchange BuyUcoin has even suggested a regulatory sandbox approach to be implemented. It is highly important that the governing bodies step in with a clear regulatory framework that helps the industry to grow and minimize any possible scams."
674,"The monthly candle of Bitcoin (BTC) for October has closed above $13,000 for the first time since December 2017. It comes after both daily and weekly candles all closed above the crucial resistance level.Traders often use the monthly log chart to evaluate the long-term and macro trend of an asset. On a monthly chart, each candle represents a whole month of trading activity. As such, a Bitcoin monthly log chart typically covers many years of trading activity.The monthly chart is considered to be one of the main high time frame charts alongside the weekly chart. A clear breakout above an important level, like $13,000, on the monthly chart, indicates a technical breakout.As Cointelegraph previously reported, Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood emphasized the importance of the $13,000 level.Wood, who manages $11 billion in assets under management at Ark Invest, said there is little resistance between $13,000 and $20,000. This means if Bitcoin breaks out on a high time frame chart, the probability to rise to a new record-high could get higher. She said:Although the price of Bitcoin hit $20,000 in 2017 and $13,970 in 2019, the monthly candle never closed above $13,000. This is because BTC saw sharp rejections during both peaks, which then rattled the market.The recent rally is particularly optimistic because it has shown a more sustainable staircase-like uptrend. As the price rose, it established clear support levels, making the rally more stable.In the immediate future, traders are readying for a minor pullback. Technically, the monthly chart of Bitcoin closed significantly higher above key short-term moving averages.A pseudonymous trader known as “Loma” said BTC would likely drop to around $13,100, and resume the rally. The 5-day moving average on the Bitcoin monthly chart is found at $12,256, so a drop to low $13,000s would be healthy for the rally. Loma wrote:Similarly, Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said a drop to sub-$12,000 could also occur.As Cointelegraph reported, a Bitcoin pullback entering November would place even more pressure on the altcoin market. Bitcoin has sucked most of the volume from the cryptocurrency market, which means that if BTC goes down, the selling pressure on altcoins would likely intensify."
675,"At the time of writing this article, around 3.6% of Bitcoin (BTC) is locked up in long-term holdings by institutional investors. According to the data, 13 entities have amassed close to 600,000 BTC — about 2.85% of all Bitcoins and worth approximately $6.9 billion.The list includes MicroStrategy at the top, with close to 38,250 BTC (about $450 million). The second on the list is Galaxy Digital Holdings with 16,651 BTC (about $198 million). The third, with 4,709 BTC, is the payment company Square Inc., founded by Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey. Separately, some companies help their clients invest in BTC. One such company is Grayscale Investments through its GBTC trust, which holds around 450,000 BTC.With that stated, the amount of Bitcoin that publicly traded companies hold as a reserve is a tiny fraction of the corporate treasuries around the world. Indeed, the actual amount of cash held in reserves is in the trillions of U.S. dollars. But consider this: Nine companies in the S&P 500 are sitting on close to $600 billion in cash and short-term investments, and if just 5% (or $30 billion) of that amount is converted into Bitcoin, the price could easily increase fivefold.Of course, there is the question of where to place Bitcoin in company investment portfolios. The most likely category is “alternative investment.” The need to strike a balance between traditional and alternative investments might reduce the appetite the market might have for the cryptocurrency.Nevertheless, the potential demand is still huge. As mentioned in a recent report by Fidelity, the alternative investment market grew to $13.4 trillion by the end of 2018, and very little of it was in Bitcoin. It might take converting as little as 5% of that to see the Bitcoin price moon.Some investment firms have chosen to create entirely separate holding companies for Bitcoin and other crypto assets. For example, Stone Ridge launched New York Digital Investment Group, which today has over $1 billion worth of crypto.To understand this phenomenon better, I recently had an enlightening chat with Michael Saylor, the founder of MicroStrategy. In particular, I found his pick of 100 years as the base on which to measure the success or failure of a reserve asset very interesting.Of course, most companies are founded with the expectation that they are going to be around for quite some time — centuries, preferably. Even for individuals, it still makes sense to look at how investments might change over a hundred years, as a person might amass wealth intended for heirs or even causes that are close to the heart, such as climate change. As Michael Saylor said:Of course, the most obvious weakness to spot when considering the performance of any reserve asset in 100 years is inflation. Out of all asset types, fiat currency experiences the most inflation over time. For example, what $5 could buy in the 1920s is far more than what it can in 2020. According to a website that collects and processes government data for the benefit of the public, the U.S. dollar loses close to 2% of its purchasing power every year.While real estate might seem like a great asset to hold as a reserve for the long term, it is susceptible to losing value through things like taxes. More importantly, though, real estate faces risks that come with changes in regulation or public governance. In the span of 100 years, it is highly likely that a government that respects private property ownership is replaced with one that does not. This has already happened several times around the world in the last century.Meanwhile, stocks also face risks of poor management and regulation changes. Michael Saylor gave the example of power and water utilities, industries in which highly lucrative companies have become nationalized. We cannot say with conviction that in the next 100 years, internet service providers, for example, aren’t going to be turned into public utilities.Even gold and other precious metals run into issues when you look at them in terms of 100 years. While they appreciate over time, the logistics of holding them can be stressful. You could use third-party storage services such as commercial banks, but history has taught us that gold can get lost even there, especially during wartime or political upheavals such as revolutions. This has also happened several times in the last century. During World War II, large masses of gold were stolen by both state and non-state actors. Similarly, during the Soviet revolution, a lot of privately owned gold was seized by the incoming government.As for now, Bitcoin has no counterparty risks. In other words, we don’t have to worry that the actions of a third party are going to lead to a significant loss of the asset’s value. It is also protected from risks that might come from regulation or extreme change in government policy. The holders of Bitcoin are always going to be in complete control of it.As a peer-to-peer network, the Bitcoin platform gives holders of the asset a level of control that bypasses regulation or the use of state force. Meanwhile, we are almost assured that its value will continue growing over the years, as the supply is determined and the emission rate of new units halves every four years.The autonomy and increasing scarcity of Bitcoin is most likely going to drive its value up over time, and it would come as no surprise in 100 years to see its price considerably higher than where it is today.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

676,"Bitcoin (BTC) price is undoubtedly having an impressive year after crashing to $3,700 in March but then rallying to $14,000 in the following months. Now BTC has reached the highest point since January 2018 as the price touched $14,100.Thus, the likelihood of the new bull cycle is heavily increasing as the price of Bitcoin continues to make new higher highs and higher lows. What's more, the strength is even seen while the U.S. Dollar Currency Index, with which it is typically inversely correlated, is also recovering amid coronavirus fears.BTC/USD 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewThe weekly chart shows some crucial levels to be watched in order to continue the bullish momentum. One of them is the current resistance zone surrounding the $14,000 threshold. Breaking through this resistance zone would initiate further strength toward the next threshold around $16,500-17,000.These two levels are the final hurdles before a possible new all-time high, while the majority of altcoins are still facing huge losses compared to their 2017 peak highs.There are two crucial levels to watch on the downside. The first and primary breaker is the $11,400-11,800 area. That’s been the crucial resistance zone for two years, which means it could see a retest before any more upside.However, if that area is lost, the next support zone is found between $10,100-10,400. These two zones are critical to hold if the market is in bullish territory.BTC/USD 1-month chart. Source: TradingViewAs the monthly chart shows, the highest monthly close ever is possible for Bitcoin — an incredible accomplishment 12 years after the release of the whitepaper.However, it also shows the significance of this resistance zone as it’s the last major hurdle before the all-time high can be challenged.If $13,700-14,200 breaks, further continuation toward new all-time highs are almost guaranteed as there are not many levels standing in between.However, the start of a new bull cycle is typically accompanied by accumulation periods, through which previous resistance zones are retested and confirmed as support. Such an accumulation period would mean Bitcoin’s price can correct toward $11,600 to find sufficient support before a major move up.BTC/USD 1-week 2016 chart. Source: TradingViewThe 2016 chart shows these accumulation ranges through which a healthy trend was established. Every previous resistance level got retested for confirmation, after which a range was established to accumulate Bitcoin.After such a range-bound construction, compression started to build up, ultimately resulting in a massive breakout.Another massive signal is the quick buys during market corrections. These are shown by long wicks as buyers quickly step in to buy as price is falling. A similar move can occur if the market corrects in the coming weeks.BTC/USD 1-week scenario chart. Source: TradingViewThe current area of $11,400-11,800 is a crucial resistance zone. If the price of Bitcoin falls to break through this resistance zone, a correction will become the likely scenario.Therefore, Bitcoin’s possible scenario is range-bound action between $11,400 and $14,200. Such a sideways construction would be similar to the 2016 period of accumulation.Ether and other altcoins may then show up to the part the moment Bitcoin finishes its correction and goes into the sideways range-bound construction. It will likely take a few more months before altcoins can start to move upward.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

677,"While the crypto community decides whether Bitcoin (BTC) was born — or merely conceived — 12 years ago, the fact is that Oct. 31, 2008, remains one of the most notable dates in humanity’s modern history. Exactly 12 years ago, Satoshi Nakamoto published what some have described as “a new bible” — Bitcoin’s white paper.

Suffice to say, it’s a great time to be alive for compliance hardliners and a rough patch for privacy advocates, aside from a healthy recent boost in the price of Monero (XMR).Stepping back and looking at the larger trend, many in the crypto community are now imagining a world with two “Bitcoin blockchains” — or perhaps, two distinct networks of various blockchains. The first is a blessed white blockchain, or “lightchain,” akin to a friendly neighborhood where everybody knows each other’s name; the other is a sinister “darkchain” full of drug traffickers, pimps and terrorists (as far as we know).Privacy advocates fear that because Know Your Customer rules are being placed on exchanges that custody crypto and that banks and institutional wealth will make crypto mainstream via similar custodial solutions, only those who custody crypto with such institutions will be allowed onto the lovely lightchains. These chains will lie within the lofty ivory pillars of Wall Street and beneath the halls of wealth and power, while the vast unwashed masses who prefer to hold and control their own crypto will be forced into a crypto ghetto on the darkchain.While the basis of these fears is well founded, it is important to remember the original purpose of AML compliance, originating in 1970s America, was to assist law enforcement in its investigations. Maintaining a vast reporting system for monitoring user activity and feeding it to the government, like the modern Transportation Security Administration airport panopticon, is a 21st century, post-9/11 invention of Bush-era America and hardly a prerequisite for a global financial network.In fact, this recently imposed norm was a major impetus for many privacy-friendly innovations in crypto, including, arguably, Bitcoin (BTC) itself. In other words, the “lightchainers” are justifying potentially removing the privacy from blockchains under the same “War on Terror” rationale for the Patriot Act, only with the possibility of permanently airing your dirty laundry on a public ledger rather than keeping it between the banks and government (and occasionally leaked to Buzzfeed).More importantly, it has long been obvious that even in the crypto space, the imposition of global mandatory wallet identification and traceability has strained this original “assisting law enforcement” rationale for AML rules. Historically, the Elliptics, CypherTraces and Chainalysises of the world have spent most of their energy working with law enforcement to map out actual criminals and their transactions resulting from actual criminal activity, rather than setting up vast dragnets of everybody’s wallet addresses.Whether it was Mt. Gox or other exchange hackers, BitLocker scammers or international criminals of many stripes, Bitcoin has a feature that allows blockchain exploration compliance firms to demarcate known bad guys and create an actual “darkchain” not to be mixed into the polite company of the remaining blockchain(s).This system has worked. Most virtual asset service providers, or VASPs, (i.e., exchanges) use blockchain explorer compliance tools to block and track transactions on the darkchain and assist law enforcement with its investigations. These efforts have also made it much, much harder for actual criminals to launder their crypto on compliant exchanges.So, let us reject the thesis that we are barreling toward a “lightchain-vs.-darkchain” dichotomy. Rather, let’s recognize that we already have a small darkchain of proven money launderers that VASPs do not, and should not, work with and should freeze and work with law enforcement to deal with. We then have the splotches of lightchains that exist within VASPs (i.e., exchanges) for which they are, and should be, legally obligated to keep private and share only to the extent they detect darkchain or demonstrable criminal activity, rather than sharing private user information of noncriminals. This leaves us with a third chain, the vast, lovely, delightfully opaque “graychain” blockchains that have served us so well for all these many years.To “keep blockchain gray,” we must resist the efforts of the lightchain to penetrate the gray by penalizing VASPs and blockchain exploration and compliance tools that engage in unjustified tainting of the gray with the white. In other words, publicizing identifying information of exchange customers should lead to lawsuits and, in Europe, anti-privacy enforcement actions. Likewise, we must resist the darkening of our beloved graychain by policymakers, pundits and so-called crypto lawyers who advocate for penalties on operating in the gray zone.There is nothing wrong with holding your crypto in a hardware wallet, and to argue that those who exercise healthy cybersecurity by doing so have “something to hide” stains credibility. We must resist this by advocating for the graychains, which are by no actual measures true vectors for money laundering, and by pointing out the irrationality of believing that pseudonymous blockchains are more valuable when they are no longer anonymous at all. In the end, even if the lightchainers are successful, they will be sowing the seeds of even more private forms of money that lie beyond their reach.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
679,"As public awareness of cryptocurrencies continues to grow, there’s one issue that the sector continues to grapple with: trust.According to research by Edelman, just 48% of people trust digital assets. Although this is up 11% on the year before, it’s still lower than the scores given to banks, credit card providers, insurers and the financial services sector as a whole.The report also suggests that levels of trust could rise if the industry doubles down on efforts to educate the public by demonstrating the distinctive use cases for cryptocurrencies and clearly explaining the advantages and disadvantages associated with this asset class.Given how many crypto-focused projects present their products in an overly technical way while others offer little transparency, it can be difficult for consumers to access impartial information to help them make up their minds.Cryptogeek is one of the websites that’s aiming to change this. Launched in 2019, it provides independent information about cryptocurrency and blockchain projects, giving readers concise, helpful reviews that they can trust, the team says.The company already has hundreds of reviews available for crypto enthusiasts to read, covering exchanges, wallets, coins, mining hardware and games. These guides, which are written by a team of experts, aim to cut through the noise and deliver the facts that everyday users want to know.For example, Cryptogeek’s unbiased reviews on exchanges clearly set out the fees that are charged on different types of transactions, examine the trading platform’s basic features, and critique the security measures that have been put in place to protect users.At the conclusion of every Cryptogeek review — which comes complete with screenshots and helpful subheadings — the platform provides an aggregate rating for each project based on five factors: functionality, reputation, security, support and fees.Of course, the experiences of one reviewer can differ from those of people who use these platforms on a regular basis. That’s why each brand page also provides a score based on reviews from members of the public. These reviews are free of censorship and give brands the opportunity to monitor their online reputation. Representatives can easily respond to the reviews left by Cryptogeek users, either to acknowledge praise or address failures. In time, this could help improve levels of accountability in the industry.Overall though, it all comes back to empowering crypto consumers to make informed decisions. One of Cryptogeek’s most novel features is a tool where users can type in the names of two companies and get an instant comparison of their features. As an example, the site contrasts Binance and Coinbase side by side, weighing up the two major exchanges based on fees, supported languages, trading volumes, the number of crypto tokens and trading pairs offered, and their rating as determined by both Cryptogeek and the public. At the bottom of the page, the winner of the two is marked based on score.Cryptogeek says its database benefits everyone: customers who want to share their opinion about products with the crypto community, newcomers searching for unbiased expert reviews and helpful tutorials, and companies who are passionate about receiving feedback from their users.Platforms interested in getting exposure can easily fill in an application form in order to gain a brand page on the Cryptogeek website. Applications are normally considered within a couple of days.Cryptogeek has already entered into several partnerships with other crypto brands, including the price data platform Coin360 and the prime brokerage firm Bequant.In these uncertain times, trust matters. Platforms that aim to educate the masses about the promise and potential pitfalls of digital assets and service providers will be instrumental in helping the crypto industry become more favorable in the eyes of the public.Disclaimer.

680,"Has it only been a dozen years since Oct. 31, 2008, that Satoshi Nakamoto published a modest nine-page paper describing a new online payments system called “Bitcoin?” Depending on where one stands, that pseudonymous white paper — its author(s) remain unidentified — fostered either a fintech revolution or, as some believe, “the greatest scam in history.” To mark the anniversary of the publication of “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” Cointelegraph invited comments on the enduring vision of the paper’s author. Would Satoshi Nakamoto have been pleased with how Bitcoin and blockchain technology have developed and evolved over the past 12 years?James Angel, an associate professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, told Cointelegraph: “It has set in motion a revolution in finance with the rise of DeFi apps, smart contracts, and coin offerings, in addition to a payment revolution that is leading to central bank digital currencies.” Gina Pieters, an assistant instructional professor at the University of Chicago’s economics department, told Cointelegraph: “He would be pleased to see the evolution and new applications of his vision.”The influence of Bitcoin’s (BTC) white paper goes beyond finance, Garrick Hileman, head of research at Blockchain.com, told Cointelegraph: “Its impact is worthy of being considered alongside other major technical innovations, such as the personal computer and internet.”Satoshi’s vision was for a P2P, or decentralized, digital cash system — as referenced in the white paper’s title. The problem with incumbent digital commerce was that it relied exclusively on “financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments,” Satoshi wrote. This had inherent weaknesses. Transactions could be reversed, banks had to mediate disputes, and transaction costs were high. Satoshi’s solution was presented in the second paragraph of the white paper’s introduction:In the 12 years since the paper’s publication, the need for P2P transactions — without interfering third parties — has become something of an article of faith among Bitcoinists. But, on reflection, has this aspect of Satoshi’s vision been fulfilled? David Yermack, a professor of finance at New York University’s Leonard N. Stern School of Business, told Cointelegraph:Angel went further: “Satoshi would be appalled at the politics of concentrated mining pools that currently dominate the Bitcoin protocol.” While Pieters added that Satoshi would be disappointed that the “primary transactions of Bitcoin were not occurring through peer-to-peer trading, but rather intermediated by centralized exchanges or companies.”The matter of fraud in digital transactions has always loomed, and in Bitcoin’s white paper Satoshi proposed a way to solve the classic “double-spend” problem — where miscreants spend the same coin twice, something not difficult to do with electronic coins. He did this using a “peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.” In this way, explained Satoshi, “transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud.”Solving the double-spend problem today is considered one of Satoshi’s greatest achievements. His Bitcoin blockchain has never been hacked (though the same can’t be said for the many crypto exchanges that trade BTC). Still, fraud associated with digital payments has not been squeezed out of the system. Would this have dismayed Bitcoin’s founder?Angel said that Satoshi would “have been disappointed that Bitcoin did not turn into an everyday payment medium but instead a store of value for fearful fatcats and tax evaders.” Moreover, Satoshi would “have been saddened by the increase in inequality that Bitcoin’s history has created, with a few early adopters becoming whales and the other 99.99999% of the population as have nots.” Still, one assumes Bitcoin’s creator — whether man, woman or group — would have marveled at the breadth of BTC’s adoption, as Yermack outlined:He had no inkling that the blockchain would become overloaded within the next five or six years, continued Yermack, “and that a contentious debate, still unresolved today, would break out among different constituencies of Bitcoin about the best way to expand the blockchain’s capacity further.”In the past 12 years, most of Satoshi’s original software code has been altered or substituted, added Hileman, but still, Bitcoin has retained its key foundational qualities, including “its fixed supply of 21 million coins, open access, and censorship/tamper resistance. I believe Satoshi would be happy with the ongoing software optimizations and improvements to these core foundational characteristics that continue today.”While the white paper says a lot about transaction fees, CPU power, network nodes, proof-of-work chains, and even the Gambler’s Ruin problem, it says nothing much about the larger world around, including the environment. Angel contends that Satoshi would be shocked by the environmental damage caused by the Bitcoin mining arms race, adding: “At current hash rates and mining efficiency, Bitcoin mining alone is consuming about seven gigawatts of electricity, which is the equivalent to seven Chernobyl power plants.”And while little is known about Satoshi’s politics, his creation, in the form of the first crypto blockchain, would also be disturbed by the idea of central bank digital currencies, and in some cases, “those currencies are designed for repressive governments to engage in even more surveillance and control over their populations,” added Angel.Focusing on the white paper proper, Franklin Noll, a monetary historian and the president of Noll Historical Consulting, told Cointelegraph: “His concern was with speedy, anonymous, low cost, non-mediated, non-reversible transactions. So far, Bitcoin transactions — and many other blockchain transactions — have not been found to be all that speedy, anonymous, or low cost.” He further added:“I believe Satoshi would want to see more use of non-custodial wallets to store and transact Bitcoin,” added Hileman, who explained that custody firms that manage private cryptographic keys on behalf of Bitcoin owners “resemble traditional banks.” Meanwhile, he believes that “Satoshi was not a fan of trusted third-party financial intermediaries.”After a little more than a decade later, what is the significance of Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper? In the financial sphere, “It incentivized financial companies and central banks to prioritize evaluating their technology, considering both increased digitization and ‘always-on’ digital platforms,” Pieters opined, continuing: “In some cases, like the renewed examinations of CBDCs, this has led to explorations of new systems even if it is not directly the adoption of blockchain technology.”“Bitcoin and blockchain have fundamentally changed the monetary world,” added Noll. “Terms like proof-of-work, distributed ledger technology, decentralized finance, programmable money and smart contracts are now part of the lexicon of anyone serious about the future of money and finance.” Hileman added:“The publication of Nakamoto’s 2008 paper was an important turning point in financial record-keeping,” said NYU’s Yermack. “We are only beginning to understand the ramifications, but they appear to be vast.”One won’t find the word “revolution” in Satoshi’s paper. There is nothing about overturning the economic order or narrowing the gap between rich or poor. It’s an unassuming treatise on electronic payments — how they can be made to function effectively.On his own terms, Satoshi succeeded wildly. He promised a workable P2P digital payment system, and he delivered. The market value of Bitcoin stands at $251 billion 12 years after the idea was unveiled.Whether Bitcoin is also harming the environment, abetting money launderers or propping up political regimes, goes beyond the scope of his paper. What can be said is that economic decentralization continues to present governance challenges. How much “peer-to-peer” does society really want? The larger global community will have to decide.Twelve years out from the publication of “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” it’s worth remembering that “it is a dictum of history that revolutions do not always turn out as the founders planned,” Noll told Cointelegraph."
681,"Satoshi Nakamoto announced the Bitcoin whitepaper on a cryptography mailing list on Halloween 2008. It could be the case that this was a meaningless coincidence, but when we take into account the meticulous planning behind Bitcoin’s launch party, the chosen date begins to take on more significance. Halloween is the carnival time, a ritual day when one can pretend to be someone or something else, whether a comic book superhero like Batman or Superman, or another eternally popular choice for Halloween, a Ghost — a spirit, much like Satoshi, that is neither dead nor alive. The carnival tradition goes back hundreds, even thousands of years, and there is no more apt day for the creator of Bitcoin to reveal the persona of Satoshi Nakamoto than Halloween.“The mystery and the paradox of it”Whoever created the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, they likely came from the cypherpunk community, a variegated bunch that was united by a common goal of using cryptography to curtail the reach of the Hobbesian Leviathan. The word “cryptography” is made up of the two Ancient Greek words, which when combined, mean something like “hidden writing” or “secret writing”. The early spirit of the cypherpunks is summed up best by none other than Hal Finney in his famous “farewell” post on Bitcointalk:Finney was the first person, outside of Satoshi, to run Bitcoin; he was the recipient of the first Bitcoin transaction as well. His early involvement in Bitcoin and prior experience in programming has led many to believe that he was Satoshi. Had Finney been involved in the creation of Bitcoin, then for the lover of “mystery and paradox” named “Hal”, revealing the project to the world on Halloween might have had additional meaning.Things are not as they appear to be when it comes to Bitcoin’s launchFor Satoshi Nakamoto, the creation of a decentralized electronic currency that was beyond the purview of any government was an ideologically driven endeavor imbued with symbolism and ceremony. The coinbase block contained a quote from an English newspaper, The Times, that many believe was a political commentary on the failings of the contemporary financial system:The quote has also acted as a watermark, a timestamp that certifies that the Bitcoin network was started on Jan 3, 2009. This is a generally accepted start date for the Bitcoin blockchain. Yet, it may not be true. It is true that it could not have been created before that date, but the quote does not prove that the network was born on that date. The first block (the genesis block was block zero) was mined on Jan 8, five days later. This was likely the day when the Bitcoin network went live. Satoshi backdated the ultimate timestamping service in order to make a political statement.FDR and the birth of Satoshi NakamotoSatoshi’s profile on the Foundation for Peer to Peer Alternatives, or P2P Foundation, listed his birthday as April 5, 1975. Some have drawn attention to the fact that on April 5, 1933, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102 forbidding the hoarding of gold, which limited an individual’s ability to own gold. During the Great Depression, the population looked to gold as the ultimate safe-haven asset at the time of great uncertainty. The recent horrors of German hyperinflation were still fresh on everyone’s mind. Up until then, the U.S. dollar was backed up with gold, the government needed to have more gold reserves to print more dollars, thus it believed that the hoarding of gold was hampering economic growth.Nonetheless, the same year, the United States was forced to abandon the gold standard. Roosevelt’s order was eventually repealed by President Gerald Ford, the bill went into effect on Dec 31, 1974. Hence, some have suggested — the birth year of Satoshi Nakamoto — 1975, the first year the Americans regained the right to hoard gold.Bitcoin keeps on trick-or-treating the worldSatoshi has done a wonderful job of creating an anonymous alter ego. Twelve years later no one has been able to unmask his Halloween disguise. In a world where seemingly the answer to any mystery, the solution to any paradox, is within a few clicks of a mouse, creating an impenetrable anon had to take wit and meticulous planning. Satoshi was always careful as to leave scant traceable personal clues in his writing.Satoshi’s last post on Bitcointalk came on Dec 12, 2010, in his penultimate post from the day before, he famously lamented about the attention Bitcoin was getting from the WikiLeaks association:Soon after that he withdrew from public life. Yet when the world was besieging befuddled Dorian Nakamoto, Satoshi, perhaps moved by the remorse about a prank that went too far, posted a message on the P2P Foundation’s site:Trick-or-treating is one of Halloween’s carnival customs where kids go door-to-door pleading for treats and threatening mischief if the adults fail to comply. As Bitcoin turns 12, it appears the world has not yet decided how to deal with this mischievous urchin."
682,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed $14,000 on Oct. 31, the day Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008. Since then, the world's biggest cryptocurrency has seen remarkable and exponential growth across various areas.Fast forward 12 years, since the October 31, 2008 release of the whitepaper, Bitcoin is in a different growth trajectory. An institutional craze is leading the BTC rally, major financial institutions are supporting crypto assets, and the market has become increasingly liquid.The 12-year anniversary of the Bitcoin whitepaper is particularly special for Bitcoin because it marks the third post-halving cycle.Every four years, Bitcoin undergoes a block reward halving, which cuts the rate at which new BTC is mined by half. This happens because 21 million BTC can ever exist on the blockchain. As BTC approaches its fixed supply, the rate of production gets slowed.A halving historically has had a positive impact on the price of Bitcoin. It reduces the pace a new BTC supply is introduced to the market. Consequently, every four years, there is less BTC flowing into the exchange market.The 4th, 8th, and the 12th anniversary of Bitcoin are more noteworthy than other anniversaries for this reason. It coincides with a post-halving cycle, as the latest halving occurred in May 2020.The historic prices of Bitcoin on ""whitepaper day"" have seen considerable growth over the past decade. For example, in 2013, BTC price was just $204. In 2014, it reached $338m; 2015 - $314; 2016 - $700; 2017 - $6,468; 2018 - $6,317; and $9,199 in 2019.Across major exchanges, the price of Bitcoin reached a peak of $14,100 and saw an immediate rejection on Saturday, Oct. 31. Most of the selling pressure came from Binance, which caused the price to quickly fall by 3% within minutes.Prior to the rejection, massive buy walls on Huobi and Binance initially pushed BTC upwards. There was a 1,371 BTC buy wall on Binance at $13,680 and another big buy wall at over $13,800 on Huobi.A pseudonymous Bitcoin trader known as “CL” said it was the “biggest buy wall on Huobi I’ve seen in a long time.”But as BTC surpassed $14,000, traders on Binance began to sell large amounts of BTC in a short period. Prior to BTC’s upsurge to $14,100, tech investor and Cointelegraph Markets contributor, Keith Wareing, wrote:When the price of Bitcoin surges rapidly and violently rejects, traders describe the pattern as a “darth maul candle.”After such a large spike in volatility, Bitcoin tends to stabilize and consolidate. Considering that $14,000 is a crucial resistance level, BTC would likely consolidate under $14,000 and continuously attempt to break out.CryptoQuant, the on-chain market data provider, has been pinpointing that Bitcoin exchange deposits have been declining. That typically indicates declining selling pressure, particularly among retail investors and whales.According to Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant said the trend is considered a “long-term buy signal.” The lack of intent to sell from investors on exchange indicates that a prolonged uptrend has become more likely.An optimistic market sentiment supplemented with strong fundamentals and various positive technical factors is only fitting on Bitcoin’s 12th anniversary."
683,"From what started as something of a “technological experiment” with Bitcoin (BTC) over a decade ago, the crypto asset industry has become a significant driver for change in global financial markets. Cryptocurrency exchanges started as a means to enable crypto enthusiasts to trade digital coins outside the traditional financial system on a decentralized and largely autonomous basis. It is likely that combined with regulatory recognition and development of digital market infrastructures, acceptance of essential Anti-Money Laundering practices, investment in security protection systems, and recognition of investor protection measures will see these businesses continue to expand and potentially merge or compete on an even footing with existing regulated marketplaces.The success of these platforms in allowing an unregulated free-flow of value across borders has unsurprisingly resulted in interest from governments and regulatory bodies. Initial skepticism was replaced by concern over weaknesses in relation to AML, fraud and investor protection measures. As crypto exchanges have improved their systems to meet AML and investor protection requirements, there is a begrudging recognition that these platforms have brought much-needed modernization and democratization to a market that has generally been seen as remote and privileged.Crypto exchanges have provided 24-hour, global access to trading venues with participants eligible from all walks of life and able to participate directly through accessing online trading tools and graphics, which have historically been available almost solely to a limited set of professional investors.Crypto assets have generally been on the outer edge of the regulatory perimeter, but are increasingly facing pressure to be included within the regulatory framework.The first key step in this direction at an international level was the extension of the AML standards announced in June 2019 for crypto-related businesses from the Financial Action Task Force, the global standard-setting body for fighting financial crime.Related: Slow but steady: FATF review highlights crypto exchanges’ struggle to meet AML standardsIn the European Union, this was followed by the adoption of the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, or 5AMLD, which brought crypto-asset exchanges and custodian wallet providers into the scope of the EU AML regime. As a result, in-scope crypto asset firms operating in the EU and the United Kingdom are now subject to the full suite of AML obligations applicable to most financial market participants, such as the need to undertake customer due diligence checks when onboarding a new client. In addition, they are required to register with the relevant national competent authorities where they intend to carry on crypto-related business.The general approach to the regulatory treatment of crypto assets has been more complicated. At an EU-wide level, the position so far has been to apply the existing regulatory framework to crypto assets that have the characteristics of regulated assets. Specific regulations such as outlawing the sale of crypto derivatives to retail investors are imposed, but more specific requirements are considered necessary.Exchanges dealing in digital assets are therefore subject to regulation if the assets traded fall within this regulatory perimeter. To a large extent, this has meant understanding the application of the existing regulatory framework and applying this to relevant circumstances, relying on interpretative guidance where necessary.As a result, two main categories of crypto assets, which function in a similar manner as regulated instruments, and their respective service providers have been brought within the scope of existing rules. These are digital assets akin to “financial instruments” (generally capturing crypto assets used as means for raising finance and derivatives), but are being treated with existing rules for tokens functioning as “electronic money.” This captures crypto assets designed to facilitate payment transactions or some stablecoins.Importantly, this means that crypto exchanges trading digital securities, such as DLT-based shares, bonds, fund units or derivatives — often referred to as security tokens — are required to obtain authorization as regulated trading venues to do business in the EU. This would also capture EU-based crypto exchanges trading particularly popular instruments, such as derivatives referencing Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies as underlying assets. This has been supplemented by jurisdictions putting in place bespoke regimes for the crypto sector, for example, clarifying aspects concerning the use of the underlying DLT technology (e.g., Luxembourg) or closing gaps in existing rules (e.g., France).In the securities space, significant steps are being made toward developing a credible digital market infrastructure for issuance, trading and settlement of digital securities. Most notably, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority has recently granted a MiFID licence to Archax Limited, which has become the first fully-authorized trading venue for digital securities in the U.K.At the same time, established exchanges are building their own “digital versions,” such as the Börse Stuttgart Digital Exchange in Germany and the SIX Digital Exchange in Switzerland. However, despite these developments, integrating digital solutions with existing market infrastructures remains challenging, not least due to constraints stemming from existing rules around settlement finality requirements in the post-trading systems.In an effort to unlock opportunities for innovation in the space, the European Commission has recently published a proposal for a pilot regime for market infrastructures based on DLT, which aims to create a bespoke legal regime for the application of DLT in post-trade services and would allow for the creation of digital securities settlement systems.Some of the largest crypto exchanges are looking to obtain regulatory licences across the world in order to be able to directly compete with incumbent financial institutions, adapt to user demand for more sophisticated services, and enhance their own credibility in the market.For example, in March 2018, the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase obtained an e-money licence from the U.K. FCA, as well as from the Central Bank of Ireland in 2019, allowing it to issue e-money and provide payment services, thereby enhancing its fiat-to-crypto services. Kraken has recently obtained a banking license from the State of Wyoming to create a special purpose depository institution (Kraken Financial), which will allow it to provide deposit-taking, custody and fiduciary services for digital assets.With a view to enhancing market integrity and investor confidence, the EU Commission put out a proposal on Sept. 23 for a regulation on markets in crypto assets, or MiCA. The draft regulation captures crypto assets such as “asset-referenced tokens” (commonly known as “stablecoins”) as well as “utility tokens.”Under the MiCA draft, crypto exchanges operating in the EU are required to obtain regulatory authorization and are subject to strict prudential and conduct requirements. In addition, the draft rules include prescriptive requirements around admission of crypto asset instruments to trading, including the requirement to publish a white paper with specified content.European Commission proposals have to go through a long legislative process before they become binding law. The MiCA however, is likely to be a significant step toward establishing credibility and structure in creating a viable crypto asset industry in the EU, which will identify the contrasting regulatory framework for security-type crypto assets and non-security-type crypto assets. For many, the process of imposing regulatory requirements at all in the pure crypto assets sector will be an anathema that stifles innovation and creates barriers to entry for smaller fintech firms. However, this is the most likely approach to establishing a long-term, viable marketplace.There is significant interest from large institutional players in entering the crypto asset space. Some of the biggest European institutions have extensive digital asset programs. As an example, ING is currently working with industry participants on a digital custody and safekeeping solution within the FCA sandbox that will provide institutional-grade security for digital holdings and transfers of digital assets. The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency recently gave the “all-clear” to U.S. banks to provide cryptocurrency custody services for their customers, a development that could put crypto asset service providers (including exchanges) in direct competition with traditional players.Going forward, the innovation, democratization and expansion of access brought about by crypto exchanges, as well as an improved financial regulatory recognition of their services, will be combined with the digitalization of traditional asset securities and development of market infrastructure for digital trading. This is likely to lead to a powerful dynamic for combinations and mergers between rapidly developing crypto exchanges and incumbent institutions. We are currently at the forefront of advising on developments in the space and welcome the significant changes undoubtedly ahead.This article was co-authored by Martin Bartlam and Marina Troullinou.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors’ alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
684,"Bitcoin (BTC) is sucking up the volume from the entire cryptocurrency market as it continues to rally. This is causing the alternative cryptocurrency (altcoin) market to pullback, which has seen rising selling pressure and low buyer demand.On Oct. 30, researchers at Santiment pinpointed the growing volume and dominance of Bitcoin, while Chainlink (LINK), Ether (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB) struggled. They wrote:At least in the foreseeable future, traders believe the so-called “altseason” is not returning, especially as Bitcoin outperforms altcoins.Historically, during bull markets, the cryptocurrency market saw Bitcoin experience a rapid uptrend first. Then, altcoins followed, after BTC surged to a local peak or an all-time high.Traders foresee a similar pattern playing out in the current price cycle, generally expecting altcoins to recover in 2021. But until BTC stabilizes and completes its rally, traders do not see a proper altcoin uptrend happening.Since Sept. 13 lows, the Bitcoin dominance index has increased from 56% to 63.4%, recording a 7.4% increase within two months.However, Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said an altseason in the first quarter of 2021 is possible. He said:The problem with altcoins is the current dynamic of the cryptocurrency market. When Bitcoin rises quickly, altcoins fall as capital cycles back into BTC. If BTC drops, then altcoins drop in tandem, putting altcoins in a precarious position.A pseudonymous trader known as “DonAlt” said he has been short Ether for several days. He said that if ETH does not recover against Bitcoin, then a broader altcoin market pullback is a possibility. The trader noted:Similarly, a trader recognized as ""CryptoCapo"" said that the technical structure of altcoins is not compelling in the near term. For traders, that makes Bitcoin more attractive, given that it has portrayed strong momentum throughout October. He emphasized:As long as the price of Bitcoin continues to surge rapidly and Ether lags behind, an altseason is highly unlikely in the near term.A strong sign of an altseason would be a consolidation of the ongoing Bitcoin rally followed by a breakout in the price of ETH.Considering that BTC/USD broke out of the $13,000 resistance level merely a week ago, technically, an Ether and altcoin market uptrend could still potentially be several months out.So far, the capital in the altcoin market still seems to be shifting towards Bitcoin, however. As Cointelegraph reported, decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, have continued to bleed volume in October. This indicates that the demand for DeFi tokens is slowing down likely due to Bitcoin's curren momentum."
685,"In the past week, altcoins prices received a significant haircut, and investors who were light on Bitcoin (BTC) saw their portfolio value take a hit. Initially, Ether (ETH) price followed Bitcoin higher as the top-ranked digital asset rallied through the $12,000 resistance but as BTC continues to slowly push higher Ether struggled to flip $400 to support.Ether’s loss of momentum and the correction in altcoins has led to a number of crypto traders tweeting that altcoin season is done and many are citing the bearish price action in the ETH/BTC pair as evidence for this point of view.Looking at the ETH/BTC weekly chart, traders will notice that the pair is on the verge of dropping below the ascending trendline and high volume VPVR node at 0.027294 sats.Losing this level opens the door for a further decline to 0.024519 sats and below this Ether is approaching yearly lows near 0.0160 sats.On the daily timeframe, we can see that losing the 0.032385 sats support thrust Ether price into the VPVR gap from 0.032385 sats to 0.029536 sats.The bleeding looks set to continue until the price reaches the 0.029536 sats level, but the current daily candle is beginning to form what looks like a double bottom and there appears to be an oversold bounce taking place as the RSI is rising from 28 on the daily timeframe.The signal line and MACD of the moving average convergence divergence indicator are still in steep decline and the absence of strong buy volume decreases the chance that short-term trend-reversal is in the making.Perhaps if Bitcoin price entered a period of consolidation for the next few days the ETH/BTC pair could recover some lost ground but this seems unlikely at the moment.The ETH/USDT pair paints something of a different picture as the pair continues to make daily higher lows and the price action is following the support and resistance trendlines of the ascending channel.The channel support rides alongside the 100-day moving average and once Ether is able to hold $400 as support $405 and $417 are the next hurdles the altcoin must overcome.The price action within ascending channels is pretty easy to track and the 4-hour chart shows the MACD converging with the signal line as the selling tapers off and the RSI is rising toward 45.Over the short-term, a move to the ascending channel midline at $400 seems probable but traders still expect this level to be stiff resistance. A bullish breakout from the ascending channel ($430) could enable Ether to chase after the $468.If Ether price drops below the 100-MA and falls from the ascending channel there is support at $353, $330, and $315. Losing these levels means traders can look for a sharper drop to $248.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

686,"As the weekend approaches, Bitcoin (BTC) price appears set to close out the month with a remarkably strong performance which has many bulls calling for a new all-time high above $20,000 in the near future. Traders attribute these lofty estimates to the fact that BTC appears to have flipped $12,000 to $12,500 to support and barring some unexpected price implosion, Bitcoin is on the path to painting a beautiful monthly candle.Further ‘bullish’ evidence comes from today’s options and futures expiry which saw $450 million of futures open interest expiring as of Oct.28.According to Cointelegraph contributor Marcel Pechman:Currently, BTC is trading above $13.5K, and the 4-hour chart shows the digital asset making higher lows and lower highs as the price pulls into a tighter range.Even as the price holds above the 20-day moving average, it wouldn’t be unexpected to see it range between $13,500 to $12,900 through the weekend and into early next week.If Bitcoin price is able to push above the pennant trendline at $13,620 and secure a 4-hour close above it, then a renewed push for a new 2020-high above $13,859 is possible.Currently, as trading volume increases, the moving average convergence divergence indicator shows the MACD has crossed above the signal line (orange) and the histogram shows an increase in momentum. The RSI is also above the midline, just reaching 60, but for the last few days, BTC has met resistance at $13,660.In the event that BTC loses its current momentum and drops from the pennant below $13,100, there is support at $12,800. Failure to hold at this level opens the door for a retest of the next support at $12,000 and below this $11,500.From a bird’s-eye-view, Bitcoin’s current price action is encouraging and the digital asset is clearly in a strong uptrend with room to run higher.The same cannot be said for altcoins which have taken an absolute pummeling throughout this week. At the time of writing Ether (ETH) price is down by 5.8% as the top altcoin struggles to reclaim $400 as support. Chainlink (LINK) has dropped 6.74% and Binance Coin (BNB has lost 6.10%.According to CoinMarketCap, the overall cryptocurrency market cap now stands at $396.6 billion and Bitcoin’s dominance rate is 63.5%."
687,"Even though the Bitcoin (BTC) hash rate has experienced a sharp decline in recent weeks, the head of research at Blockchain .com, Garrick Hileman is not concerned.Blockchain .com was founded in 2011 by dissenting members of another early crypto start up — Coinbase. It was one of the first providers of Bitcoin analytics, eventually expanding its services to include a non-custodial wallet, exchange, and crypto lending platform. The company also coined the term “hash rate” as a metric that “estimates [the] number of terahashes per second the Bitcoin network is performing.""The Bitcoin hash rate tends to be highly volatile. It dropped to the lowest point of the year — 76 million TH/s, on March 25 before setting a number of all-time highs following Bitcoin's most recent block halving. This latter trend ultimately culminated in a hash rate of 161 million TH/s on Sep 25.A month later, however, this trend reversed itself, with the hash rate dropping to 95 million TH/s on Oct 27. While the definitive cause remains unknown, some have suggested that the most recent drop was caused by the seasonal migration of Bitcoin miners in China.In a Cointelegraph interview, Hileman explained that he doesn't necessarily see the drop as a cause for concern:The hash rate has recovered slightly over the last couple of days to 107 million TH/s. It is still down on the year, having entered 2020 with 111 million Th/s. Although historically the price and hash rate have exhibited a strong correlation, the latest decline in the hash rate does not seem to have impacted the price."
688,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance has risen from about 56% in early September to above 63%. This suggests that the market participants may be rotating their investments out of altcoins to buy Bitcoin. Due to this, several altcoins have either corrected or formed a range.While legacy markets are keeping a close eye on the U.S. Presidential elections, Grayscale CEO Barry Silbert believes that Bitcoin price will gain irrespective of the result because the next President will continue to print more dollars.Using data from CoinMetrics, Twitter user Julio Moreno recently highlighted that if Bitcoin could sustain above $10,000 for four more days, it would complete 100 days above this critical level.History suggests that Bitcoin rallies vertically after it completes 100 days above a psychologically significant level. Bitcoin’s rally from $10 to $100, a 10-fold rise, took only 122 days after it had spent 100 days above $10.Similarly, a move from $100 to $1000 happened in two days, and the rally from $1,000 to $10,000 was completed in 150 days. Therefore, investors are watching to see whether Bitcoin will continue following its precedence or will it chalk a new course.Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out the path of least resistance.The long tail on the candlesticks of the past two days shows that the bulls are accumulating on dips. However, the failure to sustain Bitcoin (BTC) above $13,600 suggests that the bears are attempting to defend the overhead resistance.After the large range day on Oct. 28, the price action could be subdued for a few days as both the bulls and the bears try to gain an upper hand.However, the upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index still in the overbought zone suggests that the path of least resistance is to the upside.The bulls will again try to push the BTC/USD pair above $13,973.50 and if they succeed, the uptrend could resume.Contrary to this assumption, if the index turns down from the current levels and slips below the 20-day exponential moving average ($12,518), the trend could turn in favor of the bears.Ether (ETH) has broken below the 20-day EMA ($385) today but the bulls are attempting to defend the support at the 50-day simple moving average ($370). The uptrend line is also just below this level, hence, a bounce is likely.If the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, the ETH/USD pair may rise to the $420.50 overhead resistance. A break above this level could increase the possibility of a rally to $450 and then to $488.134.On the other hand, if the bears sink the ETH/USD pair below the uptrend line, a drop to $333 and then to $308.392 is possible.The flat moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint do not indicate an advantage to either the bulls or the bears. Hence, the pair could remain range-bound for a few days.After failing to sustain above the $0.26–$0.2295 range on Oct. 22, XRP has dropped to the support of the range. However, the long tail on the candlestick today suggests that bulls are using this dip to buy.It is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout from the range, hence, it is better to wait for the price to break above or below the range before taking a large bet.In a consolidation phase, the signals from the moving averages are choppy. The oversold levels on the RSI are considered as a buying opportunity and overbought levels are used to book profits because the expectation is that the range-bound action will continue.A trending move could be expected if the bears sink the XRP/USD pair below the $0.2295–$0.219712 support zone, while a break above $0.26 will suggest that the bulls are in command.The long wick on the candlestick on Oct. 28 shows that bulls booked profits when Bitcoin Cash (BCH) failed to rise above $280. Although the bulls purchased the dip to the 20-day EMA ($256) on Oct. 29, the price has again slipped today.The RSI has broken down from the symmetrical triangle, which suggests that the bears are attempting to make a comeback. If the bears can sink the price below the 20-day EMA, a drop to $242 is possible.This support could attract buying as the 50-day SMA ($238) is just below it. If the BCH/USD pair rebounds off this support, it could remain range-bound between $280–$242 for a few days.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the pair below the 50-day SMA, a drop to $210 could be on the cards.Chainlink (LINK) has broken below the 20-day EMA ($11.21) support and the bears are now attempting to sink the price below the 50-day SMA ($10.58). If the bears succeed, the altcoin could dip to the uptrend line.A break below the uptrend line could signal an advantage to the bears and open the gates for a possible decline to $8.38 and then $6.90.Conversely, if the rebound off the current levels or the uptrend line sustains above the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to propel the LINK/USD pair above $13.28.However, the flat moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint indicate a balance between supply and demand. This could result in a range-bound action in the short-term.The bears are currently attempting to sink and sustain Binance Coin (BNB) below the $28.43 support. If they succeed, the altcoin will complete a double top pattern that could drag the price down to the target objective of $24.86.The 20-day EMA ($29.81) has started to turn down and the RSI has plunged into negative territory, which suggests the bears have the upper hand.However, if the bulls buy the current dip and push the price back above $28.43, the BNB/USD pair could rise to the 20-day EMA where it may face resistance.If the price turns down from this resistance, it will suggest that the sentiment has turned bearish and traders are looking to sell on rallies.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push the price above $32, it will suggest that the bulls are back in control.Polkadot (DOT) plummeted back below the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern on Oct. 29. This drop has invalidated the bullish reversal pattern.The bulls are currently trying to find support close to $3.80. If this support cracks, the bears will try to break the $3.5321 support and if they succeed, the DOT/USD pair could start a downtrend that may reach $2.60.On the contrary, if the pair rebounds off the current levels, the pair may again attempt to rise above the moving averages and $4.6112. If that happens, it will suggest that the bulls are accumulating at lower levels.The reversal on Oct. 28 attracted further follow up selling on Oct. 29 and Litecoin (LTC) broke the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $54.9361. Currently, the bulls are attempting to defend the $52.36 support.If they succeed, the LTC/USD pair could consolidate between $52 and $60 for a few days. The flattening 20-day EMA ($53) and the RSI just above the halfway mark also suggest a few days of range-bound action.This assumption will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below the $52.36–$51 support. If this happens, the pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($49) and below that to $46.Bitcoin SV (BSV) broke below the 20-day EMA ($167) on Oct. 29 and that has been followed by further selling today. Currently, the altcoin has dropped to the uptrend line of the symmetrical triangle.A break below the uptrend line could drag the price down to the $146.20 support where the bulls are likely to step in and buy. A bounce off $146.20 could keep the BSV/USD pair stuck inside the range for a few more days.The flat moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory also suggest a balance between supply and demand. This view of a range formation will be invalidated if the bulls push the price above $180.63 or the bears sink the pair below $146.20.Cardano (ADA) broke below the 50-day SMA ($0.092) on Oct. 29 and the bears are currently attempting to sink the price below the $0.0893 support. If they succeed, the altcoin may drop to $0.0755701.The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.102) and the RSI below 38 indicate that bears are in command.Even if the ADA/USD pair rises from the current levels, the bears will try to sell the bounce to the 20-day EMA. If the pair turns down from this resistance, it will increase the possibility of a break below $0.0893.This bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls can push the pair above $0.1040440. Such a move will suggest accumulation at lower levels.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

689,"Tech-heavy stock market indices, including the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500, have begun to recover. Amazon posted high pandemic sales that led profits to climb threefold and reported a 37% spike in revenue. Facebook also surpassed Wall Street expectations, achieving $21.5 billion in revenue during the third quarter.Although the correlation between Bitcoin and U.S. stocks has declined in recent weeks, the probability that the rising risk-on market sentiment could buoy BTC remains high. As Kevin Svenson, a chartist at Kraken’s Cryptowatch, explained, the market direction between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 is the “same 80% of the time.”As such, Svenson hinted that correlation would likely return: “The only other week in 2020 with a lack of correlation was at the bottom of the Global Pandemic Crash when #Bitcoin rallied before the S&P500. Remember, ‘correlation’ should not be calculated by % gain or loss. We are strictly talking about market direction. Uptrend or Downtrend.”The United States stock market has entered earnings season, following weeks of stagnancy. Historically, earnings season has been a net positive for stocks, acting as a short-term catalyst. This could place Bitcoin (BTC) in a unique position because it has rallied throughout October, despite the slump of U.S. stocks. If risk-on assets begin to see some upside momentum, there is a chance it could affect BTC positively.If Bitcoin begins to show some correlation with the S&P 500 again, then the positive earnings season met with a strong performance by Big Tech could further fuel Bitcoin’s momentum. However, there is some evidence that supports the opposite.Bitcoin to remain unaffectedDenis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto exchange and broker Bequant, told Cointelegraph that earnings typically buoy the U.S. stock market, but the latest earnings season might have a small effect on the overall market sentiment. He said that the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election has become a more important macro factor, which could diminish the importance of earnings, adding:“The markets are now half way through the third quarter and despite the global slowdown in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic, so far, 85 percent of companies have beat expectations by 19 percent on average, which is well above the historic average beat of between three to five percent. However, what markets tend to focus on is not just the headline earnings data but also guidance, which, given the limited visibility amid the aforementioned pandemic, has been rather muted.”Vinokourov also emphasized that Bitcoin could pull back in the near term, noting that if Bitcoin rose in October due to the uncertainty around the election, then the post-election cycle could cause BTC to unwind. Since Oct. 1, Bitcoin has risen from $10,775 to over $13,300, peaking at $13,859 on Oct. 28.A minor pullback or consolidation phase in the short term is also likely, given that $13,875 has acted as a multiyear resistance area since 2018. Vinokourov suggested that “If one goes by the narrative that uncertainty over the elections in the U.S. was one the main upside drivers, then, by default, the resolution should result in unwind and therefore some downside.”Guy Hirsch, managing director of the U.S. region at trading platform eToro, told Cointelegraph that he does not see earnings season affecting Bitcoin in a major way. Hirsch noted that the U.S. stock market would not have a major impact on BTC:“So far, earnings season has been a net positive for the markets, with a significant number of companies beating estimates and likely limiting the total downside risk for a mass sell-off, at least for the time being. That said, the correlation between Bitcoin and equities has largely broken down over recent weeks and I am unable to see how earnings might affect BTC in the near-future.”Another metric that points toward a declining correlation between Bitcoin and U.S. stocks is the Bitcoin network-value-to-transactions, or NVT, price ratio. The NVT price calculates the value of Bitcoin based on its market price and the amount of BTC transferred on the blockchain on a daily basis. The NVT price of Bitcoin has also seen a drop in correlation with the S&P 500, as on-chain analyst Willy Woo reported.A small pullback could occur, but momentum is too strongSince achieving a peak of $13,859, the price of Bitcoin has fallen by around 4% in the past three days. The drop coincided with a decline in stablecoin inflows, which indicates lower buyer demand. In the same period, exchange inflows increased, demonstrating an intent to sell from retail investors and potentially high-net-worth individual investors.Still, Hirsch emphasized that he does not believe a drop to $12,000 is likely, as the “upside momentum” of Bitcoin is simply too strong, with fundamentals backing it up. Bitcoin has seen unexpected price swings in the past, especially during bull markets. Volumes, open interest and overall trading activity increase, raising the probability for short-term volatility spikes. Yet, Hirsch said the current uptrend of Bitcoin is different from past cycles.In the past month, PayPal integrated cryptocurrency buying and selling. That was followed by JPMorgan Chase’s comparison of Bitcoin with gold, and Avanti, a digital-asset-focused bank, receiving a banking charter. Given the rising institutional adoption of Bitcoin, high network hash rate and growing daily transaction value on the Bitcoin blockchain, Hirsch suggested a major pullback is unlikely in the near term, as “This rally is different than the 2017 ICO run up,” adding:“Should COVID continue to surge and stimulus falter in the wake of a contested US election, it would make sense for Bitcoin adoption to continue increasing (thus, driving up prices) versus BTC being sold off.”Technically, higher time frame charts of Bitcoin also portray a neutral market sentiment in the short term. The daily chart shows BTC has been hovering above the short-term 10-day moving average, despite the pullback from $13,876. As long as the price of Bitcoin remains stable above key support levels of $12,700 and $13,000, the overall technical uptrend of BTC remains intact."
690,"Two years ago, venture capitalist and noted Bitcoin investor Tim Draper publicly stated that Bitcoin will hit $250,000 by 2022. Yet, as Bitcoin continues to gain interest from investors, Draper revealed to Cointelegraph during an interview that a $250,000 price prediction may have been conservative: “I think it’ll certainly hit that. But a lot of people are thinking that $250,000 was a little too conservative."" Draper also discussed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the blockchain space, noting that tokenization will play a major role in solving problems related to global shipping and real estate. Additionally, Draper shared his thoughts on decentralized finance, or DeFi, saying he wants to “‘DeFi’ the venture capitalist business” moving forward.The full interview can be viewed on Cointelegraph’s YouTube channel.Cointelegraph: What are your thoughts on how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the blockchain space?Tim Draper: A couple of things have happened since the pandemic. Some people say it’s condensed the time for us to adopt new technologies. People are stuck in place and they’re saying, “Yeah, why don’t I try to see what VR is like for remote medicine or remote education?” Some of the things that we’ve been backing over time have gained a lot of attention during the pandemic because people haven’t been able to leave their homes.The other thing that has happened was that when the U.S. government printed $13 trillion dollars, they immediately diluted the dollar by 20 or 30%. That was a real shock to the system. People then said, “Well, wait, where do I put my money? Do I put it into gold, or do I put it into Bitcoin where it’s a great store of value?” A lot of people have said they want to move their money into Bitcoin.Another thing is that millions of people are going to die from this pandemic. But 135 million people are going to die from starvation because of the government’s reaction to the pandemic. Government lockdowns have shut off different supply chains around the world. As a result, people are starving.But whenever there’s a crisis, there’s a great opportunity to do something extraordinary. When there was a financial crisis for example, Satoshi Nakamoto came up with Bitcoin. And I think that as we’re able to put more restrictions and more accounting systems around the blockchain, we’re going to be able to use Bitcoin interchangeably with dollars.CT: Right now, the world is in the midst of a crisis. Which technological breakthrough will help humanity come out stronger on the other end? TD: Tokenization will advance. We’re seeing it in real estate, global shipping and in everything where items of value need to be moved between parties. Now, these items can be transferred over the internet, which is so useful for industries like real estate and global shipping. In the case of real estate, you could buy a piece of my house, or you could tokenize my real estate and own a piece of that property without having to buy the whole thing. Tokenization and shipping is also a great way for people to own containers to keep track of the entire Iot. I think we’re going to see some extraordinary breakthroughs in shipping and also with any kind of logistic use cases.CT: Another thing that we’re seeing is the rise of DeFi. Do you think DeFi is just a bubble or will this actually drive adoption?TD: I think that DeFi had to happen. People have been sitting on their Bitcoin or their other cryptocurrencies just watching as they appreciate in value instead of having that money being put to use. But, you want your money constantly put to use.I ultimately want to “DeFi” the venture capital business, where I raise a fund just in Bitcoin, I invest it just in Bitcoin, and the entrepreneurs pay their employees and suppliers all in Bitcoin. Then, all the accounting through that system should be on the blockchain. My relationship with the entrepreneur and my relationship with my investors can all be on a smart contract, so that if there’s a big winner, it can all be distributed into many different Bitcoin wallets. I think this will eventually happen, but right now the accounting isn’t set up. We are now seeing the early DeFi use cases, but longer term, all the accounting, the taxes, the whole thing will be done using Bitcoin.All that DeFi will then become a bridge to “ReFi” where it’s retail and we’re using this as the major currency for all of our purchases. It will just become a part of the world economy. I think this will include Bitcoin, along with four or five other cryptocurrencies.Ultimately, I think that fiat currencies will slowly go away. And I think that the governments who are saying, “Oh, I’ll do a centralized cryptocurrency that is tied to my country’s currency,” well, that defeats half the purpose. Half the purpose of doing this is that your currency is not tied to some political force. You can’t inflate against debts, and you can’t operate the way Argentina has been for 100 years. You have to operate fairly across the board. That’s the beauty of what we've got in cryptocurrency, which governments don’t have with fiat currency.CT: And are you still sticking with your prediction that Bitcoin will hit $250,000 by 2022?TD: Yes, Bitcoin will hit $250,000 by 2022 or the beginning of 2023. That $250,000 is really based on a 5% market share of currencies. I think that’s easily achievable, especially as more women start using Bitcoin, since they control 80% of retail spending. It’s really interesting that there used to be one in 15 Bitcoin wallets that women held, and now it’s advancing. As women start using those wallets, they’ll realize this is much easier. I moved as much of my money as I felt fair into Bitcoin. And so, yes, I think it’ll certainly hit that, but a lot of people are thinking that was a little too conservative."
691,"The latest findings by Santiment, published in Cointelegraph Consulting’s biweekly newsletter, show that the Bitcoin Age Consumed experienced a large uptick with the recent price increase — a sign that tokens previously dormant are on the move. The Bitcoin Age Consumed metric is found by multiplying the amount of tokens changing addresses on a certain date by the time since they last moved. It is an indicator of volatility, which often precedes a directional price shift. Over 79,955 BTC that were dormant for at least a year changed addresses on Friday, Oct. 23, pointing to a strong paradigm shift among veteran Bitcoin (BTC) traders.Bitcoin’s Mean Dollar Invested Age, or MDIA, has also experienced a marked downtrend over the past seven days, implying short-term distribution and potential profit-taking by some long-term BTC investors. Bitcoin’s MDIA has recorded similar drop-offs near its local price tops in February and September suggesting an increased risk of price volatility up ahead.The average sentiment toward Bitcoin has taken a complete u-turn amid its latest push past $13,000, shifting from predominantly bearish to overwhelmingly bullish over the previous 10 days. Last Friday, Bitcoin-related sentiment was the highest it’s been since May 12, the date of Bitcoin’s latest “halving.”On the whole, positive crowd sentiment has rarely been a friend to digital assets. Over the past two years, periods dominated by bullish chatter and FOMO typically coincided with price consolidations or upcoming market corrections — not just for Bitcoin, but Ether (ETH) and other cryptocurrencies as well.Read the full newsletter edition here to get the entire scoop, complete with detailed charts and images.Cointelegraph’s Market Insights Newsletter shares our knowledge on the fundamentals that move the digital asset market.

692,"Major private-owned Russian bank Gazprombank has received regulatory approval to launch cryptocurrency custody services through its Swiss subsidiary.According to an official announcement on Oct. 29, the bank scored approval from the country's financial regulator, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, to offer crypto custody and trading services to its institutional and corporate clients.Offerings will initially be restricted to a select group of customers with Bitcoin (BTC) as the only supported cryptocurrency. Gazprombank plans to gradually expand the offering to include additional cryptocurrencies as well as other related products and services.Gazprombank CEO Roman Abdulin said, “We expect digital assets to become increasingly important in the global economy and, in particular, for our current and potential clientele."" As a regulated entity, Gazprombank will have to comply with Swiss Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer laws and regulations, in addition to implementing its own due diligence procedures and software. Gazprombank Switzerland is a Swiss registered bank, 100% owned by Russia-based Gazprombank. The bank has been preparing to launch crypto services in Switzerland since 2018.While Russia’s banking institutions are tapping crypto markets abroad, Russia’s government is not too friendly to major cryptocurrencies at home. Earlier this month, Anatoly Aksakov — a member of the Russian State Duma and a key representative of Russia’s crypto-related legislation efforts — argued that decentralized cryptos like Bitcoin have no future."
693,"Bitcoin (BTC) has spent nearly 100 days above $10,000 — and if history repeats itself, further price gains could be astronomical.As noted by various social media users this week, as of Oct. 30, Bitcoin was just five days away from trading above $10,000 for 100 days.According to data from analytics firm CoinMetrics compiled by Twitter user Julio Moreno, after trading above certain price points specifically for 100 days, Bitcoin subsequently gained by an order of magnitude.For example, after staying above $10 for 100 days, it took just 122 days for BTC/USD to reach $100. After cracking 100 days above $100, meanwhile, $1,000 appeared in just two days.Looking at the difference between $1,000 and $10,000, the time period was longer — 150 days to crack five figures after trading at four figures for 100 days.“Bitcoin has held above $10,000 for over 90 days now, currently ~30% higher than this key level.
