0,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) abruptly dropped 4% from the day’s peak on Oct. 30 as the uncertainty in the stock market intensified. With five days left to the U.S. presidential election, Bank of America, or BofA, suggested a 20% drop is possible.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 7.55% since Oct. 12. Tech-heavy stock indices performed slightly better in the same three weeks as the Nasdaq dropped 5.8%.While the correlation between Bitcoin and stocks has declined in recent weeks, the slump of risk-on assets could negatively affect cryptocurrencies.According to BofA economists led by Michelle Meyer, the election result is not the biggest threat to equities.Rather, it is whether a contested election occurs that could cause the markets to rattle due to uncertainty. The markets could still rally regardless of who wins the election, but a contested election may lead to a market slump. The economists wrote:For Bitcoin, it is still difficult to gauge whether a potential prolonged equities dump would cause a pullback.Since Oct. 12, while U.S. stock market indices declined by 5% to 6%, Bitcoin rallied by nearly 16%. In the last 18 days, BTC rose from $11,167 to $13,290, massively outperforming gold, stocks and the U.S. dollar.But the confluence of Bitcoin facing a multiyear resistance level at $14,000 and the lack of certainty around risk-on assets could slow BTC’s momentum.In the near term, as Cointelegraph reported, $13,000 serves as a large whale cluster. This means high-net-worth buyers would likely protect $13,000 as a key support area. Since $14,000 was the previous top for Bitcoin in mid-2019, the new range would likely be found $13,000 to $13,900.If the market uncertainty persists after the election, there is a higher probability that it would place BTC in the low $13,000 region for a prolonged period, which wouldn’t necessarily be unhealthy. “A correction wouldn’t necessarily be unhealthy for the Bitcoin market at this point, as that may lead to further accumulation,” explained Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michael van de Poppe in his latest Bitcoin price technical analysis. He added: Throughout October, alternative cryptocurrencies have found themselves in an awkward position alongside rising BTC dominance. When Bitcoin increases so fast in a short period, it could hinder the altcoin market’s recovery because it creates a volume vacuum.According to researchers at Santiment, the sentiment around Bitcoin has strengthened in recent weeks and months. Consequently, the Bitcoin dominance index has consistently increased, dwarfing both major and small-cap cryptocurrencies. They said:"
1,"Almost one-quarter of Ether’s (ETH) circulating supply is held on cryptocurrency exchanges, according to analytics platform ViewBase.The website shows that 26,768,260 ETH is on exchanges, equating to 23.6% with a value of $10.3 billion. Almost 26 million of these tokens are held by 10 centralized exchanges, with Coinbase alone sitting on 8,521,807 ETH — 7.5% of the supply.Ether is miles ahead of Bitcoin (BTC) in terms of the percentage of tokens held on exchanges. Bitcoin has 8.1% of its circulating supply held on exchanges.Earlier this month, Cryptocurrency statistician Willy Woo said he believes that when the number of coins held on exchanges drop, “it’s a sign that new buyers are coming in to scoop the coins off the markets and moving them into cold storage.” As such, the relatively low share of BTC held on exchanges is “macro bullish” according to Woo.According to crypto data aggregator Glassnode, the number of Bitcoin held on exchanges has been reducing significantly for almost the entire year, falling from the all-time high of 2.97 million BTC in February to below 2.6 million yesterday.Glassnode also shows bullish signals for Bitcoin with the daily number of new addresses for Bitcoin approximately 480,000 — six times that of Ether, which has less than 80,000 new addresses created each day.Also worth noting is that the seven-day moving average of exchange net flow volume for both Bitcoin and Ether have been negative since early August. The net flow volume is the number of coins sent to exchanges minus the amount removed. This suggests that while Ether has a high percentage of coins held on exchanges compared to other coins, the overall sentiment is moving toward a bullish trend in the last few months.Glassnode does not reflect the same percentage of coins held on exchanges as ViewBase. According to Glassnode, there are less than 16.6 million ETH (14.7%) and almost 2.6 million BTC (14%) on exchanges."
2,"Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) reached all-time highs today in terms of market capitalization and number of tokens.WBTC is the most popular version of Bitcoin tokenized for use on the Ethereum network. According to the official website, there currently is a record total of 116,885 WBTC, backed by an equal number of BTC held by custodians. The market cap of WBTC now tops $1.58 billion.This makes WBTC Ethereum’s sixth-largest token by market cap, after Crypto.com Coin (CRO), USD Coin (USDC), Chainlink (LINK), BNB (BNB), and at number one, Tether USD (USDT).WBTC moved up the rankings in the past week to surpass Compound Dai (cDAI), OKB (OKB) and Bitfinex’s LEO Token (LEO). WBTC is currently the 18th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap overall.An ERC-20 token backed 1:1 by BTC reserves, Wrapped Bitcoin accounts for 80% percent of the $2 billion worth of BTC on the Ethereum network. To put the growth into perspective, in mid-September, there was only 80,000 tokenized Bitcoin, worth just under $1 billion.Although recent gains made by BTC also contribute to the rising market cap of WBTC, the primary factor propelling its sudden growth is increasing demand. WBTC is used extensively in DeFi for yield farming, especially among projects with more moderate yields. There is now more than 164,000 BTC locked up in DeFi protocols, which equates to about 0.85% of Bitcoin’s entire circulating supply.While the first Wrapped Bitcoin was minted back in January 2019, daily trading volume for the token didn’t surpass $1 million until late July of this year. Today, WBTC regularly sees trading volume above $50 million."
3,"Nine celebrities with profiles on the sponsored video-sharing platform Cameo have published messages wishing Bitcoin (BTC) a happy birthday ahead of the twelfth anniversary of the publication of its whitepaper on Oct. 31.The videos were paid for by crypto security firm Halborn, and feature Hollywood notables, musicians, and comedians including David Hasselhoff, Charlie Sheen, Carole Baskin, Charlamagne Tha God, Gilbert Gottfried, Doug Benson, Hassan Johnson, Soulja Boy, and RZA.Most of the celebrities were reading off talking points and showcased varying levels of crypto-literacy. Charlamagne Tha God questioned whether the pictures that he found upon Googling ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ actually depicted Satoshi.Charlie Sheen offered praise to Satoshi Nakamoto and expressed excitement at the chance to invest in BTC — once he finds a job of course. He admitted he has little knowledge of cryptocurrency.The Hoff made the bold pool-side claim that he invented Bitcoin:Tiger King star Carole Baskin emphasized the virtues of contact-less payments amid the coronavirus pandemic, predicting the virtual currency will be “the future.”RZA wondered if “maybe soon there will be a Wu-Tang Bitcoin.”While Oct. 31 commemorates the publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper, the network’s genesis block was not mined until Jan. 3, 2009."
4,"Bitcoin (BTC) has started to decouple from the U.S. stock market index S&P 500 according to crypto statistician Willy Woo. First signs of de-coupling behaviour spotted between BTC and stocks.

Buying from an influx of new users provides price support preventing speculators from trading the correlation downwards.

NVTP approximates a valuation for BTC with organic investor velocity on the blockchain. pic.twitter.com/AvilB9cfdDPredicting this behavior in late September, he asserted that Bitcoin will break ties with traditional markets due to an influx of new users:Referring to Network Value to Transaction Ratio (NVT), an indicator Woo introduced in 2017, the analyst said that Bitcoin’s NVT price has shown clear price support despite the S&P falling sharply over recent days.The NVT can be likened to Bitcoin’s P/E (price to earnings) ratio, however since Bitcoin has no earnings in the literal sense, Woo replaced the P/E values with network value (Bitcoin’s market cap) and daily USD on-chain transaction volume.Two days ago, Bitcoin’s NVT price (price support) crept into new all-time-highs above $11,000.Woo added that the indicators suggest Bitcoin could begin reclaiming its status as a “safe-haven” asset should stocks continue to fall:On Oct 26, Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano claimed “Bitcoin is the ultimate safe haven” and the market is proving it,” adding that Bitcoin “could not be more uncorrelated” with the stock market.Not everyone agrees that Bitcoin had any decoupling to do: analyst Scott Melker Tweeted in May that stocks and Bitcoin are “not correlated now, and they weren’t correlated before.”Early last week, crypto investor Chris Dunn suggested a negative correlation between stocks and BTC had started, prompting Woo to reiterate his stance of Bitcoin as a safe alternative to traditional assets:However, some analysts have suggested that an excessive preoccupation with the correlation between BTC and the S&P 500 could be dangerous. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe said that when things get messy, as they did in March this year, “all correlations tend to go towards 1,” adding:"
5,"In the last few days Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied within a hair of the $14,000 level and Ether (ETH) followed with a similarly strong performance but the altcoin failed to hold above the $400 physiological support. Although Ether price is below $400, data show traders are not worried about Friday’s options expiry. Investor optimism has been kept intact despite the recent decentralized finance (DeFi) lackluster performances.$80 million worth of Ether options are set to expire this Friday, but there has never been a strong argument for October. For starters, this number pales in comparison with the figures for December and March $282 million.Even when taking a more granular view, October options are somehow balanced between calls and puts. This data is a sign of an undecided market, which is neither bullish nor bearish when viewed in isolation.As the data above shows, there is roughly the same amount of call (buy) options betting on prices up to $410, as there are put (sell) options eager for lower prices. The scenario gets even more balanced after including OKEx numbers, which favors put (sell) options by 2.5K ETH.The main reason behind the interest in October options is Ethereum's upcoming ETH 2.0 upcoming staking launch. For investors willing to open leveraged bets for this event, the odds favor December to March 2021 for an outcome. This rationale is valid both for bulls and bears, therefore greatly diminishing investors appetite for short-term options.By analyzing December’s $200 million in open interest, one will obtain a better sense of how investors are positioning themselves for the upcoming Ethereum network upgrade. Bullish strategies are using this ‘event’ around 62% of these options.For those unfamiliar with the ""delta"" mentioned on those charts, this indicator comes from the options Black & Scholes pricing model. It represents the mathematical probability of Ether being above that price on the expiry date according to its volatility. For example, the current options pricing display 33% odds of the price being above $460 on December 25.Investors then compare calls and put options with similar probabilities. On a balanced market, traders should be demanding roughly the same premium for both options, with a 25% delta (odds).Whenever the market is unwilling to take downside risk, the indicator shifts negatively. On the other hand, a positive 10% delta skew indicates traders are demanding less premium (risk) for upside protection.The above chart shows a relatively steady optimism as the 25% delta skew has been hovering around -11% past two months. Although not excessive, it certainly shows how sentiment has not changed despite the recent failure to sustain a $400 support level.To further confirm whether this optimism reflects investors positions, one should analyze the Ether top traders' long-to-short exchange provided data. By reviewing the top client positions on spot, perpetual and futures contracts, exchanges can obtain a clearer view of whether traders are leaning bullish or bearish.There are occasional discrepancies in the methodologies used by different exchanges, so viewers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.As shown by the chart above, there hasn't been any relevant changes to the exchange's top trading Ether positions. The decrease seen in Huobi is more than compensated by OKEx’s increasing long exposure. Binance figures were not included as they barely moved from 1.06 earlier this month to the current 1.01 level.Ultimately, despite the 7% downturn in Ether price since last week and a relatively clear lack of appetite for short-term options, there are no bearishness signals.This is because the 25% skew options pricing indicator and crypto exchange top traders long-to-short ratios are slightly favoring bulls.Nevertheless, investors are concentrating their bets on December and March expiries, which seems to make sense as the Ethereum network faces its most massive upgrade ever.At least, for now, these traders are confident that $400 will act as a support level going forward.bRegardless of what happens during tomorrow's expiry, one should closely monitor the options 25% delta skew indicator and top traders long-to-short ratio.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

6,"All eyes are set on Bitcoin (BTC) as the digital asset continues to trek to a new 2020 high. Meanwhile, the hype around decentralized finance projects continues to die down, especially as token prices plummet. Data shows that trading volume for decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, is dropping rapidly, further signaling the decline of the DeFi sector.The recent hack of Harvest Finance saw volumes across DEXs boom for one day, especially Uniswap and Curve. According to media reporting and Harvest investors, the hacker executed a flash-loan exploit that used millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency across both Uniswap and Curve to drive down the perceived prices of Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) tokens on Harvest Finance.The attacker then bought those tokens at a discount, used them to pay back the initial flash loan, and netted a tidy profit in the process. By doing this multiple times, volumes at Uniswap were inflated.While the hack bumped daily DEX volume to just over $5 billion for the day, the anomaly was short lived, and since then, volume still seems to be on a steady decline.In the second half of October, DEXs saw the worst week in terms of trading volume since August. Weekly volume dropped from the $8 billion record in the first week of September to roughly $3 billion from Oct. 19–25. Uniswap is still leading the pack with a 56% market share of all DEX trading volume.Despite the major correction seen across DeFi assets and reduced trading volume, the total value locked has remained near record highs. Data from DeFi Pulse shows the total value locked is currently at $11.2 billion, a slight drop from the Oct. 25 all-time high at $12.46 billion.As the hype around decentralized finance recedes, Bitcoin is once again in the spotlight. Bitcoin price has soared roughly 24% since the start of October, with multiple high profile bets being made by corporate giants like Square and Paypal, the latter of which could help triple Bitcoin’s user base in the near future.Reduced trading volume for DeFi shows that traders have lost interest in, to a degree, taking profits and are returning to Bitcoin. This is further cemented by the rising volumes seen across Bitcoin derivatives products.While it’s difficult to discern the impact institutional players are having on Bitcoin price action, the recent acquisitions and surges in options and futures volumes do indicate that bulls are at play.Following PayPal’s announcement that it will add Bitcoin to its platform, the price of BTC rallied nearly 10%. On Oct. 23, Grayscale announced that a whopping $300 million of crypto assets were added in just one day, and currently, the firm holds $7.6 billion in assets under management.With investors shifting their focus back to Bitcoin, some wonder what the future holds for decentralized assets. The total value locked in DeFi has remained high, but this may change soon due to the reduced trading volumes on exchanges.Since a big part of rewards on DeFi protocols is associated with trading volumes, lower volumes will lead to lower yields for liquidity providers and further diminish investor’s interest in DeFi.According to Ilya Abugov, lead analyst at DappRadar:Despite facing some real challenges, a number of DeFi projects continue to receive strong interest from investors. On Oct. 28, Yearn.finance founder Andre Cronje released Keep3r, a decentralized job platform powered by the KPR token marketplace for technical jobs.Despite the lack of announcements, investors jumped on the opportunity to participate in the project, and traders drove the price of KPR up by 570% from $24 to $162.58. The project also saw more than $255 million in trading volume on the first day of trading.The hype around Keep3r shows that interest is still there if the right project presents itself. New projects and developments in DeFi may help generate interest in the field, and Abugov said:"
7,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) increased from $12,920 to $13,600 in four hours, recording a 5% rally. The uptrend coincides with positive developments from the European Central Bank, or ECB, and optimistic job data from the United States.Throughout the past week, BTC has continuously rallied despite negative macro factors. The U.S. stock market was in a steep decline, and the number of COVID-19 cases across the U.S. and Europe rose sharply.The perception of Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset is noticeably strengthening due to the rise in institutional demand. But when risk-on assets, such as stocks, are declining, they could place indirect pressure on BTC.As such, when stocks rally and risk-on assets thrive, the short-term outlook for the price of Bitcoin improves.On Oct. 29, there were several events that caused risk-on assets to increase. First, the ECB said it might seek a new stimulus package in December. Second, U.S. job data reflected the lowest weekly claims since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.A second stimulus package in Europe achieves two things. First, it would massively increase the appetite for risk-on assets in Europe. Simultaneously, it would place pressure on the U.S. to deliver a much-needed stimulus deal.Since U.S. President Donald Trump has made his position clear that a stimulus package will come after the election, this sets the U.S. up for a December stimulus deal.The ECB said it would consider all possibilities in ensuring the sustainability of the economy. This benefits Bitcoin, gold and stocks altogether, as evidenced by the price of BTC. The ECB said:Christine Lagarde, the president of the ECB, also emphasized that the institution acted promptly when the first wave of COVID-19 hit. Hinting that a second stimulus deal could arrive, she said:When the price of Bitcoin moved below $13,000, technical analysts said BTC is at risk of dropping to $12,700 and lower.The $13,000 level has acted as a strong support area, backed by whale clusters and large by orders. BTC defending the area indicates buyer demand is overwhelming selling pressure, as seen in the futures market.The funding rate of the Bitcoin futures market has remained negative throughout the past several days. It suggests that the majority of the derivatives market is seemingly betting against BTC.Yet, the demand for Bitcoin from the spot market is offsetting the selling pressure and defending BTC against further downside."
8,"With the recent influx of mainstream financial players into the blockchain space, how long will it take for corporate allocation of Bitcoin (BTC) to become the norm? Brian Estes, founder of investment firm Off The Chain Capital, thinks 10 years.""I think in 2029, 2030, when 90% of U.S. households and people in the United States use cryptocurrency and Bitcoin, then I think it becomes a stable part of the economy, and not just the U.S. economy, but I think the world economy,"" Estes told Cointelegraph in an interview. Estes' rationale is based on an analysis of the S-curve, a common graphical image depicting the speed and process of adoption for new technologies. ""The amount of time it takes for a new technology to go from 0% adoption to 10% adoption is the same amount of time takes it to go from 10% adoption to 90% adoption,"" Estes said. Digital asset holders make up at least 15% of the 18-and-older U.S. population, based on 2020 data from consultancy firm Cornerstone Advisors, as reported by Forbes contributor Ron Shevlin in July. Acting U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks also commented on this 15% estimate in an August interview with CNN. In 2019, only 10% of U.S. persons held crypto assets, up from 0% before Bitcoin's launch in early 2009, Estes pointed out. In April 2019, data from Blockchain Capital asserted that Bitcoin holders comprised 11% of the U.S. population. ""It took 10 years for Bitcoin to go from 0–10% adoption,"" he said. According to S-curve analysis, BTC should reach 90% adoption over the current decade. In light of 15% of U.S. folks holding crypto in 2020, Estes said: ""We're right on track to hit 90% in the year 2029.""""It's not an 'if' anymore,"" Estes said of crypto adoption, adding: In addition to MicroStrategy, Jack Dorsey's Square and billionaire Paul Tudor Jones have also placed big bets on Bitcoin in 2020."
9,"Bitcoin price has had a tremendous month as the price rallied from $10,500 to $13,800. However, in recent days, momentum is slowing amid rising coronavirus fears. Bitcoin’s (BTC) price dropped from $13,800 to $12,900 on Oct. 28, making the recent breakout a fakeout.Alongside a correction in the crypto markets, the equity and commodity markets also showed weakness. As the S&P 500 retraced 4% on Oct. 27, silver also corrected 6%. The only asset doing relatively well was the U.S. Dollar Currency Index (DXY). In other words, investors are flying toward the dollar for safety once again.The two-day chart shows an apparent resistance at the $13,500–$14,000 area, as a rejection is seen in this area. The $13,500–$14,000 area is the final big hurdle until a potential new all-time high can be hit. Many investors and traders are eying this area as crucial.The chart also shows a clear support zone ready to be tested in the coming period. This zone is marked between $11,600–$12,200. If that area holds for support, new range-bound construction can be established to start a healthy accumulation period.With the fear surrounding potential full lockdowns returning across Europe, the flight toward safety is also starting up.The first wave was there in March when the flight toward the U.S. dollar was seen as markets crashed. Through that, the DXY found a bottom and bounced upward from the 92.50-points level. Currently, it’s close to 94 points, through which the recent bounce of the DXY triggered weakness across the other markets.Bitcoin retraced heavily in recent days, but even silver showed a 6% correction in just a day.As the data shows, the correlation between Bitcoin and the DXY have become inverse since the March crash. This is also similar to the movements of gold.But what can be derived from this data is that the likelihood of further corrections for Bitcoin is increasing amid the legacy markets’ weakness and social unrest surrounding the potential lockdowns.A correction wouldn’t necessarily be unhealthy for the Bitcoin market at this point, as that may lead to further accumulation.The majority of the investors definitely want to see a straight line toward $200,000, but that’s simply not happening. At best, Bitcoin is at the start of a new cycle, through which the boring sideways part will keep recurring. Once all levels are tested, parabolic movements can occur in price discovery.A familiar concept is a breakout above the previous resistance for liquidity. After this, an immediate drop back into the range occurs. This is called a fakeout and is often seen in the markets to take liquidity.As the chart shows, a clear resistance zone is established at $13,250–$13,400 and should be broken to sustain further upward momentum. If the resistance zone can’t be cleared, the downside becomes more likely.The levels beneath the current prices are $12,700–$12,850 and $11,600–$11,800 as higher time frame zones to watch for potential support.The latter ""hell's candle"" scenario is only expected if the support zone between $12,700 and $12,850 is lost. However, such a drop would warrant massive selloffs across all crypto markets, with altcoins taking the biggest losses from such a correction on Bitcoin.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk. You should conduct your own research when making a decision."
10,"Whether it is a Democratic sweep led by Joe Biden or a Donald Trump reelection, Bitcoin () would likely thrive. Industry executives, including DCG and Grayscale CEO Barry Silbert, say both a Trump or a Biden win would buoy BTC.The optimistic stance of industry execs despite the glaring election risk comes after Grayscale’s Bitcoin study.Trump wins = brrr

Biden wins = brrr

Either way, bitcoin winsGrayscale, a major cryptocurrency investment firm with in net assets under management, released a study on Oct. 27 highlighting that the potential market for Bitcoin has significantly expanded in 2020.In 2019, Grayscale discovered that 36% of investors in the U.S. were interested in investing in Bitcoin. This year, in the U.S. are looking at Bitcoin. The study reads:The nearly 20% rise represents a substantial increase in mainstream awareness within a short period. It also coincides with the following Bitcoin’s impressive 200%+ recovery since March.The strong fundamental factors behind Bitcoin and the rapidly growing demand could offset the election risk in the fourth quarter.For instance, a particularly positive statistic that shows the clear increase in demand for Bitcoin in 2020 is the rate at which individuals interested in BTC become actual buyers.According to Grayscale, out of the individuals that expressed the intent to invest in Bitcoin, 83% purchased BTC. The researchers wrote:The higher conversion rate from interested individuals to investors is important because Bitcoin’s potential market has rapidly expanded.What’s more, the potential market in the U.S. of around 32 million investors does not include other major markets like Europe and Asia.Meanwhile, the number of investors familiar with Bitcoin has also increased noticeably. The survey found that 62% of investors are now aware of BTC, compared to just 53% in 2019. The study said:The primary reason behind the attraction of Bitcoin remains its exponential growth potential. Yet, in the eyes of institutional investors, it is also a .Bitcoin being a hedge asset against inflation and having demonstrated exponential growth potential makes it a compelling portfolio asset for both institutions and accredited investors.Consequently, the number of with a fraction of their capital or and building on top of existing positions has increased as well. The Grayscale research says:The clear spike in interest towards Bitcoin follows a continuous rise in inflows from institutional investors. As Cointelegraph reported, Grayscale on Oct. 23 as the Bitcoin price hit new yearly highs. "
11,"Simplex, a crypto-to-fiat payments provider, is adding another fiat offramp to enable its partner exchanges like Binance and Huob to sell major stablecoin Tether (USDT) to the euro.According to an Oct. 29 announcement, Simplex has rolled out new Tether (USDT) offramps across its partner network including major exchanges like Binance, OKEx and Huobi.A Simplex representative told Cointelegraph that the latest development marks the first time when the sell option is enabled for Tether on Simplex, stating:With the new crypto-to-fiat offramp, Simplex’s partner companies can immediately add the new feature for their users worldwide, the firm’s executives said. “Simplex enables anyone to sell USDT and convert it into euro — using our bank account via our partner network users can transfer those funds anywhere in the world,” the spokesperson noted.To date, Simplex’s partner network includes over 200 services including crypto exchanges, brokers and wallets. Alongside centralized crypto platforms, Simplex’s partner network also includes companies like MakerDAO — a major player in decentralized finance, or DeFi.The world’s largest stablecoin, USDT surged almost 300% in 2020 in terms of market capitalization, starting the year with a market cap of $4 billion and rising up to nearly $16 billion in October. According to an recent report by Bloomberg, Tether could surpass Ether’s (ETH) market cap by the end of 2021, becoming the second-largest crypto after Bitcoin (BTC)."
12,"Bitcoin (BTC) hit seven ounces of gold for the first time in over a year this week as the precious metal comes off all-time highs.Data from CoinGecko showed BTC/XAU returning to the pivotal 7 ounce mark on Oct. 25, continuing to edge up to press-time levels of 7.02 ounces.Despite Bitcoin losing ground after challenging $14,000, the gains against gold remained on Thursday, as the traditional safe haven felt the pressure of Coronavirus tensions and U.S. election uncertainty.The last time that BTC/XAU broke 7 ounces was in September 2019.Commenting on the latest events, quant analyst PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow family of Bitcoin price models, called the move “significant.”“It looks like #Bitcoin is getting ready to conquer a larger portion of the gold market cap,” data monitor Ecoinometrics responded on Twitter.BTC/XAU 1-year chart. Source: CoinGeckoThe sentiment echoed recent comments by Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal, who said that gold was “breaking down” against Bitcoin and that other macro assets would follow.“The next thing I'm expecting is the correlations between BTC and the dollar and BTC vs equities to break down too... let's see,” he wrote last week.Reacting to the latest price action, embattled gold bug Peter Schiff did not hold back. Despite BTC/USD staying far from its $20,000 all-time highs, in a fresh Twitter post, Schiff described the largest cryptocurrency as a “bubble.”“If you measure the size of asset bubbles based on the level of conviction buyers have in their trade, the #Bitcoin bubble is the biggest I've seen,” he claimed.Bitcoin has yet to suffer as a result of renewed uncertainty across the global economy, leading to increased claims that its correlation with traditional assets has all but disappeared.As Cointelegraph reported, correlation between BTC/USD and the S&P 500 hit zero again this week, as Bitcoin struck out on its own in its latest gains.“It could not be more uncorrelated than it is right now,” Anthony Pompliano, co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital, summarized."
13,"Cred, a United States-based cryptocurrency lending service, has officially announced the temporary suspension of operations due to an ongoing investigation.On Oct. 29, Cred executives tweeted that the company is now cooperating with law enforcement authorities to investigate a “recent fraudulent incident.”As part of the ongoing investigation, Cred suspended “all inflows and outflows of funds.” The company expects to provide an update regarding the issue within the next two weeks.Unfortunately, we are unable to comment further at this time but we will undertake to provide an update within the next 2 weeks. During this period all inflows and outflows of funds have been suspended.The news comes shortly after Uphold — a major U.S. cryptocurrency wallet and trading platform — terminated its partnership with Cred. On Oct. 25, Uphold issued an official notice claiming that the firm has “discontinued its relationship with third-party crypto lending provider Cred.” Uphold provided few details regarding the termination, stating that Uphold users will no longer be able to link their Uphold wallet to Cred.According to some Uphold users, Cred’s issues might have started earlier than that. A self-purported customer of Uphold who also uses Cred’s CredEarn program told Cointelegraph that he first faced a technical problem impeding outflows on Oct. 15. According to the user, Uphold said that the problem was caused by Cred.Shortly after Uphold “ended the relationship with Cred with no explanation,” Cred disabled user communication for all members in the Cred Telegram chat, the user claimed, stating that about $140,000 in Bitcoin (BTC) and other assets are now locked in his Cred account.When approached for comment on alleged customer issues on the platform, Cred CEO Dan Schatt said that the firm “appreciates the past partnership with Uphold and will ensure users are informed of any updates to their Cred account.” "

15,"Bitcoin (BTC) could see further downward price pressure this week as network difficulty is set to drop the most in five months.Data from data resource BTC.com estimates that difficulty will drop by 8.3% at the next automatic readjustment in four days’ time.The mining difficulty is an essential measure of the competition among miners in finding block subsidies, and by extension, the overall health of the mining sector.Automatic readjustments meanwhile fulfill an even more important function, allowing Bitcoin to sustain itself regardless of price action or other circumstances.In June, difficulty dipped 9.3% following a previous 6.3% decrease, the latter marking the culmination of miner upheaval after Bitcoin’s block subsidy halving event in May.The halving cut the block subsidy by 50%, producing a drastically different profit dynamic for miners operating on tight margins or with older equipment. The two consecutive downward adjustments opened up opportunities for less efficient miners once again, and difficulty corrected upward by almost 15% thereafter.The latest fall, meanwhile, has been attributed to the end of the so-called “hydro season” for Chinese miners. This occurs each October, when rainfall in China’s Sichuan province eases and cheaper hydroelectricity dries up, pushing up costs.The knock-on effect, coming at a time when Bitcoin tried and failed to crack $14,000 resistance for the first time in almost 18 months, may be a longer withdrawal from that essential level.As Cointelegraph reported, hardly any technical resistance levels lie between $14,000 and Bitcoin’s all-time highs of $20,000 from 2017.On Tuesday, developer Matt Odell summarized the process on Twitter:Odell was discussing another result of reduced miner activity — larger Bitcoin transaction fees, which have spiked almost 200%.After June, price action slowly fell in line with both difficulty and Bitcoin network hash rate. Thereafter, as both metrics picked up, price staged a comeback of its own, bolstering a popular theory that price follows fundamentals and, in particular, hash rate.Bitcoin 7-day average hash rate 60-day chart. Source: BlockchainZooming out, Lina Seiche, managing director of Bitcoin media outlet BTC Times, drew attention to the hash rate’s overall strength.“The #Bitcoin hash rate is up 18% since the third halving, 9,300% since the second halving, and 554,000,000% since the first halving,” she tweeted this week."
16,"Bitcoin (BTC) P2P marketplace Paxful has partnered with Spanish neobank Bnext to launch its first crypto debit card in Mexico.The partnership will allow Paxful’s Mexican customers to use their crypto funds to pay with a debit card in any national and foreign point-of-sale, or PoS, and even withdraw cash from ATMs without fees.Bnext customers will also have direct access to the P2P marketplace to buy and sell crypto. Paxful explained in the announcement that “strict banking regulations” in Mexico are encouraging people to focus on cryptocurrencies, and quoted figures from crypto exchange Bitso that revealed a growth of 342% in the crypto exchange's volume in Mexico from September 2019 to May 2020.Ray Youseff, CEO and co-founder of Paxful, called the partnership a critical step towards financial inclusion:Bnext is also the latest addition to Paxful's list of more than 300 payment methods, offering Mexican users the ability to buy and sell Bitcoin and Tether (USDT) on the marketplace.In July, Cointelegraph Spanish reported that Colombia, Argentina, and Mexico are among the six countries with the most cryptocurrency users in the world.UPDATE (October 29):  The card itself is to be issued by Bnext, though the project is endorsed by Paxful's P2P marketplace."
17,"A total of 62K Bitcoin (BTC) options are set to expire this Friday, and this is equivalent to $830 million in open interest. These massive numbers fail to reflect the fact that 58% of these options are now deemed worthless.As we approach the expiry date, call (buy) options above the current level begin to depreciate very fast. It is not worth paying $20 for the opportunity to buy BTC at $14.5K on Friday morning. Therefore, rolling options to the next month is not that helpful.With less than 48 hours to October's expiry, call (buy) options above $14.5K and above face slim odds. The same can be said for the $11.5K put (sell) options which are currently trading below $10 apiece.Deribit leads with a 70% market share of the options that are still worthy. Currently, there are $134 million worth of call (buy) options from $11.5K to $13.5K, stacked against $45.5 million in put (sell) options from $12.5K to $14.5K. Thus, bulls favor bears by a ratio of 3:1.Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) holds a 26% market share among the October BTC options that still count. The call (buy) options near the current market level totals $72 million, whereas the put (sell) is less than $1 million. This movement is not unlike past expiries as CME option traders are usually extremely bullish.Therefore, there's currently a $160 million imbalance favoring bulls on BTC option markets. This is a relevant number considering the expiry happens at a set time. OKEx and Deribit options and futures are set to expire at 8:00 AM (UTC) on October 30, and the CME a few hours later at 4:00 PM (UTC).Many traders believe that Bitcoin futures $5.4 billion open interest is also set to expire on Friday. Most of those contracts are either perpetual (inverse swap) or set for a later date.This time around, CME leads with $360 million open interest for October, but there's a catch. This notional will drastically reduce ahead of expiry as traders move their positions for upcoming months. As proof of this movement, the CME’s outstanding October open interest was cut by $130 million yesterday.No matter how big an investor’s win or loss is, rolling over the position for the next expiry is viable. Unlike options markets, futures contracts don't devalue nearing their last trading day.Futures margin is adjusted daily, meaning, the contract buyer (long) gets paid by the seller (short) when Bitcoin trades up, and the opposite happens if BTC price closes down. Both sides can benefit from rolling over their positions, as long as there's enough margin to maintain it.For professional traders, futures premium is the most useful indicator to gauge how bullish or bearish those investors are. At the time of writing, OKEx leads the remaining exchanges with $69 million set to expire on Friday, followed by Huobi's $23 million.This indicator is known as basis, and it usually ranges between a 5% to 15% annualized rate. Whenever the premium is positive, the market is characterized as being in contango. Meanwhile, levels below 5% indicate modest bearishness.A negative future contracts premium is highly unusual and is usually related to liquidity issues.As the above chart shows, investors were very bullish in August, as the 1-month futures contract traded with a 25% or higher premium. That was caused by a 30% Bitcoin hike from $9.1K to $11.9K.The basis indicator currently stands near 14%, on the verge of a very bullish zone. One must factor in that any leveraged bullish position opened in the past six months is currently gaining.Meanwhile, BTC futures open interest more than doubled to $5.4 billion from $2.6 billion back in April. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that investors are well prepared to defend the current $13K support level.Both derivatives contracts are supporting the market’s current strength. Aside from the $160 million options expiry imbalance, futures contract buyers are holding a comfortable position.Furthermore, as Bitcoin spiked from $11.3K just twelve days ago, short-sellers have been suffering and watching their balances decrease every day.As for Friday's expiry, some added volatility is to be expected as usual, but as far as the futures premium can tell, it’s unlikely that the bears will have a chance to re-establish control of the markets.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

18,"The equity markets across Europe closed deeply in the red and the U.S. markets are also witnessing intense selling pressure as investors fear a rise in COVID-19 cases could stall the fragile economic recovery. This increasingly negative sentiment has also dragged gold and Bitcoin (BTC) prices lower, while the U.S. dollar currency index has risen.In 2020, Bitcoin has largely acted as an uncorrelated asset, barring short periods of time when it has followed the S&P 500 or gold. Therefore, investors should take a longer-term view rather than panicking due to short-term volatility.A survey by Grayscale has shown that the number of investors who are familiar with Bitcoin has risen from 53% in 2019 to 62% this year. The poll also showed that about 55% of the respondents were interested in Bitcoin investment products this year, compared to 36% in 2019.With greater participation from both retail and institutional investors, the crypto markets may become less prone to manipulation and that could in turn attract more investments.When an asset enters a correction, knowing the strong support levels can help traders to make a more informed decision. Therefore, let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies in order to spot the critical levels that may attract buyers.Bitcoin (BTC) has turned down sharply from just under the critical overhead resistance of $13,973.50, which suggests profit-booking by short-term traders and likely initiation of short positions by the aggressive bears.If the price closes below $13,041.5, the BTC/USD pair would form a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern, which is a warning sign that the trend may be reversing. The first stop on the downside is the 20-day exponential moving average ($12,289).A break below this support will suggest that the bullish momentum has weakened and that could intensify selling, dragging the price to the 50-day simple moving average ($11,238)However, as the moving averages are sloping up and the relative strength index has corrected its overbought levels, the bulls are likely to buy the dips to the 20-day EMA.A strong bounce off this support will suggest that the sentiment is bullish as traders are buying on dips.The rebound off the 20-day EMA ($385) on Oct. 26 could not sustain the higher levels on Oct. 27 as the bears sold on recovery. This has dragged Ether (ETH) below the 20-day EMA today.If the bears sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, a drop to the uptrend line is likely. A break below this support could drag the ETH/USD pair to the next support at $333 and then to $308.096.However, if the price recovers from the current levels and rises above the $400–$420 resistance zone, it will signal an advantage to the bulls. Above $420, the pair could start its journey to $450 and then to $488.134.XRP continues to trade inside a range as the flat moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. If the bears can sink and sustain the price below the 50-day SMA ($0.245), the altcoin could drop to $0.2295.XRP/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewA break below the $0.2295–$0.2197 support zone could tilt the advantage in favor of the bears. However, if the price rebounds off the support zone, the XRP/USD pair could extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair rebounds off the 50-day SMA and rises above the $0.26 resistance, it will indicate that bulls are in command. Above $0.26, the pair could start an up-move that may reach $0.30.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($256) on Oct. 26 and the bulls are currently trying to propel the price above the overhead resistance at $280. If they can pull it off, the altcoin could rise to $300 and then to $326.30.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 62 suggests that the bulls are in control. However, the RSI has formed a negative divergence and a possible symmetrical triangle.If the RSI breaks above the triangle, it will increase the possibility of an up-move in the BCH/USD pair. Conversely, if the RSI breaks below the triangle, it will suggest the start of a pullback.The failure to drive the price above $280 could attract profit-booking by short-term traders. A break below the 20-day EMA ($256) will signal that the momentum has weakened.The rebound off the $11.199 support on Oct. 26 was short-lived as the bulls could not sustain the higher levels on Oct. 27. The bears have jumped on this opportunity and are currently attempting to sink Chainlink (LINK) back below $11.199.If they succeed, the LINK/USD pair could drop to the trendline. A break below the trendline could signal an advantage to the bears that may result in a fall to $8.38.On the contrary, if the pair rebounds off the current levels, the bulls will once again try to push the price above $13.28 and extend the recovery to $18.The indicators are not giving any clear signals as both moving averages have flattened out and the RSI has dropped close to the halfway mark, suggesting a balance between supply and demand.The bulls pushed Binance Coin (BNB) above the $32 resistance on Oct. 27 but could not sustain the higher levels. This shows that the bears are defending the zone between $32–$33.3888.The failure to sustain above $32 could have attracted profit booking from the short-term traders. If the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($29.94), the BNB/USD pair may drop to the 50-day SMA ($28.24).However, the trend remains up as both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory. Therefore, the bulls may attempt to buy on dips to the moving averages. The uptrend will resume on a close above $33.3888.On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA, it may increase the possibility of a deeper correction to $26 and then 22.The bulls pushed Polkadot (DOT) above the $4.6112 resistance on Oct. 26 but the sellers were in no mood to relent and they aggressively defended the overhead resistance at $5 on Oct. 27.The failure to sustain above $4.6112 has again dragged the price down to the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern.If the DOT/USD pair rebounds off this support, the bulls will again try to propel the price above $5 and reach the overhead resistance at $5.5899.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the neckline, the pair may again drop to $3.5321. A bounce off this support could keep the pair range-bound for a few days.Litecoin (LTC) bounced off the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $54.9361 on Oct. 26, which showed that the bulls were not willing to wait for lower levels to buy as they expected the uptrend to resume.Although the bulls had pushed the LTC/USD pair above $60 today, they could not sustain the higher levels. This attracted aggressive selling from short-term traders and the price again dropped to the 38.2% retracement level.If the bears can sink the pair below $54.9361, the correction may extend to $53.2915 and then to $51.However, if the pair again rebounds off $54.9361, a few days of range-bound action is possible. The pair is likely to pick up momentum after the price sustains above $60.The bulls purchased the dip to the breakout level of the symmetrical triangle on Oct. 26 but they could not push Bitcoin SV (BSV) above the $180–$185.14 overhead resistance zone on Oct. 27 and start a new uptrend.The failure to rise above the overhead resistance could have attracted selling by the short-term bulls and the aggressive bears. As a result, the BSV/USD pair has again dropped down to the 20-day EMA ($168).If the pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again attempt to propel the price above the overhead resistance zone.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the moving averages, the pair could may to the uptrend line of the triangle and then to $146.20.The long tail on the Oct. 26 candlestick shows that the bulls purchased the dip to the 50-day SMA ($0.098). However, the buyers could not build upon this strength and sustain Cardano (ADA) above the 20-day EMA ($0.103) on Oct. 27.This shows that demand dries up at higher levels. The bears pounced on this sign of weakness and resumed their selling today and have managed to sink the ADA/USD pair below the 50-day SMA.If the price sustains below this level, the next support is at $0.090 and if this support also gives way, the decline could extend to the critical support at $0.0755701.With the latest fall, the 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI has dipped into the negative zone, indicating an advantage to the bears.This bearish view will be invalidated if the pair turns around from the current levels or the immediate support and rises above $0.104044.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

19,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has increased by 36% in the last 35 days, showing a strong rally. The market sentiment has been optimistic due to rising institutional demand and the perception of BTC as an inflation hedge. But after a large uptrend, the belief that BTC may pull back has begun to increase. While a minor correction could occur, like the 4% downward trip to just under $13,000 on Oct. 28, a sizable downtrend is becoming increasingly unlikely. Bitcoin was at $13,860 at the day’s peak, which marked the top of the July 2019 rally. After hitting such a resistance area, a minor pullback is expected. Following a drop to below $13,000, BTC has quickly recovered to $13,150, demonstrating resilience.Throughout the past 11 years, Bitcoin price has moved in cycles. One of the most prominent narratives, among many others, is the block reward halving, where roughly every four years, the Bitcoin blockchain cuts in half the amount of BTC mined. The halving slows down the pace at which new BTC is created, causing its overall circulating supply to decrease over time. The year following every halving, BTC has rallied strongly, as seen in December 2017 when BTC hit $20,000, subsequent to the July 2016 halving.If a similar pattern follows, the price of Bitcoin will likely hit $20,000 in March 2021, an analyst known as Ceteris Paribus said. “For $BTC to match last cycle’s time to regain all time high, it would need to hit $20k on March 11, 2021. Would be kind of poetic for it to happen a year after (arguably) the most infamous day in bitcoin’s history.”As such, analysts anticipate the road to $20,000 in the medium term to be met with obstacles and minor corrections. But three reasons could prevent Bitcoin from seeing a big pullback in the near term.During a bull cycle, the biggest threat to an uptrend is a potential sell-off from long-time hodlers and whales. Before the sell-off happens, some on-chain indicators could show an intent to sell. The most widely used indicator to gauge seller activity is exchange inflows.When whales prepare to sell Bitcoin, they typically transfer their BTC holdings to exchanges. On some occasions, if a high-net-worth individual is dealing with extremely large BTC holdings, then they might engage in peer-to-peer trades on over-the-counter markets. But in most cases, whales use exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini and Binance. As such, when inflows to major exchanges increase, it often suggests the selling pressure on BTC might intensify.In the past month, as Bitcoin has rallied, exchange inflows have not increased substantially. Ki Young Ju, CEO of analytics firm CryptoQuant, reaffirmed on Oct. 27 that Bitcoin exchange inflows are declining. On Oct. 22, whale inflows temporarily spiked, causing concerns of heightened selling pressure. Ju noted, “Still safe from short-term $BTC dumping as well.”With no large selling pressure coming from whales on exchanges, derivatives traders have explained that the ongoing rally is spot-led, not futures-driven. This differentiation is critical because when a rally is primarily fueled by the futures market, it could raise the probability of a rapid pullback. The reason behind this tendency is the possibility of cascading liquidations.On a Bitcoin futures exchange, cryptocurrency traders place short or long positions with leverage. But that also indicates that if BTC drops 10%, the position would get liquidated and the trader would lose the base capital of $10,000. When the futures market drives the rally and a small drop rattles traders, it could cause a cascade of long futures contracts, causing the market to drop.The recent rally, however, has seen significant demand from spot and institutional markets. “Light,” a pseudonymous Bitcoin derivatives trader, said, “Market structure is distributed with no exchange monopolizing price discovery. spot is leading derivatives. make of that what you will.” The continuous increase in the trading volume of LMAX Digital, Coinbase, Bakkt and Binance demonstrates the dominance of the spot market in the recent uptrend.Lastly, the staircase rally of Bitcoin supports the argument that a large price drop has become less likely. In December 2017, Bitcoin crashed after reaching $20,000 because the uptrend occurred in a short period, so there was not enough time to establish support and resistance levels. This time, BTC is climbing a staircase, consolidating after each rally. Such a technical pattern strengthens the uptrend and uplifts the overall momentum.Still, there are two key reasons why traders anticipate a short-term Bitcoin downtrend. First, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) has been rebounding. Since alternative stores of value, including gold and Bitcoin, are priced against the dollar, the recovery of the DXY could negatively affect BTC. Second, Bitcoin market sentiment is demonstrating FOMO-level excitement — the fear of missing out — which raises concerns of an overheated rally.Bitcoin traders Michael van de Poppe and Nick Cote both emphasized that the rising DXY could be a problem for BTC in the near term. Van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and a Cointelegraph contributor, said that $12,700 remains a potential target if the DXY continues to climb:Researchers at Santiment also emphasized that the “social mood” of the Bitcoin market has been increasing quickly. Marking a positive factor in the long term, in the foreseeable future it raises the chances of an overheated rally. If so, the derivatives market could begin to get overcrowded and whales could ponder taking profit on their positions: “Overall social volume is also rising, indicating higher than normal FOMO levels.”In the last three days, the hash rate of the Bitcoin blockchain network has dropped substantially. According to data from ByteTree, miners have been selling large amounts of BTC in the past week. Analysts attribute this trend to the end of the rainy season in China, which affects the cost of electricity of Bitcoin miners. During the rainy season, miners can gain access to cheaper electricity, which allows them to mine more BTC with lower costs.There is a possibility that, as miners slow down their operations, they will sell BTC to take profit. As Cote, an on-chain analyst, said, the hashing power outflows out of China have been fast and could further accelerate in 2021. While this is a positive development for the decentralization of the hash rate, in the short term, it could affect the markets:Atop the mass exodus of miners in China, the uncertainty around how the United States presidential election will affect the global equities market is causing both American and European stocks to slump. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has decreased by 5.10% in the past five days, rattling all risk-on and risk-off markets. The DXY aside, gold, Bitcoin and stocks have all fallen in tandem in the last 24 hours, demonstrating a high level of uncertainty in the market."
20,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $13,000 on Oct. 28 shortly after hitting $13,850 at the day’s peak. Despite the 7% drop in 11 hours, however, the market sentiment remains positive for three key reasons.First, Bitcoin is still at where it was on Oct. 27, merely 24 hours ago. Second, BTC rose to $13,850, right below a multiyear resistance area at $13,873. Third, a marketwide drop was expected due to declining stablecoin inflows into exchanges.In the last two days, the price of Bitcoin rallied 8.5% from $13,783 to $13,850 on Coinbase. The move came after a month-long uptrend during which BTC rose from around $10,200 to $13,850.Now, on high time frame charts — like the daily chart, for example — BTC price is hovering above a key short-term moving average.The recent pattern of Bitcoin following up each uptrend with a consolidation phase makes the ongoing rally sustainable.The strength of the spot market over the derivatives market also indicates that the uptrend is strong and healthy. A pseudonymous trader known as “Byzantine General” said:Bitcoin peaked at around $13,900 in July 2019 across major exchanges. As Cointelegraph reported, many traders pinpointed the $13,875 level as the pivotal resistance area in the short term, partially for this reason.If BTC had continuously risen beyond $13,875 without any pullback, it would have caused the rally to become massively overheated. In the medium term, that would have raised the probability of deep pullback, or as some on-chain analysts call it, a “hell candle.”Prior to the short-term correction of Bitcoin, CryptoQuant CEO Ki-Young Ju warned that stablecoin inflows into exchanges were declining.The inflow of stablecoins is an accurate metric to gauge buyer demand because stablecoins, like Tether (USDT), account for a large portion of the cryptocurrency market’s volume.According to CoinMarketCap, the daily volume of Tether exceeds $59 billion across major exchanges. Purely in terms of daily volume, Tether is the most traded cryptocurrency in the global market. A few hours before the BTC drop occurred, Ju tweeted:The drop in stablecoin inflows might have triggered a sharp Bitcoin pullback because buyers and sellers were intensely battling over the past week. Some miners and whales were selling, while new inflows continuously offset the selling pressure."
21,"Bitcoin (BTC) retreated to $13,300 on Oct. 28 after a retest of its 2019 resistance levels was met with rejection. Cryptocurrency market overview from Coin360Data from Cointelegraph Markets, Coin360 and TradingView show volatility rising during Wednesday after BTC/USD hit $13,850.After failing to reach $14,000, uncertain conditions prevailed, culminating in a brief dip to $13,300 at press time.A subsequent rebound saw $13,400 become a focal point, with sudden upward and downward movements continuing to characterize the market.BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewWednesday saw an unusually large transaction to exchange Coinbase from an unknown wallet, a possible sign of an incoming sale involving 1,072 BTC ($14.6 million). This followed multiple large transactions for identical amounts, as well as larger ones tracked by monitoring resource Whale Alert.As Cointelegraph reported, a $1 billion transaction on Tuesday appeared to be tied to Coinbase.For analysts, however, a clear distinction was emerging between short-term price action and its longer-term implications. For some, Bitcoin had already proven its maturity as an asset, and further gains were all but guaranteed in the coming months.As Cointelegraph noted, Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal publicly stated that Bitcoin would challenge its $20,000 all-time highs within three months.Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe meanwhile highlighted the significance of overcoming $14,000 and flipping it to support. By contrast, $13,000 should now form a major support zone."
22,"The Bitcoin network has slowed down amid Bitcoin’s (BTC) new price highs, causing a large number of unconfirmed transactions.According to the mempool transaction count on Blockchain.com, the number of unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions surpassed 100,000 on Oct. 27. This is the highest number of unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions recorded since late 2017, when Bitcoin hit $20,000.The all-time high of unconfirmed transactions in the Bitcoin mempool was recorded in early December 2017, accounting for about 180,000 transactions, according to data from Blockchain.com.The high number of unconfirmed transactions comes amid Bitcoin hitting new multi-month highs. On Oct. 27, Bitcoin surpassed a $13,745 threshold, almost touching its previous peak of $13,970 recorded on June 26, 2019.Amid the bullish trend, the Bitcoin network faced some issues in its key indicators recently. On Oct. 25, Bitcoin’s hash rate — a key indicator of the health of the Bitcoin network — tumbled from 151.1 EH/s on Oct. 24 to 116.3 EH/s. As reported, some mining data aggregators link the drop in Bitcoin’s hash rate with the end of the wet season in Sichuan. Heavy rains in the region result in low hydroelectric prices for miners. However, as rivers and tributaries dry up, miners are moving to Inner Mongolia and Xinjian. "
23,"According to on-chain data from the analysts at Whalemap, $13,000 has become a support level for the price of Bitcoin (BTC). Whale clusters indicate that whales — or large BTC holders — are continuously accumulating.Whale clusters form when a large number of BTC are transferred to a new address and the BTC is unspent. This indicates that whales either bought or transferred their BTC to other whales, signifying buyer demand.A large whale cluster has emerged at the $13,000 level, which could turn into a key support level.The ongoing rally of Bitcoin has been different from previous uptrends in that it is considered to be more sustainable.Bitcoin started to rally and gain momentum from Sep. 23. Since then, it has repeated the pattern of rallying and then consolidating, establishing clear support levels.On Sep. 23, BTC initially rallied from $10,200 to $10,600, then consolidated. The rally began once again on Oct. 8 up to $11,700, then stabilized at $11,400 for a few days. Then on Oct. 19, it started to rally again.Due to the healthy rally of Bitcoin, whales have been accumulating BTC in key areas. The whale cluster at $13,000 might suggest that high-net-worth investors do not expect a massive pullback occurring in the near term.Speaking to Cointelegraph, Whalemap market analyst Andy Bohutsky explained:The $1.1 billion Bitcoin transaction on Oct. 23 was later found to be a transaction made by Xapo. Since Xapo is a cryptocurrency custodial service provider, there's a good chance that this was an over-the-counter transfer.Meanwhile, another relevant metric, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) gauges whether investors in the cryptocurrency market are taking profit on their positions.Bohutsky explained that while SOPR has been consistently volatile, it did not substantially increase when BTC surpassed $13,800.This data suggests two main things. First, investors have been taking profit regularly throughout the past month — reducing the probability of a large profit-taking pullback. Second, even at a multi-year resistance like $13,875, whales are not taking large profits. He said:"
24,"Bitcoin (BTC) has already hit an all-time high this week, according to one price measurement from popular statistician Willy Woo.In a series of tweets on Oct. 27, Woo added to his recent bullish prognoses on Bitcoin, noting that one valuation of BTC/USD was now higher than ever before.Woo was referring to Bitcoin’s network value to transactions (NVT) ratio, which aims to suggest when the Bitcoin network is overvalued compared to the actual value of transactions passing through it.As of Tuesday, Bitcoin’s “organic valuation” based on NVT had crossed $10,000 for the first time.“While we wait for BTC post an all-time-high, both on the monthly chart of $14k and the 20k prior top I'll point out that the organic valuation under NVT Price from underlying long term investors is already at an all-time-high,” Woo commented.Bitcoin NVT price chart showing all-time high. Source: Willy Woo/TwitterThe observation came as BTC price action showed no signs of bearish corrections, rising to highs of $13,850 on Oct. 28 — matching the peak of the 2019 bull run.As Cointelegraph reported, analysts continue to eye relatively little resistance between $14,000 and Bitcoin’s all-time high of $20,000. Should the $14,000 level break, they argue, the door is open to fresh highs.“In markets when all-time-highs are breached, there’s no prior history to go back on, so price discovery swings wildly upward exploring different levels as there’s no history to say ‘That’s not valid,’” Woo added.Among those sensing new all-time highs before the end of the year are Gemini exchange co-founder Tyler Winklevoss and Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal, the latter giving a maximum timeframe of early 2021 for the event to occur.At press time, Bitcoin traded at around $13,630, having momentarily fallen to $13,480 before recovering."
25,"Nevada-based cryptocurrency mining firm Marathon Patent Group has announced the purchase of 10,000 Antminer S-19 Pro ASICs as part of its plan to become the largest mining firm in North America.The publicly traded firm announced the purchase on Oct. 26, revealing plans to command an operational hash rate of 2.56 exahashes per second (EH/s) in July 2021 — equal to 1.9% of the current hashing power of the entire Bitcoin network.The firm had previously ordered 10,500 S19 Pros to bolster its existing operation of 2,560 units. With the exception of 500 miners set to arrive in November of this year, the miners will be delivered throughout the first half of 2021 — with 4,000 units scheduled to arrive in January, 6,300 in February, 4,800 in March, and then 1,800 in April, May, and June respectively.The race appears to be on for the crown of North America’s largest Bitcoin miner, with Riot Blockchain announcing the purchase of 2,500 S19 Pros earlier this month which are scheduled for deployment in DecemberUntil Marathon’s announcement, Riot Blockchain was aiming to emerge as the region’s top miner with a 2.3 EH/s hashrate targeted for June 2021 after purchasing 18,640 S-19s this year.While Riot’s current operational hash rate of 519 pentahashes per second (PH/s) currently beats out Marathon’s roughly 300 PH/s capacity, Marathon expects to overtake Riot in April 2021.Texas-based firm Layer 1 appears to have been side-tracked in its bid to claim 30% of global hash rate, with a U.S. district judge rejecting the firm’s motion to dismiss a patent infringement suit brought by tech firm Lancium.Lancium claims Layer1’s mining operations violate its patent for a system helping data centers shut down or restart in response to fluctuating electricity prices. Despite filing its patent in March 2020, Lancium claims Layer1 is using the same system under the title of “proprietary demand-response software.””We appreciate Judge Albright’s rapid denial,” said Lancium CEO, Michael McNamara, adding: “We look forward to the next phases of the case and, ultimately, to the opportunity to present our case to the jury.”Layer1 has not announced any expansion of capacity since the lawsuit was filed."
26,"Bitcoin (BTC) transaction fees have nearly tripled in three days, from $3.52 to $10.20 on average.According to crypto market data aggregator Glassnode, 22.25% of Bitcoin miners’ income is currently made up of fees, with the other 77.75% coming from block rewards. The share of fee revenues is currently the highest it has been since the plateau of the last all-time high in January 2018 — which followed fee revenues spiking to almost a 45% share during the previous month.The percentage of #Bitcoin miner revenue from fees increased to 22.25% in the past hour (24h MA).

It is the highest observed value since January 2018.

Live chart: https://t.co/hcl2opVV0B pic.twitter.com/0gTFWcbVedThe latest spike follows a jump in average daily Bitcoin fees in recent days, launching into double-figures in dollar terms for the only time except for the period between November 2017 and January 2018.Despite the share of mining revenue represented by fees tripling in the past month for Bitcoin miners, Ethereum (ETH) miners are still raking in more fees. Ethereum fees recently outpaced those generated by Bitcoin for the longest streak ever, owing to stablecoin use and the exploding decentralized finance (DeFi) sector built on the Ethereum network.After first overtaking Bitcoin on June 6, Ethereum’s fee revenue exceeded Bitcoin’s until Oct. 22, with two momentary exceptions at the end of July and the start of August.While Bitcoin momentarily reclaimed its fee dominance last week, Ethereum’s fees have again been higher since Oct. 25. As of this writing, Ethereum fees totaled $1.74 million over the past 24 hours, compared to Bitcoin’s $1.54 million, according to Messari.Vitalik Buterin’s Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-1559 has seen increased discussion recently as a potential way to reduce fees. Despite surveys indicating community support for the proposal, miners appear vehemently opposed due to the expected impact the upgrade may have on their revenues."
27,"Bitcoin cannot function as an inclusive currency for the unbanked due to its volatility, Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga said during Tuesday’s Fortune Global Forum conference. He also cited a lack of knowledge about who is behind the cryptocurrency as concerning.Banga also revealed that Mastercard has a significant patent library relating to CBDCs, which may help explain why he's so positive towards them.Asked about Bitcoin (BTC) as a potential solution to financial inclusion, Banga claimed that the cryptocurrency doesn’t fulfill the requirements for the unbanked, using a bizarre example about Coke bottles to illustrate its price volatility:He believes that if fiat currencies were to go digital they would “help with cross-border traded flows,” however, he added that “financial inclusion for individuals is a very different thing.”He has held a strong view against the opacity of cryptocurrencies for years calling any non-government mandated cryptocurrencies junk in 2017, and even comparing them to “snakes” in 2018, saying that they don’t “deserve” to be considered a medium for exchange.However, Mastercard has publicly stated it is open to state-issued digital currencies.And in 2019, Mastercard appeared to be taking a more open stance towards cryptocurrencies by being one of the founding members of Facebook’s Libra project. But in October last year, the payment provider left the project along with Visa, Stripe, and Paypal, citing a lack of transparency among the core reasons for its departure.Putting its money where its mouth is, the CEO confirmed that Mastercard has “invested a considerable amount of money” in CBDCs, adding:The CBDC sandbox released in September this year by Mastercard, Banga stated, allows for central banks and commercial banks to explore CBDCs together for use-cases like “cross-border transactions flows.” The tool simulates various types of transaction environments to let central banks evaluate CBDC use cases. It is still unclear which banks are using the tool."
28,"Bitcoin (BTC) has gained significant notoriety in the decade since its 2009 launch. Big mainstream players such as MicroStrategy have recently begun to invest large sums of money into the asset, normalizing its viability as an investment for some. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, said Bitcoin is now an obvious financial play.""On a risk-adjusted basis, BTC is an easier bet today than it has ever been,"" Novogratz said in an Oct. 27 tweet. ""It’s being de-risked daily.""Cointelegraph reached out to Novogratz for additional details, but received no response as of press time. This article will be updated accordingly should a response come in. ""Adjusted by its volatility, Bitcoin has presented the best return in one or two years against all other asset classes,"" Cointelegraph markets contributor Marcel Pechman said when asked to weigh in on Novogratz tweet. ""Few investors expect gold to rally 60%, but it never went below -8% so the Sharpe index adjusts returns based on volatility.”Although MicroStrategy bought more than $400 million worth of BTC in recent months, it is not the only mainstream giant to join the party. Square, headed up by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, purchased $50 million of Bitcoin recently, publicized on Oct. 8. After disclosing his BTC holdings in May 2020, billionaire Paul Tudor Jones compared the asset to an investment in Apple before its boom. With its mainstream involvement, including the traditional trading products being built around it, Bitcoin is much easier to gain financial exposure to today than it once was. Though it was originally designed as an alternative form of currency, Bitcoin has gained prevalence more as a store of value and investment option in recent years.""I don't think Bitcoin is going to be used as a transactional currency any time in the next five years,"" Novogratz said in an interview with Bloomberg TV, posted on Oct. 23. ""Bitcoin is being used as a store of value,"" he added. ""People are worried that the central banks around the world are debasing fiat currencies.""The U.S. government, for example, printed a massive amount of its national currency in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic; and action that could ultimately decrease the value of the American dollar as a whole.

29,"The governor of the Republic of Buryatia, Russia signed a decree allowing for the construction of a 13.6 acre data center in Southeastern Siberia. The facility will become home to a number of hi-tech activities, including a Bitcoin (BTC) mining operation.The facility will be built by BitRiver and is expected to create up to 100 local jobs. It will be equipped with the latest generation of ASIC miners and will take about a year to complete. In addition to cryptocurrency mining, the facility will be used for Big Data and the Internet of Things. The required investment is estimated at 691 million rubles or $9 million, to be provided by investors from the U.S.A., China, and Japan.Siberia is one of the more attractive places in the world for Bitcoin mining. Its abundance of natural resources translates into low electricity prices, and its cold climate means that the miners do not have to spend as much energy on cooling. Is proximity to China, the main producer of mining equipment, should also make the outfit's supply chain more efficient.It is possible that these advantages will be negated by the legal uncertainty surrounding the regulation of crypto mining in the region, however."
30,"Crypto investing firm Grayscale recently released its 2020 Bitcoin Investor Study. The report used data from a survey which digitally polled a sizable number of individuals in the U.S. between June and July. Grayscale found the majority of the surveyed people were keen on buying Bitcoin ().""In 2020, more than half (55%) of survey respondents expressed interest in Bitcoin investment products,"" Grayscale in its October 2020 report. ""This marks a significant increase from the 36% of investors who said they were interested in 2019.""The numbers in Grayscale's report come from data compiled by research company 8 Acre Perspective. The firm asked 1,000 U.S. persons about their Bitcoin investment interest, or lack thereof. The digitally polled group ranged from age 25 to 64, with minimum household earnings of $50,000 and a minimum of $10,000 of capital at their exposure for investment.Similarly, Grayscale's 2019 used data from 1,100 Americans, polled in March and April 2019 under the same monetary and age parameters. ""Among those who reported investing in Bitcoin, 83% have made investments within the last year, indicating that digital currencies are an increasingly attractive component of modern investment portfolios,"" Grayscale's 2020 report detailed. The report's findings show Bitcoin's popularity has increased in the U.S. ""Based on this year’s survey, the market of potential Bitcoin investors is 32 million strong — compared to 21 million investors just one year ago,"" the report explained.The report also noted that parties interested in BTC were similar to mainstream market participants, although those keen on Bitcoin purchases run about seven years younger, on average. Additionally, the report between interest in Bitcoin and the COVID-19 pandemic. "
31,"Cubans are finding new ways to circumvent the embargo sanctions imposed by the U.S. government back in 1962. According to an October 26 report by Cuba's AFP news agency, remittances sent from the U.S. to Cuba often pass through a clandestine network of ""crypto enthusiasts"" before being converted into Cuban pesos.Erich García, a 33-year-old programmer and local YouTuber, told AFP that anyone who wants to send remittances to the island must buy Bitcoin and send it through a Cuban crypto exchange called BitRemesas.Crypto users on the island then bid to offer recipients the best price for their coins via WhatsApp or Telegram. On average, a middleman from the network receives up to a 25% commission for their part in a risky and legally questionable operation.After a deal is reached, the counterparties agree to a time and date to complete the trade. Entities trading Cuban pesos for Bitcoin often endure long bike journeys though the Caribbean heat to finalize these transactions. Though the group appears to be informal and self-organized, thousands appear to be utilizing their services.Cointelegraph Spanish previously reported that most of the 10,000 Cubans who use Bitcoin on the island do so in secret."
32,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has surpassed $13,745 and is now en-route to the next major resistance level. Traders have suggested that $13,875 is the nex key short-term area for BTC for two major reasons.First, Bitcoin peaked at $13,970 on Jun. 26, 2019. Technically, the previous peak achieved more than a year ago still serves as an important area for sellers.Second, technical analysts say that the weekly candle chart of Bitcoin shows $13,875 as the next “logical resistance.”The major factor will be how Bitcoin price responds to tapping the highly anticipated resistance level and it is likely to pave its short-term performance until the end of 2020.In the past several days, calls for a major Bitcoin pullback have increased as the market sentiment turned euphoric.Historically, even amidst strong bull cycles, Bitcoin saw healthy corrections that further strengthened its uptrend.Edward Morra, a popular cryptocurrency trader, said he expects a reaction from the market at $13,875. The last time BTC tested that level 16 months ago, it saw a massive price drop in a short period.This time, traders do not anticipate a deep rejection but a strong reaction is expected from BTC and the wider market. Morra said:In the past week, Bitcoin has tested many key resistance levels in a short span of time. Yet, it has breached the levels with ease, consolidating above each one, and demonstrating a stable rally.For buyers, the ideal scenario for Bitcoin would be to rise above $13,875 and remain stable above it. Such a pattern would indicate a healthy reclaiming of a multi-year resistance level, which is very optimistic.There are two fundamental and macro factors that could catalyze Bitcoin’s momentum in the near term: decoupling and the dormant supply.As Bitcoin investor James O’Beirne pointed out, BTC convincingly decoupled from the U.S. stock market in October.Due to the lack of stimulus, the uncertainty surrounding the 2020 election, and the sharp rise in COVID-19 cases, the U.S. stock market has dropped steadily. At the same time, BTC has rallied strongly and the sentiment surrounding the digital asset has improved significantly.According to CoinMetrics, the dormant supply of Bitcoin held for at least 1 year has hit an all-time high. The researchers said:The confluence of positive fundamentals, macro, and technical factors, along with an optimistic high time frame technical structure, raise the probability of BTC testing $13,875 without a massive corrective movement."
33,"A survey by Grayscale Investments indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased investor appetite for Bitcoin ().The firm surveyed 1,000 U.S. consumers between the ages of 25 and 64 that were involved in personal investments of $10,000 or more in household investable assets. The survey was conducted in June-July 2020. 63% of the respondents who had invested in Bitcoin in the previous four months said that the pandemic had an impact on their decision. Moreover, 39% found Bitcoin to be more appealing because of the pandemic. Only 13% said that the events surrounding COVID-19 made the asset less desirable:This appears to support . According to the results of the survey, interest in Bitcoin as an investment appears to increase in tandem with education level. Thus, only 17% of the respondents without a degree had an interest in the asset, while 29% holders held a graduate degree."
34,"Bitcoin (BTC) price has been showing impressive strength in the previous weeks and today the price made a new 2020 high at $13,666.This momentum was made alongside weakness in the U.S. dollar and many analysts believe that as long as the dollar remains weak, Bitcoin and other safe-haven assets will do well.However, as Bitcoin shows strength, altcoins are failing to follow suit and most altcoins are selling off against BTC. Bitcoin’s dominance rate has been rising in the previous weeks and this shows that the market’s momentum is based around Bitcoin.The weekly chart shows a clear resistance zone between $13,500-$14,250 as the next big hurdle for the markets.The price of Bitcoin broke through the $11,600-$12,000 barrier as the crucial barrier for further upward movement. This breakthrough caused the price to continue rallying toward the next hurdle, which is between $13,500-$14,250.It’s not likely to anticipate an apparent breakthrough in one-go as it’s the first test of this resistance zone, but the overall weakness of the dollar is signaling that the price of Bitcoin could only run higher.The U.S. Dollar Currency Index (DXY) is currenlty showing significant weakness after the last test of the 94.6 points level was instantly rejected.This rejection caused DXY to drop down further. More importantly, since the rejection occurred on Sept. 24, Bitcoin’s price started to rally.This rally increased the price of Bitcoin by $3,000 as it rallied from $10,500 to $13,500. The correlation between DXY and Bitcoin has increased since the March crash and this is an inverse correlation.If the dollar holds the 92.50 area for support, there’s a potential likelihood of a reversal on the price of Bitcoin as well. This would mean a correction in the crypto markets, which isn’t bearish at all.The crypto total market capitalization is lagging behind Bitcoin’s strength, as BTC is the only one showing strength recently. This means that altcoins are seeing a selloff in their BTC pairings, further showing that Bitcoin is currently more robust than altcoins.Currently the total market capitalization is in a massive resistance zone, as the $400-$410 billion level is a crucial pivot.A breakthrough in this resistance zone would mean continuation to $520-$530 billion is likely to occur.A rejection here would mean a further range-bound construction, through which the $280-$300 billion areas is a significant support zone to hold.The primary pivot for Bitcoin right now is whether it can hold the $13,000-$13,200 area for support. If that area warrants support, then the recent breakout can’t be classified as deviation above the range high.However, if Bitcoin’s price fakes out above $13,500 and drops back into the range, the deviation is confirmed by a bearish retest of the $13,000-$13,200 area.If this scenario plays out the way it should, retests of $12,500 and potentially $12,000 or $11,600 are on the tables.Obviously, such a move is lining up with a potential reversal on the U.S. Dollar Currency Index and the failure of Bitcoin to breakout above $14,000.Once again, such a retest is not bearish. It’s very healthy to test previous resistance levels for support before continuation to the upside can occur.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

35,"Bitcoin (BTC) has recently seen ample interest from a number of mainstream companies and persons, such as billionaire hedge funder Paul Tudor Jones. This could be the beginning of a new wave of Bitcoin buyers, according to Brian Estes, chief investment officer and managing partner at Off The Chain Capital — an investment firm focused on blockchain and digital assets. ""I think eventually all corporate treasuries will have a small amount of their reserves in Bitcoin,"" Estes told Cointelegraph in an interview. A growing number of companies are looking to Bitcoin as part of their treasury fund equation. Two of the latest entrants to the Bitcoin ecosystem, MicroStrategy and Square, recently bought approximately $425 million and $50 million worth of BTC respectively. ""Those are two of the Fortune 1000 companies and I think there's 998 left to go,"" Estes said.Collaborating with a number of its partners, Off The Chain crunched a few numbers based on hypothetical scenarios, matching each company's presumed investment capability with possible Bitcoin purchases. ""There's $4 trillion of treasury reserves at public corporations today,"" Estes said. ""If just 1% of that moves into Bitcoin, that's $40 billion.""""The multiplier effect for every dollar that goes into Bitcoin, Bitcoin goes up somewhere between $20 and $100 in market cap,"" Estes explained. ""If there's $1 million in Bitcoin bought, the market cap of Bitcoin goes up between $20 million and $100 million.""This multiplier effect relates to the availability of funds on order books across crypto exchanges, according to Fundstrat senior research analyst and director David Grider. ""Reason you get this effect is, as in all markets, it’s the marginal liquidity at the edges that sets the price and value for the entire asset base,"" Grider told Cointelegraph.On the low end of the spectrum, multiplying the $40 billion estimate by twenty would boost Bitcoin's market cap by $800 billion, Estes speculated. This would push Bitcoin's market cap past $1 trillion, up from its current $222 billion evaluation. ""If 1% of treasury reserves from public companies go into Bitcoin, Bitcoin is a trillion-dollar market cap, on the conservative side, and it could be a $5 trillion dollar market cap if we use the 100 number,"" Estes explained. ""That doesn't count central banks and other institutions that may be coming in later on."""
36,"Colombia now has the largest number of Bitcoin (BTC) ATMs in Latin America. According to CoinATMRadar, Bogota, the nation's capital, has 34 ATMs, followed by Medellin with 11, and Bucaramanga and Cali with 4 each. Other cities with one ATM at least include Armenia, Barranquilla, Cartagena, Cúcuta, La Hormiga, and Pereira.Until recently, countries such as Venezuela and Argentina were more frequently discussed as crypto hotspots in terms of regional adoption due to factors like political and economic turmoil. Colombia has taken important steps towards regulating the nation’s crypto sphere, however, with its government approving a pilot program to test crypto transactions back in September. The pilot, which operates within a recently instituted regulatory sandbox, will run until December 31.In September, the Colombian Ministry of Information Technology and Communications, or MinTIC, released a draft of a guide calling for the public sector to adopt blockchain technology, including crypto payments.Figures released in August by Statista showed that cryptocurrency adoption had reached double digits in Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Mexico, and Chile."

39,"Bitcoin (BTC) might be in the early phase of a major new bull cycle, a key on-chain metric suggests on Oct. 27. The dominant cryptocurrency has entered the “belief zone,” which historically marked the start of explosive rallies.According to Glassnode, the last time the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) reached the belief zone was in June 2019. In the month that followed, Bitcoin rose from around $7,500 to $13,868 by over 80%.The NUPL metric essentially gauges how many Bitcoin holders are in profit or at a loss. If the metric rises, it means more investors are profitable since they purchased BTC.The researchers at Glassnode calculate NUPL by evaluating the price of Bitcoin when it enters a new address.Since a buyer needs to hold BTC in a new address, newly created addresses typically mean newly purchased BTC. The researchers explained:Currently, more than 50% of the Bitcoin market cap is represented by unrealized profits. This means the overwhelming majority of BTC holders and investors are in profit.Albeit the metric could be interpreted negatively because investors could begin to sell, historically, NUPL would have to rise much higher to signal a top. Glassnode writes:Throughout 2017, Bitcoin stayed in the belief zone for a prolonged period, compared to the 2019 rally. There is a possibility that a similarly extended accumulation phase could emerge in 2021 because of the post-halving cycle.Analysts often attribute the 2017 rally to the post-halving cycle. In July 2016, Bitcoin experienced its second-ever block reward halving. Since the halving causes the rate at which new BTC is mined, it directly impacts its supply. After a year following the halving, BTC started to rally.The latest halving occurred in May 2020. If a similar pattern ensures, BTC could continue to rally throughout 2020 until the second half of 2021.In the short term, analysts and traders expect the price of Bitcoin to pull back in a healthy consolidation phase.Researchers at Santiment said that on-chain and social metrics show concerning signs, possibly because BTC is becoming overheated. They said:Unlike the 2017 bull run, the current BTC rally has been more sustainable. It has established numerous major support and resistance levels, which decreases the chances of a massive correction."
40,"Crypto community members will likely be familiar with mantras such as “Don’t trust, verify!” or the “law of code.” Both refer to the promises of greater transparency and audibility via a technology that offers to replace fallible, corruptible powerful actors with a functional rules-based order secured through deterministic computation.The desire to dispense with the need to trust third-party actors is a mainstay with many cryptocurrency creators and users. Bitcoin (BTC), after all, was invented in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, and the abuse of authority by powerful actors and institutions continued to make itself felt throughout the Great Recession. Crypto has continued to draw in more and more enthusiasts against the backdrop of social, political and economic crises. However, a paper published by a group of researchers this August that circulated through the University of Oxford Faculty of Law’s blog on Oct. 27 argues against conceptualizing blockchain as a question of trust — or the absence of such.Instead, the paper proposes to understand blockchain as a “confidence-machine”: A technology designed to maximize the degree of confidence in the system as a means to, only indirectly, reduce the need for interpersonal trust. The paper’s argument rests on carefully parsing the distinction between trust and confidence, each of which is a complex cluster of ideas in its own right. Yet for all their internal complexity, trust and confidence, each imply a fundamentally different interpretation of the nature of the social environment. Trust, across its various definitions, presupposes an acknowledgment of risk and uncertainty: One can choose to consciously trust another agent by way of a leap of faith or commitment, or as the outcome of a rational choice, based on the calculation that it is in the interests of a third party to act in a particular way. One can also trust more tacitly, by way of routinized actions, where the backdrop of risk is less explicitly recognized. Confidence, by contrast, presupposes the predictability of systems or institutions. These predictable systems, in the case of blockchain, refer to the technological design of a protocol (i.e., one that is designed to mint a certain degree of new coins at a given interval), a repository of open-source code, and the mathematical properties of hash functions and public-private key cryptography. Blockchain systems also attempt to maximize the predictability of a network of actors’ decisions by means of game-theoretical mechanisms and economic incentives, and by the provision of a collectively auditable record of the sequence of actions in a given ecosystem.In the course of their argument, however, the authors of the paper complicate this view of confidence, which, they claim, rests on a denial that blockchain systems are irreducibly hybrid, involving both social and technical components. They make their case by exploring the real asymmetries in resources and knowledge — and therefore power — among the various actors in blockchain networks, uncovering the mixture of confidence, trust and even faith that is involved in their everyday operations. Rather than evoking an alternative, ideal scenario wherein relationships of dependency and domination could be magically eliminated, the paper concludes with an exploration of what blockchain governance, accurately understood, actually involves, and what it could evolve into if we fully acknowledge the clusters of power that inescapably shape its infrastructure."

42,"DBS, Singapore’s largest retail and commercial bank, seems to be entering the cryptocurrency space with three new offerings.According to information seen by Cointelegraph, DBS is launching cryptocurrency trading and custody as well as a platform for conducting security token offerings. A description of the offering and its components appeared briefly on DBS' website before being removed minutes later.DBS’ upcoming crypto service — the DBS Digital Exchange — will support five major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).Supported fiat currencies include the United States dollar, the Singapore dollar, the Hong Kong dollar and the Japanese yen.DBS Digital Exchange will not hold any assets itself, instead, ""all digital assets are kept at DBS Bank, which is globally recognised for its custodial services.""The DBS Digital Exchange will also allow small- and medium-sized enterprises as well as large corporations to issue security tokens.As a company regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, DBS noted that its upcoming crypto service will offer “distinct advantages such as the assurance of institutional-grade security.” The upcoming bank-backed exchange also aims to also provide robust measures to prevent fraudulent activities and maintain strict compliance with Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Financing regulations, according to the document.Despite details surfacing about the exchange earlier today, a spokesperson for DBS told Cointelegraph that the platform is still under development: "
43,"LibertyX, a major retail network of Bitcoin (BTC) ATMs in the United States, is expanding Bitcoin sales options at thousands of its ATMs.According to an Oct. 26 announcement, LibertyX has enabled a Bitcoin cashout feature at 5,000 regular ATMs across the United States. As such, consumers can now sell Bitcoin for cash at any of the participating ATMs.LibertyX CEO and co-founder Chris Yim said that previously, the firm’s software only supported Bitcoin purchases with debit cards. The latest addition allows holders to receive cash for selling their Bitcoin.Yim noted that Bitcoin has reached new yearly highs. “With the run-up in the price of Bitcoin, consumers are looking for a way to sell Bitcoin without dealing with wire or bank transfer delays,” Yim said.The Bitcoin sale feature is supported by a limited number of ATMs in the U.S. compared to Bitcoin purchases. Yim said:Bitcoin sales at ATMs come with their own fees. According to data from LibertyX’s helpdesk, the consumer fee at Bitcoin ATMs by LibertyX is 8%. Yim said that LibertyX’s BTC price is based on an index of exchanges, tracking closely to Coinbase’s consumer prices. LibertyX came under the media spotlight in October 2020 shortly after reports claimed that the Tesla Fremont Gigafactory in Nevada had an operational Bitcoin ATM. LibertyX representatives told Cointelegraph that the company enabled BTC sales and purchases at three employee-accessible ATMs at Tesla in August 2020."
44,"Bitcoin (BTC) stayed above $13,000 on Oct. 27, but one analyst is warning that the largest cryptocurrency is due for a major correction.In a tweet on Tuesday, on-chain analyst Cole Garner forecast that BTC/USD could soon end its bull run and suddenly move lower in a “Hell’s candle” event on the daily chart.Garner eyed Brave New Coin’s Bitcoin’s liquid coin index (BLX), a price calculator designed to assess at which price points liquidity should enter and exit the market, and the result was firmly bearish.After its run to $13,370 over the weekend, Bitcoin is ripe to lose investor liquidity, in line with events that followed its return to $10,000 and $12,000 this year.In each case, a certain price point triggered a sell-off, followed by a slow grind back to higher levels.“Hell candle’s coming for ya. Watch your ass,” he commented.According to Garner’s chart, the potential bottom level for the resulting price losses this time appears to be at $11,300 — a drop of 15.4% from the local high.BTC/USD chart with BLX entry and exit points highlighted. Source: Cole Garner/TwitterBitcoin has retained $13,000 as broad support for almost a week, with only brief dips below that level contrasting the general bullish market atmosphere.As Cointelegraph reported, network fundamentals have begun to trend downwards from all-time highs, something that could potentially signal a brief reshift of miner sentiment and associated price pressure.Among network participants, however, the overall sense is one of a maturing market, with hash rate still an order of magnitude higher than just two years ago. To manage risk, miners should thus turn to derivatives products dedicated to the hash rate as the industry becomes larger and more competitive.Currently researching this new format of derivative product is asset manager Fidelity, a company famous for its Bitcoin support.“We are researching and experimenting with a range of novel difficulty and hashrate derivative contracts to learn how miners can incorporate the contracts into their strategies to reduce risks associated with unexpected increases in network hashrate,” an update on the company’s website published on Monday confirms.The research and development is being undertaken by dedicated spinoff, the Fidelity Center for Applied Technology."
45,"Mining data aggregators attribute a slump in Bitcoin’s hash rate to the end of the wet season in Sichuan, resulting in many miners migrating to other jurisdictions.On Oct. 26, Thomas Heller of Bitcoin (BTC) mining blog Hashr8 reported that roughly 22 exahashes per second (EH/s) of mining power had left the Bitcoin network, coinciding with the end of the season the previous day (based on weather forecasts).Kevin Zhang of mining-focused Digital Currency Group subsidiary Foundry also estimated a 20 EH/s drop, noting the seven-day average for Bitcoin’s hashrate was 132.9 EH/s while daily hash rate concurrently tagged 112.9 EH/s.Blockchain.com estimates Bitcoin’s hash rate to have fallen from 151.1 EH/s on Oct. 24 to 116.3 EH/s the following day.The province of Sichuan is one of the world’s largest hubs for mining activity. Miners flock there to take advantage of cheap hydro-electricity during the rainy season and then just as quickly leave. The most recent data from the University of Cambridge’s Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (BECI) estimates the province represented 18.5% of global hash rate as of April 2020 — which was double the rate prior to the rainy season.Heller predicted that many miners operating in Sichuan were n relocating overseas or to the provinces of Xinjian or Inner Mongolia, which represented 30.1% and 7.7% of global hash power in April respectively.In 2018, it was estimated that 80% of Chinese miners migrate to Sichuan for rainy season from other parts of the country. CoinShares data published during December 2019 estimated Sichuan represents 54% of global mining activityHeller also shared data estimating the next Bitcoin mining difficulty adjustment at the end of this week will see a reduction of between 7.4% and 8.8%. If accurate, the event would comprise 2020’s second-largest negative adjustment after the near 16% drop that followed the ‘Black Thursday’ crash in March."
46,"Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano highlighted data from Santiment, which showed that the 30-day rolling correlation between Bitcoin (BTC) and the S&P 500 is 0. Pomp stressed that the lack of correlation shows that Bitcoin is a store of value. Along with that, Bitcoin has also outperformed most traditional asset classes such as gold, the S&P 500, crude oil, and the U.S. dollar since the sector wide crash that took place in March when coronavirus fears reached a peak.Abra Co-founder and CEO Bill Barhydt recently said that “Bitcoin is the single best investment opportunity in the world right now” and he has substantially increased his Bitcoin holdings in the past few days. After the recent purchase, about 50% of Barhydt’s total investment portfolio is now held in Bitcoin.Is Bitcoin likely to resume its uptrend or will it take a pause and consolidate for a few days before starting the next trending move? Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.The bulls are struggling to propel Bitcoin (BTC) above the $13,200–$13,343.66 resistance zone. This suggests that after the initial frenzy, buying has dried up at higher levels.The failure to sustain above $13,200 could attract profit booking by the short-term traders that may result in a pullback to the $12,460–$12,050 support zone.However, the upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index in the overbought territory, shows that the bulls are in command. Therefore, the bulls might buy the dip to the 20-day exponential moving average ($12,034).If the BTC/USD pair rebounds sharply from the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to resume the uptrend. If they succeed, a rally to $14,000 is likely.Conversely, if the bears can sink the pair below the 20-day EMA, a fall to the 50-day simple moving average ($11,109) is possible.The tight range consolidation of the past three days has resolved the downside. The bears have dragged Ether (ETH) back below $395 but the bulls are attempting to keep the price above the 20-day EMA ($383).If the ETH/USD pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA and rises above $400, it will suggest strong accumulation at lower levels. A breakout of $420 will signal the possible resumption of the uptrend.However, the 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is just above the midpoint, which suggests a balance between supply and demand.If the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the momentum has weakened. A break below the uptrend line may intensify the selling.The failure of the bulls to push XRP above the $0.26 resistance in the past few days may have attracted profit booking by the short-term traders. The altcoin has broken below the 20-day EMA ($0.249) and is currently attempting to stay above the 50-day SMA ($0.244).If the XRP/USD pair rebounds off the 50-day SMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above $0.26. If they can pull it off, the pair is likely to pick up momentum and rally to $0.30.On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA, the pair could extend its stay inside the $0.2295–$0.26 range for a few more days.The flattening moving averages and the RSI just below 50 also point to a possible range-bound action in the short-term.The failure of the bulls to propel Bitcoin Cash (BCH) above the $280 resistance attracted profit booking by the short-term traders. This selling has dragged the price down to the 20-day EMA ($252).If the BCH/USD pair rebounds sharply from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The bulls will then again try to push the price above the overhead resistance at $280.If they succeed, the rally may extend to $300 and above it to $326.30. Conversely, if bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair could drop to $242. Such a move will suggest that the pair could remain range-bound for a few more days.The RSI has formed a negative divergence, which suggests that the bullish momentum may be weakening.Chainlink (LINK) has turned down from close to $13 levels and the bears will now attempt to pull the price back below the $11.8028–$11.1990 support zone. If they succeed, it will suggest that the recent breakout of $11.8028 was a bull trap.A break below the moving averages could signal further weakness and the trend will turn in favor of the bears if the uptrend line also fails to provide support.On the other hand, if the LINK/USD pair rebounds off the $11.8028-$11.1990 support, it will suggest that the bulls are buying the dips. The bulls will then make one more attempt to propel the pair above $13.28.If they succeed, the uptrend is likely to pick up momentum with a rally to $15 and then to $17.Binance Coin (BNB) remains in an uptrend and the bulls have held the support at $29.5646 for the past four days. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 57 signals that bulls are in command.If the bulls can thrust the BNB/USD pair above the $32–$33.3888 resistance zone, the uptrend may pick up momentum. A breakout of the resistance zone increases the possibility of a retest of the all-time highs.Contrary to this assumption, the first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA ($29.68) and the pair could signal a deeper correction if it sustains below the 50-day SMA ($27.91).Polkadot (DOT) broke above the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern on Oct. 24. This bullish setup has a target objective of $5.40. The bulls are currently attempting to push and sustain the price above the overhead resistance at $4.6112.If the buyers can manage to sustain the price above $4.6112, the momentum is likely to pick up. The 20-day EMA ($4.22) has flattened out and the RSI has risen above 59, which suggests that the selling pressure has reduced.This positive view will be invalidated if the DOT/USD pair turns around from the current levels and plummets below the moving averages. Such a move will suggest that the break above the neckline was a bull trap.Litecoin (LTC) turned around from the $60 mark as traders booked profits following the sharp gains of the past few days. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 62 suggest that bulls have the upper hand.The LTC/USD pair has corrected to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $54.9361 and if this support cracks, a drop to the 50% retracement level of $53.3915 is likely.If the pair bounces from either level, it will suggest buying on dips. In such a case, the bulls will again try to resume the up-move by driving the price above $60. If they succeed, the pair could rally to $64 and then to $68.9008.This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below the breakout zone of $51–$52.36.Bitcoin SV (BSV) broke above the symmetrical triangle on Oct. 24 but the bulls could not build up on the strength and push the price above the overhead resistance at $180.63.This has resulted in profit booking that has dragged the price close to the 20-day EMA ($167). A break below the moving averages could pull the price down to the uptrend line of the triangle.On the contrary, if the BSV/USD pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above $180.63. If they are successful, a rally to $208 and then to $227 is possible.Cardano (ADA) has broken down of the support line of the rising wedge pattern and the 20-day EMA ($0.10). The bulls are currently attempting to defend the support at the 50-day SMA ($0.099).If the ADA/USD pair rebounds off the current levels, the bulls will make one more attempt to drive the price above $0.1142241.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA, a drop to $0.90 and then to $0.755701 is possible.The flat moving averages and the RSI just below 45 suggest that bears have a minor advantage.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

47,"The number of Bitcoin (BTC) whales reached a new all-time high amid last week's price ascension. On October 20, there were 2,178 Bitcoin addresses that held at least 1,000 BTC. By October 25, this number increased to 2,231. At current prices, 1,000 BTC translates to approximately $13 million.Based on this data, we can surmise that the whales control at least 2.23 million Bitcoin — a significant figure equivalent to 12% of the current supply.According to data from BitcoinCharts, these whale addresses actually control a much higher 7,902,469 BTC, or 42% of the total supply. Although we know the number of whale addresses, we do not know how many individuals or entities control them. Multiple addresses could be controlled by a single entity, or likewise a single address could be controlled by multiple parties with a multi-signature wallet.Researchers allege that approximately 1.1 billion BTC are/were controlled by Bitcoin's create and original miner, Satoshi Nakamoto. The vast majority of the coins believed to belong to Nakamoto have never been moved. We can also observe an increase in the “hodling” pattern — the percentage of Bitcoin supply that has not been moved in a while. 62% of the supply has not seen action in at least 1 year and almost one third has not changed addresses in 3 years or more.Though Bitcoin saw its highest weekly close since 2018 during the past week, most whales and hodlers do not seem to be in a rush to part with their assets."
48,"John McAfee, an eccentric millionaire, crypto enthusiast, and anti-virus expert, was recently detained in Spain on charges of U.S. tax evasion. He also faces charges arising from a series of questionable crypto promotions, from which he allegedly profited millions of dollars. Though he is currently in a Spanish prison, it did not stop him from sharing a few of his thoughts on recent developments in the crypto industry. With regard to PayPal's recent announcement, McAfee said “PayPal's acceptance of cryptocurrency signals, I believe, a new wave of cryptocurrency acceptance worldwide. Governments around the world will have to get used to cryptocurrencies.”In 2017, McAfee  boldly forecast that Bitcoin would hit $1 million within three years, though he later took back his comment in July 2020. When asked whether his view of the asset class had changed in the months since, he responded affirmatively stating “Too many people are using crypto as a way to get rich quick rather than its original intent, which is for buying and selling transactions.”“We will see very soon a new movement into using cryptocurrencies as transactions rather than as get rich quick schemes. This is why I developed the private $GHOST stablecoin.”McAfee departed from the Ghost cryptocurrency asset in August — the result of disagreements with the team. Days later, he clarified that he remained part of the network's broader privacy project. McAfee has statedly sorted things out with the Ghost team since then, based on an Oct. 17 tweet. He now oversees work on the Ghost asset once again.   “My work with $GHOST revolves entirely around our development of the world's first private stablecoin,” McAfee explained. “Version one will be a wrapped DAI. Later we will have a new stable, private blockchain. Holders of $GHOST will share all transaction fee profits for the stablecoin.”According to his correspondence, which was facilitated through his wife Mrs. Janice McAfee, he has not yet been transported to the U.S., and still resides in Barcelona. “I have not seen the full complaint or the charges against me, but I assume they are also looking into my crypto activities,” John said.McAfee and his wife have posted a number of updates via their Twitter profiles following his arrest. John evaded the U.S. authorities for quite some time due to the tax charges against him.UPDATE Oct. 27, 19:41 UTC: This article has been updated with added information."
49,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropped 3% in less than three hours as the U.S. stock market plummeted. Following the pullback, most traders are neutral or slightly bearish on the short-term trend of BTC.Traders and on-chain analysts are now pinpointing $12,500 and $11,973 as the two levels to watch for the continuation of the Bitcoin rally.The Bitcoin price dropped sharply on the day due to the confluence of major macro factors.JPMorgan said the re-election of U.S. President Donald Trump would be the most favorable outcome for the stock market. The investment bank’s analysts wrote:Given that the expectations of a Democratic sweep remain relatively high, it could have caused the markets to rattle.Atop the election risk, the U.S. recorded a new peak in daily COVID-19 cases. Alongside the fear surrounding the pandemic, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reportedly said the Trump administration is refusing the stimulus package.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged by nearly 1,000 points in a single session. As the U.S. stock market plummeted, BTC slumped, declining by around 3.4% in several hours.Despite this, technical analysts believe it is difficult to conclude that the dominant cryptocurrency will see a prolonged pullback.For now, the $12,500 support level remains a critical area for buyers to defend for three reasons. First, it is near the 10-day moving average on the daily chart of Bitcoin. Second, it is the top of the previous peak on Aug. 17, which makes it a key support level. Third, it has large whale clusters, which makes it an area of interest for high-net-worth investors.As long as BTC defends $12,500, the chances of a bullish uptrend remain high. If Bitcoin can remain above $11,973 despite the swift pullback, then the short-term outlook remains particularly bright.Researchers at Whalemap, which tracks the activity of Bitcoin whales, identified $11,973 as the level to uphold the uptrend. They said:Even if BTC tests the low $12,500 support level, traders believe that this could make a healthier uptrend for BTC.The price of Bitcoin rose by 15% since Oct. 17 with barely any pullback, demonstrating strong momentum. Following such a large rally, a consolidation phase or a short-term pullback could be beneficial for BTC. Cryptocurrency trader Scott Melker said:"
50,"Bitcoin (BTC) “could not be more uncorrelated” with the stock market, Anthony Pompliano says as data shows that BTC is leaving macro assets behind.In a series of tweets on Oct. 26, the Morgan Creek Digital co-founder, also known as “Pomp,” took critics to task over their accusations that Bitcoin was a poor store of value.Pompliano uploaded a chart from behavior analysis platform Santiment, which showed Bitcoin hitting 0 for 30-day correlation with the S&P 500.“It could not be more uncorrelated than it is right now,” he added in comments.Bitcoin vs. S&P 500 rolling correlation chart. Source: Anthony Pompliano/ TwitterContinuing, Pompliano highlighted Bitcoin beating macro asset returns since the Coronavirus crash in March this year.“So how did Bitcoin do during an economic downturn? It outperformed stocks, bonds, gold, oil, and pretty much everything else. It also has a low to no correlation over any material amount of time,” he summarized.Circling $13,150, BTC/USD has offered investors year-to-date returns of 83%, versus 24% for gold and 6% for the S&P 500, data from on-chain monitoring resource Skew confirms.For Pompliano, previous correlation between Bitcoin and these assets was merely a short-term phenomenon induced by the March events.“During liquidity crises, all asset correlations trend towards 1. This was temporary thing & happened to gold, stocks, etc.,” he wrote.Bitcoin vs. macro asset performance. Source: SkewAs Cointelegraph reported, a consensus has been building that Bitcoin is not only abandoning its correlation with stocks and others but that this will be a definitive watershed which will not be reversed.Among those promoting the idea is Willy Woo, the statistician and creator of data resource Woobull, who continues to double down on Bitcoin striking out on its own sooner rather than later.“The decoupling is upon us,” he tweeted last week."
51,"The Central Bank of Kenya, or CBK, has reportedly started discussions with international central banks to explore the possibility of entering the central bank digital currency space.CBK governor Dr. Patrick Njoroge told reporters during Georgetown's DC Fintech week that:From Dr. Njoroge's perspective, the central bank needs to keep a keen eye on the ""niche"" that private sector cryptocurrencies are vying for. The CBK governor singled out money laundering and the financing of illicit activities as a central concern for the institution. However, he seemed less convinced that the global trend is toward a truly cashless society, characterizing developments as tending to merely a ""less-cash"" environment.Dr. Njoroge's explicit reference to ongoing global research into how a CBDC could, in principle, be made available to the general public, appeared to position central bank-mandated digital currency in explicit competition with decentralized coins.The CBK governor also expressed a rather dismissive opinion of Bitcoin (BTC), characterizing it as merely a tool for speculation. While he finds the coin's underlying technology impressive, he argued it was still an invention seeking out a problem to solve. With cryptocurrency trading on the rise on the African continent, local industry entrepreneurs are readying themselves — with cautious optimism — for the likely rollout of more robust regulation. Stephany Zoo of Kenya-based exchange Bitpesa told Cointelegraph in Sept. 2020 that while there's a risk of heavy-handed intervention stifling intervention, better integration with traditional financial infrastructure could equally be a boost for the crypto space."
52,"The co-founder and CEO of major cryptocurrency company Abra is clearly bullish on Bitcoin (BTC).In an Oct. 23 tweet, Bill Barhydt, CEO of peer-to-peer payments platform Abra, claimed that he has significantly increased his Bitcoin holdings a few weeks ago. According to the CEO, Bitcoin now accounts for 50% of his total investment portfolio.Barhydt talked about his holdings on an episode of Money Talks. In an Oct. 23 YouTube live stream, Barhydt reiterated his bullish stance on Bitcoin, claiming that “Bitcoin is the single best investment opportunity in the world right now.”The executive said that Bitcoin’s scarcity is one of the biggest reasons why the cryptocurrency is the best investment option. “As the minting of new Bitcoin approaches zero in the coming years, its value versus fiat will continue to skyrocket in my opinion,” Barhydt said.During the live stream, Barhydt also touched upon stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) as well as central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. He argued that the issuance of global CBDCs like the digital yuan does not mean that central banks are going to stop printing money. “It’s the opposite, this actually makes it easier for them to continue their irresponsible behavior of simply printing money at will,” Barhydt said.Barhydt is known as one of the most prominent Bitcoin bulls. In early October 2020, Barhydt claimed that he has been bullish on BTC price since 2015. Previously, Barhydt called Bitcoin a store of value comparable to gold.The CEO's comments follow Bitcoin hitting new highs this year. On Oct. 22, Bitcoin price recorded its new 2020 high of $13,217 in the aftermath of PayPal enabling cryptocurrency purchases. Subsequently, famous Wall Street investor and billionaire Paul Tudor Jones praised Bitcoin on CNBC’s Squawk Box morning show, stating that he likes Bitcoin “even more than I did then.” The billionaire investor also claimed that holds a “small single-digit investment” in Bitcoin."
53,"Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week still at $13,000 and wholly unfazed by problems in the global economy — what’s in store next?Cointelegraph takes a look at the potential issues at stake for Bitcoin in the coming days.Last week’s announcement that payment giant PayPal would support Bitcoin and three altcoins from 2021 continues to have an impact on price action.When the news hit last week, Bitcoin abruptly surged beyond $12,500 to hit highs of $13,200, subsequently reaching $13,370 over the weekend.Reactions among veteran Bitcoiners were mixed, with some warning consumers not to let PayPal hold their cryptocurrency for them, as restrictions are already known to apply.Nonetheless, consensus remains that Bitcoin has crossed a major adoption hurdle. Even David Marcus, co-creator of Facebook’s Libra digital currency scheme which PayPal previously abandoned, was bullish.“Exciting to see more mainstream financial services players getting on the crypto bandwagon,” he tweeted on Oct. 25.His words echo forecasts by Virgin Galactic chairman, Chamath Palihapitiya, who on Thursday likewise said that Bitcoin was now not “optional” for major institutions.As Cointelegraph reported, multiple corporations have added Bitcoin to their reserves in recent weeks and months in a concerted effort to reduce exposure to fiat currency inflation.At $13,070, Bitcoin sealed its second-highest weekly close since January 2018 on Sunday and its sixth-highest ever.On a technical level, this is no mean feat — BTC/USD has beaten out long-term weekly resistance at $11,900 and also held those higher levels.Retaking and holding $12,000 has been notably absent even from Bitcoin’s most successful periods since the end of its bull market in late 2017, when it reached $20,000.In both 2019 and earlier in 2020, brief spurts above $12,000 all ended in rejection and a retreat to lower levels on weekly timeframes.BTC/USD weekly chart. Source: TradingViewThis week’s close thus provides another turning point for Bitcoin, and analysts are hopeful that its significance is genuine.Others were more conservative prior to the event, with Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe eyeing a short-term pullback.Van de Poppe said that the area just below $11,500 is essential to hold in order to maintain current trajectory.“I think this is a likely scenario, not expecting a clear breaker above $14,000 yet,” he wrote on Sunday.Across macro markets, meanwhile, the mood is decidedly less buoyant as the week begins.A combination of tightening coronavirus restrictions, moves to inflate fiat currencies by multiple central banks and U.S. election uncertainty is weighing on sentiment.Just a week before polling day, a fresh spat over Washington agreeing Coronavirus stimulus has added to market skittishness.In Europe, eyes are on the European Central Bank for an expansion of its own monetary stimulus program, already worth €1.5 trillion. The central banks of Japan and Canada are also due to announce updates on their virus response this week.“In terms of actually getting back to pre-Covid or trend growth, it could take more than a year,” Chris Chapman, portfolio manager at Manulife Investment, which has over $660 billion in assets under management, told Bloomberg on Sunday.The U.S. dollar currency index (DXY), with which Bitcoin has shown considerable inverse correlation, has begun to trend up in recent days, while stocks are starting the week on a downward slope.U.S. dollar currency index since Coronavirus crash.

Currently, it is at record highs.Estimated weekly average hash rate, meanwhile, has been sloping downwards from its own highs since Oct. 18.As of Monday, the average is 133 exahashes per second (EH/s), with the record standing at 146 EH/s.Bitcoin 7-day average hash rate 1-month chart. Source: BlockchainFor Bitcoin bulls, however, the old adage that price follows hash rate remains firmly in play. In an interview with Cointelegraph on Saturday, RT host Max Keiser showed no signs of concern.For him, price action has even higher to climb to match the hash rate levels seen recently.“The price lag vs. hash rate is due in part to the existence of shitcoins that muddy the waters,” he said.For quant analyst PlanB, however, the coming months should provide more of a shock to the system for Bitcoin market participants before a slowdown and consolidation phase begins.Creator of the stock-to-flow family of Bitcoin price models, PlanB has been wholly satisfied with Bitcoin price performance since the latest block subsidy halving in May. Price has conformed exactly to stock-to-flow’s demands, and the latest jump has proven no exception.Looking ahead, he argues that the huge supply buy-up seen last week will accelerate to a peak before dying off.“Supply shortage after the halving eats into the pool of bitcoins available for sale and leads to increasing supply/demand pressure .. until it snaps, a couple of months later,” he wrote during a Twitter conversation over the weekend.BTC/USD price chart with RSI peaks visible. Source: TradingViewA further tweet ahead of the weekly close reinforced this idea. This time, the focus was Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI).“If you were not here during 2013 or 2017 bull markets: current #bitcoin price rise is just a small taste of what's next (weekly RSI in 70-90 range),” PlanB forecast."
54,"To gain a deeper understanding of how professional investors feel about digital assets, Cointelegraph Consulting has published a 70+ page research report written by eight authors and supported by SIX Digital Exchange, BlockFi, Bitmain, Blocksize Capital, and Nexo. The Discovering Institutional Demand for Digital Assets report highlights which coins wealthy investors already own and which ones they plan to buy in the coming months. The report also covers the most popular regulated funds and structured products that are designed for investors from the traditional finance realm. The total assets under management of the 55 portfolio allocators that participated in the survey was over €719 billion, which is almost double the entire market capitalization of the digital asset market. Out of those professional investors, 36% already had blockchain-inspired assets in their portfolio either through direct investment in cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and security tokens or via funds, structured products, or futures.Out of the remaining 64% that have not yet invested, 39.29% plan to invest. This results in 36% + 25.15% = 61.15% of professional investors in the survey either already owning digital assets or planning to buy in the future.Download the full report here, complete with charts and infographics.The majority of investors with exposure to cryptographic assets were primarily interested in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Around 88% and 75% of respondents exposed to cryptocurrencies have invested in these cryptocurrencies, respectively. However, institutional investors appear to be increasingly interested in security tokens. Out of the 39.29% of investors that plan to invest in the future, security tokens were more popular than Ethereum and other alternative coins.Some investors hold cryptographic assets for speculation rather than for use as a medium of exchange. They hope to “front-run” Wall Street by buying in before bigger pockets enter the market. Putting the fear of missing out aside, there are genuine reasons to be excited about institutional investors joining the space.The sheer size of the wealth managed by professional investors like pension funds, university endowments, and insurance companies is enough to have a dramatic impact on the entire digital asset industry if they enter the market. For years, there have been rumors that institutional investors were starting to buy cryptocurrencies, and now, the most recent academic survey, as well as news of Microstrategy, Stone Ridge and Square entering crypto, provide evidence to support this.The survey was conducted during June through September 2020 by Professor Dr. Philipp Sandner from the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management’s Blockchain Center, Professor Dr. Alfred Taudes from the Vienna University of Economics and Business’ Austrian Blockchain Center, and Cointelegraph’s director of research, Demelza Hays. The report is co-published by Cointelegraph Consulting and Crypto Research Report.Cointelegraph Consulting offers bespoke research on digital assets and distributed ledger technology. Our services range from educational seminars, in-depth written reports and consulting on enterprise blockchain implementation strategies.

55,"A big Bitcoin (BTC) volatility spike could occur by the month’s end as two major factors come into play. The BTC options market nears a massive $750 million expiration and the CME futures market’s open interest has also soared.When an options expiry nears, holders of options contracts have to adjust their contracts before or right after the expiration. Often times, that could cause volatility in the price of Bitcoin.It is difficult to gauge the volatility coming from Bitcoin options until one to two days before the actual expiration. But, the upcoming expiration, which would occur on the last Friday of the month, coincides with other important dates.According to the CME Bitcoin futures calendar, the October futures contract expires on Oct. 30. All CME monthly Bitcoin futures contracts expire on the last Friday of each month.The upcoming expiry of CME Bitcoin futures contracts is particularly important because of its high open interest.As Cointelegraph reported last week, the CME became the second-biggest Bitcoin futures market by open interest, overtaking Binance Futures and other major exchanges.Since CME tailors to accredited investors and institutions, the CME Bitcoin futures market surpassing major cryptocurrency exchanges carries various significance. Most notably, it indicates that the demand for BTC from institutions has never been this high before.The term open interest refers to the total amount of long and short contracts open in the market. Hence, if open interest is high nearing expiration, it could trigger large volatility.Atop the highly-anticipated options and futures expirations, Bitcoin also looks ahead at an important monthly close.On Oct. 26, upon its weekly candle close, Bitcoin officially marked its first completed weekly candle above $13,000 since January 2018.If BTC stays above $13,000 into November, it would confirm its first monthly candle close above $13,000 in nearly three years.Researchers from Skew said, the ""organic"" nature of the ongoing Bitcoin rally might raise the chances for a prolonged uptrend. As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin options are pricing in a 7% chance of BTC hitting $20K in the next two months.Whether the expected increase in volatility would aid BTC or fuel a sharp rejection depends on BTC’s momentum.If the price of Bitcoin can stay above $13,000 until the monthly close, it would increase the chances of a rally continuation over a pullback.Technical analysts, including the psuedonymous trader Bitcoin Jack, state that the current technical structure of Bitcoin is bullish. The trader said:The continuous increase in the price of Bitcoin, despite on-chain data hinting at a miner sell-off, also shows new demand is flowing into the market.The selling pressure from existing players, miners and investors is being offset by new capital that is entering the cryptocurrency market.After the last options expiry on Sep. 25, the price of Bitcoin rose from $10,686 to $11,720 in the following 16 days. At the time, Cointelegraph reported that volatility may result from the September options' expiration."
56,"Harvest Finance, a major decentralized finance protocol, has seemingly issued a $100,000 bounty in the aftermath of a $24 millon attack targeting its liquidity pools.In an Oct. 26 tweet, Harvest Finance said that there is enough data so far to identify the attacker, “who is well-known in the crypto community.”In addition to the BTC addresses which hold the funds, there is now a significant amount of personally identifiable information on the attacker, who is well-known in the crypto community.

We are putting out a 100k bounty for the first person or team to reach out to the attackerHarvest Finance’s $100,000 bounty comes shortly after the protocol was apparently hacked earlier today, with an attacker reportedly exploiting about $24 million from Harvest Finance pools and swapping for renBTC (rBTC). Harvest Finance subsequently confirmed the hack, claiming that the protocol is “working actively on the issue of mitigating the economic attack on the Stablecoin and BTC pools.”The attacker subsequently sent back about $2.5 million to the deployer in the form of Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). “This will be distributed to the affected depositors pro-rata using a snapshot,” Harvest Finance tweeted.In a joint effort with Ren Protocol, Harvest Finance managed to identify Bitcoin addresses where the funds were transferred. Harvest Finance’s representatives subsequently asked major exchanges including Binance and Coinbase to freeze the allegedly stolen funds.At the time of publication, Harvest Finance’s FARM token tumbled about 60% over the past 24 hours. Total value locked in the Harvest protocol also dropped heavily from above $1 billion on Oct. 25 to about $570 million, according to data from DeFi Pulse."
57,"Those new to investing might think that professional traders spend the majority of their time staring at screens day and night in order to analyze the markets and pick the best trades but this could not be farther away from the truth.Having a good eye isn’t what differentiates top traders from average ones, it’s the application of tried and tested strategies that give pro traders the ability to stay net positive over long periods of time. Today we will discuss how the futures carry trade, funding rate, and use of trailing stops are used by top traders.Each of these simple strategies do not involve proprietary trading bots or a substantial margin deposit, meaning an investor does not need a massive trading balance to generate profits.The crypto markets are known for their whipsaw price action which involves many assets rising or falling by double to triple digits within a 1 hour to 24 hour period.Investors are drawn to the possibility of capturing stellar returns so it might sound crazy to suggest seeking just a 2% monthly gain on cryptocurrencies.Why would an investor engage in such a ‘low yield’ strategy? The answer is compound interest. If a trader can achieve 2% per month, their yearly gain equals 27%.Few traders would be able to match this return consistently by trying to guess market tops and bottoms. Thus, having more reliable gains relieves one from the stress of potential losses and the almost impossible task of trying to time the market.One great strategy called the carry trade consists of buying a cryptocurrency on traditional markets and selling its fixed-month calendar futures.This rate can be measured by analyzing the basis indicator, a metric also referred to as the futures markets annualized premium.This is not a permanent trade as the basis indicator oscillates depending on how bullish investors are. Usually, there is a stronger opportunity in altcoins as there is less competition for those.Viewing the chart above, take notice of how Ether’s (ETH) basis touched the 20% annualized level in mid-August. But, there's a catch.The devil always lies in the details, and this is one of those cases. This trade will only work if the cryptocurrency deposited as margin is the same one being shorted via futures. Some derivatives exchanges will only let you deposit Bitcoin (BTC) or Tether (USDT) as collateral.One important thing investors must remember is that unlike perpetual futures (inverse swaps), fixed-calendar futures contracts have a set expiry date. Hence, one needs to sell the spot position at the moment of futures contract liquidation.Other non-directional trades include options strategies which usually involve multiple expiries and futures contracts.One example, which is less risky is to exploit and trade the funding rate. Perpetual contracts (inverse swaps) will charge either longs or shorts, depending on the leverage imbalance. Those exchanges inform an estimate for the next funding window, usually every 8 hours.When this rate goes up, professional traders will short futures contracts and simultaneously buy it on spot exchanges. Thus, their risk is fully hedged, collecting the funding rate and reverting the trade right afterward.Sometimes, in the market there are not many risk averse trading strategies available. In situations like these, even professional traders might consider taking a directional risk. What sets them apart from novice traders is the use of automated trading.Most traders know how to use stop-loss, which's a good thing, but that's not what creates winning opportunities. The same tool can be used to initiate trades, especially if using a trailing stop.In the above example, this trailing stop buy (long) has an activation price of $12,900. Thus, while the market remains trading above that level, this order remains dormant.Once Bitcoin reaches that level, it will only buy after a 0.8% bounce (callback rate). Hence, it will automatically buy as soon as Bitcoin rises $103 from its lows.This strategy is one that is frequently used by professional traders to automate their investing process and it significantly reduces the need to check prices 24-hours a day.Practice and master those three strategies: futures carry trade, profiting from the funding rate, and buying using trailing stops. Focus on learning non-directional trading and options strategies and free yourself from guessing market tops and bottoms.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

58,"Hot on the heels of Paypal’s crypto adoption, JPMorgan’s Global Markets Strategy division released a report detailing how Bitcoin (BTC) could offer “considerable” upside “if it competes more intensely with gold as an 'alternative' currency.”According to the analysts, the three reasons for their long-term bullish view on Bitcoin are the large valuation gap between Bitcoin and gold, the growing utility of cryptocurrencies, and millennials preferring Bitcoin over gold in the long-term.This report shows that institutions are gradually realizing the huge potential of cryptocurrencies and are willing to take a U-turn on their previous apprehensions.Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz said that PayPal’s decision on crypto could force other big banks to consider ways to engage with digital assets. ""We are going to see, over the next 10 years, a rebuilding of the financial infrastructure of this country,"" Novogratz added in an interview with CNBC.On similar lines, in a recent interview with Peter McCormack, Gemini crypto exchange founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss reiterated their bullish Bitcoin stance, explaining that they expect BTC to eventually reach $500,000.The twins believe that if big Fortune 100 or 500 companies and central banks start buying Bitcoin for their treasury reserves, Bitcoin’s price could soar.At the moment investors are wondering if Bitcoin can build upon the current bullish momentum and continue its journey northward.Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies to find out if Bitcoin and altcoins will move higher.Bitcoin (BTC) is in an uptrend and the price has been sustaining above the breakout level of $12,460 for the past few days. The rising 20-day exponential moving average ($11,938) and the relative strength index in the overbought zone suggest that bulls are in command.The bulls had pushed the price above $13,214 today but they could not sustain the higher levels. This suggests that the bears have not yet thrown in the towel and are defending the $13,200 level.However, as the trend is up, the bulls are likely to buy on dips to the breakout level of $12,460. Even if this support cracks, the bulls may again step in and buy at the 20-day EMA.If the BTC/USD pair rebounds off either level, the bulls will once again try to push and sustain the price above $13,214. If they succeed, a rally to $14,000 could be on the cards.This positive view will be negated if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that the current breakout was a bear trap.The bears thwarted an attempt by the bulls to extend the uptrend today when they did not allow the bulls to sustain the price above $13,214. The sellers dragged the price down to theimmediate support at the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart.The bulls are currently attempting to keep the price above the 20-EMA but the bearish divergence on the RSI suggests that the momentum may be weakening.A break below the 20-day EMA could result in a retest of $12,460, while a strong rebound off the current levels could resume the uptrend.Ether (ETH) broke above the $308–$396 range on Oct. 22, which suggests that the bulls have overpowered the bears. Although bears have stalled the up-move at $420, they have not been able to pull the price back below $396.This suggests that the bulls are buying on dips to $400. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($383) and the RSI above 59 also indicate that bulls have the upper hand.If the bulls can push the price above $421, the ETH/USD pair could start a rally that may challenge the Sep. 1 highs at $488.134.This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair back below $396 and the 20-day EMA at $383. Such a move could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days.The pair has formed a flag pattern following the breakout above $400. The long tail on the retest of the breakout level suggests that bulls are accumulating at lower levels. A breakout above the flag will signal the possible start of a new uptrend.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the flag, a drop to the $396–$400 zone is likely. If the pair once again rebounds off this support, the bulls will try to resume the uptrend. Conversely, the trend will favor the bears if the $388 support cracks.Although XRP has not yet started an uptrend, it has formed a possible inverse head and shoulders pattern that will complete when the price breaks out and closes above the overhead resistance at $0.26.If that happens, the XRP/USD pair could pick up momentum and rally to $0.30. A sequence of higher highs and higher lows since the Sep. 23 lows indicate a minor advantage to the bulls.If the pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA ($0.249) or the uptrend line, the bulls will try to drive the price above $0.26.This positive view will be negated if the bears sink the price below the uptrend line. Such a move could result in a drop to $0.228409.The failure of the pair to sustain above $0.26 could have resulted in the liquidation of long positions that pulled the price below the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart.Currently, the flattish 20-EMA and the RSI near the midpoint suggests a balance between supply and demand.A breakout of $0.2635 could tilt the advantage in favor of the bulls while a break below the uptrend line may signal an upper hand to the bears.Litecoin (LTC) completed an inverse head and shoulders pattern when it broke out and closed above the overhead resistance at $51.50 on Oct. 21. This setup has a target objective of $61.50 and if this level is crossed, the up-move may extend to $64.The rising 20-day EMA ($51.30) and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest that bulls have the upper hand.Usually, after the breakout of a reversal pattern, the price dips to retest the breakout level. In this case, such a move could drag the price down to $51.50. If the price rebounds off this level, it suggests that the breakout is valid.However, if the bears sink the LTC/USD pair below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest a lack of demand at higher levels. Therefore, it is a good strategy to wait for a rebound from a strong support before buying rather than enter on the way down.The 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart is sloping up and the bulls have been buying the dip to this support in the past few days. This suggests that the sentiment is positive and the bulls view dips as a buying opportunity.The RSI has been trading near the overbought zone, which also suggests that bulls are in control. A break below the 20-EMA will be the first sign that the momentum may be weakening. Such a move could result in a drop to $53 and then to $51.50.Stellar Lumens (XLM) has repeatedly risen above the overhead resistance at $0.084584 in the past few days but the bulls have not been able to capitalize on the move and start a new uptrend. This suggests that the bears are defending this resistance.However, the upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.080) and the RSI in the positive territory suggests that bulls have the upper hand.If the bulls can propel the price above the $0.084584–$0.087753 resistance, the XLM/USD pair will complete a rounding bottom pattern. This reversal setup has a target objective of $0.102327.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls have squandered their advantage.The pair broke below the support line of the triangle but the bears have not been able to capitalize on this move. The bulls are currently attempting to push the price back inside the triangle.If they succeed, the pair could rally to the resistance line of the triangle. A breakout and close above the triangle might begin a new uptrend.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sustain the price below the support line of the triangle, the sentiment could weaken and the pair may drop to $0.079 and lower.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

59,"In a time of global crisis, a pandemic, and a generally unstable political and social environment, cryptocurrencies have shown remarkable stability. Moreover, the pandemic-induced economic downturn played into the hands of the industry by not only attracting professional cryptocurrency traders but also reviving mining as a way of generating passive income. It is not surprising that countries experiencing difficult political and economic situations have witnessed a boom in the purchase of GPU cards in recent months. In the region of Abkhazia, where all crypto activities have been illegal since 2018, citizens spent more than $500,000 on mining equipment over a period of six months.Another factor that has worked to further popularize mining is strong crypto prices. Bitcoin (BTC) has risen by almost a third, while Ether (ETH), the most popular currency for mining, has added $150 to its price and the decentralized frenzy has meant that gas fees have reached unprecedented levels.So, here’s how to design a cryptocurrency rig — and an exploration of whether it needs to be done at all, given all the associated risks.A cryptocurrency mining rig consists of a computer that has many graphics cards but no monitor. Computer cases are filled with GPU cards, a power-generating unit, a motherboard and a cooling system. If a monitor is connected, it can become a regular computer where a user can open a browser or play their favorite video game.The rig is connected to the internet, and thus, the blockchain network. The network operates by itself to conduct monetary transactions using the power of the graphics cards. To be more specific, a mining rig consists of:Another important detail is the frame for the rig. It is better to make a frame out of wood or aluminum. The size of the mining rig will be slightly larger than its frame due to protruding parts, adapters and a cooling system. For example, a seven-GPU rig will be approximately 21 inches wide (53 centimeters), 12 inches deep (30 centimeters) and 12 inches high (30 centimeters).After purchasing all the components of the rig, it’s time to design it, which is a rather easy task for a person who has experience with computer hardware. Additionally, there are plenty of guides on YouTube.When a rig is ready, all that needs to be done is to install some software — i.e., to choose a program for mining the currency of preference. Another way is to find a mining pool, which is a popular way to mine, as it’s becoming harder to do so individually due to the rising complexity of crypto mining. There are also some tools available such as TeamViewer, for remote control, and WatchDog, which automatically restarts the system if the program freezes.As a rule, one rig should include four to seven video cards — it’s a number that will not go beyond the framework of a stable operation, although there are exceptions. Miners can connect 10 to 15 GPU cards to one motherboard, but seven is the optimal number because Microsoft’s Windows 10 operating system can detect only this number of cards. But there is a solution: specialized mining software based on the Linux kernel. In that case, the key is to choose the right motherboard, such as an ASRock Pro BTC+ series or similar.Determining which GPU cards are best for mining is not so straightforward, as the answer depends only on the amount of money that the miner has. In general, it makes little sense to buy the most expensive, powerful GPUs for the price of two to three slightly weaker ones, as there is a greater chance the cheaper ones will bring more benefits due to their low power consumption and initial cost.The highest income in mining is currently achieved with Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti and AMD Radeon VII cards, but it is more profitable to build a mining farm with AMD Radeon RX 580 and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Super cards, as they will pay off much faster.Related: The top crypto-mining graphics cards to get a big bang for your buckIt should also be kept in mind that AMD RX series GPU cards can be flashed by changing the working time of the RAM, downvolting the core and overclocking. Programs such as MSI Afterburner and Sapphire TriXX can assist in making these manipulations, which will help GPU cards achieve maximum performance during the mining process.In over 10 years, the mining industry has turned from something incomprehensible and rather cheap to a professional, high-tech venture that implies high barriers of entry, not only for the equipment but also for its maintenance.After purchasing mining equipment, paying the cost of electricity during its operation becomes the main expense that directly affects profitability. The energy consumption of one mining rig consists of the following components:So, how can a miner reduce the cost of electricity? The main consumers of electricity are the GPU cards, and with the right settings, electricity consumption during mining can be reduced significantly. For example, when mining Ether, the main thing is to overclock the video memory. The most optimal operating mode for GPU cards is setting the core voltage to about 830 to 850 millivolts for AMD cards and 650 to 850 millivolts for Nvidia cards. Lowering the voltage on the core of the card, in addition to reducing power consumption, decreases the amount of heat, which has a beneficial effect on the equipment.Power-generating units can also use less power if they have a “gold” certificate, which means they save a large amount of electricity (about 15%) compared with power units that lack them. Another way is to change HDDs to solid-state drives, which will increase the speed of loading the operating system and reduce the power consumption of each rig by five to 15 watts. Furthermore, modern RAM (DDR4 or DDR3L instead of DDR3) and processors can reduce consumption by another 10 to 20 watts.A miner can also reduce consumption through slightly more complicated ways too, such as finding more economical electricity tariffs — for example, installing the rigs where there are reduced tariffs for consumers with electric stoves or electric heating and lower night-time prices. If possible, miners can even reach out to a power plant that generates electricity to find out if it has surplus capacity. Some miners can create their own solar or wind farms and use them for mining, but not everyone can afford such an investment.Keeping in mind the unstable situation in the economy, some may want to join the crypto mining community but cannot due to the high initial costs associated. Here’s where “hosted mining” can come into play, whereby cryptocurrencies are mined through a remote connection to equipment that has been rented out. Philip Salter, head of operations at Genesis Mining — a hosted mining provider — told Cointelegraph:Hosted mining starts with a user choosing a provider of computational capacity. Then they enter into agreements with the company to connect to its equipment. After paying for computer capacity, miners are provided with access to remote mining of cryptocurrencies through rented equipment. So, users only need a computer and a fast internet connection to operate. Hosted mining commissions are charged in accordance with the agreements established between the parties.This type of mining has a number of advantages, such as not requiring start-up capital, not needing to connect equipment by yourself, no costs of maintenance and electricity, the ability to disconnect from work at any time, and not needing special technical knowledge and skills.There are also risks in cloud mining, primarily because, like any young industry, many rogue actors seek to take over the funds of ignorant users. So, when choosing a platform, users should spend time and carefully study its history and reviews.Also, hosted mining brings in lower income compared with mining using one’s own equipment. Nevertheless, this is a possible option for those who really want to get involved in mining because, in any case, no one will give up an opportunity for passive income, even if it’s not too significant.In summary, it can be said that today, mining seems to be an attractive way to make some income. If for some reason hosted mining is inconvenient, then setting up a personal rig is not too difficult. This will require an initial investment and a little time to figure out how the system operates.Randy Ready, CEO and chief technology officer of Mining Rig Rentals — a hardware mining rental platform — believes that building your own system certainly is more interesting, adding: “I suggest going with a small rig and potentially going larger once you are familiar with mining and have a stable profit.”Disclaimer.

60,"Three factors likely triggered a quick decline in the price of Bitcoin (BTC) on Oct. 25. First, traders pinpoint the $13,300 to $13,500 area as a major resistance range. Second, futures and options markets are neutralizing. Third, weekend trading is seemingly amplifying volatility.Before the sudden price drop occurred, BTC soared from $13,127 to $13,350. The dominant cryptocurrency rallied swiftly to an area of interest for sellers as more miners moved BTC to exchanges.Throughout the past week, data from ByteTree shows Bitcoin miners have been selling more than they mine.BTC possibly saw a sharp correction as it surged to a key resistance range, which sellers aggressively defended.Some technical analysts anticipated the price of Bitcoin to rise to around $13,500 before seeing a pullback. Before the volatile price action occurred, cryptocurrency trader Cantering Clark said:After the week-long rally, the futures market started to show signs of overheating. Although the funding rate of BTC remained at an average 0.01% level, alternative cryptocurrencies demonstrated high funding rates.The overall cryptocurrency futures market needed pullback to reset or cool down the funding rates of top cryptocurrencies. The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index is also showing ""extreme greed"" in the market, which makes a healthy pullback a positive trend for BTC.Meanwhile, the options market also faces expiration worth $750 million in about six days that could trigger volatility.During the weekend, particularly on a Sunday, the volatility of Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market tends to increase.There are many potential factors that could cause volatile price movements to occur. Two main factors are lower the volume during the weekend and the anticipation of the Sunday weekly candle close.If the price of Bitcoin stays over $12,000 in the next 15 hours, it would mark the first weekly candle close above $12,000 since January 2018.As such, while BTC continues to see high volatility, the optimism surrounding its high time frame log charts are buoying the general market sentiment.One popular technical analyst known as ""Squeeze"" emphasized that the macro view of Bitcoin remains optimistic, particularly as exchange BTC balances continue to drop reducing available supply. He said:"
61,"The previous week has been tremendous for Bitcoin (BTC) investors as price broke the crucial barrier of $12,000, culminating in a surge from $11,300 to $13,300, a rally of $2,000 within a week.A new yearly high was printed, while the dollar has been showing weakness as well. Next to that, multiple listed companies came along with statements regarding allocations of Bitcoin rather than the U.S. Dollar.All these arguments line up for a continuation of the bull market, but which levels should be watched? Let's take a closer look at the charts. BTC/USD 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewAs Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows, the $11,600-12,000 area was a crucial area to break for any bullish continuation. This resistance area has been persistent since the start of the bear market at the beginning of 2018. For over thirty months, the price of Bitcoin couldn’t break through this resistance zone, until the previous week.The beginning of a bull market is often flagged by beautiful support/resistance tests for continuation, which is also seen at the $10,000 level. After this support/resistance test, the upward run continued.BTC/USD 3-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe $10,000 level got a retest and held, which marked a new support zone. Since then, Bitcoin’s price has continued to run upward, which led to the breakout above the $12,000 barrier.BTC/USD 3-day chart. Source: TradingViewAs the $11,600-12,000 broke upward, some interesting levels can now be determined for traders to watch in the upcoming weeks. Often, buying after such a big rally isn’t the best strategy since a retest of lower levels is likely. As mentioned, the confirmation of a support/resistance flip at the $10,000 level warranted upward momentum. A similar case is likely here. The crucial barrier of $11,600-12,000 is likely to see a support level test before the market can continue rallying.The resistances are found at $13,600-14,000 and $16,500-17,000. However, the latter is unlikely to be hit in the coming months as range-bound movements appear to be more likely.Therefore, traders should pay attention to the $13,600-14,000 area and the $11,600-12,000 as both could become crucial pivots in the upcoming weeks.Total market capitalization cryptocurrency 3-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe total market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies chart is showing a clear resistance zone between $395-415 billion. It’s unlikely to have a breakout in one go, but that’s heavily dependent on the movement of Bitcoin.Therefore, a retest of the $330-340 billion for support would be very likely and would set up a healthy construction for the start of a new bull market.If the total market capitalization breaks through $395-415 billion, the next resistance zone is found between $510-525 billion.BTC/USDT 3-day chart. Source: TradingViewAs discussed previously in this article, there’s a very likely case that Bitcoin’s price will have a correction toward the $11,600-12,000 area for some technical level tests.Therefore, a range-bound technical structure can be determined. The resistance zone is located between $13,500-14,000, and the support zone is between $11,600-12,000.Such a range-bound construction is very healthy for starting a new cycle as it’s constantly accumulating on a higher level. Breaking out of this sideways range after a few months may see the next big move, which will likely bring the price of Bitcoin towards $17,000 and possibly even a new all-time high.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

62,"Earlier this week, Bitcoin (BTC) advocate and Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal said gold is breaking down against BTC. If the dominant cryptocurrency continues to gain momentum against BTC, it could strengthen its perception as a store of value.In the past month, the price of Bitcoin gained 30.36% against the U.S. dollar, from $10,136 to $13,217. In the same period, gold has gained about 2.25%, from $1,863 to $1,903.In the past two weeks, while the price of Bitcoin rallied strongly, both gold and the U.S. stock market steadily recovered.The confluence of three major factors likely contributed to the upsurge of Bitcoin since early October.First, PayPal's crypto integration announcement buoyed market sentiment. Second, the institutional demand for BTC has continuously increased following Square, MicroStrategy, and Stone Ridge’s investment. Third, Bitcoin’s favorable high time frame log charts have spurred significant optimism.Particularly, after its breakout above $12,000, the volume of Bitcoin across the spot, institutional, and derivatives market spiked. Consequently, the digital asset began to outperform most risk-on and risk-off assets. Pal said:As Cointelegraph reported, when Bitcoin surged past the $12,000 resistance level, it marked a clean breakout on the weekly chart. Traders have started to pinpoint the weekly and monthly log charts to predict a new all-time high.The strong technical momentum of Bitcoin and its decoupling from gold and stocks are also possibly furthering the intensity of BTC’s current rally.In the short term, cryptocurrency technical analysts say that Bitcoin faces an identity crisis, but fortunately in a good way.Cantering Clark, a Bitcoin and derivatives trader, said gold is under pressure when the dollar goes up. The analyst said that for BTC, due to uncertainty on whether it is a risk-on or a risk-off asset, it could see a lower correlation with the dollar. He wrote:As the momentum of Bitcoin continues to gain against gold and stocks, prominent billionaire investors are voicing their support for BTC.Paul Tudor Jones, the Wall Street billionaire investor who purchased Bitcoin in May, reaffirmed his positive stance around Bitcoin.Hasu, a researcher who writes for the top cryptocurrency options exchange Deribit, quoted Tudor Jones saying:"
63,"China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), published a draft law this Friday that aims to provide regulatory framework and legitimacy for a forthcoming central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan. The draft law states that the yuan is the official currency of the People's Republic of China whether in physical or digital form.The draft law also appears to take aim at third-party efforts at yuan-backed digital currencies, stating that individuals and institutions are prohibited from making and issuing a currency designed to “replace” digital yuan circulation. This move would presumably criminalize all non-state-sanctioned yuan-backed stablecoins. The punitive measures against violators of this proposed law are harsh: most notably confiscating all profits, destroying all tokens, and imposing a fine of not less than five times the illegal amount created, in addition to the possibility of criminal prosecution and imprisonment.The People’s Bank of China clarified that the draft of the new law is on the table for public consultation until November 23, 2020.Previous reports have indicated that China hopes to start officially issuing the digital yuan before the Winter Olympics in Beijing in February 2022. Additionally, earlier this month, China conducted a major test of Shenzhen's digital yuan payment system, where nearly 47,500 residents claimed 200 yuan ($30) each in digital currency which they then spent across 3,389 stores throughout the city.This regulatory move is also just the latest in a worldwide trend towards CBDCs. The Bank for International Settlements had told Cointelegraph that it had worked with seven central banks to define the foundational principles necessary for any publicly available CBDCs to help central banks meet their public policy objectives."
64,"JPMorgan, the $316 billion investment banking giant, said the potential long-term upside for Bitcoin (BTC) is “considerable.” This new optimistic stance towards the dominant cryptocurrency comes after PayPal allowed its users to buy and sell crypto assets.JP Morgan, from ""Bitcoin is a fraud and will blow up"" in 2017 to ""Bitcoin’s competition with gold"" in 2020.

We've come a long way. pic.twitter.com/xceabkHaVJThe main factor put forward by JPMorgan’s Global Markets Strategy division is Bitcoin’s competition with gold. The note, obtained by Business Insider, reads:The analysts also pinpointed the large valuation gap between Bitcoin and gold. At least $2.6 trillion is said to be stored in gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and bars. In contrast, the market capitalization of BTC remains at $240 billion.JPMorgan’s note essentially emphasized three major reasons to support the long-term growth potential of Bitcoin.First, Bitcoin has to rise 10 times to match the private sector’s gold investment. Second, cryptocurrencies have high utility. Third, BTC could appeal to millennials in the longer term.Following the integration of crypto purchases by PayPal and the rapid increase in institutional demand, Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a safe-haven asset.There is a massive difference in the valuation of gold and Bitcoin. Albeit the former has been recognized as a safe-haven asset for a long period, BTC has many distinct advantages. JPMorgan analysts said:One of the advantages Bitcoin has over gold is utility. Bitcoin is a blockchain network at its core. That means users can send BTC to one another on a public ledger, efficiently and practically. To transfer gold, there needs to be physical delivery, which becomes challenging.As seen in many cold wallet transfers, it is easier to move $1 billion worth of capital on the Bitcoin blockchain than with physical gold. The bank’s analysts further explained:Bitcoin is still at a nascent stage in terms of infrastructure, development, and mainstream adoption. As Cointelegraph reported, only 7% of Americans previously bought Bitcoin, according to a study.Some major markets, in the likes of Canada, still lack a well-regulated exchange market. Large banks are yet to provide custody of crypto assets, and that gives Bitcoin a large room to grow in the next five to ten years."
65,"It’s been quite a week for Bitcoin, a week we’ve been waiting for. The coin is up nearly 13% and burst through the $13,000 barrier. Some of that support came from PayPal’s decision to enable cryptocurrency purchases, a move that sent its stock soaring. The company will need that kind of rise to stay ahead of the coin’s value. Bitcoin’s valuation is now just one behind the payments processor that lets people trade it.Traders, though, expect that Bitcoin will slow down after that strong rally, which has allowed the coin to regain its cryptocurrency dominance. Some experts think that the new level might even be meaningless. They see prices falling unless it picks up some strong support from bulls. One person who sees any fall as temporary is Raoul Pal. A former Goldman Sachs hedge fund manager, Pal has said that he thinks Bitcoin could reach a million bucks in as little as five years.Meanwhile, as Bitcoin tries to decide whether to continue rising, fall back, or stick around $13,000, Monero and other privacy coins are doing fine. Monero is up more than 14% over the last couple of weeks and over 41% over the last month.One place that’s happy with Bitcoin’s new price level is Turkey. Adoption in the country is rising as inflation pushes up prices and the Turkish lira falls against the dollar. The currency is down about a third since the start of the year. Turkish registrations on Paxful, a Bitcoin marketplace, are up 274% over the last 12 months.It’s not just financial health that the blockchain is helping to preserve, though. Seventeen million Chinese tourists have now used a blockchain to verify their health status before visiting Macau. IBM has developed a blockchain-based digital health passport that will let people store their health reports on their smartphones safely. Individuals must give consent before granting access to details on their IBM Digital Health Pass.In Kyrgyzstan, Sadyr Japarov, the country’s Prime Minister and new acting President has suggested using a blockchain to secure future elections. The country has had three revolutions caused by unfair elections, he said. Japarov seized power after his release from prison, where he was serving an 11-and-a-half-year sentence for kidnapping a rival.A passenger on a flight from Dubai to India might be wishing he’d thought of moving funds on the blockchain. Airport authorities thought he was walking strangely and stopped him. They found two pounds of gold hidden up his butt. Either the food on the flight was particularly rich, or the passenger was trying to avoid paying an 18% tax. He should have bought Bitcoin. It’s a lot more comfortable — and it’s now even more popular than sex, at least on Reddit.And finally, Atari — yes, that Atari — will include a cryptocurrency in its new console. Customers will be able to use Atari tokens as they play Atari arcade games. It looks like Bitcoin isn’t the only coin that’s leveling up.

66,"A recent report from institutional crypto firm Fidelity Digital Assets concluded that Bitcoin (BTC) shows very little price correlation to mainstream financial assets, based on data from the past five years. Over the course of 2020, Bitcoin has gained further adoption into mainstream finance, which logically might impact the asset’s correlation or lack thereof. Has Bitcoin’s correlation changed in 2020? Ria Bhutoria, director of research at Fidelity Digital Assets, told Cointelegraph via email: “Bitcoin has experienced higher positive correlations to other assets over shorter time periods, especially during periods of uncertainty and turbulence, and even prior to 2020.”Amid rising COVID-19 concerns and prevention measures starting in March 2020, Bitcoin plummeted in price, seemingly in step with the U.S. stock market. “The increase in correlation between Bitcoin and other assets was a consequence of a short-term liquidity crisis that impacted many asset classes,” Bhutoria explained of the March drop. Essentially, a large number of people rushed to sell their financial assets in exchange for cash when times became uncertain around the COVID-19 pandemic news. She added:Fidelity released an in-depth October report labeled “Bitcoin Investment Thesis: Bitcoin’s Role As An Alternative Investment.” Authored by Bhutoria, the report touched on a bevy of topics. One particular segment of the report pointed out Bitcoin’s lack of correlation to other financial assets, including U.S. stocks and gold. Correlation stands as a hotly debated topic in the crypto industry.Using data from January 2015 to September 2020, Fidelity’s report concluded that Bitcoin performed differently than mainstream assets, signalling virtually zero correlation to other markets for that time period. BTC scored a 0.11 in a range between -1 and 1. Wielding a 1 rating means prices of assets travel exactly in step with one another, while a score of -1 means exactly the opposite price action. Any asset holding a score of 0 walks its own price path, unaffected when others move. In addition to the March drop, multiple other instances have shown a seeming correlation between Bitcoin and traditional markets, at least at certain points. The element of adoption could play into the equation, making Bitcoin more correlated than years prior — an aspect pointed out in Fidelity’s report. “Bitcoin is a young asset that, until recently, was untethered to traditional markets,” the report read, adding: “As it is integrated in institutional portfolios, it could become increasingly correlated with other assets.” Related: The next big treasure: Corporations buy up Bitcoin as a treasury reserveBitcoin has seen significant mainstream adoption in 2020. One sign is a number of traditional financial players, such as MicroStrategy, have accumulated sizable Bitcoin positions. PayPal also recently announced plans for adding Bitcoin to its platform in 2020, pushing the asset further into the mainstream spotlight. “Bitcoin’s longer-term correlations to other assets could continue to be low, given Bitcoin’s differing risk and return factors versus other asset classes and its dynamic use cases and narratives,” Bhutoria said, adding further:Over the years, other industry participants have also weighed in on Bitcoin’s price in line with other markets. Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano holds as a long-time advocate for Bitcoin as a non-correlated asset. “All assets trend towards a correlation of 1 in a liquidity crisis,” Pompliano told Cointelegraph in an email, which also lines up with Bhutoria’s explanation. He further added:Prior to Bitcoin’s launch in 2009, the financial crisis of 2007–2008 yielded similar liquidity issues. As the public often compares Bitcoin to gold, looking at gold during this crisis adds perspective. “We saw gold drop 30% over the liquidity crisis during the summer of 2008, along with all assets trending to a correlation of 1 during the same time,” Pompliano wrote, adding: “Eventually the assets decoupled later on and so history can teach us a great lesson here as well.” Erik Finman, a Bitcoin millionaire who invested in BTC at the age of 12 back in 2011, holds a more tentative approach regarding Bitcoin’s lack of correlation possibly changing recently. “We have to wait and see,” he told Cointelegraph, outlining: Based on all three responses outlined above, Bitcoin seemingly holds at least some correlation to other assets during isolated, short-term events. However, on a broader timeline and scale, BTC continues to prove itself as a non-correlated asset, at least so far."
67,"Cointelegraph Markets: Paul Tudor Jones. Did his investment into Bitcoin spark a new bull cycle?Max Keiser: First, we need to go back to the Genesis Block and understand that everything that has happened and will ever happen with Bitcoin came into existence at that instant and the world and our species were forever changed. Understand too, that Bitcoin is shaping our world around its protocol in ways that most don’t understand but all are powerless to stop. Within this context, it was clear on Jan. 3, 2009, the genius of the protocol would catch up to the likes of Paul Tudor Jones and warp his mind.As he said this past week, after studying Bitcoin he’s become more bullish and it's the first time in his career he’s ever encountered an asset he’s buying to hedge against the carnage of runaway inflation that is ""pro-humanity."" He understands the paradox of the protocol. He understands like Michael Saylor does now (after rejecting Bitcoin for years) that Bitcoin is in control.Were you surprised at the news that PayPal is entering the Bitcoin and crypto space? Max Keiser: No. PayPal, like all companies, came to the realization faster than others that Bitcoin is an existential threat to their business and to ignore it would mean going out of business.Do you think it is a reasonable trade-off that it will maintain control over users' money just as Libra would?Max Keiser: PayPal’s attempt to restrain Bitcoin won’t work because the competition at $SQ and elsewhere will force them to go Full Bitcoin or die. This is true with Libra as well. It’s true of CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currencies), and it’s true of countries like Venezuela who abandoned their Petro and are now moving to a Full Bitcoin position. In China, the situation is different.At the moment, with China establishing a V-shaped recovery in their uniquely post-covid economy (the only G20 country to achieve this), they are cocky and blind to what will happen if the U.S. and others go Full Bitcoin. It’s similar to the 1980s-1990s when Japan was set to take over the global economy but failed to embrace the Internet fast enough and the US quickly reasserted global dominance again. China thinks they hold all the cards, but without going Full Bitcoin they leave themselves vulnerable to countries that do.Does news about BTC payment acceptance bolster price? Or is Bitcoin’s value mainly rising because it’s being increasingly perceived as a store of value?Max Keiser: The role of payments (i.e. medium of exchange) comes after Bitcoin establishes itself as a SOV; a point Roger Ver, Craig Wright, and Calvin Ayre never understood and why their projects BCH and BSV are increasingly becoming worthless compared to BTC (they completely misread the BTC White Paper). At the moment, BTC is still establishing itself as a SOV.I’ve said many times that I think the transition that includes the MOE use case probably comes after BTC starts to push Gold out of the SOV picture around $100,000 per BTC. By the way, a warning to Gold Bugs bashing BTC. Look what happened to Peter Schiff. By not letting BTC change his thinking he sabotaged himself and appears to be in real trouble. This fate awaits all who mess with Bitcoin.In June, you said that Peter Schiff would buy Bitcoin at $50,000. Is the price still the same?Max Keiser: Yes. I predict that the combination of his business failing plus his legal fees will force him to finally succumb to reality and he’ll come to Bitcoin with his tail between his legs begging forgiveness and the timing will be around BTC $50,000.Gold bugs say that gold will win regardless of who wins the US election. Who do you think is best for Bitcoin: Biden or Trump? How do you expect Bitcoin will react to the election results next month?Max Keiser: A Biden win means a win for corruption and the Deep State so I would expect Bitcoin’s price to bolt higher as people panic-buy unconfiscatable Bitcoin before Biden’s socialist, jackbooted thugs start confiscating everything in a replay of 1938 Kristallnacht.Michael Saylor said that he bought Bitcoin to protect cash reserves from ""melting"" like an ice cube. Do you think Google, Amazon, etc. will make similar realizations?Max Keiser: Yes. The inflation genie is out of the bottle and cash is trash. But the important thing here is that Michael Saylor went against the prevailing wisdom of buying back his own stock, a move that takes advantage of a reckless, money printing Fed and instead essentially goes to war with the Fed by embracing Bitcoin — an asset hardcoded to destroy the Fed.As the Genesis Block made clear with ""Chancellor on brink of a second bailout,"" Bitcoin was designed as a central bank killer. Michael Saylor figured that out and understands that he needs to be on the right side of history or get blown out. Every company in the world will face the same decision. Do they support central banks or do they want to survive and thrive in a post-central bank world. Do you believe another “Bloody Thursday” can happen for the markets and Bitcoin again?Max Keiser: Volatility is the price we pay for unconfiscatable, uncensorable Hard Money, so I welcome it.You were one of the first people to report on Bitcoin. But who has had the most influence on you as far as getting into bitcoin goes?Max Keiser: I have a patented technology for creating digitally scarce money (us pat. 5950176) secured in 1996 so I’d say it was my work at that time creating digital money for my startup the Hollywood Stock Exchange that put me on the Bitcoin path.Is understanding Bitcoin an ever-evolving process? You frequently talk of Bitcoin as a new type of increasingly self-aware entity of sorts. Can you speak a bit more about this?Max Keiser: Bitcoin came into existence as a spontaneous life form that grew out of our global, collective consciousness as a defense mechanism to fight predatory central banks. Jamie Dimon is a parasite, like a tapeworm, and our species had no defense. So with God’s help, we collectively willed Bitcoin into existence to fight fiat money, fractional reserve banking and Keynesian debt-money propaganda. Which company or person has done the most for Bitcoin in recent years in terms of adoption?Max Keiser: The biggest driver of adoption has been financial terrorists on Wall St and central banks. The more they print, the more people flee to individual sovereignty and Bitcoin.What's your view on the popular stock-to-flow model (created by planB), and what do you say to those who don't believe its price hypotheses such as $288,000 this halving cycle?Max Keiser: S2f is an analytical tool that some people, like myself, like. It’s like technical analysis and chart reading. Some people like TA and swear by it. Some don’t. There is no proof that TA has any forecasting ability greater than coin-flipping. Same for S2f, but each has its fans for various reasons.These tools are helpful to organize your thoughts and to imagine price points, trends, etc. Individuals like different analytical tools for different reasons.What do you think is causing the hash rate vs. price lag, which you recently said implies a $35-50K BTC value?Max Keiser: The price lag vs. hash rate is due in part to the existence of shitcoins that muddy the waters. As BTC dominance climbs, this distracting noise will die off and we’ll see price catch up to hash rate.What do you think about the future of DeFi?Max Keiser: DeFi is mostly just repackaged ICO scams. Avoid.Do you plan to have Saifedean Ammous on the Keiser Report or Orange Pill Podcast? What do you think about his idea of “fiat life” (food, art, etc.) versus life on a Bitcoin standard?Max Keiser: Saifedean and “The Bitcoin Standard” took the industry up to a higher base-camp on our quest to conquer the Mt. Everest of money. Yes. He’ll be back on KR and OPP for sure."
68,"According to Whalemap, there are three major Bitcoin (BTC) whale clusters in the near term that might serve as key technical levels. The $11,857, $12,256 and $12,868 levels would likely act as important support and resistance areas.In previous cycles, whale activity coincided with significant price movements at crucial technical levels. For instance, Cointelegraph reported that a whale sold at $12,000 after “HODLing” for years. In the next few weeks, BTC dropped to sub-$10,000.Whale clusters form when whales buy Bitcoin and do not move their BTC holdings. This indicates that whales are accumulating BTC in the areas where the clusters materialize.The larger Bitcoin whale cluster has formed at $11,857, with previous clusters at $11,288 to $11,465. In the near term, that signifies that the $11,857 is considered a big support area by whales.Now, Bitcoin would have to remain above $11,857 or consolidate above it to see a broader rally. The ideal technical structure for a rally continuation would be to stabilize at $11,900.After a major rally, some consolidation to neutralize the futures market could make the ongoing uptrend healthier.Since Oct. 2, in just over three weeks, the price of Bitcoin climbed 24% against the U.S. dollar. In the same period, gold has slightly risen by 0.2%, as BTC outperformed most risk-on and safe-haven assets.Throughout most of the rally, the futures market demonstrated negative or neutral funding rates. As such, the rally itself was not highly overcrowded and is not in danger of a large pullback.Still, a corrective price movement following a month of consistent rallying could further stabilize the upward movement.Whales might have been buying all the way from early $11,000s to $12,000 due to the context of the current rally.Technically, Bitcoin broke out of a three-year range, with the daily chart confirming the highest price point since January 2018. As Cointelegraph reported, the daily candle of Bitcoin has never closed above $12,900 for nearly three years.Atop the technical reasons, the perception of Bitcoin as a potential competitor against gold is also strengthening alongside network fundamentals. Consequently, the institutional demand for BTC has considerably spiked as seen by the rise of the CME Bitcoin futures market.Meanwhile, researchers at Santiment, an on-chain market analytics firm, point out that BTC appears to be decoupling from other markets. Throughout historical bull cycles, when BTC demonstrated independent price movements, it caused the momentum to strengthen. They said:The confluence of BTC’s resilience above $11,900, an important whale cluster, as well as various favorable technical factors may help BTC/USD overpower several bearish signals in the short term to keep the current rally going.

69,"Gemini crypto exchange founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss said that Bitcoin (BTC) will eventually hit $500,000 per coin during a recent interview with podcast host Peter McCormack.“The question in our mind is not so much does it get to $500,000, but how quickly,” Tyler told McCormack during the Oct. 23 podcast episode. His thesis takes the market cap of gold and theoretical central bank allocation into consideration. ""I would sort of contend that $500,000 Bitcoin is actually pretty conservative and the game hasn't even really started,"" Cameron noted.MicroStrategy and others buying significant amounts of Bitcoin for their treasury reserves seems to indicate that the market is beginning to shift. “What if every Fortune 100 or 500 company does that, what if central banks start doing that?” Cameron queried. “It hasn’t even started,” he added, analogizing that Bitcoin is in the bottom of the first in a nine-inning baseball game.The basis for the interview was a report from Tyler and Cameron published in August 2020, titled: The Case for $500K Bitcoin. The brothers began constructing the report in January 2020, Cameron said in the interview with McCormack.""We started to think about what the government has been doing with the U.S. dollar for the past decade or so and traditional sort of stores of value and hedges,"" Cameron explained. The twins halted work on the report in March when COVID gained a global foothold. They resumed the paper several months later after evaluating the economic changes brought on by the virus.Tyler said he and his brother began buying BTC in 2012. Part of the rationale for the report stemmed from evaluating the asset's performance amid the surrounding economy over the past decade. While a growing number of bullish predictions for Bitcoin surfaced throughout 2020, some have remained skeptical such as gold bug Peter Schiff."
70,"In the days preceding Bitcoin’s latest rise in price, stablecoins went wild, exhibiting some largely unprecedented behavior.On October 18, stablecoins moving to exchanges reached record highs of 60,000 and 56,000 respectively, according to data from CryptoQuant. The outlet's data tracked USDT on Ethereum, PAX, USDC, TUSD, DAI, SAI, BUSD, HUSD and USDK. When it comes to the total inflow of all stablecoins in terms of the dollar value, no extraordinary trends were detected.CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju told Cointelegraph that, although the inflows were not huge in terms of dollar value, they signified a bullish trend among retail investors:Ju believes that the market's high address and transaction count indicates that inflows were coming from a large number of retail investors rather than from a few large players. The assumption is that investors send stablecoins to exchanges when they plan to convert them to other crypto assets — primarily Bitcoin. Yesterday, Tether minted 450 million USDT on the Tron (TRX) network. The company’s CTO Paolo Ardoino clarified earlier that the amount was authorized, but not issued:Tether’s market capitalization quadrupled in 2020, beginning the year with $4 billion and rising to $16 billion at time of publication. Meanwhile, Bitcoin balances on major exchanges fell below 2.5 BTC for the first time in years."
71,"PayPal’s crypto announcement acted as a trigger that drove Bitcoin (BTC) price to a new 52-week high. During such news-based events, traders holding short positions are caught off guard and are forced to cover their trades, resulting in the type of short squeeze seen during the Oct. 21 rally.Cryptocurrency market weekly performance. Source: Coin360.comHowever, after this initial burst, the next leg of the uptrend is only possible if demand picks up and the bulls continue to buy at higher levels.Data from Huobi exchange suggests that pro traders are not convinced that the current rally warrants the opening of long positions and Cointelegraph contributor Marcel Pechman explained that this could be a bearish signal.On the other hand, the open interest on CME Bitcoin futures paints a different picture. The CME has now become the second biggest Bitcoin futures exchange in terms of open interest, second only to OKEx. This suggests that institutional demand could be picking up.This opposing set of data from Bitcoin futures exchanges only adds to the confusion among traders about the next possible move.Let’s go a little deep into the psychology of the traders for a better understanding. Institutional investors rarely buy because of FOMO as they are generally more averse toThese large traders may wait for the rally to sustain and complete a successful retest of the breakout level before buying.Let’s take a look at the top-10 cryptocurrencies in order to determine what the technical indicators project.Bitcoin (BTC) broke out and closed above the $12,460 resistance on Oct. 21. This move helped the cryptocurrency notch a new 52-week high, which is a sign of strength.The 20-day exponential moving average ($11,679) is sloping up and the 50-day simple moving average ($10,943) has also started to rise. This shows that both the short-term and the medium-term trend favors the bulls.However, the rally above $13,000 pushed the relative strength index close to 81, a level which attracted profit booking the last two times it was reached.The BTC/USD pair is facing selling above $13,000 but the bulls do not seem to be in a hurry to close their positions. If the pair does not drop below $12,460 within the next few days, it will increase the possibility of a rally to $14,000.On the contrary, if the bears can pull the price below the $12,460–$12,050 support zone, it will suggest a lack of demand at higher levels. Such a move will suggest that the current breakout was a bear trap.Ether (ETH) broke out and closed above $395 on Oct. 22. This move completed the ascending triangle pattern, which has a target objective of $478.The rising 20-day EMA ($377) and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that the bulls have the upper hand.However, the bears are currently trying to pull the price back below the breakout level of $395. If they succeed, it will signal that the current breakout was a fake one. The next support on the downside is the uptrend line.Conversely, if the ETH/USD pair rebounds off $395, it will suggest that the breakout is valid. The uptrend could pick up momentum after the bulls push the price above $421.XRP attempted to rise above the $0.2295–$0.26 range on Oct. 21 but the bulls could not close the price above $0.26. This suggests a lack of buyers at higher levels.The failure of the XRP/USD pair to break out of the range could have attracted profit booking. If the price breaks below the moving averages, it will suggest that the range-bound action is likely to extend for a few more days.Contrary to this assumption, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA ($0.24), the bulls will once again attempt to drive the pair above the $0.26–$0.265763 resistance zone.A breakout and close (UTC time) above the resistance zone will complete an inverted head and shoulders pattern that could signal the start of a new uptrend with a target objective of $0.30.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently facing selling near the overhead resistance at $280. This shows that the bears are trying to keep the price below this level. If they succeed, a drop to the 20-day EMA ($247) is possible.However, the upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI close to the oversold zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside.If the bulls can push the price above $280, a move to $300 is possible. This level could act as resistance but if the bulls can thrust the price above it, the BCH/USD pair could resume the uptrend and reach $326.30–$337.90.This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the critical support at $242.Binance Coin (BNB) broke above the downtrend line on Oct. 22. This suggests that the correction could be over. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 56 suggest that bulls have the upper hand.If the bulls can push the price above $31.9798, a retest of the 52-week high at $33.3888 is possible. A breakout and close above this level could resume the uptrend that can challenge the all-time high at $39.5941.This bullish view will be invalidated if the price continues to decline from the current levels and plummet below $28.50. Such a move could start a deeper correction to $22.Chainlink (LINK) completed an ascending triangle pattern when it broke and closed above $11.8028 on Oct. 22. The target objective of this bullish setup is $15.The gradually upsloping 20-day EMA ($10.71) and the RSI above 57 suggest that bulls have the upper hand.However, the bears are not willing to let bulls have their way. They are currently attempting to drag the price back below the $11.199–$11.8028 support zone. If they manage to do that, it will suggest that the current breakout was a bull trap.On the other hand, if the bears fail to sustain the price below the support zone, it will indicate that the bulls are accumulating on dips. This could increase the possibility of a rally to $13.28 and higher.Polkadot (DOT) closed above the 20-day EMA ($4.17) on Oct. 22. The bulls will now try to push the price above the overhead resistance at $4.6112. A close above this resistance could drive the price to $5.5899.The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has risen above the 50 levels for the first time in more than a month. This suggests that the selling pressure has reduced and the bulls are attempting to make a comeback.However, if the price again slips back below the 20-day EMA, the DOT/USD pair could extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. The pair may turn negative if the bears sink the pair below the critical support at $3.5321.Litecoin (LTC) completed an inverse head and shoulders pattern when it broke out and closed above the $51–$52.36 resistance zone. The pattern target of this bullish reversal setup is $61.The upsloping 20-day EMA ($49) and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest that bulls are in control.However, after the initial run-up, the price may retest the breakout zone of $51–$52.36. If the bulls purchase the dip to this zone and the price recovers sharply, it will suggest that the zone may act as a floor in the future.This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears drag and sustain the LTC/USD pair below $51. Such a move will suggest that the current breakout was a bull trap.Cardano (ADA) has been trading inside a rising wedge pattern for the past few days. The bulls have failed to push the price above the immediate resistance at $0.1142241, which shows a lack of demand at higher levels.The rising wedge is usually considered as a bearish setup. The pattern will complete when the price drops and closes below the support line of the wedge. Such a move could drag the price down to $0.090 and then to $0.0755701.However, the upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.10) and the RSI in the positive zone suggest a minor advantage to the bulls. If the buyers can propel the price above the wedge, the ADA/USD pair could start an up-move that may reach $0.01445.Bitcoin SV (BSV) has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, which shows indecision among the bulls and the bears. Although the bulls had pushed the price above the triangle on Oct. 22, they could not sustain the higher levels.The price has turned down from the downtrend line and the bears will now try to sink the BSV/USD pair to the uptrend line of the triangle. If this support cracks, a drop to $146.20 is possible.Conversely, if the pair rebounds off the uptrend line, the bulls will once again attempt to push the price above the triangle. If they can pull it off, a rally to $180.63 and then to $227 could be on the cards.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

72,"Galaxy Digital CEO and multi-millionaire Mike Novogratz recently hopped on CNBC Squawk Box for an interview, detailing the importance of PayPal's Bitcoin launch. ""I think that's, in some ways, the shot heard around the world on Wall Street,"" Novogratz said in an Oct. 23 interview about PayPal's recent news. ""PayPal has 346 million accounts,"" he said, adding: ""They're the 30th biggest bank in the U.S. in deposits and all of a sudden every financial institution says, 'Wait a minute, what am I doing?'""PayPal unveiled the addition of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash to its network on Oct. 21. Following the announcement of these plans, Bitcoin surged in price, ultimately overtaking the market cap of PayPal itself. ""If you're in the board room at Morgan Stanley or Goldman Sachs or Bank of America, you're thinking, 'How do I get engaged?'"" Novogratz said of crypto. Prior to his interview, the CEO said he took a peak at stock performances for companies involved in crypto, as well as Ethereum's price. He pointed out that such assets have posted standout price gains in 2020.""We are going to see, over the next 10 years, a rebuilding of the financial infrastructure of this country,"" Novogratz said. ""It was interesting that PayPal hired Paxos to do their integration with crypto because there's a domain expertise in this cryptocurrency space, in this blockchain space, that's needed."" Paxos serves as the entity behind PAX, one of the many U.S. dollar-pegged stable coins in the crypto industry. The institution also touts other functions, such as custody.Multiple traditional financial players have picked up large stacks of Bitcoin this year, seemingly ushering in an age of mainstream Bitcoin adoption.UPDATE Oct. 29, 15:43 UTC: This article has been updated, correcting information on PayPal's crypto launch details.

73,"With Bitcoin price successfully punching through the $12,000 barrier after PayPal announced that it would be venturing into digital assets, October is delivering on the excitement that September failed to provide. And with on-chain and market data continuing bullish signs for Bitcoin (BTC), experts believe that a 2017-style rally may be on the way.Ether (ETH) price has also picked up, although confidence in decentralized finance is beginning to shake as the industry’s growth and hype are slowing down. DeFi has been the major kick-starter for cryptocurrency popularity in 2020, but now, other digital assets seem to be ready to start thriving and could reach considerable heights by the end of the year.According to a recent report by Finder — an online comparison resource — featuring 30 experts from the industry, Bitcoin’s price is likely to reach $14,283 by the end of the year. And according to Finder’s cryptocurrency editor, Andrew Munro, Bitcoin’s reputation as a reliable store of value is the main reason behind the generally bullish outlook. He told Cointelegraph:Other experts have cited numerous reasons for a rally in the price of Bitcoin, namely an increasingly clear regulatory framework in the digital asset market and the many setbacks associated with fiat currencies, such as inflation and negative rates.While the panel average predicted a $14,283 Bitcoin price by the end of the year, other predictions point to a much higher price tag, especially considering the famous stock-to-flow model created by anonymous analyst PlanB.While Bitcoin is beginning to show signs of strength over other cryptocurrencies, with increasing trade and market capitalization dominance, industry participants also hold a positive outlook on Ether, with a panelist average of $513, a 40% increase by the end of the year. However, in the long term, experts are not so sure about Ether’s sustainability. Munro said: “The most commonly cited factor behind bullish near-term Ethereum predictions was the expected launch of Ethereum 2.0 before the end of the year, and the impact of staking on circulating supply.”Ethereum has seen increased popularity throughout 2020 due to the rise of DeFi, but some skepticism is being voiced over the long-term prospect and sustainability of DeFi. While many are hoping for the launch of Ethereum 2.0, that may take years to finalize. According to Jonathan Hobbs, author of The Crypto Portfolio and a former digital asset fund manager, told Cointelegraph that it’s one of the reasons for the positive returns on Bitcoin:As profits from the DeFi alt season trickle back into Bitcoin, the long-term sustainability of decentralized finance may come into question. In fact, a survey by CryptoCompare asked 26 exchange operators in leading trading venues about the future of decentralized exchanges, with only 7.7% finding it likely that DEXs will overtake centralized exchanges in two years’ time.It is clear that DeFi activity is slowing down, but some believe this is actually good in the long run. Lanre Jonathan Ige, a researcher at Amun AG — an issuer of cryptocurrency exchange-traded products in Europe — told Cointelegraph:While sustainability seems to be the main blocker for any long-term success of decentralized finance, both when it comes to the returns on DeFi and to the technical aspects of Ethereum, others have cited a shady crypto industry, complicated interfaces and a general lack of popularity as deterrents to the continued growth of DeFi. Munro stated: “73% of the panel said ‘scams, excessive hype and market manipulation’ were a key obstacle to DeFi growth, and some likened DeFi to the ICO boom in 2017.”Nevertheless, many remain hopeful about DeFi. In fact, the majority of panelists in Finder’s cryptocurrency report said DeFi applications will likely continue to steadily grow over the next 12 months in terms of value locked and the number of users. Ilya Abugov, lead analyst at DappRadar also believes this to be the case, telling Cointelegraph: “There is less media hype in DeFi right now. There was a lot of buildup in the summer, so now there is a bit of a sobering up moment.”While DeFi may have been the catalyst for the summer’s crypto activity, institutional interest may be the driving force for Bitcoin going forward, according to Lanre, especially because big corporations such as MicroStrategy, Stone Ridge and Square are now getting involved,Exchange operators queried in the CryptoCompare survey believe this to be the case as well, with 92.3% stating that there will be a rise in institutional investment in digital assets in the next two years. According to Hobbs, Bitcoin’s scarcity and deflationary nature are some of the factors influencing why institutions are becoming interested in digital asset investment: “Ninety percent of the world’s bitcoin has already been mined. Ninety percent of the world’s dollars, however, have definitely not been printed. I believe this narrative is starting to catch on more with institutional players.”In the meantime, some institutions are still betting on the DeFi sector, with Pantera Capital recently disclosing during a webinar that DeFi will be at the center of the upcoming bull rally. But while many still believe in DeFi, most seem to think that the DeFi price hype cycle is done and that slower growth for the industry will follow, especially as Ethereum is able to scale.While the outlook is generally positive, many are still concerned with the latest news pertaining to regulation, such as the United States’ lawsuit against BitMex and the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority’s ban on cryptocurrency derivatives for retail. Will more regulatory constraints follow, or is it clear sailing for Bitcoin and crypto from now on?"
74,"The CME Bitcoin futures market overtook Binance Futures to become the second-biggest Bitcoin (BTC) futures exchange by open interest. The data shows that the institutional volume is rapidly gaining a larger share of the cryptocurrency market.On Oct. 10, Skew reported that the CME Bitcoin futures market’s open interest rose sharply by 1,500 contracts. Since then, within three days, the price of BTC surged 9% to over $13,000.The growing open interest of CME’s futures contracts on BTC is likely to have a positive effect on BTC price, particularly as a recent study found that ""CME Bitcoin futures contribute more to price discovery than its related spot markets.""For many years, the Bitcoin futures market was dominated by two key players: BitMEX and OKEx. In the past year, new-generation futures exchanges began to swiftly expand, which led Binance Futures, Bybit, and Huobi to compete against the likes of BitMEX.The CME launched its Bitcoin futures contracts on Dec. 17, 2017. Within a span of three years, it evolved into the second-largest BTC futures exchange by open interest, Skew reports.The term open interest refers to the sum of the value of all long and short futures contracts that are actively open. It is used to gauge the activity of the market by measuring the amount of capital that is deployed onto the futures market.Data from Skew shows CME now accounts for $790 million worth of BTC long and short contracts. It falls merely $19 million behind OKEx, which has been the dominant futures exchange throughout 2020.The rapid increase in the open interest of the CME Bitcoin futures market reflects growing institutional demand for three key reasons.First, throughout the past three days, the overall volume of the Bitcoin futures market rose substantially. Hence, CME’s open interest rose higher than other retail-focused platforms, which also saw a large spike in volume.Second, major institution-focused markets, including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), reported a massive upsurge in institutional inflows. Cointelegraph reported that Grayscale saw a $300 million upsurge in net assets under management (AUM) in one day, albeit the rising BTC price primarily caused the AUM to rise.Third, the options market has also achieved a record-high daily volume, which is also preferred by full-time traders and high-net-worth investors.High profile investors, like Chamath Palihapitiya, the CEO of Social Capital, believes more banks and institutions would soon support Bitcoin. He said:Institutions are primarily exploring Bitcoin as an inflation trade and a long-term allocation, as the billionaire Wall Street investor Paul Tudor Jones said. But technical analysts state that the short to medium-term outlook remains bright for BTC/USD.Bitcoin saw its highest daily candle close since Jan. 15, 2018, meaning the price of BTC is on the verge of breaking out across all time frames.As Cointelegraph reported, traders have emphasized the bullishness of the weekly and monthly log charts of Bitcoin. If BTC remains above $13,000 at the weekly close and stays above $12,500 until the month’s end, it could signify a compelling technical breakout.The confluence of macro as well as a favorable technical structure could further intensify the demand for Bitcoin as institutions are starting to increasingly embrace the world's biggest cryptocurrency."
75,"Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor said he will hold his company’s Bitcoin (BTC) for 100 years, and has no intention of selling it. On Aug. 11, the business intelligence firm announced it had purchased 21,454 BTC for $250 million. This investment is now worth more than $278 million, representing an 11% increase in two months, and has purchased more Bitcoin since.In a new interview with Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal, Saylor said the decision to invest $250 million was informed by a discussion between its board of directors and the firm’s investors, auditor and executives. Saylor explained:Microstrategy decided to restructure its treasury in response to recent global economic uncertainty, looking to explore assets suited to providing a long-term store of value.But after considering a variety of options with a 100-year outlook, Saylor decided Bitcoin was the only option. Tax and fees kill almost all other assets, he concluded, and those that aren’t killed are instead crippled because they are controlled by a CEO, government or country.Bitcoin, on the other hand, is evolving, and over time it gets harder, stronger and faster, Saylor concluded, describing BTC as a “hive of cybernetic hornets protected by a wall of encrypted energy.”When looking at Ethereum as an alternative to Bitcoin, he told Pal it didn’t compare, as they are “still chasing after functionality.” He explained that “it still has to be proven,” adding:The fact that Bitcoin is so big, compared with all other cryptocurrencies, is “the market screaming to you there is a winner, [...] it’s eating the world.”Saylor asserted Bitcoin is the world’s best collateral and doesn’t even compare to gold or any other commodities. He told Pal that if you hold $100 million in cash over 100 years, you will lose 99% of it, and if held in gold, you will still lose 85% at best.Saylor described Bitcoin as performing similar monetary utilities as gold, only better and without the fear of dilution — likening BTC to gold as what steel is to bricks:With Bitcoin, Saylor argued, “anybody can inspect the fact that I own the Bitcoin in one second,” and yet it can be “sent anywhere in the world for $5.” He added that he could liquidate $100 million BTC on “a Saturday afternoon.”Saylor told Pal that many people believe he has weak hands, saying “Ya, Saylor’s going to buy it and he’s going to dump it. He’s going to buy it and then buy another company with it. He’s going to buy it until he gets this profit and do whatever.” But in reality, he isn’t going to sell it, explaining that he is in it for the long haul:Saylor finished the two-hour-long interview by noting that his executives are closely watching developers in the crypto space:"
76,"A report published by Arcane Research has revealed that nearly half of Paxful’s trade volume comes from trade between Bitcoin (BTC) and gift cards.The report found that, “purchasing Bitcoin with gift cards has been the preferred solution on Paxful each month throughout the five-year span analyzed,” and in June accounted for 48% of Paxful’s volume.Paxful processes nearly $40 million in weekly trade, which means up to $20M of BTC is exchanged for gift cards every week. Arcane highlighted the last week of June this year in the report, in which $16.2M BTC was sold for gift cards.Arcane attributes most of Paxful’s volume to demand for remittances from jurisdictions with poorly developed financial services. With more than half of Paxful’s trade by value taking place in the United States, the reports suggest much of the platform’s North American volume represents migrant workers sending funds to their families.Arcane notes that many of these trades are settled at a large discount from market value, suggesting some of these trades may relate to illegal activities:Paxful emerged as the top peer-to-peer (P2P) Bitcoin marketplace after Localbitcoins introduced KYC requirements one year ago for users with more than $1,000 in annual trade volume.While western trading has shifted away from the P2P markets in favor of centralized exchanges since 2016, Arcane notes the volume from emerging “frontier” economies has consistently increased over recent years.Western Europe’s share of worldwide P2P volume has slumped from 20% at the peak of the 2017 bull run to 10% today, while North American trade has fallen from 53% of the globe’s in 2016 to 35% today.Since the start of 2016, P2P volume from Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America has grown from 4% and 1% to 19% and 13% respectively."
77,"The third-quarter decentralized finance boom has resulted in the Ethereum (ETH) network processing more than twice the daily transaction volume of Bitcoin (BTC).According to crypto market data aggregator Messari, the 30-day rolling daily average for Ethereum transaction volume is currently $7 billion, with Bitcoin processing less than $3 billion.If the current trend continues, Messari predicts Ethereum will become the first public blockchain to settle $1 trillion in transfers over a calendar year.Ethereum’s previous strongest calendar year relative to Bitcoin was 2018, when it processed half a billion in volume, which was 59% as much as Bitcoin’s $849 million that year.Bitcoin is on-track for its second-strongest year behind 2018, projected to process $800 million.It’s not a straightforward comparison between the two blockchains, however. With the DeFi bubble largely taking place on top of Ethereum-powered smart contracts, the Ethereum network now processes the volume of an entire sector, while Bitcoin largely represents transfers of value denominated in BTC.Messari’s Ryan Watkins attributes much of Ethereum’s volume spike to increased ERC-20 stablecoin volumes, with the majority of Tether (USDT) transactions now taking place on Ethereum and yield farming-driven demand pushing supply growth of more than 600% for MakerDAO’s Dai stablecoin.Watkins also notes booming on-chain liquidity from decentralized exchanges, with Uniswap and Curve generating more than $20 billion in volume combined during September. DEXs now represent more than 13.6% of total exchange volumes.However, Messari predicts “the next twelve months could come to define the platform wars” in crypto, noting Ethereum’s ongoing high fees as a problem that rival blockchains will seek to solve, alongside “the rise of parallel DeFi ecosystems.”In August, Chris Burniske, a partner at PlaceHolder Capital, asserted that Ethereum and Bitcoin are racing each other to reach the first $1 trillion market cap in crypto."
78,"For novice traders, FOMO can be a heavy burden to bear. Resisting the urge to buy Bitcoin (BTC) after a nearly 15% rally, which saw the price break both the $12K and $13K levels in less than 24 hours, is almost impossible.Professional traders are more experienced and know precisely how to play these FOMO-inducing situations. As data has shown, they were mostly adding shorts up to October 20, right before the $12K rupture.Most investors fail to grasp that being a pro trader does not mean all the emerging trends are played profitably. Instead, surviving when things go wrong is the true mark of success.As BTC rocketed to $13,217, a total of $350 million worth of liquidations occurred, and the futures contract funding rate shows there was not excessive short leverage.Perpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embed rate usually charged every eight hours. When shorts are the ones demanding more leverage, the funding rate goes negative. Therefore, those shorts will be the ones paying up the fees.The above chart shows that such a situation hasn't occurred over the past few weeks, at least not in a significant way. Thus, despite selling ahead of the price surge, top traders were not squeezed out of leveraged short positions.Data show pro traders covered their shorts on Oct. 21 and they remain distanced from placing bullish bets. This action is supported both by crypto exchanges top traders long-to-short ratio and the futures contracts premium.According to Huobi’s long-to-short ratio, there has been no sign of aggressive buying. Data indicates that top traders are not confident that the current rally is sustainable despite some short-covering activity.The long-to-short ratio had been relatively neutral until October 21. Suddenly, top traders decided to short as BTC broke the $12.5K resistance. This morning, as BTC refused to lose ground, those traders started to cover their shorts.Still, at the moment, there are no signs of bullish bets as Huobi’s latest data favoring longs by 10% occurred over two weeks ago.As for OKEx top traders, a similar pattern emerged, although the shorting movement happened ahead of $12K. This indicator remains in favor of shorts, a trend that emerged in mid-September and has been held since then.To confirm whether there has been a change in sentiment, one should monitor the futures contracts premium. Those contracts usually trade with a slight premium on healthy markets across any asset class.Bullish markets will cause futures contract sellers to demand a higher price to postpone settlement instead of making the sale at regular spot markets. If the current $13K level has managed to restore bullish momentum, this should be reflected in this indicator.As Cointelegraph and Digital Assets Data show, the current 1.8% premium matches the same level seen three weeks ago as BTC hovered around $11.5K. This data is further evidence that top traders are not confident in buying BTC despite the 13% price increase since then.Implied volatility is the primary metric that can be extracted from options pricing. Whenever traders perceive an increased risk of larger price oscillations, the indicator will shift higher. The opposite occurs during periods when the price is flat or the expectation of mild price swings.Bitcoin's implied volatility had been in a downtrend during the past six weeks, but yesterday's move seems to have surprised options traders. Not only did the indicator spike from 55% to 70%, the volume traded on options contracts ($575 million) was three times higher than average.The sudden volatility spike and the consequent partial retrace to the current 64% level indicate that some traders were ill-positioned and had to close their positions abruptly.According to the Black-Scholes model, a 15% implied volatility move causes a $14K December call option price to move 40%. This change shows that events like yesterday's are sensitive to leveraged traders, as any leverage above 3x would have been liquidated.Going by the long-to-short ratio and futures contracts premium, there is hardly any relevant buying activity from top traders. This lack of interest raises a yellow flag as on-chain data shows that as the Bitcoin price surged above $13,000, a record-high 22% of the total BTC supply was transacted.This movement could be a potential signal of large entities preparing to sell. Still, one must remember that unless those BTC are transferred to exchanges, over-the-counter (OTC) deals tend to have less price impact.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

79,"Global payments firm PayPal is looking to acquire a crypto asset custody firm, with a report published by Bloomberg on Oct. 23 claiming the company is currently in talks with BitGo Inc.Anonymous sources cited in the report claimed that the two companies may reach an agreement within a matter of weeks. BitGo is a multi-signature custodian that was founded in 2013. In 2018, the company raised $15 million in a round led by Goldman Sachs and Galaxy Digital.However, the deal is believed to be far from certain, with the report noting: “Talks could still fall apart and PayPal could opt to buy other targets.”The rumors follow this week’s announcement that PayPal will be launching crypto payment services from next year, which was the catalyst for a quick double-digit percentage price push for Bitcoin (BTC).Not everyone is overjoyed with PayPal’s potential acquisition, with the official account of Thorchain (Rune) expressing concerns about the decentralization of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), given most of the Bitcoin (BTC) locked in the protocol are stored with BitGo.There goes wBTC.

The majority of wrapped Bitcoin is custodied by BitGo.

PayPal is not a good actor in this space. Position accordingly. https://t.co/bETSfDr88JYesterday, Meltem Demirors, the chief security officer of crypto asset manager CoinShares, predicted that PayPal will seek to launch a stablecoin after the payments company left the governance association for Facebook’s Libra project. "
80,"Bitcoin (BTC) price has again punched through the $13,000 mark after yesterday’s PayPal’s announcement sparked a powerful rally which drove the price to a new 2020 high. Currently sitting near $13,100, Bitcoin price has rallied nearly 10% since the announcement and BTC is now close to overtaking PayPal as the 21st biggest asset by market capitalization.PayPal’s crypto announcement comes two weeks after Square, another payments giant, announced its own foray into Bitcoin by investing roughly 1% of its assets into Bitcoin.According to Lanre Jonathan Ige, a researcher at 21Shares, the continuing trend of large sized investments will be material in bringing institutional interest to Bitcoin. Ige said:However, the recent news from PayPal is more likely to bring the masses to Bitcoin, rather than Bitcoin to institutions. This is because PayPal may bring a more mainstream audience up to speed with the cryptocurrency as an investment vehicle for now and as a payment method in the future, which has been one of the main focus of the Bitcoin community when it comes to mass adoption.According to data from glassnode, Bitcoin currently has over 187 million users or “hodlers”. While impressive, crypto analyst Willy Woo noted that this pales in comparison to PayPal’s 487 million users.By adding Bitcoin, PayPal is bringing the name to a mainstream audience. While it is only possible to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin through PayPal for the time being, the company announced that it would be adding cryptocurrency payment and transfers in 2021. Once this occurs, it could cement Bitcoin’s reputation as a payment and remittance mechanism.Transacting through PayPal and other centralized platforms could even become one of the ways in which Bitcoin is able to scale to a mainstream user base. Centralized transactions (along with other methods like sidechains and lightning network) could be used to alleviate congestion in Bitcoin’s blockchain, allowing it to be used only for bigger transactions that require more safety, transparency or immutable proof of ownership.While it seems that payment processing companies and cryptocurrencies are finding more synergy as time passes, the same can not be said for banks and this struggle is reflected in their stock price.Jon Erlichman, tech correspondent at BNN Bloomberg, noted that assets like Bitcoin, Ether and stocks for payment companies like PayPal and Square were doing quite well this year but since the COVID-19 pandemic, financial stocks have underperformed.To date, the prices of Bitcoin and Ether have appreciated by 80.5% and 217%. Meanwhile, PayPal rallied 99% and Square 186%. Banks like JPMorgan and Bank of America, on the other hand, have lost 28% and 32% respectively. Citigroup has seen its stock value drop by 46% and Wells Fargo has decreased by 58%.As for Bitcoin, it continues to be one of the best performing assets in existence, beating gold and the S&P 500 by a wide margin in 2020.As a growing number of people interact with Bitcoin as an investment vehicle, it is possible that consumers will turn their backs to banks and invest in cryptocurrency.According to experts, Bitcoin may even benefit from what some call the ‘Robinhood effect’, a phenomenon where retail investors with disposable income purchase an asset via fee-free, gamified investing platforms in order to avoid the rigamarole frequently associated with banks.If this happens to BTC, the digital asset could see the same type of hyperbolic investing frenzy that occurred as Robinhood investors poured funds into Tesla earlier this year."
81,"Peter Brandt, a well-regarded veteran trader, recently emphasized the high demand from institutions as a key catalyst for Bitcoin's strong performance.The strong high time frame technical structure of BTC, especially the weekly chart, and the strengthening fundamentals are buoying the market sentiment. In a tweet, Brandt posted the above chart and said:In addition to the rise in trading volume and growing institutional appetite, investors are referring to the logarithmic chart to forecast a broader rally.The log price chart is the most widely used scale by most technical analysts. A logarithmic chart simply means a chart that represents common percent changes with equal spacing in a scale.Raoul Pal, the founder and CEO of Real Vision Group, says Bitcoin's monthly log chart is highly optimistic. He wrote:The technical reason behind the optimism towards the monthly log chart is mainly its clean breakout. Throughout the past four years, $13,000 has acted as a heavy resistance level.As such, on high time frame charts, like the weekly and the monthly chart, BTC always closed below $11,000, except for 2020.Bitcoin's clean technical breakout on the monthly timeframe is leading traders and investors like Brandt and Pal to make strong bullish calls on BTC's price action. As Pal said, “if history rhymes, 2021 is going to be a BIG year.”Apart from the numerous bullish technical and fundamental catalysts, the timing of the current rally is also in favor of a major Bitcoin bull cycle.According to data from Skew, Bitcoin had not had three positive consecutive quarters since 2017. During that year, BTC reached its all-time high at $20,000 following its second block reward halving in 2016.Bitcoin could possibly be on track to record a massively positive gain in the fourth quarter if it stays above $12,000. If so, that could lead to the same bull cycle pattern as 2017. Next year would also present the same post-halving cycle BTC saw in 2017, which further strengthens the narrative of a newfound bull cycle."
82,"On October 20, 2020, the amount of Bitcoin (BTC) held at major exchanges fell below 2.5 million BTC for the first time in two years. Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev opined to Cointelegraph that this trend is driven by the world finally realizing that only Bitcoin offers sound monetary policy:He also noted that the community is resorting more to self-custody solutions, including platforms like Nexo, where they can “tax-efficiently borrow against their assets rather than selling them."" Cointelegraph noted yesterday that the Bitcoin supply is currently diffused more than ever.Alex Mashinsky, co-founder of the Celsius crypto lending platform, told Cointelegraph that the exodus will likely continue unless exchanges begin offering better terms to their customers:From the chart above, we can see that this swing has not impacted all exchanges equally. While balances at BitMEX and Bitfinex were decimated, decreasing by more than half, Binance has continued to accumulate additional funds. Coinbase’s coffers have remained mostly unchanged as well.The growth of DeFi may have also contributed to this trend. The amount of Bitcoin locked on Ethereum through wBTC and renBTC presently exceeds 130,000. Just a few months ago, these numbers were negligible. Another likely culprit is institutional adoption. Aside from the continuous growth of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust Fund, publicly-traded companies like MicroStrategy and Square began adding crypto assets to their treasuries.It seems that there is either a general trend towards users withdrawing Bitcoin from custodial exchanges, or perhaps a few major exchanges are simply losing the trust of their customers. The latter may be a reasonable conclusion, as a mere three platforms (BitMEX, Huobi, and Bitfinex) were responsible for the bulk of the trend — their balances decreased by 390,000 BTC, making them accountable for almost 80% of the total decline."
83,"Bitcoin price has seen a healthy upward tick toward the $13,000 mark in the fourth quarter. At the start of the quarter, Bitcoin (BTC) was in the sub-$11,000 region, and from there, constant rises took the price to the $13,000 mark on Oct. 21 for the first time this year.The price rallied to $13,217, a record high for 2020, before falling to around the $12,750 mark. This upward price movement is certainly indicative of the bullish sentiment held by investors in the current market.The Bitcoin hash rate has also been constantly increasing since the end of the second quarter, reaching its all-time high of 157 exahashes per second on Oct. 17, according to data from BitInfoCharts. The metric estimates the number of hashes per second that the Bitcoin network has performed in the past 24 hours. It signifies the speed at which a miner arrives at a certain hash, which is the number of times a hash function can be computed per second.Thus, the more that BTC is mined, the bigger the hash rate increase. Jay Hao, CEO of OKEx — a cryptocurrency exchange based in Malta — told Cointelegraph that the rising hash rate is good news for the network:However, the rising hash rate also means that miners will also need computing power to be able to mine profitably, due to the increased competition on the network. Hao further elaborated on these nuances, stating that more competition is likely to emerge in the long run, and those with lots of resources will be more successful: “If Bitcoin's price increases this will generate more income for miners but if the price fails to rise and the hash rate increases, it will generate more costs for miners.”Agreeing with the idea that an increasing hash rate indicates bullish sentiment, Tone Vays, the organizer of the Financial Summit, elaborated on what this might mean for Bitcoin miners, including comparing them with the miners of the Ethereum network:Because Bitcoin becomes rarer by the day, as there is only a limited amount of coins that can be mined, it’s important to also consider the role that distribution trends among BTC holders play in the sentiment of the market. According to data released by Blockchain Center, cryptocurrency exchanges currently account for 12.62% of the total distribution of BTC, and this figure is decreasing.The two main reasons for this may be that new holders are purchasing Bitcoin from the secondary market and saving it in cold wallets as a store of value, similar to what traditional investors would do with gold, and the DeFi boom, which may lead some investors to tokenize Bitcoin for quick profits in DeFi markets rather than hold it. As this trend increases the circulation cost of Bitcoin, the price of BTC is bound to go up as exchanges’ size in the token pool decreases.The second important figure is the amount of Bitcoin held by institutional investors and whales, which stands at 3.74% and is increasing incrementally. These large institutional investors are increasing the percentage of Bitcoin in their portfolios, as they see it as a store of value and a hedge against the uncertainty in the traditional market. Hao further stated that “With fewer Bitcoin left and more usage emerging, the Bitcoin price trend would certainly seem to be bullish.”According to market sentiment data tracked by IntoTheBlock — which analyzes on-chain data, exchange signals and derivatives information — the market is currently “mostly bearish,” even as Bitcoin touched $12,900. The large-transactions and net-network-growth indicators point toward the market being slightly bearish, as they are contracting in size due to the aforementioned reasons. As noted by crypto analytics firm Skew, the Bitcoin options markets also indicate “volatility on the upside” for their underlying asset.The current macroeconomic scenario is extremely positive, with United States presidential candidate Joe Biden ahead in the polls and new stimulus check talks resuming. In fact, this has, so far, been the fastest rebound for the U.S. economy in history. Since fears of the pandemic led to market lows in March, U.S. equity stocks have soared, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining more than 59%, the S&P 500 gaining 63%, the small-cap Russell 2000 index gaining 70% and the Nasdaq Composite index gaining 81%. The Nasdaq has even passed the highs it reached before the pandemic.Simultaneously, this has led to the correlation between BTC price and the U.S. equities markets to be higher, along with positive funding rates in the Bitcoin futures market. These are highly encouraging signs for Bitcoin, and the recent BTC purchases by large institutional investors such as Square and MicroStrategy are pushing the short-term bullish sentiment in line with traditional markets through the end of the year.Related: The next big treasure: Corporations buy up Bitcoin as a treasury reserveThe excessive quantitative easing done by governments all over the world to temporarily solve their nations’ economic woes will also have a positive impact on the price of Bitcoin, according to Vays:Even when the traditional market has faced extreme volatility, Bitcoin has held its own, proving its place as a reliable alternative asset and a possible store of value. It’s also finding more uses within the cryptocurrency space, such as the use of tokenized Bitcoin within the DeFi ecosystem. News of PayPal’s Oct. 21 announcement that it will allow crypto payments starting in 2021 has provided a confidence boost to the blockchain industry, as it adds more credibility by presenting Bitcoin as an asset that can be used for day-to-day transactions."
84,"Bitcoin (BTC) has a 7% probability of beating its $20,000 all-time highs by the end of this year, data shows.According to data from on-chain analytics resource Skew, as of Oct. 22, Bitcoin options were moving in favor of higher prices continuing in 2020.At press time, the likelihood of BTC/USD being $20,000 or higher by Dec. 31, 2020 was 7%, with 11% for $18,000.By March 2021, more bets said that Bitcoin would have reclaimed $20,000 (14%), while the figure for June 2021 was 18%.On social media, Skew said that the probability data was “repricing quickly” in the aftermath of Bitcoin hitting $13,200.Bitcoin options price probability chart. Source: SkewAs Cointelegraph reported, the mood among institutional investors remains skewed to the upside despite the higher price levels. The latest commitments of traders (COT) report from CME Group, for example, showed that institutions were overwhelmingly long rather than short BTC.On Wednesday, statistician Willy Woo noted that huge amounts of liquidity had been removed from speculative arenas by investors keen to store coins for the long term. Woo described the event, which involved 250,000 BTC ($3.24 billion), as “the mother of all scoop-ups.”“Where did the supply come from? 250k coins ($2b+ USD) have been scooped off the speculative stock on spot exchanges into HODL,” he tweeted.The organic nature of the behavior which led to the price rise has not gone unnoticed. For Charles Edwards, founder of digital asset manager Capriole, this was a unique phenomenon in Bitcoin’s twelve-year lifespan.“This pump is organically spot driven. There is almost no order book resistance,” he tweeted on Thursday.Nevertheless, Bitcoin futures trading volume has also nearly tripled in the past two days compared to levels seen earlier this month as the price of Bitcoin overcame $12,000.

85,"Since PayPal announced adding Bitcoin (BTC) to its platform, the asset's market cap has exceeded that of PayPal itself. Ironic?At press time, Bitcoin holds a market cap of $239,877,416,968, just recently surpassing PayPal on AssetDash's list of the largest stocks, ETFs, and crypto assets. Bitcoin now holds the 21st spot on the list, with PayPal right below at $238,578,822,000.Whenever a company, asset, or otherwise overtakes a rival in valuation, the crypto space loosely refers to the event as a ""flippening."" In 2017, a number of folks speculated on a potential Ethereum (ETH) flippening, which would see ETH's market cap rise higher than BTC's. As of press time, no crypto asset has ever flippened Bitcoin's market cap.On Oct. 21, PayPal confirmed rumors that it will add Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) to its platform. When used for transactions, the assets will automatically convert into cash on the backend for merchant recipients. Bitcoin saw a standout price performance following the news, which seemingly acted as a catalyst to push the asset's price even higher after a number of bullish days. Over the past 48 hours, BTC's price has soared more than $1,000. UPDATE Oct. 29, 16:31 UTC: This article has been updated, correcting information on PayPal's crypto launch details. "
86,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed $13,000 for the first time since June 2019. The optimism around PayPal supporting crypto purchases led the overall market sentiment to brighten within a short period. Immediately after the PayPal news was reported, the price of Bitcoin increased from $12,300 to $13,200 at the day’s peak. Although the medium-term outlook of the cryptocurrency market remains positive, analysts are not dismissing the likelihood of a pullback.Bitcoin surged 25.5% within a 13-day span from Oct. 8. Initially, the BTC rally began as profits from altcoins and decentralized finance tokens cycled into BTC. Some industry players like Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of derivatives exchange FTX, revealed a cautious stance toward DeFi tokens, admitting that he placed a 200 net Yearn.Finance (YFI) short, equivalent to around $2.75 million. Although the shorts likely have not caused DeFi to slump, it showed that the sentiment around DeFi is dwindling.However, analysts are slightly cautious in the immediate-term in the price trend of Bitcoin. The overwhelming majority of BTC holders are in profit, which could lead investors to take cash out. BTC is also approaching $14,000, which previously acted as a major resistance level for BTC in mid-2019. In June 2019, when BTC hit $13,970 on Binance, it quickly pulled back to as low as $10,525 on the next day. In the 21 days that followed, BTC declined to $9,252, recording a 35% drop.Guy Hirsch, U.S. managing director of eToro’s trading platform emphasized to Cointelegraph that the PayPal news is a “very big deal” as prominent investors and venture capitalists, including Social Capital chairman Chamath Palihapitiya, echo a similar sentiment. The venture capitalist said every major bank is “having a meeting about how to support Bitcoin.”The cryptocurrency market has been particularly optimistic about the prospects of PayPal integrating crypto for two main reasons. First, it follows the Bitcoin support from another major payments conglomerate, Square. Second, it reaffirms the perception of cryptocurrencies as an established asset class. Albeit the positivity around the news, in the short-term, Hirsch said a drop followed by a steady climb could occur:Denis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto exchange and broker Bequant, believes that in the near term, at least, consolidation would lead to a healthier uptrend for BTC rather than an exponential upsurge. There is little resistance between $14,000 and $20,000 due to the previous bull cycle in 2017 ending abruptly. But, Vinokourov said, that does not mean the ride to a new all-time high would be easy.When 98% of Bitcoin addresses are in profit, as Glassnode researchers reported, a profit-taking phase is inevitable. Whether new inflows into the Bitcoin market would offset profit-taking from existing investors and hodlers is the variable in the near term. So currently, exchange inflows is set to become a highly relevant statistic, which recently dropped to a yearly low. If exchange inflows begin to increase again, it would signify that a take-profit pullback is probable, according to Vinokourov. He added:There is a strong possibility that BTC would see a continuation of its ongoing rally after a short consolidation period, as according to the data from Skew, all Bitcoin markets, including spot, derivatives and options, are showing a high level of demand after the PayPal news. Analysts at Skew said, “Bitcoin showing some solid activity following the PayPal news across spot, futures and options. Big sessions.”If Bitcoin sees a profit-taking pullback and consolidates, analysts expect the next range of BTC to form between $12,500 to $13,500 and stay there for the upcoming months until the next breakout. The $12,500 mark is important because it has acted as a strong resistance level, and BTC remaining above confirms it as a stronger support area. The $13,500 to $14,000 area has been a heavy multi-year resistance range.But a tight range under a key resistance level that has pushed BTC down for nearly four years puts BTC in a positive position, placing a new record-high at arm’s length, especially when the next breakout occurs. Another variable for BTC is whether new capital would continue to flow into Bitcoin or diversify into the altcoin market. If the former happens, it would raise the probability of a BTC breakout by the year’s end.There are two likely catalysts that could further spur another breakout of the next Bitcoin range in the medium term. Another major financial institution could announce support for BTC or allocate a fraction of their capital into BTC, fueling retail interest. The institutional demand could also spill over to the retail and spot markets, which are already seeing high daily trading activity.Binance’s Bitcoin/Tether (USDT) trading pair, for instance, has processed $1.3 billion worth of volume in the past 24 hours. While the CME Bitcoin futures market’s open interest has also increased alongside the volume of LMAX Digital and Bakkt, indicating a contango of rising volume across institutional and spot markets. Heading into 2021, the noticeably growing interest toward Bitcoin would likely continuously fuel the appetite for the dominant cryptocurrency."
87,"Famed Wall Street investor and billionaire Paul Tudor Jones said that he likes Bitcoin ""even more than I did then,” referring to his initial investment announced in May 2020.Jones praised Bitcoin on CNBC’s Squawk Box morning show, revealing that he holds a “small single-digit investment” in the asset.His investment thesis remains unchanged — Bitcoin is an excellent hedge against inflation, which is expected to ramp up in the next few years due to central bank intervention. Unprecedented amounts of quantitative easing and balance sheet expansion, in addition to more aggressive commitment to inflation by the Fed, resulted in heightened inflation expectations.Bitcoin, according to Jones, is one of the best “inflation trades” when compared to traditional options like gold, Treasury Inflation-Protected securities, copper and other more complex strategies.“Bitcoin has this enormous contingence of really, really smart and sophisticated people who believe in it,” Jones added. “It’s like investing with Steve Jobs and Apple or investing in Google early.”Paul Tudor Jones is an industry veteran, first rising to fame for correctly predicting the 1987 stock market crash, known as Black Monday. Following his earlier statements, the Bitcoin community buzzed with excitement due to the endorsement. Some predicted that Jones would soon become the largest Bitcoin holder.Some see Jones’s endorsement as a potential icebreaker for more institutional investors, who may feel more confident investing in the asset class after familiar names have already made the leap."
88,"Bitstamp, one of the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency exchanges, is replacing its CEO for the first time.Nejc Kodrič, the firm’s CEO who co-founded Bitstamp back in 2011, is stepping down from his position. He will be moving into a new advisory role on the company’s board of directors, Bitstamp executives told Cointelegraph on Oct. 22.Julian Sawyer, who currently serves as the managing director of the United Kingdom and Europe at major global crypto exchange Gemini, will replace Kodrič, becoming the second CEO in Bitstamp’s history.The replacement is purportedly a response to the dynamic growth of the exchange over the last nine years.Kodrič says that Bitstamp has grown far beyond his initial vision since he founded it years ago. At the time, Bitcoin was trading at just a few cents, and Kodrič managed to set up the exchange in a garage with 1,000 euros, two laptops and a server. Now, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $12,783, while Bitstamp is one of the world’s top crypto exchanges. Kodrič said:Sawyer has over 20 years of banking and fintech experience. In May 2015, Sawyer co-founded Starling Bank, where he served as chief operating officer until 2019. The exec also served as a consultant and advisor to other banks and founded financial management consulting firm Bluerock Consulting.At publishing time, Bitstamp is ranked the eighth-largest crypto exchange by daily trading volume, which is around $373 million, according to data from CoinGecko. The exchange provides trading services for seven major cryptocurrencies, among them Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) and XRP."
89,"In 2017, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) reached as high as $20,000 before crashing rapidly. Now, the same on-chain top signal has reemerged, according to researchers at Glassnode. But besides much stronger fundamentals this time around, the ongoing rally feels significantly different for other reasons.Bitcoin typically pulls back when whales take profit, causing a ripple effect throughout the cryptocurrency market. As such, when the overwhelming majority of the market is in profit, the chances of correction rises.Since the March 2020 crash, when the price of Bitcoin dropped below $3,600 on BitMEX, BTC has rallied 260%. After such a large rally, a consolidation phase or a pullback could cause a healthier rally in the medium term.Glassnode researchers found that the last time 98% of all Bitcoin UTXOs were profitable was in December 2017. After Bitcoin peaked at $19,798 on Dec. 16, 2017, it dropped 45% within six days to $10,961.At the time, many whales and retail investors took profit, causing massive volatility. Glassnode said:However, there are various fundamental and technical differences between the ongoing rally and the 2017 top.First, the current rally of Bitcoin has been far more stable than the parabolic 2017 upsurge, which happened so suddenly that no clear resistance and support levels were established.This time, Bitcoin has been climbing steadily, confirming $10,500, $11,300, $12,000 and $12,500 as key support levels.Second, the overall institutional and spot demand is high, relative to the volume coming from the derivatives market.Following Square, MicroStrategy and Stone Ridge’s high-profile allocations into Bitcoin, the volume of institution-focused platforms surged. LMAX Digital, CME and Bakkt specifically saw trading activity surge significantly since August.When miners, whales and high-net-worth individuals buy and sell Bitcoin, they usually rely on the over-the-counter market.The OTC market allows large trades to be matched with minimum slippage, which otherwise could trigger massive price fluctuations on exchanges.The consistent increase in over-the-counter deals suggests that the appetite for BTC from large investors and institutions is likely rising. Analysts at on-chain data provider CryptoQuant said:The confluence of high volume, a stable uptrend and growing OTC volumes makes new inflows into the Bitcoin market more likely. If the trend is sustained, it may offset potential profit-taking pullbacks in the cryptocurrency market."
90,"Global digital payment giant PayPal might be moving into issuing its own cryptocurrency after officially entering the crypto industry, according to a major industry exec.Meltem Demirors, CSO at digital asset management firm CoinShares, says that she will not be surprised if PayPal issues its own token after the company broke the news of its soon-to-come support for crypto..In an Oct. 21 interview with CNBC’s Fast Money, Demirors claimed that PayPal’s supporting crypto could eventually become a basis for launching its own, stating:Demirors said that PayPal might be interested in launching its own token as the company officially left the Libra Association, the governing body of Facebook’s Libra digital currency project. A member of the association at the project’s launch in June 2019, PayPal left the initiative several months after, claiming that it does not want the regulatory scrutiny over Libra to “bleed into their business.”PayPal CEO Dan Schulman subsequently said that that regulation and compliance are foundational for PayPal as a company trusted worldwide. He also stated that PayPal is developing a product that is “not necessarily competitive with Libra.”On Oct. 21, PayPal officially announced that the company will introduce the ability to “buy, hold and sell” a number of cryptos including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) directly with the PayPal digital wallet. With the new feature, PayPal customers will be able to use their crypto to shop at any of PayPal's 26 million merchants around the globe starting in early 2021."

... then all other fiat currenciesBitcoin’s weekly gains stood at over 15% overnight on Wednesday, as BTC/USD reached $13,200 before reversing to press-time levels of $12,800.The rate of change surprised many and came at a time when many countries’ fiat currencies — specifically those of developing nations — were suffering from the coronavirus and the impact of central banks’ economic reactions to it.The last time that Bitcoin traded at around $13,000, and even when it hit its own all-time highs of $20,000 in late 2017, the economic picture looked very different.In Brazil for example, where 1 BTC now buys more reals than ever before, savers have seen the value of their currency decline by 28% against the U.S. dollar in a single year.At 209 million, Brazil formed the largest country by population on Milne’s list. The others include Turkey, Argentina and Venezuela, with the total population of all countries involved standing at 450 million.Milne additionally forecast that Russia and Colombia would soon join, followed at some point in time by “all other fiat currencies.”Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s inverse correlation to the U.S. dollar currency index remained in focus as its bull run took hold.Measuring USD strength against a basket of trading partner currencies, DXY declined during October to press-time levels of 92.72, coinciding with fresh strength in BTC.U.S. dollar currency index 1-month chart. Source: TradingViewThe impact of the upcoming U.S. elections may produce further USD volatility, analysts warned.“If the DXY closes below the structure in the 92.5 zone, this would support any inflation assets like commodities and gold, as well as growth stocks,” Miles Ruttan of Bytown Capital wrote earlier in the month.The extent of Bitcoin’s growth has nonetheless led to announcements that it has left behind its correlation to traditional macro assets."
92,"On Oct. 21 Bitcoin (BTC) price overtook the $13K mark to reach $13,217 after traders took out key resistance levels at $11,900, $12,000, and $12,500 in the last 48-hours. While there are various technical reasons behind the abrupt upsurge, there are three key factors buoying the rally.The three catalysts are a favorable technical structure, PayPal enabling cryptocurrency purchases, and Bitcoin's rising dominance rate.Earlier today, PayPal officially announced that it is allowing users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin.Throughout the past year, speculations on PayPal’s potential cryptocurrency integration continuously intensified after various reports claimed the company was working on it.In an official statement, Dan Schulman, the president and CEO of PayPal, confirmed the cryptocurrency integration. He wrote:Following PayPal’s statement, the price of Bitcoin immediately rose from around $12,300 to as high as $12,900.Sui Chung, the CEO of CF Benchmarks, a subsidiary of Kraken exchange, told Cointelegraph that bullish sentiment is likely returning to the crypto market. According to Chung:In the past week, Bitcoin has outperformed alternative cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, and Ethereum.Josh Olszewicz, a cryptocurrency technical analyst, said the dominance of BTC is above a key moving average. Technically, this suggests that Bitcoin could continue to outperform altcoins in the near term. Olszewicz said:Throughout October, traders have pinpointed the favorable technical structure of Bitcoin on the higher time frames.Bitcoin's weekly chart, in particular, has shown a breakout and surpassed the previous local top achieved in August.Two months ago, BTC topped out at $12,468 on Binance and proceeded to fall below $10,000. As mentioned earlier, today's high volume surge took the price to a new 2020 high at $13,217, which is well above the previous local top.In the short-term, traders anticipate that the market will cool down after such a strong rally. Flood, a pseudonymous crypto futures trader, said:"
93,"Bitcoin (BTC) has rallied above $13,000 for the first time since July, and only the third time since the all-time high bull run of late-2017.The move follows the long-sustained period of five-figure price action, with BTC having spent nearly the entirety of the past 12 weeks trading above $10,000.The spike was triggered by news that the global payments giant PayPal is launching support for Bitcoin, in addition to Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan said the rally was almost entirely driven by PayPal.BTC is up 10% over the past 24 hours, while ETH is up 8%,  BCH is up 9% and LTC is up more than 15% today.While Ether has rallied alongside Bitcoin, ETH has failed to maintain its strength relative to Bitcoin since rallying into the low-mid $400s amid the decentralized finance boom in August. Ether is currently testing resistance at $400.In response to the news from PayPal, Alex Mashinsky, CEO of crypto lending platform Celsius, said:"
94,"As Bitcoin (BTC) breaks the $12,000 resistance, derivatives markets are flirting with overly excessive bullish sentiment. The futures basis and the options 25% delta skew both reached the same levels seen now on October 12 when BTC briefly tested $11,700 but failed to maintain momentum.What differentiates the current situation from nine days ago is the positions of top crypto traders. On Oct. 12, these traders increased their longs, but during the recent move to $12,000 these professional traders are opening up short positions.Despite this flip in sentiment, traders should not automatically conclude that today’s pump will turn into a flop exclusively based on the longs-to-shorts indicator. For starters, there is no way to know for sure how the top traders are positioned off-exchange.For this reason, derivatives pricing is a better way to assess how bullish or bearish professional traders might be. This indicator focuses on the actual market conditions, whereas both the fear and greed and options put-to-call ratio are backward-looking.Futures markets tend to trade at a slight premium to regular spot exchanges. This event is not exclusive to crypto markets but rather a derivatives effect.The futures contracts premium (or basis) should range between a 5% to 10% annualized rate for healthy markets. Figures above this range denote excessive optimism, as traders bet on much higher prices. In the opposite situation, a negative futures contract premium indicates bearish sentiment.The above chart shows how the basis indicator has been flirting with over-optimistic levels, similar to what happened on October 12.Traders should not mistake optimism with leverage as a positive funding rate on perpetual contracts is also needed to confirm this thesis.The perpetual futures funding rate settles every 8 hours on most exchanges, and a fee is paid from longs (buyers) to shorts whenever the funding rate is positive. This situation would be the defining characteristic of overleveraged buyers, but that hasn’t been the case so far.The data above shows how volatile the funding rate has been, although there has not been any sustained funding periods. The standard measure for this indicator is 8 hours. Therefore a 0.05% rate is equivalent to 1% per week. The opposite holds for a negative funding rate when shorts are the ones paying it.As for the BTC options market, there has been a similar movement as the 25% delta skew indicator entered the overconfident bullish territory. A negative skew indicates calls (buy) options cost more than similar puts (sell) options, thus indicating bullish sentiment. On the other hand, a positive skew suggests bearishness.Take notice how close the skew indicator is to its lowest levels in 6 months, indicating traders’ optimism. This situation is the same as October 12, when BTC gained 10% in 4 days. Although nothing is barring the skew indicator from remaining at the current level for extended periods, it is unlikely in BTC history.After reading derivatives market indicators, one might conclude that professional traders are leaning bullish by adding long positions above $12K. Except, exchange-provided data on top traders long-to-short net ratios shows this hasn’t been the case.There are often discrepancies between exchanges' methodologies, so readers should monitor changes instead of absolute figures. According to the above data, it is safe to say that top clients were either neutral or adding long positions ahead of Oct. 12.On the other hand, there has been a sizable move in both exchanges over the past two days as top traders were more active on the sell-side when BTC approached $12K.Therefore, regardless of derivatives indicators’ bullishness, these traders are signaling a lack of short-term optimism.These seemingly opposing signals could reflect the recent 15% hike in two weeks, causing some traders to realize gains. Even though derivatives markets continue to favor a bullish trend, top traders appear to see no reason to add to long positions at the current levels.Although the top traders call seems to have failed for now, they appear to be in no rush to FOMO at the current levels. Until these begin building some substantial long positions above $12K, this support level cannot be deemed strong enough.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

95,"The crypto markets are cheering PayPal’s decision to allow its customers to use cryptocurrencies to shop from its vast merchant network. PayPal also revealed that U.S. account holders will be able to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies in the PayPal app. The company plans to extend this service to a few other countries in the first half of 2021. PayPal’s decision has significantly increased the reach of cryptocurrencies. Now, many of the company’s 346 million active users will have the options to engage with cryptocurrencies and become investors if they choose.However, a mass influx of investors into cryptocurrencies is likely to take more time. Ultimately, this move by PayPal proves that companies cannot ignore the rise of digital assets anymore.Although the news is bullish, a vertical rally may not materialize immediately. After the initial buying frenzy dies down, the extent of any future correction will confirm whether a new roaring bull market has begun or if institutional investors used this news to lighten up their positions in order to buy at lower levels.Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies and spot the critical levels to watch out for.Bitcoin (BTC) soared above the resistance line of the ascending channel on Oct. 20. That was followed by a sharp up-move today when the bulls propelled the price above the stiff overhead resistance at $12,460.A new 52-week high is generally a bullish sign. The breakout of the ascending channel gives the BTC/USD pair a target objective of $12,975. If this level is crossed, the rally may extend to $14,000.The current up-move has pushed the relative strength index to 80. Previous instances show that the risk of a correction increases when the RSI rises above 80.The first sign of weakness will be a break and close (in UTC) below the previous resistance turned support at $12,000.Conversely, if the bulls can arrest the next correction at $12,000, it will signal strength and increase the possibility of a resumption of the up-move.Ether (ETH) has held above the 20-day exponential moving average ($370) for the past few days. The failure of the bears to break this support has attracted buying from the aggressive bulls who are trying to sustain the price above the overhead resistance at $395.If they succeed, it will complete an ascending triangle pattern that has a target objective of $478. The gradually upward-sloping 20-day EMA and the RSI above 61 suggest a marginal advantage to the bulls.However, the bears are unlikely to throw in the towel so easily. They will attempt to defend the overhead resistance at $395. If the ETH/USD pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the uptrend line, it will signal weakness.XRP is currently range-bound between $0.26 and $0.2295. After failing to sustain above the moving averages for the past two days, the altcoin has made a decisive move higher today.If the bulls can sustain the momentum and push the price above $0.26, the XRP/USD pair will complete an inverse head and shoulders pattern. This setup has a target objective of $0.30.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls fail to push the price above $0.26, the bears will again try to sink the price below the moving averages. If they succeed, the pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) broke down and closed (in UTC) below the critical support at $242 on Oct. 20, but the bears could not capitalize on this weakness.The BCH/USD pair has surged today, which shows strong buying by the bulls and short covering by the aggressive bears who may have opened short positions hoping for a fall to $200.If the bulls can sustain the momentum and push the price above $266.46, the pair could rally to $280 and then to $300. The bounce in the RSI from 50 shows strength.This positive view will be invalidated if the bears sell the current rally and sink the pair below the $237.69.Binance Coin (BNB) broke and closed (in UTC) below the $29.5646 support and the 20-day EMA ($29) on Oct. 21. However, the bears could not capitalize on this advantage by intensifying selling.The bulls are currently attempting to push the price back above the downtrend line. If the BNB/USD pair closes above the downtrend line, a rally to $31.9798 and then to $33.3888 is possible.Conversely, if the price turns down from the current levels, the bears will once again attempt to sink the pair below the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the pair could decline to the 50-day simple moving average of $27.Chainlink (LINK) turned down from the overhead resistance at $11.199 on Oct. 19 and plunged below the moving averages on Oct. 20.However, the bulls are not willing to surrender without a fight. They are currently attempting to push the price above the $11.199–$11.8029 overhead resistance zone.If they succeed and the LINK/USD pair closes above the resistance zone, it will complete an ascending triangle pattern that has a target objective of $15.On the contrary, if the pair once again turns down from the overhead resistance, the bears will try to sink the price below the uptrend line. If that happens, a decline to $8.3817 is possible.The bulls are struggling to push Polkadot (DOT) above the 20-day EMA ($4.14) and the bears are finding it difficult to sink the price below $3.80. This has kept the altcoin stuck inside a tight range.Usually, a squeeze is followed by expansion. If the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA, the DOT/USD pair could move up to $4.6112 and that could be followed by a rally to $5.5899.The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has risen sharply to the midpoint. This suggests that the selling pressure has reduced.However, if the price once again turns down from the overhead resistance and slips below $3.80, a retest of the $3.5321 is possible.Litecoin (LTC) price soared today and has reached the critical $51–$52.36 overhead resistance zone. If the altcoin can close above this zone, it will complete an inverse head and shoulders pattern.This bullish reversal pattern has a target objective of $61. The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI has risen above 63, which suggests an advantage to the bulls.However, the bears will pose a stiff challenge in the resistance zone. If the pullback from the current level is shallow, it will suggest that traders are not booking profits at the resistance and this will increase the possibility of the start of a new uptrend.On the contrary, if the price turns down from the current levels and the bulls fail to arrest the decline above $50, the LTC/USD pair may again drop down to the moving averages.The bulls have once again purchased the dip to the support line of the rising wedge pattern. They will now try to push Cardano (ADA) to the resistance line of the wedge.However, it is unlikely to be an easy task because the flat 20-day EMA ($0.10) and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. The bears will try to stall the recovery at the downtrend line.If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the bears will make one more attempt to drag the ADA/USD pair below the wedge.On the other hand, if the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, a move to the resistance line of the wedge is possible. A breakout of the wedge could start a new uptrend.Bitcoin SV (BSV) largely remains range-bound between $180.63 and $146.20. The bulls are currently attempting to sustain the price above the moving averages. If they can do that, the altcoin could move up to the downtrend line and then to $180.63.On the other hand, if the price turns down from the downtrend line, the bears will try to sink the BSV/USD pair to $146.20.Currently, the flattish moving averages and the RSI close to the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.The next trending move could start after the bulls push the price above $180.63 or the bears break the support at $146.20. Until then, volatile range-bound action is likely to continue.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

96,"A significant amount of Bitcoin's (BTC) total supply has not moved for more than 10 years, according to data from cryptocurrency analytics data provider Glassnode.During this decade-long interim, 1.8 million Bitcoin (of the current 18.5 million supply) has been locked in dormant Bitcoin addresses. Its cumulative value amounts to more than $23 billion at the time of publication, according to data from Coin360.A large portion of these coins may belong to Bitcoin’s mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto — who disappeared from the community in 2011. Nakamoto may own over 1 million of these as-yet untouched assets, which are purported to be lost forever.Despite the large number in stagnation, some previously uncirculated Bitcoin began to move for the first time in May. One wallet containing coins from February 2009 suddenly sent 50 BTC to two different addresses without warning or explanation. People in the blockchain community subsequently suggested three main scenarios: These coins may have belonged to the family of late cryptographer Hal Finney, early developer Martti Malmi or possibly Satoshi Nakamoto themself. This speculation was largely denied by the parties in question, except for Nakamoto, who remains elusive."
97,"What feels better than watching Bitcoin (BTC) skyrocket on bullish mass-adoption news? For hodlers, there aren't too many events in life more satisfying than a trip to the moon — and now the rest of the world seems to be catching on.Bitcoin, it seems, is outstripping sex — at least when it comes to Reddit users — which may come as little surprise to those of us who spend time on the ""front page of the internet.""Reddit enjoys a massive audience of 440 million users and has been a popular destination for Bitcoin enthusiasts since very early days. But while the r/Bitcoin audience has swollen dramatically since 2017, r/Sex has been somewhat tepid for years.Since Reddit user u/farmingOnYieldApp made this observation last night, the number of r/Bitcoin subscribers has increased to 1,707,689, perhaps propelled by the PayPal announcement, while the number of Redditors talking about sex has not changed much at all and stands at just over 1.69 million. The world really is performing an about-face.Bitcoin is also more popular than the Beatles, which had a terrific '69 of their own — that was the year they released ""Come Together"" and ""I Want You."" Sadly, the Liverpudlian pop phenoms only have 118,258 subscribers. The r/Jesus subreddit is fairly deserted, but if we extrapolate from the r/Christianity subreddit (258,121 devoted members), Bitcoin may even be more popular than Jesus among Redditors. And speaking of Bitcoin Jesus, the subreddit that supports the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) community has only 328,882 followers. Roger Ver will be pinning his hopes on a resurrection of interest in BCH now that PayPal will be supporting the cryptocurrency.Despite its growing popularity, Bitcoin has a long way to go before it becomes ""Mildly Interesting"" — this subreddit has a remarkable 18.2 million subscribers. R/Gaming and r/Sports also make Bitcoin look small and insignificant.Meanwhile, there is a happy ending for those who can’t make up their mind between Bitcoin and sex — Pornhub accepts Bitcoin for its premium services."
98,"As Bitcoin's price broke through resistance at $12,000, its on-chain transfer volume exceeded 4 million and set a 14-month record high.Unlike exchange volume, on-chain metrics cannot be easily faked or manipulated. To put this in perspective, the total current supply of Bitcoin (BTC) is 18.5 million. This means that in 24 hours, users transacted 22% of Bitcoin's total current supply.If we examine the 30-day average for this metric, we discover that Sept. 30 marked a three-year high, and the overall trend appears even more prominent.At the same time, the number of addresses with non-zero balances and those holding at least 0.01 BTC has also set new highs. It appears that at least some of the extra volume was generated by Bitcoiners diffusing their wealth. It is also possible that this was driven by the influx of new investors testing the waters with small acquisitions.Meanwhile, payments giant PayPal announced that it will soon allow users in the United States to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrency in its wallets."
99,"Bitcoin has risen dramatically in market capitalization over the years, recently taking its place among the top 25 largest companies and assets by market cap. At press time, Bitcoin (BTC) holds a market value near $240 billion. The coin is 22nd on a list of the top 100 stocks, exchange-traded funds and cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, according to AssetDash. Apple holds the number-one spot, standing at a $2 trillion evaluation, followed by Microsoft and Amazon, respectively. Bitcoin had a bullish day of price action following significant news from the payments processing network PayPal. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is only a single position behind PayPal, which holds the 21st spot.Bitcoin's market cap is not the highest it has ever been, however.

101,"A cloud cryptocurrency software provider that aims to make automated trading simple says it now has over 70,000 active users and over 7,000 active trading bots, with almost 3 million deals completed successfully since its launch.TradeSanta’s software can be connected to seven major exchanges, including Binance, Huobi, OKEx and HitBTC. The company says setting up an account is simple, and trading bots can be set up in under two minutes.From here, long and short bots can be utilized to take advantage of bull and bear markets alike, and technical indicators can be relied upon to open trades at opportune moments. TradeSanta notes it allows large volumes of crypto to be traded without affecting the value of the underlying assets — and better still, users can track their bot’s progress anywhere thanks to transparent analytics and Telegram notifications.TradeSanta says it has had a busy 2020 as it unveils brand-new features.So far this year, it has added a plethora of technical indicators, including Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI). Virtual and manual trading terminals were also unveiled. Moreover, one of the company’s priorities has involved expanding to new markets worldwide. To this end, TradeSanta’s services are now available in Russian, Spanish and Japanese.Next, the company is planning to unveil a trailing take profit feature, meaning that traders can maximize the opportunity to capitalize on price movements. This tool means that the figure at which a cryptocurrency is sold rises in line with an increase in the digital asset’s value.As an example, let’s imagine that someone buys 1 BTC for $10,000 and sets a trailing take profit of 5%. If Bitcoin were to subsequently rise to $12,000, the trailing take profit would rise alongside it, keeping a distance of $600. This means that if BTC were to suddenly slump down to $9,500, the trader would exit their position at $11,400, thereby protecting $1,400 of profit that would have been lost if Bitcoin’s price dips below $10,000.Further improvements are planned in the coming months, with TradeSanta planning to make enhancements to its stop loss feature, optimize its dashboard, and deliver a better user experience. Futures trading will also be supported, with Binance Futures one of the first platforms to be onboarded.Looking ahead to the final quarter of 2020, users will be able to share bot settings and copy trading strategies with the highest levels of performance. A profit tracker will be able to set and follow trading goals, and a new one-click feature will enable coins to be sold immediately from the TradeSanta dashboard.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, TradeSanta believes there are many advantages to using more than one cryptocurrency exchange, as doing so gives consumers access to a more diverse range of trading pairs. It’s even possible to benefit from arbitrage, where one trading platform sells Bitcoin more cheaply than another.Moreover, the company aims to eliminate the downsides of maintaining multiple logins by linking all of these exchanges to its cloud-based software.Four subscription tiers are offered for TradeSanta’s service. A free package allows users to operate up to two bots with maximum trading volumes of $3,000 a month. The basic package costs $14 a month and is paid a year in advance, offering up to 49 bots, which first-time users can make use of in a free three-day trial. The advanced tier unlocks access to 99 bots for $20 a month on an annual basis, while the maximum plan delivers unlimited bots at a discounted rate of $30 a month — 50% off the usual price.Disclaimer.

105,"Bitcoin (BTC) abandoning correlation with traditional markets will be its “biggest story” if it continues, one popular analyst says.In a series of tweets on Oct. 21, Cole Garner highlighted Bitcoin’s market decoupling among bullish price factors.Garner retweeted a chart of Bitcoin, gold, the S&P 500 and Ether (ETH), which shows Bitcoin striking out on its own, delivering positive returns while other assets floundered.The chart originated from Eric Wall, CIO of crypto hedge fund Arcane Assets, who described the trend as “unusual.”“BTC’s correlation to traditional markets appears to be unwinding. If this persists in the coming weeks, it’ll be the biggest story in crypto,” Garner commented.Bitcoin (orange) vs. gold, S&P 500 and Ethereum. Source: Eric Wall/ TwitterBitcoin previously demonstrated long-term correlation to the S&P 500 in particular, also forming a close relationship to gold in the months after March’s coronavirus-induced price crash.Others have previously noted the now-decaying trend, among them statistician Willy Woo, who in September forecast that it would continue.Also buoying the mood for Garner is the “amazingly neutral” funding rate across perpetual swaps on exchanges.Despite Bitcoin’s latest gains which took it above $12,000, the funding rate suggests support for longs at the expense of shorts — an encouraging sign for further upward momentum.Coupled to this is institutional investor sentiment, which from last weekend’s commitment of traders (COT) report is firmly long, not short.As Cointelegraph reported, BTC/USD suddenly retook $12,000 overnight on Tuesday, having spent time tackling the pivotal resistance point of $11,900.As Garner and others note, very little stands in the way of further positive price action above $12,000 due to how Bitcoin spent the brief periods of time above that level before.“Skies are mostly clear above $12K across exchange orderbooks,” he summarized.Other factors remain from previous weeks and months, notably the lack of inflows from whales, suggesting that the desire to sell large amounts of BTC remains low. Exchange balances are in fact continually dropping despite the price rises, data shows.Bitcoin exchange balances vs. price with latest drop highlighted. Source: Cole Garner/ GlassnodeConcluding, Garner’s only concern was that, if Twitter sentiment is a reliable measure, few hodlers expected the current scenario.“Too many people were unprepared for this,” he wrote, linking to a recent survey in which 35% of respondents claimed that Bitcoin made up less than 10% of their crypto portfolio."
106,"The average value of Bitcoin (BTC) transactions has increased dramatically since July this year. The average transaction value was sitting at approximately $25,000 per transaction four months ago, but posted a yearly high on Oct. 20 at $151,000 per transfer — representing an increase of more than 500%.The latest spike, as shown by crypto analytics platform BitInfoCharts’ data, saw the average value of a transaction increase almost $50,000, up from $105,000, in the last 48 hours. This surge in transaction value comes shortly after Bitcoin’s trading dominance rose to levels not seen since 2017.The $151,000 average value is 190 times more than Ethereum’s average transaction value of $793, suggesting a significantly greater institutional presence in the Bitcoin markets.However, the number of daily Ethereum transactions increased by 30% amid the DeFi boom in August, reaching a two-year high of 1.29 million on Aug. 10. Over the same period, Bitcoin transactions consistently hovered between 300,000 and 350,000, suggesting the Ethereum ecosystem was the primary magnet for new crypto users.The number of Bitcoin active addresses also showed no significant changes, fluctuating between 650,000 and 970,000 over the last four months.Accumulation figures show that institutional investors are starting to take notice as large investment firms such as Grayscale and Microstrategy increased their accumulation of large amounts of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies over the last few months.By the end of September, Grayscale controlled at least 449,900 BTC or 2.4% of the current supply of Bitcoin, while Microstrategy owned 38,250 BTC.Two weeks later, Jack Dorsey’s Square purchased 4,709 BTC (approximately $50 million) in Bitcoin."
107,"On Tuesday Bitcoin (BTC) bulls mustered enough strength to push BTC price slightly above the $12K mark, a level not seen since Sept. 1. The move occurred after Monday’s (Oct. 19) high volume surge to $11,822 was followed by continued buying into Tuesday, providing enough momentum for bulls to push above the ascending channel to $12,038.The rally to $12K was also accompanied by soaring volumes across the top Bitcoin futures exchanges on Monday through Tuesday, and earlier this week Cointelegraph reported that the most recent CME commitment of traders report shows institutional longs reached a record-high.At the start of the week traditional markets took a hit as investors feared a stalemate between Democrats and Republican lawmakers in Congress would prevent the passing of a second round of economic stimulus aimed at alleviating the financial pressure placed on small businesses and Americans in need of a second stimulus check.Fortunately, by  today’s market closure the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq wrapped the day up with marginal gains.Notably, the Dow closed 100 points higher after U.S. House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi said she felt “optomistic” about a deal being struck between the Congress and the White House.Bitcoin’s recent price action has been somewhat dislodged from that of equities markets, leading some analysts on crypto Twitter to again call for a ‘decoupling’ but this all seems a bit premature.Regardless where one stands on Bitcoin price decoupling from traditional markets, the digital asset remains one of the top performers for 2020, currently up 65.4% year-to-date.Bitcoin bulls must flip $12K to supportToday’s daily high at $12,038 is only $10 away from the previous high on Sept.1 when Bitcoin price formed a tweezer top and corrected 18.5% over the next few days. So naturally, traders have expressed mixed emotions about the price hovering near $12,000 again, especially considering that the last 5 visits to this resistance were followed by sharp sell-offs.Price action wise, when an ascending channel is trendline is broken near a key resistance level, it’s normal for some profit booking to take place, and this typically results in the price dropping to retest either the ascending channel trendline or a former resistance like $11,900 to determine whether or not buyers remain bullish enough to confirm the level as support.On the 4-hr timeframe we can see that this is what has occurred as the price dropped to $11,850 as investors pulled in profits.At the time of writing, BTC is trading around $11,940 and with less than 2-hours until the daily close, a push to secure $12,000 before the day ends would be a positive sign.Given the recent importance of the $12K level, multiple failed attempts to overcome the resistance or a clear loss of momentum might motivate bearish traders to open short positions from $11,900-$12,000. This would heighten the possibility of a repeat of the previous sell-offs from 12K.As mentioned in a previous analysis, Bitcoin price has support at the 20-MA ($11,600) and at the $11,500-$11,400 level. If the price were dip below the ascending channel midline, there is also support at $11,200 and $10,900.Over the next day or so some consolidation in the $11,950 to $11,800 zone could lead to the formation of a bull flag or a pennant so traders should keep an eye on the 4-hour chart and volume across the 1-hour to 4-hour timeframe.A push to the daily high ($12,038) would put the price back at a key resistance level (see dotted blue line) which if flipped to support would put Bitcoin price back on the path to securing a new 2020 high.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

108,"On Oct. 14, Wilshire Phoenix investment firm released its Efficient Price Discovery report, which detailed how CME Bitcoin (BTC) futures impact Bitcoin price discovery.The firm concluded that ""CME Bitcoin futures contribute more to price discovery than its related spot markets."" And the researchers also suggested that:Wilshire's analysis correctly states that price discovery in traditional markets is a contested topic. The report also adds that studies on price formation often find that the futures markets lead most of the time, but this doesn't mean their conclusions about CME Bitcoin futures are absolute.According to the report, CME Group, the leading derivatives venue, trades $5.15 trillion per day across its multiple markets. According to Nasdaq data, this number compares to the $430 billion in daily volume seen in the U.S. stock market.This data shows that the trend of derivatives volumes surpassing spot exchanges by tenfold is the norm rather than an exception.U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) documents show that In June, Wilshire Phoenix filed for a publicly tradable Bitcoin-backed fund similar to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.It is important to note that the Bitcoin held by Wilshire's fund will follow a BTC price index called the Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR) listed by the CME.In the report, Wilshire Phoenix explained that the CME Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR) is used to determine the price on which BTC futures contracts are cash-settled in U.S. dollars.For CME and aspirant funds based in the U.S., it might make sense to exclude stablecoin volumes and focus on more regulated exchanges. Even if Bitcoin price discovery does not happen there, arbitrage efficiency has grown over the years, according to a 2019 Bitwise Investments report.Analysis from Bitwise found that ""arbitrage between these ten exchanges is virtually perfect."" Therefore, by not having sustained price discrepancies, the CME reference index can comfortably select a handful of exchanges, excluding the top three.Although the latest Bitwise Bitcoin ETF proposal has been withdrawn, its price formation was different from its competitors. Using a broader base, it also included stablecoin based exchanges.Those familiar with cryptocurrency markets will know that stablecoin market caps, trading volumes, altcoin pairings, and their impact on the crypto market have increased immensely over the past two years.Not only has the stablecoin market capitalization risen eightfold to $21 billion in the past two years, but the dominance of stablecoin pairs and their trading volumes have also grown significantly.Take notice of how the top Bitcoin pairs are Tether (USDT) based. Even more worrisome is that the CME excludes the three leading exchanges from the Bitcoin Reference Rate.The above data leads to a significant difference in exchanges' selection from more inclusive indexes such as Bitwise’s ‘Real Bitcoin Trade Volume’, Messari’s ‘Real Volume’, and Nomics ‘Transparent Volume’. Regardless of the reasons behind CME’s exchange selection, its BRR index excludes the top three exchanges, according to Messari’s 24-hour data.Wilshire Phoenix’s report is a step in the right direction, and the study has an impeccable methodology. There is enough evidence to support their conclusion that the CME Bitcoin futures lead price formation compared to regulated USD fiat exchanges.Although well-executed, the analysis does not disprove that Bitcoin price formation happens on Binance, Bitfinex, Huobi, or OKEx. Institutional investors, principally those based in the U.S., may not be interested in less regulated exchange volumes or Bitcoin pricing in stablecoins, but that does not mean those are irrelevant for the price formation.As for the retail investor, using a broader set of exchanges and pricing makes more sense to test price discovery for an asset like Bitcoin. This conclusion is not equivalent to stating that CME's Bitcoin Reference Rate is wrong or easily manipulated.Are less-regulated exchanges inflating volumes by using market makers and large clients paying barely zero fees? Is Tether’s volatility too high to even consider when attempting to determine whether it impacts Bitcoin price formation in USD? These are all valid questions that warrant further discussion and investigation.Therefore, a broader evaluation is necessary before concluding whether CME Bitcoin futures have the highest contribution to price discovery.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

109,"Within the past few hours, Bitcoin price rose to $11,988 before pulling back to hover around the $11,900 level. The price is on the cusp of breaking above $12,000, and some analysts have suggested that the dominant cryptocurrency is in the process of decoupling from the rest of the market, including U.S. equities.The general sentiment around Bitcoin (BTC) among analysts and traders remains positive, and multiple on-chain analysts say that Bitcoin has been behaving like a safe-haven asset.Technical analysis suggests that first, the $12,000 resistance level needs to be flipped to support, and previous price action around this level suggests that it will be hard for BTC to surpass it cleanly in its first retest.On-chain analyst Willy Woo has consistently been positive about the current Bitcoin price cycle.Woo emphasized that BTC showing correlation with U.S. stocks in the near term makes perfect sense, but over the long term, the analyst noted that decoupling was inevitable. He said:While the fundamentals remain optimistic for Bitcoin, technical analysts and traders are wary about BTC at $12,000. Historically, the $12,000 level has acted as a strong resistance area for BTC.A pseudonymous trader known as “Salsa Tekila” said that he remains careful as Bitcoin pulls closer to the $12,000 level. The trader wrote:In addition to Bitcon’s favorable technical structure, the confluence of preferable macro factors are buoying the sentiment around BTC.Heading into the Nov. 3 United States presidential election, risk-on assets are demonstrating a high level of uncertainty. This has caused the U.S. dollar index to decline, causing alternative stores of value to rally.Traders are pointing to the spot market as the primary driver of today’s bullish move. Meanwhile, the futures market is cautious, but spot traders are continuing to accumulate BTC.Derivatives trader Cantering Clark noted that there is not much buyer demand in the futures market. He said:Previous bull cycles were led mostly by the futures market, particularly by BitMEX and Binance Futures. If the spot and futures market are showing contrasting directions, it could spark significant volatility in the short term.If Bitcoin cleanly breaks $12,000, traders believe the momentum would lead to the formation of a new uptrend.

110,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) had to hold the crucial support level between $11,100-11,300, and it did. After this support test, the price of BTC continued to surge upward on Oct. 20, reaching the crucial resistance area between $11,900-12,200.This upward move came along with weakness in the dollar, as the U.S. Dollar Currency Index (DXY) dropped substantially.

Is the attention shifting back to Bitcoin? XBT/USD 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewThe weekly is showing one massive crucial level that’s been a hurdle for Bitcoin in the previous years. It’s the resistance area between $11,700-12,300. If that level is broken to the upside, a strong move toward $17,000 is likely to occur.It would also mean the start of the new cycle with more and more arguments to be made at the beginning of a new bull cycle. However, it doesn’t mean that a breakthrough is imminent as the construction is ripe for further range-bound movements. The main argument for a breakout upward would be the weakness of the U.S. Dollar.The U.S. Dollar has been showing weakness since the massive crash in March 2020, causing the prices of gold, silver and Bitcoin to surge heavily.U.S. Dollar Currency Index 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe DXY is a great indicator to derive momentum on other “safe haven” assets like gold, silver and Bitcoin. Of course, when there’s a definite crisis occurring on the markets, the run to cash and the dollar is expected. However, in the recent period, there’s been a run out of the dollar. One of the primary arguments for this DXY weakening is the infinite QE provided by the FED, announcing trillions in new stimulus packages. As the dollar has been showing weakness, Bitcoin continued to climb since the March crash. Similarly, the U.S. Dollar Currency Index rejected at 94.64 points in recent days and continued its freefall. The last support level to hold is the 93 points area. If that is lost, new lows will be imminent for the U.S. Dollar currency index, which would only add momentum for Bitcoin. Gold vs. DXY Index 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewAs the chart shows, the dollar has been showing weakness ever since the Dot.com bubble popped and started to retrace heavily.During this period, the strength of gold intensified and the price surged 600% amid the USD’s weakness. In the first part of the crisis (2000, which also saw a run toward cash), gold dropped 30%, but then its strength increased after this dropdown. Such a correlation has also been seen in Bitcoin recently as BTC has been moving in lockstep with gold in recent months. A conclusion can be drawn that investors seek safe assets as a hedge against a weakening U.S. Dollar.BTC Dominance 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewAltcoins are getting crushed by the recent moves in Bitcoin. Whether BTC goes up or down, it doesn’t matter. Altcoins are dropping like stones.That’s not entirely a strong signal for the markets as it indicates that the focus is around Bitcoin. The moment that Bitcoin goes up while altcoins are getting sold off means that there’s money flowing from altcoins into Bitcoin. If that occurs and Bitcoin makes a small move, it doesn’t show much strength. In that regard, markets move in cycles where the fourth quarter of the year is typically a terrible quarter for altcoin investors. History shows that the dominance chart of Bitcoin moving up in that quarter and topping out in December.This chart aligns with the Ether (ETH) chart against Bitcoin, as this one frequently bottoms out in the December period. Moving forward, It’s very likely to see Bitcoin’s market dominance surge upward from here, with altcoins selling off further. Critical indicators for the markets in the short term are the strength of Ether, and thus altcoins, against Bitcoin and the overall movements of the U.S. Dollar Currency Index.

111,"Cryptocurrency investment is one of the most popular investment tools in Russia, according to a new report.The World Gold Council, a major market development organization for the gold industry, released a report on retail gold insights in Russia on Tuesday.According to the report, cryptocurrency is currently the fifth-most popular investment tool in Russia after savings accounts, foreign currencies, real estate and life insurance. As part of the World Gold Council's rankings of Russian investments made in the past 12 months, cryptocurrency is followed by gold, accounting for 17% and 16%, respectively.The report is based on a survey of 2,023 online interviews with investors from cities across Russia. The respondents are “active investors” — those who made at least one investment in the 12 months preceding the survey.According to the report, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) remain popular in Russia and benefit from being an accessible investment tool. In the meantime, gold has not yet established itself as a mainstream investment asset due to a lack of education and trust.The World Gold Council also noted that the crypto investment trend in Russia comes despite digital assets being a relatively risky investment, while gold has historically emerged as a stable investment for the long term. This could be a sign of growing demand for new investment products, the World Gold Council suggested, stating:Russia has emerged as one of the major jurisdictions investing in crypto. According to a September report by Chainalysis, Russia is now the world’s second-largest country after Ukraine in terms of the rate of crypto adoption."
112,"The cryptocurrency market has suddenly shifted back to Bitcoin (BTC) after several months of a decentralized finance (DeFi) frenzy. While market cap dominance remains below 60%, earlier this month, the trading dominance of BTC has spiked to levels not seen since 2017 when the price hit an all-time high at $20,000.The trading dominance of Bitcoin against other major cryptocurrencies. Source: TheTieDue to the growing dominance of Bitcoin in terms of market volume, the alternative cryptocurrency (altcoin) market is stagnating. The trading dominance of the bellwether for altcoins, Ether (ETH), for instance, did not see a similar spike in the same period. As seen from July to early September, when Bitcoin is climbing upwards gradually, it can cause an “altseason” to materialize. In fact, ETH has outperformed BTC so far this year in terms of percentage, which is partially why the momentum may be returning back to Bitcoin. Especially during August, many DeFi tokens increased between 5 to 20-fold, causing a massive altcoin craze.But when the price of Bitcoin goes up quickly in a short period, it can cause the altcoin market to slump. Profits are likely cycling in from altcoins back into stablecoins and Bitcoin, leading BTC to rally by itself.Su Zhu, the CEO of Three Arrows Capital, emphasized that Bitcoin going up quickly could be bearish for altcoins. He explained:“BTC going up swiftly is not only not bullish for alts but it's bearish. Reasons for this are myriad but boil down to the fact that money is a coordination game and Bitcoin is the Schelling point; this is independent of how you feel about it, community is literally irrelevant.”A similar trend has been spotted across major cryptocurrency exchanges. On Huobi, Bitcoin trading volume’s market share has been increasing, as shown by the data from Skew.The share of major cryptocurrency volume on Huobi. Source: SkewThe trading data on Huobi is significant because the exchange has 1.1% of the Bitcoin supply in its cold wallet. It remains one of the biggest exchanges in the world in terms of cryptocurrency reserves, alongside OKEx and Binance.In the past 13 days, the price of Bitcoin has increased by more than 12% against the U.S. dollar. The strong performance of BTC comes after a series of negative events that could have caused a major pullback.As Cointelegraph extensively reported, several exchange-related news, including the suspension of withdrawals by OKEx, caused BTC to drop below $11,300. Despite the uncertainty in the market and the slump of U.S. equities, BTC pushed above $11,700.Analysts remain relatively confident in the optimistic medium-term trajectory of Bitcoin. But if BTC pulls back in the short term as the market seeks for relief, it could cause a bigger altcoin correction.A potential Bitcoin scenario in the medium-term.

In China’s Shenzhen province about 2 million people had applied for the digital yuan giveaway and the lucky 50,000 among them received “red envelopes” of digital yuan totalling $1.5 million.By the end of Oct. 18 about 47,573 of the recipients had spent roughly $1.3 million of the bounty, amounting to 88% of the total giveaway. This suggests that the pilot program was a success and shows that China is far ahead of other developed economies in developing their central bank digital currency..To speed up the process of launching its CBDC, the Bank of Canada recently listed a job opening for an economist with thorough knowledge of financial technology and digital currencies.However, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell seems unfazed by the progress other countries are making with CBDCs. According to Powell, “it’s more important for the United States to get it right than it is to be first.”In other news, a survey by Statista shows that only 7% of Americans have used or owned Bitcoin (BTC).This figure is far less than Nigeria where the penetration rate is 32%, but also higher than Germany and Japan. This shows that the asset class has a long way to go before it can truly become a ‘mainstream’ currency.Currently, the bearish sentiment that dominated the markets for the past month appears to be alleviating as Bitcoin price moves closer the the $12K level.Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot the ones that may perform well in the short-term.Bitcoin (BTC) has risen to the resistance line of the ascending channel where it could face selling pressure from the bears. However, the upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($11,201) and the relative strength index above 67 suggests that bulls are in command.If the bulls can exploit this advantage and push the price above the channel, the up-move could pick up momentum and quickly rally to $12,048.05. A breakout of this level may challenge the yearly highs at $12,460.However, the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight. They will try to stall the rally at the resistance line. If the price turns down from the current levels but stays above $11,500, then the BTC/USD pair could slowly grind higher inside the channel.The first sign of weakness will be a break below $11,178, and the trend will turn in favor of the bears if they can sink the price below the support line of the channel.The bears could not sustain Ether (ETH) below the moving averages on Oct. 16 and 17. This attracted buying and the bulls will now try to push the price above the overhead resistance at $395.The 20-day EMA ($368) has started to turn up slowly, and the RSI has risen above 57, which suggests that bulls are attempting a comeback.If the bulls can push and close (UTC time) the price above $395, it will complete an ascending triangle pattern. This bullish setup has a target objective of $478, just below the 52-week highs at $488.134.This positive view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels or from $395 and plunges below the uptrend line. Such a move could keep the pair range-bound between $308.392 and $395 for a few more days.Although XRP broke below the moving averages on Oct. 15, the bears could not capitalize on this advantage and sink the price to the bottom of the range at $0.2295. This suggests a lack of sellers at lower levels.The bulls have currently propelled the price back above the moving averages. If they can sustain the higher levels, there will be another attempt to clear the $0.26 hurdle.A breakout and close (UTC time) above $0.26 is likely to start a new uptrend that may reach $0.2905 and then $0.303746.However, the flat moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. If the XRP/USD pair turns down from the current levels or $0.26, the range-bound action could continue for a few more days.The bulls have held the critical support at $242 for the past two days, and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is now attempting to resume its up-move.The upsloping 20-day EMA ($241) and the RSI above 58 indicates that the bulls are in control. The first target on the upside is $266.46, and if that is scaled, the up-move can reach $280.However, if the bulls fail to push the price above $266.46, the BCH/USD pair could remain range-bound for a few days. A break and close (UTC time) below the moving averages will indicate weakness and could pull the price down to $200.The support at $29.5646 is acting as a new floor for Binance Coin (BNB). Both moving averages continue to rise, and the RSI has been sustaining in the positive zone for the past few days, which suggests that bulls are in command.The bulls will now again try to push the price above the $32– $33.3888 resistance zone. If they can pull it off, the pair is likely to pick up momentum and challenge the all-time highs at $39.5941.This bullish view will be negated if the BNB/USD pair turns down from the current levels or from the overhead resistance and sustains below the 20-day EMA ($29.17). Such a move could drag the price down to the 50-day simple moving average ($26.83).Chainlink (LINK) has held above the 20-day EMA ($10.52) for the past three days but the bulls have not been able to push the price back above the $11.1990–$11.8028 resistance. This suggests that demand is drying up at higher levels.However, the gradually upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory suggests a minor advantage to the bulls. The momentum could pick up after the bulls push the price above the overhead resistance zone. The first target is $13.28 and then $18.This bullish view will be invalidated if the LINK/USD pair turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and breaks below $10.15. Such a move could pull the price down to the $8.7975 support.The failure of the bears to sink Polkadot (DOT) to $3.5321 suggests that lower levels are attracting buying by the bulls. If the buyers can push the price above the downtrend line, the bearish descending triangle setup will be invalidated.Above the downtrend line, the DOT/USD pair could move up to $4.6112 and if this level is crossed, the rally may extend to $5.5899.However, the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight. The sellers will try to reverse the direction from the current levels and again at $4.6112. If the pair turns down from either resistance, it could again drop to $3.5321.A breakdown and close (UTC time) below $3.5321 will signal that bears are back in command.Cardano (ADA) has bounced off the 20-day EMA ($0.103), which shows that the sentiment is positive and the bulls are accumulating at lower levels. The buyers will once again try to push the price above the resistance line of the rising wedge pattern.If the bulls can manage a close (UTC time) above the resistance line, a rally to $0.128062 and then to $0.1445 is possible. The upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI above 61 suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside.Contrary to this assumption, if the ADA/USD pair turns down from the resistance line, the bears will once again try to sink the price below the 20-day EMA and the support line of the wedge. If they can do that, the advantage will tilt in favor of the bears.Litecoin (LTC) has bounced off the uptrend line and the bulls will now try to push the price above the moving averages. If the buyers can sustain the price above the moving averages, a move to the overhead resistance zone of $51–$52.36 is possible.However, the bulls are unlikely to have it easy as the bears will try to defend the moving averages. If the LTC/USD pair turns down and breaks below the uptrend line, a drop to $42 will be on the cards.Currently, the flat 20-day EMA ($47.99) and the RSI at the midpoint suggests a balance between supply and demand. Hence, the price action could remain volatile for the next few days as both the bulls and the bears try to dominate proceedings.A breakout and close (UTC time) above the resistance zone will complete an inverse head and shoulders pattern that may signal the start of a new uptrend.Bitcoin SV (BSV) is attempting to stage a recovery but the rebound off the Oct. 16 intraday lows lacks strength. This suggests that the bulls are in no hurry to buy as they are not confident that the bottom is in place.The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative zone suggest that the advantage is with the bears. If the bulls do not push the price above the moving averages within the next few days, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the price to $146.20.Conversely, if the bulls can push the price above the moving averages, the BSV/USD pair could move up to $180.63. A breakout and close (UTC time) above this resistance could start a journey to $189 and then to $227.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

114,"According to CME, the amount of Bitcoin (BTC) long contracts held by institutions are at an all-time high. Yet, CME’s most recent Commitment of Trader report shows hedge funds are at a record-high for BTC shorts.There seemingly is a major difference in the perception of Bitcoin’s short to medium-term trend between hedge funds and institutions.Hedge funds typically implement varying strategies to generate returns for investors. Oftentimes, hedge funds will utilize derivatives and employ a more high-risk strategy.In contrast, institutional investors who are allocating a percentage of their portfolio to Bitcoin likely have a long-term strategy. This means they are not concerned about the short to medium-term performance of BTC.Some analysts say that hedge funds are likely short on Bitcoin to provide liquidity to institutions longing the top cryptocurrency.When institutional investors increasingly build up their long positions, there need to be sellers on CME to balance the order book. Mitchell Nicholson, a cryptocurrency analyst, said:Technically, hedge funds might also be shorting Bitcoin after repeated rejections of a key resistance level. Bitcoin has been unable to break out of the $11,700 to $12,000 resistance range since August.For over two months, Bitcoin has been mostly ranging between $10,500 to $11,700, struggling to show upside momentum.After BTC’s recovery from $3,600, hedge funds may be expecting a significant pullback.A pseudonymous trader known as “Bluntz” said that the current technical structure of Bitcoin looks similar to February. In March, BTC dropped to $3,596 on BitMEX in an abrupt capitulation phase.Whether hedge funds are net short on BTC or providing liquidity to buyers on CME remains unclear based on open interest. Skew said:Despite the growing Bitcoin short positions from hedge funds, institutional investors are continuing to accumulate BTC.On Oct. 17, Barry Silbert, the CEO of Grayscale, said the firm reached all-time high assets under management (AUM) at $6.4 billion. The figure from Grayscale is critical to measure institutional activity because their products mainly tailors institutional investors.In the U.S., there is not a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As such, institutions rely on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which operates more like an exchange-traded product (ETP) to gain exposure to Bitcoin.Major multi-billion dollar conglomerates that have invested in Bitcoin, such as MicroStrategy and Square, also emphasized their intent to treat BTC as a treasury asset. At least in the short to medium term, these institutions are unlikely to sell their BTC holdings."
115,"Blockchain headlines have been awash with negative news tidbits lately. KuCoin suffered a major hack on Sept. 26; two United States regulatory bodies went after BitMEX on Oct. 1; the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, banned crypto derivatives on Oct. 6; and news came to light that U.S. stimulus payment talks had stalled around Oct 9.Bitcoin's (BTC) price has appeared largely unfazed, however, despite this array of seemingly unfavorable stories. This could be indicative of upside potential in the coming weeks, according to a report Monday from crypto investment solution company CoinShares. ""It tells me holders are not nervous and leverage is low — a theory supported by wallet activity and traffic — and skews my short term price expectations from neutral to positive,"" wrote Danny Masters, executive chairman of CoinShares. In the days following each of these events, Bitcoin's price mostly held, dropping only slightly in comparison with its usual price activity, and often rising shortly thereafter.""In my 30 years in trading my top golden rule was to act when the news was not matched by price movement,"" Masters wrote. ""Having been around crypto during MtGox, the China ban, Bitfinex Hack, Trump comments and many of the other market-smashing stories that punctuate bitcoin's history I was struck by the lack of negative price movement, particularly around BitMEX,"" Masters added after noting the FCA and BitMEX events as recent, potentially bearish happenings. Bitcoin has gained a number of large mainstream participants in the past several months, partly in an effort to preserve these speculators' capital against inflation. Masters details these mainstream entrants in the first part of the report, mentioning Square and MicroStrategy as two examples. MicroStrategy allocated $425 million of its treasury reserves to Bitcoin between August and September. Square picked up roughly $50 million in Bitcoin at the beginning of October.""We think these actions are but the beginning of a treasury diversification strategy which will appeal to technology and payments companies around the globe,"" Masters wrote.Earlier in the year, billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones placed his own heavy bet on Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation.

116,"According to analytics data provider Glassnode, 16,159 Bitcoin wallets now hold 100+ BTC. A report Monday from the company stated that this figure tests the previous six-month high of 16,158, last seen on June 8.Glassnode additionally shared that the number of non-zero Bitcoin addresses reached an all-time high of 31,913,3555 on Monday; approximately 5,000 of these were recorded within the past 24 hours.On Oct. 5, Cointelegraph reported that analyst and market cyclist Cole Garner had highlighted a two-year record increase in new BTC addresses within the first week of October.Using data from Glassnode, Garner determined that around 22,000 new Bitcoin “entities” had appeared in a single day — a significant jump above the normal figure of 5,000 to 10,000 per day.In May, Bitcoin wallets holding a non-zero number of coins crossed the 30 million mark for the first time. More than 99% of these wallets contain less than the once-modest sum of 10 BTC."
117,"Old hands are selling their Bitcoin (BTC) holdings, according to Glassnode’s Coin Dormancy metric. As shown below, dormant addresses selling BTC marked previous tops in BTC.On-chain analyst Willy Woo said old hands reliably sold the top until the most recent price cycle. He wrote:There are several reasons why long-time holders are selling BTC at the current price. BTC price has increased by three-fold since March, and it is a decent take-profit area for sellers. The $12,000 area has also served as a strong resistance level throughout the past two months.Atop the various technical reasons, there are cyclical reasons that could encourage dormant Bitcoin holders to sell.In the last two fourth quarters, Bitcoin recorded negative returns. The tendency of BTC to underperform during the last quarter, alongside the $12,000 resistance, could compel holders to take profit.However, some technical analysts believe Bitcoin is at the cusp of starting a new cycle. In the upcoming months, BTC could continue to grind upward to higher resistance levels and not see a major pullback.Filbfilb, a popular cryptocurrency analyst, pinpointed the post-halving cycle seen in 2017. He said that BTC reached an all-time high after it broke out in the same week four years ago. He wrote:The trader also noted that institutions are seemingly longing Bitcoin at record levels. Following the high-profile investments in Bitcoin from MicroStrategy and Square, the institutional demand for BTC has increased noticeably.The volume of institution-tailored platforms, including Bakkt and LMAX Digital, has increased substantially in recent weeks. Filbfilb added:Most of the short-term bearish signals for Bitcoin are technical rather than fundamental. Various fundamental metrics signify strengthening momentum, including the Bitcoin hash rate.On Oct. 19, the Bitcoin hash rate hit a new all-time high once again, which is a highly optimistic trend, especially after the May 11 halving. John Todaro, a cryptocurrency venture capitalist, said:"
118,"The trial of the alleged launderer of $4 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC), Alexander Vinnik, got underway in Paris on Monday.However, despite reported links to the 300,000 BTC hack of Mt. Gox in 2014, prosecutors are focusing on a 135-million-euro ($159 million) ransomware fraud targeting French businesses and organizations between 2016 and 2018.According to The Associated Press, Russian national Vinnik is being charged with extortion, money laundering and criminal association after 20 victims of the ""Locky"" malware paid the ransom in Bitcoin through BTC-e.Vinnik is alleged to be one of the creators of the malware and the former operator of the now-shuttered cryptocurrency exchange, although he claims that he was only a technical consultant at BTC-e and had no knowledge of any wrongdoing.If found guilty, Vinnik faces up to 10 years in prison.As Cointelegraph reported, Vinnik was originally arrested in Greece in 2017 at the behest of United States authorities.There followed a legal tug of war, with prosecutors from France, the U.S. and Russia all petitioning for his extradition. Vinnik himself expressed a preference to be extradited to Russia, where he faces lesser charges.Earlier this year, Greek authorities ruled that he would be extradited first to France, then to the U.S and finally to RussiaEven following his extradition to France, Russian authorities unsuccessfully requested that he be allowed to return to his home country under house arrest.If tried in the U.S. in the future, Vinnik is likely to face charges related to the $4 billion hack of Mt. Gox. The 300,000 BTC stolen in the hack were allegedly laundered through the BTC-e exchange and Vinnik's own personal wallet."
119,"Markets tend to behave in massive cycles. One of those cycles is the previous Bitcoin (BTC) price cycle from 2014 to 2017. However, within those cycles, are multiple smaller cycles that could often repeat.A similar approach and analysis can be made for Ethereum’s Ether (ETH), which is outperforming BTC year-to-date, as the majority of its impulse upward moves have corrected heavily to retest previous resistance levels.When is the best period to buy ETH/USD and what potential levels can be hit in the next move? Let’s take a look at the charts.  ETH/USD 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewThe weekly chart shows a clear breakout above the 100-week and 200-week moving averages (MAs) earlier in the year. A breakout that also caused the price to break above the crucial resistance level of $300.This $300 barrier has been a resistance zone for close to two years, ever since the bear market for Ethereum began in February 2018. Since this accumulation period, the price of Ether has been hovering between $80 and $300. Finally, after almost two years, ETH/USD broke above $300, rallying toward the next resistance zone around $500.However, a breakout during this run is unlikely as the crypto markets still appear to be consolidating within a new cycle. This buildup is relatively dull and doesn’t provide massive volatility. Another clear signal of this accumulation period is the incentive to continually back-test every previous resistance zone as support. These retests add further momentum for more upside later on. ETH/USD 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewa higher high is already established as the chart is showing regarding the current trend. After such a higher high, the market is looking for a clearcut higher low to confirm the existing trend switch.However, the crucial question in this regard is at which level can a higher low be established? The most profound answer to this question is the previous resistance at $300 becoming support. But even if the $300 level doesn’t support, the 200-week MA at $220-245 can sustain and confirm the higher low. These two zones should be watched for investors to see whether buyers are stepping in. The $300 level already held as support, increasing the likelihood of Ether holding above this level.Second, as the markets tend to move in substantial cycles, new potential resistances can be defined. The impulse move usually lasts the shortest as accumulative and corrective movements tend to take the most prolonged period. If the $300 area sustains support, new resistances and levels can be defined through horizontal price levels and the Fibonacci extension tool.ETH/USD 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewThe next levels of potential resistance can be found through these indicators and tools at $600 and $775-825. This would mean that Ethereum could surge more than 100% in the next impulse move, driving the markets to the next level. If Ethereum 2.0 gets released, the strength will only increase, indicating that the second level has been most likely reached.ETH/BTC 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewMultiple arguments and analysis can be derived from the ETH/BTC chart. One of them is the range-bound construction between the 100-Week and 200-Week MA, which indicates that the upwards move was rejected at the 100-Week MA.However, another indication is made that the price of Ethereum provided weakness throughout the fourth quarter of the year. The bottom constructions were made in December and January, after which a large impulse move occurred. Therefore, the best period to get into ETH, therefore, is December and January, a move that has historically rewarded patient investors.If the bottom construction is finished and history repeats itself, potential resistance zones can be found at 0.058 and 0.072 sats, similar to the USD values.ETH/BTC 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe daily chart of ETH/BTC is showing clear support at the 0.03 sats level. However, this support level has seen several tests, meaning another test would likely cause the price to drop further south. This isn’t horrible, however, as the lower support level didn’t see a confirmation test (a support/resistance flip) yet. Traders should watch 0.026 sats if the level of 0.03-0.031 sats is lost for support. In general, tremendous opportunities may be arising in the markets in the coming weeks/months as 2020 comes to a close, particularly if history repeats itself.Moreover, the further you get into a cycle, the bigger the impulse moves will be. Another run of 100%+ for Ether is, therefore, likely to occur if the $450 breaks.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

120,"According to new data from Statista, only 7% of Americans have previously used Bitcoin (BTC). This means current investors in BTC are still in an early stage of growth.Dan Tapiero, the co-founder of 10T Holdings, said Bitcoin is still at the “birth” phase of a new asset class. He wrote:“It's still so early for Bitcoin. Still at the birth of a new global asset class.”In the longer term, Bitcoin has significant growth potential to evolve into an established store of value, like gold. If so, investors anticipate its valuation to increase exponentially over the next decade.The percentage of people that previously used Bitcoin. Source: StatistaCurrently, the majority of the demand for Bitcoin comes from investors that perceive BTC as gold 2.0. Investors believe BTC would eventually establish itself as a safe-haven asset.Consequently, institutional investors have heavily accumulated BTC in recent months. MicroStrategy and Stone Ridge, for instance, purchased $425 million and $110 million worth of Bitcoin, respectively.But if the retail demand for Bitcoin picks up in tandem across major regions, it could cause BTC to grow exponentially.The data from Statistica shows only six countries have more than 10% of their population as Bitcoin users. The top countries in terms of Bitcoin users per capita are Nigeria, Vietnam, and South Africa, the Statista Global Consumer Survey found.Tapiero emphasized that the survey does not include countries top to bottom, which might have missed large cryptocurrency markets. South Korea, as an example, is not on the list despite being one of the world’s bigger Bitcoin markets. He said:“It's a survey of select countries. It's not a straight top to bottom survey. IE there are countries that belong on this list that are not listed.”In recent years, the Bitcoin exchange and fiat on-ramp infrastructure have significantly improved across the U.S., Europe, and Asia. However, there are still many countries that lack a reliable exchange infrastructure to this day.Canada, as an example, lacks a strictly regulated major local cryptocurrency exchange users can rely on, apart from Coinbase.Once the exchange and fiat on-ramp infrastructure gets fully established, then it would become easier for retail investors to enter the market.Without exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and major bank custodians, users still have to undergo a relatively complex process of using exchanges. Some exchanges require a thorough Know Your Customer or KYC verification process before users can initiate wire transfers to buy Bitcoin.As such, until there are further improvements in the infrastructure to onboard retail investors, the broader mainstream population would likely struggle to enter the cryptocurrency market.The monthly price chart of Bitcoin. Source: TradingView.comThe long-term predictions of Bitcoin widely vary, anywhere from $20,000 to $1 million. On Oct. 16, Cointelegraph reported that asset manager Raoul Pal, the founder of the Real Vision Group, believes BTC is heading to $1 million.At a price point of $1 million, the fully diluted market capitalization of BTC would be at around $21 trillion. That would be more than two-folds of gold’s current market valuation of $9 trillion."
121,"Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week in familiar territory as markets move into the United States’ 2020 elections — where could it go next?Cointelegraph takes a look at five factors that could influence BTC price action in the week ahead.The U.S. is the firm focal point when it comes to macro markets this week. The Nov. 3 elections promise to set the mood as it becomes more apparent which side will control the White House. Analysts have warned that a Democrat win would dent the dollar, the long-term prospects for which are already shaky. Donald Trump’s reelection, however, would not be enough to keep the greenback out of danger, Goldman Sachs said last week.By extension, calls are coming for safe-haven gold to make serious progress upwards after November — regardless of the election outcome. For others, however, it is Bitcoin that will profit more impressively.The dollar’s strength remains on the radar of Bitcoiners thanks to the inverse correlation between BTC/USD and the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY).

Should this occur, several trillion dollars of liquidity will add to the burgeoning U.S. debt pile, with Americans seeing perks such as another $1,200 stimulus check.In Europe, the picture revolves around the European Central Bank’s (ECB) own response to the Coronavirus, which continues to tighten its grip across the continent.Speaking to French newspaper Le Monde on Monday, ECB president Christine Lagarde said that more financial tools were left to be deployed to support the eurozone if necessary. In addition, the ECB’s $878 billion recovery fund should become a permanent feature.The bank’s Coronavirus stimulus program amounted to €1.5 trillion in asset purchases.“The options in our toolbox have not been exhausted,” she said. “If more has to be done, we will do more. On taking up my position, I was told that there was nothing left for me to do, that everything had been done. But that was clearly not the case!”The potential for instability in the eurozone is compounded by Brexit, which is increasingly heading towards the “no deal” walk out of the bloc by the United Kingdom.When prime minister Boris Johnson announced the likely outcome of the process last week, however, markets barely reacted to the news.Bitcoin stayed practically rangebound over the weekend, with only a brief spike above $11,500 contrasting the flat activity.Despite this, on a technical level, signs of record strength continue pouring in this month. The difficulty, which provides an estimate of miner competition and network security, is now back at all-time highs.Two days ago, the latest readjustment saw difficulty increase by a larger-than-expected 3.5%.At the same time, the hash rate also climbed to a new average all-time high on Monday. At press time, the estimated computing power dedicated to mining stood at 146 exahashes per second (EH/s).As Cointelegraph often reports, the popular theory that price follows hash rate remains firmly in force as miners are more bullish than ever on Bitcoin as a long-term investment prospect.Bitcoin 7-day average hash rate 1-month chartFor Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe, a pivotal price transformation for Bitcoin is becoming more and more plausible.In his latest video update on Sunday, he highlighted that several years of weekly closes below the significant resistance level of $12,000 should soon come to an end.Since the start of the bear market in early 2018, $12,000 has formed a rejection point for the weekly chart, but consolidation below cannot last forever, Van de Poppe argued.“It’s very likely that we’re going to make a rally towards the area of $16,000 to $17,000 as that’s the obvious level and the final hurdle for Bitcoin to start breaking all-time highs,” he summarized.Such a move would be followed by another consolidation period which could well be longer in duration than the current one. Nonetheless, if a bull market materializes, it will be Bitcoin-fuelled.“The main driver of the next bull market will still be Bitcoin,” Van de Poppe added, recommending that viewers make an effort to accumulate BTC even in the $16,000 range.“$11,400 is still a very cheap price per Bitcoin,” he added in a tweet.BTC/USD 7-day price chart.

This suggests that sentiment among Bitcoin investors is anticipating a bullish advance, but there’s a caveat — if price increases too fast, “greed” will become “extreme greed,” under which circumstances the Index says a correction is much more likely.Crypto Fear & Greed Index as of Oct. 19.

122,"Data from Skew shows Bitcoin’s (BTC) spot volume on LMAX Digital, an exchange that mainly caters to institutions, has overtaken retail-oriented exchanges. This signals that institutional investors could be building up positions as they expect the price to move higher in the future.Along with spot purchases, institutional investors’ participation in the derivatives market has also increased. Data from Arcane Research shows that a record number of investors are taking delivery of Bitcoin from the Bakkt Bitcoin exchange.Another metric that can be useful for traders is volatility. Bitcoin options data shows that the implied volatility of at the money options has dropped to a 16-month low. This suggests that traders do not expect a large down move in the near future, hence, they are not willing to pay a greater amount to hedge their positions.Although data suggests that institutional investors are positioned for an upside move, retail traders should keep a close watch on the price action and take large bets only after a trending move starts.Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that could start a trending move next week.Bitcoin (BTC) has been holding above the 20-day exponential moving average ($11,137) for the past few days. The buyers purchased the dip to the $11,165 support on Oct. 20, which suggests accumulation at lower levels.If the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, the BTC/USD pair could retest the $11,719 resistance. A breakout of this level may resume the up-move with the first target at $12,000 and then $12,460.Both the short-term and the long-term moving averages are sloping up and the relative strength index is above 61. This suggests that the bulls are in control.This positive view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the downtrend line and plummets below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the price down to the next support at $10,500.The 4-hour chart has formed a bearish descending triangle pattern that will complete on a breakdown and close (UTC time) below $11,165. This bearish setup has a pattern target of $10,611.However, if the bulls can propel the price above the downtrend line, the bearish pattern will be invalidated. Such a move could attract short covering by the bears, resulting in a rally to $12,000.The gradually upsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the positive territory suggests a minor advantage to the bulls.Stellar Lumens (XLM) broke below the 200-day simple moving average ($0.077) on Sep. 21 but the bears could not capitalize on this move and sink the price below $0.066841. This shows buying by the bulls at lower levels.The XLM/USD pair has formed an ascending channel and the bulls are attempting to push the price above the overhead resistance at $0.084584. Although the bears defended the overhead resistance on Oct. 17, the bulls have not given up much ground.If the pair stays above the moving averages, the buyers will make one more attempt to drive the price above $0.084584. If they succeed, the pair could start a new uptrend that may rally to $0.10.The gradually upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that the bulls have the upper hand.The pair had broken above the channel but the bulls could not clear the hurdle at $0.084584. However, on the downside, the bears have not been able to drag the price below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.079239.This suggests that the bulls will again try to thrust the price above the overhead resistance. If they succeed, a rally to $0.091042 will be on the cards.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the 20-EMA, a drop to $0.076546 is possible. A break below this level could result in a decline to the support line of the channel.The descending triangle completed on Oct. 14 when Crypto.com Coin (CRO) plummeted and closed (UTC time) below the $0.144743 support. This bearish setup has a target objective of $0.10607.However, the bulls might attempt to defend the 200-day SMA at $0.121. A bounce off this level could retest the breakdown level at $0.144743. In a downtrend, traders sell on rallies to the 20-day EMA ($0.144) as the path of least resistance is to the downside.Hence, if the CRO/USD pair turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment is bearish. The sellers will then again try to sink the price below the 200-day SMA. If they succeed, the decline could extend to $0.10607.The 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI has plummeted deep into the oversold territory, which suggests that the advantage is with the bears. However, a relief rally cannot be ruled out in the short-term.The RSI on the 4-hour chart has also plunged deep into the oversold territory. This suggests panic selling and usually, after such a round of such intense selling, a minor pullback occurs.Any relief rally is likely to face selling at the 20-EMA as bears will try to consolidate their advantage.This bearish view will be invalidated if the pair rises and sustains above the breakdown level of $0.144743. Until then, every rally is likely to be viewed as a selling opportunity.Binance Coin (BNB) turned down from $31.9798 on Oct. 16 but the bulls purchased the dip to the immediate support at $29.5646. This suggests that the previous resistance level has now flipped to support.The upsloping 20-day EMA ($29.06) and the RSI above 61 indicates that bulls have the upper hand. The 200-day SMA ($19.95) has also started to turn up, which suggests that the long-term trend is also tilting in favor of the bulls.If the buyers can thrust the BNB/USD pair above the $32– $33.3888 resistance zone, the momentum could pick up and a retest of the all-time highs will be on the cards.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink and sustain the pair below the 20-day EMA, it will signal weakness.The bears are defending the $31–$32 zone aggressively. The flattened 20-EMA and the RSI just above the midpoint suggests a balance between supply and demand.This balance will tilt in favor of the bears if they can sink and sustain the price below $29.5646. If this support cracks, a drop to $28 and then to $26 is possible.Conversely, if the bulls propel the price above the overhead resistance zone, it will signal the resumption of the uptrend.Litecoin (LTC) is attempting to form an inverse head and shoulders pattern that will complete on a breakout and close (UTC time) above $51.50. The flat moving averages and the RSI below the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.However, the long tails on the candlesticks on Oct. 2 and Oct.16 show that the bulls are buying the dips to the trendline. If the bulls can push the price above the moving averages, the LTC/USD pair could again rise to $51.50.A breakout and close (UTC time) above this level could start a new uptrend. The pattern target of the reversal setup is $61.50.This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below the trendline. Such a move could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days.The 4-hour chart shows that the rebound off the trendline is struggling to sustain above $47.7845. This suggests that buying dries up at higher levels. The 20-EMA is sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone.Therefore, the bears may take one more shot at breaking the trendline support. If they manage to do that, the pair could drop to $42.Conversely, if the bulls can sustain the price above $47.7845, a move to $50 and then to $51.50 is likely.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

123,"It’s been a good week for the crypto markets. Bitcoin finally burst through the $11,000 ceiling, and kept going. According to some experts, the coin could be on its way to a full 2017-style bull run. Other analysts have identified five events that could move the markets this week, including the election’s effect on the dollar, Europe’s struggles with Brexit and the coronavirus, and Bitcoin’s high hash rate.The investment experts at Stone Ridge Asset Management have been paying attention. After executives had made personal investments in cryptocurrencies, the company created a billion-dollar spinoff with a $115 million investment in Bitcoin. Square has been just as forward-thinking. The payments company has now put 1 percent of the company's assets—about $50 million—into Bitcoins. The growth in crypto’s popularity has led some people to speculate that crypto banks are likely to overtake fiat banks within the next three years. In Italy, the banking system is trying hard to stay ahead. Some 100 banks there now use the blockchain network Spunta to speed up data transfers and settlements. In China, the city of Shenzhen gave away $1.5 million worth of a digital currency controlled by the country’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China. And the Winklevoss twins’ Gemini exchange is continuing to roll out regulated payment options for customers in the UK.Closer to home, things are… well, a bit more cautious. The G7 has said that it will oppose Facebook’s Libra project until more oversight is in place. And Elon Musk has denied that his Tesla Gigafactory has Bitcoin ATMs. In the world of DeFi, things are looking more fluid. Chainlink might be about to lose its leadership of the ecosystem. Competition is heating up. Constellation Network is building a DeFi project on its Hypergraph protocol and has announced the support of early backers, including FBG Capital and Alphabit Fund. Cornell University has revealed that the most downloaded dissertation over the last eight years is Adem Efe Gencer’s proposal for Aspen, an algorithm for spreading the workload over a peer-to-peer network. (If you’re looking for a good place to read that paper, you can do worse than choose the crypto cruise ship Satoshi.

124,"This morning, millionaire broker and noted Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff awoke to find his bank under renewed scrutiny due to an international criminal investigation. According to reporting from Australian newspaper The Age and The New York Times, the J5 -- a joint task force of tax authorities from major Western governments convened in the wake of the bombshell publication of the Panama Papers -- have placed “hundreds” of accounts at Schiff’s Puerto Rico-based Euro Pacific Bank under investigation for tax evasion and other financial crimes. The reports detail what appears to be a comically inept organization responsible for harboring the fortunes of a cast of shady businessmen and criminals. Employees hired after a quick Google search screening were tasked with attracting clients such as Simon Antequetil, the noted Australian fraudster and tax avoidance maestro.The reports also shed light on how Euro Pacific may have tainted public holdings of Schiff's favorite asset: gold. Former Australian Federal Police (AFP) investigator John Chevis discovered in 2017 that West Australian government-owned Perth Mint had a relationship with Euro Pacific. ""I was very surprised,"" Chevis told The Age. ""I think there's a significant risk that some of the gold held within the Perth Mint by customers of the Euro Pacific Bank may be held beneficially for criminals in other parts of the world.""In an interview with The Age last month, Schiff denied wrongdoing on the part of Euro Pacific, saying the bank “turns down far more accounts than we approve because our compliance is so rigorous"". ""It's got nothing to do with reality,"" he said of the allegations.He later stormed out of the interview.But nestled amid the reports is a key detail which may shed some light on why Schiff has been such a virulent critic of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. From The Age:While Schiff was criticizing Bitcoin as early as 2013, the attempted extortion scheme might explain why he’s been particularly vocal as of late, most notably in a Twitter spat with Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss.Schiff has also demonstrated a history of paranoia regarding hacks, especially cryptocurrency-related hacks. In July, Schiff augured that the hack of multiple Twitter accounts by an American teenager might be a “harbinger” for a Bitcoin hack, and in April he tweeted about ""the potential for improvements in technology to hack the blockchain and counterfeit Bitcoin.""Despite Schiff's concerns over the potential hacking of the Bitcoin blockchain, there is no equivalent in the digital asset world to iron pyrite. Unless we count BSV."
125,"The price of one actual Bitcoin on the open crypto market, known as spot BTC, fluctuates based on a countless number of factors, such as trading volume, usage and adoption. However, other catalysts affect the asset in a roundabout manner. Cash-settled Bitcoin futures trading products from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange stand as one arguable highly referenced indirect element contributing to Bitcoin’s (BTC) price direction. “The Bitcoin derivative products offered by CME are simply a vehicle for accredited investors to place sophisticated and risk-offsetting trades that would otherwise be inaccessible to them,” Shawn Dexter, a decentralized finance analyst at Quantum Economics — a markets analysis firm — told Cointelegraph on Oct. 8. “This leads to both, short-term and long-term impact on price.”At the height of Bitcoin’s largest bull run to date, the CME launched cash-settled Bitcoin futures trading, on Dec. 17, 2017. Cash-settled futures, however, involve no actual spot BTC. They simply let traders bet on the future price of Bitcoin without utilizing the underlying asset.For example, let’s say Bitcoin’s spot price sits at $10,000 per BTC at the beginning of a month and ends that month at $11,000. Buying one CME Bitcoin futures contract (equivalent to the price of five Bitcoin) when BTC’s price is at $10,000 and holding through expiration at the end of the month means the trader will receive $55,000 in cash at the end of the month, not actual Bitcoin.Since trades involve no actual Bitcoin sales or purchases, these futures products logically may not seem like they should impact Bitcoin’s spot price. In reality, however, these futures do weigh on Bitcoin’s price, according to Dexter:At times, Bitcoin trades at varying prices on different exchanges based on events, order book demand and other factors. If a large enough price discrepancy exists, a trader might buy BTC for a lower price on one exchange and sell it at a higher price on a different exchange. This activity is called arbitrage.Bitcoin’s price on CME futures would likely rise noticeably if someone bought a large number of Bitcoin futures contracts on CME. This does not directly move Bitcoin’s spot price, although eager traders would then go buy or sell spot Bitcoin at a cheaper price as an arbitrage opportunity, driving up the spot price in tandem, according to Dexter. This concept works for a number of scenarios between CME and spot BTC.On a larger time horizon, the CME’s Bitcoin futures trading products affect Bitcoin’s spot price more significantly, Dexter explained, adding: “The CME products allow for increased price stability and decreased risk. This is bullish for Bitcoin since it allows larger investors to get involved in the market with less hesitation. Thus increasing liquidity and stability.” Essentially, CME’s BTC futures add money to the market from large mainstream traders and other participants while also allowing them to hedge their trades.Derivatives trading markets for commodities can affect their respective underlying spot markets, according to Heath Tarbert, chairman of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Derivatives include futures trading products. “Sometimes, the price of cattle is actually set in the derivatives markets,” Tarbert told interviewer Anthony Pompliano on Oct. 7 as part of a segment during the LA Blockchain Summit. Cattle and Bitcoin are both considered commodities. Tarbert added: “People say, ‘Well the futures contract on cattle says it should be x amount per head, and, therefore, this is what the price should be in the real market.’”Some commodity futures are physically settled, however, involving the transfer of the underlying asset after expiration, thus, differing from CME’s Bitcoin futures trading products. Including similar findings, investment firm Wilshire Phoenix released a lengthy report on the CME BTC futures topic on Oct. 14, 2020, citing the conclusion: “CME Bitcoin Futures contribute more to price discovery than its related spot markets.”The crypto space gives significant weight to CME gaps. A gap occurs on the CME Bitcoin futures chart when Bitcoin’s spot price moves while the CME Bitcoin futures markets are closed for the weekend or the holidays. If CME’s Bitcoin futures open for trading after a big move from Bitcoin, a gap is left on the chart between the listed price when the CME closed and the price of BTC when it opens.The crypto space often expects Bitcoin’s price to return to such levels, “filling” any gaps on the chart. “Price does not need to trade in both directions through a gap to be considered filled,” Dexter explained. “A gap is considered filled as long as it meets the previously traded price before the gap.”Trading is largely about probabilities. Probability favors gaps fills, according to Dexter, although he added, “It is important to note that gaps don’t necessarily have to be filled,” as gaps exist in the same category as other chart patterns:Contrary to the market’s sentiment favoring gap fills, however, Melvis Langyintuo, a client solutions strategist at OKCoin, told Cointelegraph on Oct. 6 that CME Bitcoin gap fills are unlikely due to the CME’s lack of Bitcoin futures trading volume in comparison to crypto-native derivatives exchanges.In the last 30 days, the CME’s Bitcoin futures have yielded roughly $433 million in average daily volume, according to Langyintuo. In contrast, popular crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX often hosts over $1 billion in 24-hour trading volume. Over the last 24-hours, BitMEX’s Bitcoin perpetual swap futures product has hosted almost $1.4 billion in volume, based on numbers posted on the exchange. Several other high-volume crypto-native derivatives exchanges also exist, and these exchanges trade throughout the weekend while the CME Bitcoin futures do not, which adds to the equation.“This makes the CME gap non-consequential compared to the BTC potentially filling the gap,” Langyintuo said. “The CME BTC prices are either trailing the BTC price moves or they are a bet on where the CME BTC market may reopen on Monday,” he added. “Trading CME futures into the weekend is akin to essentially placing a weekend ‘put’ or ‘call’ on gap to capture that spread,” he explained, referencing a similarity to Bitcoin options trading — another type of derivative seen on the CME and in the crypto space. Langyintuo concluded:A vast number of forces impact Bitcoin. A conclusion can be difficult when it comes to how much impact any specific driver has, although in this case, it seems as though the CME’s Bitcoin futures may affect Bitcoin’s spot price on a number of levels."
126,"Last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping, declared that China has plans to become carbon neutral by 2060, calling for a “green revolution.”If the plan is properly implemented, it could help China to finally shed its biggest-polluter status and significantly improve the global ecosystem, which could also drastically shake up the country’s eminent Bitcoin (BTC) mining industry.The most well-known mining hub of China is the Southern province of Sichuan, which has an abundant hydroelectricity sector. However, the electricity there is especially cheap only during the wet season, which takes place between May and September. Outside of that period, most miners migrate up north to Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, which currently generate over 40% of the total Bitcoin hash rate. Unlike Sichuan, however, those desert regions depend mainly on non-renewable sources of energy such as coal. If the government proceeds to push for net-zero carbon dioxide emissions, mining there will become inefficient, and local players will be left with much fewer options.As the world has finally learned the hard truths of climate change and human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide, having constant access to renewable energy is going to become one of the most important factors in Bitcoin mining. But are there any locations that can cater to this requirement?Let’s take a look at the Bitcoin Mining Map that indicates a close estimate of the geographic distribution of the global BTC hash rate. China, of course, is the uncontested king, making up more than 65%. Following China are the United States, Russia and Kazakhstan, which are neck and neck at 7,24%, 6,90% and 6,17%, respectively.The Commonwealth of Independent States, or the CIS region, which includes both Russia and Kazakhstan, seems to be particularly overlooked by international players, mostly due to a lack of information about local mining scenes.Akin to Northern China, Kazakhstan’s electricity is produced mostly by coal power plants. It’s cheap, but not sustainable. Also, the local government has been interfering with the electricity market by lowering tariffs and cost, meaning that they might eventually bounce back.Russia, on the other hand, has lots of natural prerequisites for cheap renewable electricity, as well as a more stable economic environment.If you ask me to name one thing that the Soviet Union was good at, I’d say industrial infrastructure.Most of Bitcoin mining in Russia takes place in the famous Siberian region, which has also been a key spot for aluminum production since the 1960s. Because energy is consumed at all stages in the production of aluminum, the USSR chose to build Siberian smelters along with hydropower plants (Russia hosts as much as 9% of the world’s hydro resources, mostly in Siberia and the far east).Aluminum smelting technology has evolved since then, making production much more energy-efficient. That, along with the fact that the Soviet government often left room for future growth when building infrastructure, is the key reason why the region has so much excess power these days. According to RusHydro, the world’s second-largest hydroelectric power producer, the total installed capacity of hydropower units in Russia is currently approximately 45 million kilowatts. More specifically, hydropower plants in Siberia are estimated to produce almost 10% of the total output of all power plants controlled by the Unified National Energy Network.Another key aspect is Siberia’s infamous climate, where it’s cold nine months of the year. If there’s anything that this kind of weather is good for, it’s hosting a datacenter stuffed with large ASIC units running at full capacity. Anyone who has ever tried running a mining rig at home during summer will likely know what I mean.Russia’s vicinity to China is also a big plus, as the best mining hardware is produced there.Historically, Moscow has had a strong economic relationship with Beijing, which continues to strengthen to this day. The shipping between the two countries is cheap, fast and constant: Freight trains and cargo aircraft continue to run despite the COVID-19 pandemic.Now, imagine shipping thousands of mining rigs to the state of Texas from Beijing, considering that the U.S. is in a trade war with China and has slapped a hefty 25% tariff on imported mining equipment.Related: China and US must learn from one another and collaborate on CBDCContinuing the comparison to the U.S., operating expense and capital expense costs of maintaining a data center are considerably lower in Russia, mostly because local labor and construction costs are cheaper.Furthermore, if your rig breaks down, you don’t even have to send it back to China, wasting several weeks (which is considered ages in Bitcoin mining). Institutional-scale Russian facilities tend to have in-house repair centers with technicians trained directly by top Chinese mining hardware manufacturers, so they can quickly get everything up and running again.Russia has been the third-largest Bitcoin mining country in the world for quite a while now, and the local industry has developed significantly.Hearing all of this for this first time, one might argue: But the Russian government has banned crypto. Well, that’s not factually correct. Let’s take a closer look at the country’s major crypto-related law, called “On Digital Financial Assets,” or DFA, that was signed into law in July.The bill prohibits Russian residents from making payments in cryptocurrencies starting from January 2021 but legally recognizes them as “digital financial assets.” It does not mention cryptocurrency mining in any form, meaning that currently, there are no legal restrictions.In early September, however, Russia’s Ministry of Finance reportedly proposed to amend the DFA law to prohibit miners from receiving payments in crypto for their activities. As the authority reportedly stated:While no one knows if the amendments will get approved, what they imply is pretty straightforward: Russians can’t sell the coins that they mine, but they can legally host their hardware and other infrastructure for foreign players. Most likely, the change will affect mom-and-pop operations, since large-scale miners are normally paid in fiat currency. Moreover, operations whose clients are overseas can still be legally paid in crypto from abroad even if the proposed bill comes into effect.Besides, regional authorities in Siberia are growing highly supportive of large mining operators because they pay taxes, create jobs, and put that excess energy to use. The truth is that the government is pro-business and has no interest whatsoever in destroying something that contributes to the economy.At this point, the government has already met all the local large-scale mining operators mostly because the consumption of several megawatts of power is easily detectable by the electric grid operator (and naturally requires some sort of explanation). Earlier in August, the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media published a proposed bill that would establish additional control over data centers in Russia.A skeptic would continue: But surely you will get scammed if you choose to mine in Russia. While doing business is never a risk-free activity, especially when it comes to the cryptocurrency industry, there are actually no reported cases of crypto mining-related scams in Russia. The police regularly shut down illegal operations that steal electricity, but the authorities never scour compliant operations who pay due taxes and costs.Curiously, most stories about inconsistent mining players come from North America, which is generally considered to be a highly-regulated market. In fact, the region is littered with carcasses of mining companies that either suddenly went bust or turned out to be scams, disappearing with investors’ money in both cases.The most recent example would be the Toronto-based HyperBlock, which abruptly closed down its 20-megawatt data center in May, saying that it had to cease operation due to the Bitcoin halving — despite the fact that it is a regular event that companies can prepare for well in advance. Similarly, in early 2019, U.S.-based major crypto mining and blockchain firm Giga Watt closed access and power to its facilities after allegedly failing to pay $300,000 in utility bills.Sure, Russia could use some clearer regulation on mining (like most countries in the world), but this process will likely take some time. The most important thing is that the government has finally communicated its general attitude, which could be summarized in the following way: “We’re skeptical about the use of cryptocurrencies as a payment method, but are fine with the related activities that stimulate our economy.”Consequently, it seems like Russians are getting ready for a mining boom similar to the one that happened in 2017. Local retailers have recently reported a 49% spike in crypto mining-related sales of graphic cards in August, and GPU sales registered from June to August are up 470% compared to last year, so things are clearly heating up.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
127,"Bitcoin (BTC) exchange reserves are continuously plummeting as analysts pinpoint the trend to a shortage of sellers. Since the March crash, the reserves on exchanges rapidly fell from 2,950,000 BTC to 2,700,000 BTC.Within merely seven months, a 250,000 BTC fall in exchange reserves signifies a $2.85 billion decline. Behind the steep trend could be two major factors: a decline in sellers and lower trust toward exchanges.Bitcoin reserves on exchanges. Source: GlassnodeAnalysts mainly attribute the sustained drop in Bitcoin exchange reserves to an overall shortage of sellers in the market.As retail sellers refrain from selling BTC at current prices, institutions are also acquiring more BTC. The simultaneous drop in selling pressure and an increase in buyer demand is an optimistic trend for Bitcoin.A pseudonymous trader known as “Oddgems” said the data shows Bitcoin is likely moving from exchanges to non-custodial wallets. If so, it indicates that investors are moving their funds to hold for a longer period. He said:“More and more #Bitcoin getting out from exchanges and most probably being transferred to non-custodial wallets. This suggests slightly lower liquidity and lower selling pressure going forward.”Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, echoed the stance. He emphasized that BTC outflows from exchanges are growing as cash reserves from institutions are flowing into Bitcoin. He noted:“To be honest, more and more $BTC going from exchanges towards cold wallet storage. Big listed companies allocating cash reserves to $BTC. Is incredibly bullish.”The confluence of stagnant retail outflows from Bitcoin and the consistent demand from institutions buoy the general sentiment around BTC. Dan Tapiero, the co-founder of 10T Holdings, similarly said that “shortages of Bitcoin” is possible due to the surging institutional interest.According to Glassnode, a large portion of the Bitcoin supply is stored in “accumulation addresses.” These addresses represent users who never moved BTC from their wallets, who are likely storing BTC for the long term.When “HODLing” activity is high, which refers to holding onto BTC for prolonged periods, it typically indicates the start of an accumulation phase. Glassnode said:“Bitcoin accumulation has been on a constant upwards trend for months. 2.6M $BTC (14% of supply) are currently held in accumulation addresses. Accumulation addresses are defined as addresses that have at least 2 incoming txs and have never spent BTC.”The positive fundamental on-chain metrics supplement the favorable technical structure of Bitcoin. Despite various events that could have applied selling pressure on BTC, including the BitMEX probe and OKEx withdrawal suspension, BTC remains above $11,400.The BitMEX and OKEx controversy also led exchange reserves to decline sharply, possibly spooking traders. Although BitMEX swiftly processed withdrawals and OKEx wallets show no outflows, the regulatory uncertainty was sufficient to cause exchange reserves to slip.The BitMEX BTC supply. Source: CoinMetricsIn early October, technical analysts pinpointed the $11,100 to $11,300 range as a critical short-term resistance range. BTC has been relatively stable above the said range, which technically is a positive sign for renewed momentum."

Although the open interest is still heavily concentrated on Deribit exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has also reached $300 million.In simple terms, options derivatives contracts allow investors to buy protection, either from the upside (call options) or downside (put options). Even though there are some more complex strategies, the mere existence of liquid options markets is a positive indicator.For example, derivative contracts allow miners to stabilize their income which is tied to a cryptocurrency’s price. Arbitrage and market-making firms also utilize the instruments to hedge their trades. Ultimately, deeply liquid markets attract larger participants and increase their efficiency.Implied volatility is a useful and primary metric that can be extracted from options pricing. Whenever traders perceive increased risk of larger price oscillations, the indicator will shift higher. The opposite occurs during periods when the price is flat or if there is expectation of milder price swings.Volatility is commonly known as a fear indicator, but this is mostly a backward-looking metric. The 2019 spike seen on the above chart coincided with the $13,880 peak on June 26, followed by a sudden $1,400 decline. The more recent volatility spike from March 2020 happened after a 50% decline occurred in just 8 hours.Periods of low volatility are catalysts for more substantial price movements as it signals that market makers and arbitrage desks are willing to sell protection on lower premiums.This is because increasing derivatives open interest leads to more extensive liquidations when a sudden price change occurs.Investors then need to shift their focus to futures markets to assess whether a potential storm is brewing. Increasing open interest denotes either a higher number of market participants or that larger positions are being created.The current $4.2 billion in aggregate open interest might be modest compared to the August peak at $5.7 billion, but is still relevant.A couple of reasons might be holding back a larger figure, including the current BitMEX CFTC charges and KuCoin's $150 million hack.High volatility is another critical factor holding back the open interest on Bitcoin derivatives.Despite 57% being the lowest figure in the past 16 months, it still represents a sizable premium, especially for longer-term options. Both options and futures have a lot of synergy, as more advanced strategies combine both markets.A buyer betting on a $14K strike for the March 21 expiry in 160 days must pay a 10% premium. Therefore, the price at expiry must reach $15,165 or 34% above the current $11,300.As a comparison, Apple (AAPL) shares hold a 41% 3-month volatility. Although higher than the S&P 500's 29%, the long-term impact versus Bitcoin's 47% has striking effects. The same 34% upside for a March 2021 call option for AAPL shares has a 2.7% premium.To put things in perspective, if an APPL share were priced at $11,300, this March 2021 option would cost $308. Meanwhile, the BTC one is trading at $1,150, which is almost four times more expensive.Although there is an implied cost to carrying a perpetual futures position for more extended periods, it hasn't been burdensome. This is because the funding rate of perpetual futures is usually charged every 8 hours.The funding rate has been oscillating between positive and negative for the past couple of months. This results in a net neutral impact on buyers (longs) and short sellers that might have been carrying open positions.Due to its inherent high volatility, Bitcoin options might not be the optimal way to structure leveraged bets. The same $1,150 cost of the March 2021 option could be used to acquire Bitcoin futures using a 4x leverage. This would yield a $1,570 gain (136%) once Bitcoin reaches the same 34% upside required for the option break even.The above example does not invalidate options use, especially when building strategies that include selling call or put options. One should keep in mind that options have a set expiry. Therefore if the desired price range occurs only the following day, it yields no gain at all.For the bulls out there, unless there is a specific price range and time frame in mind, it seems for now sticking with perpetual futures is the best solution.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

129,"Historically, a weaker United States Dollar leads to strength across other “safe haven” assets. By analyzing the correlation, such momentum and conclusion can also be drawn with Bitcoin (BTC) and the USD.Bitcoin has gained in 2020 as the U.S. Dollar Currency Index (DXY) has been having a tough year. But will this momentum continue in the coming months? Let’s take a closer look at the charts.BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe triangle broke upward as the majority of the markets were waiting for a climax to occur, resulting in a rally towards $11,700 and the breakthrough of the crucial $11,000-11,200 resistance zone.However, to sustain the bullish momentum, support has to hold at this $11,000-11,200 area for a test of the $12,000 resistance area to occur.BTC/USD 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewThe weekly chart of Bitcoin is showing the significance of the $12,000 resistance level. Since the bear market started, the $12,000 area has been a big hurdle.This crucial barrier led to multiple tests of this zone. However, a breakthrough didn’t occur yet. But the general consensus is that the more often a level gets tested, the weaker it becomes.As an example, it took silver almost seven years to break through the resistance of $18.Silver 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewThis breakout took a long time, as silver’s price was constantly rejected at the $18 barrier. However, the breakthrough of the $18 level resulted in a massive move with the rally continuing toward $30, a 60% increase since the breakout.But while that’s not much for enthusiasts in the cryptocurrency markets, it’s a large move for the commodity markets. Therefore, a breakthrough of the $12,000 barrier should result in a massive move for Bitcoin as well as the first big hurdle is found between $16,500-17,500.Such a move would result in almost 50% as well.DXY vs. BTC/USD 1-day charts. Source: TradingViewIn recent months, the U.S. Dollar Currency Index has been the center of many discussions regarding Bitcoin’s movements.Quite clear, they do move in the opposite ways of each other, resulting in the conclusion that a weaker U.S. Dollar benefits the price of Bitcoin. This is also the main reasoning behind big institutional investors taking a position in Bitcoin, a major signal of an upcoming new cycle.Indeed, the inverse correlation is evident and quite natural as the global economy is built around the world reserve currency, the U.S. Dollar.DXY vs. Gold 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewThe primary example of weaknesses surrounding the U.S. Dollar is found in the reaction of gold since the dot com bubble of 2000.Since the collapse of the markets in that year, the U.S. dollar lost its value, resulting in a rally of 600% on gold in the years after. Silver even rallied 1,100% in this period.Similarly, when the U.S. Dollar started to show strength, gold and silver retraced heavily as expected.Therefore, since the recent weakness of the U.S. Dollar resulted in a rally around the commodity markets, this would also benefit any momentum in Bitcoin in the coming years. This momentum is often classified as “opting out of the system’” by Bitcoin believers.BTC/USD 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewThe most likely scenario would be a continued range-bound structure with some further tests at lower levels.Multiple arguments can be drawn for this scenario. The first one is the overall weakness of Ethereum so far in Q4, resulting in the overall weakness of the crypto market.In general, the month of January is a perfect month for Ethereum and the markets. However, a breakout in this quarter of the year is unlikely given all the uncertainties surrounding the global economy at this stage.The second argument is the conclusion that the market is still in the build-up of a new cycle. Throughout these build-ups, accumulation ranges are defined, building momentum for the next impulse move to occur.BTC/USD 4-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe 4-day chart of Bitcoin shows similarities with the start of the previous cycle in 2016. Long, sideways constructions were building up momentum, after which a big impulse move occurred towards the next resistance level.That’s the most likely scenario at this point as the market is still building up for the next big cycle. This cycle will take the market to levels not seen before, but it won’t happen in one go.Therefore, accumulation is a critical part of the build-up in such a market, which appears to be currently happening.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

130,"October is a time for surprises. On Oct. 8, right on cue, mobile payments giant Square, which boasts a market cap of $86.6 billion, announced that it had invested $50 million in Bitcoin (BTC). Five days later, asset manager Stone Ridge Holdings, which manages over $10 billion in assets, disclosed that it had purchased more than 10,000 BTC, worth around $114 million, as part of its treasury reserve strategy. They both followed MicroStrategy, a Nasdaq-listed asset manager, which made known last month that it had accumulated $425 million in Bitcoin, making BTC the principal holding in its treasury reserve strategy.Three publicly owned companies, three big BTC purchases — it may be mere coincidence. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has ballooned by $3 trillion since the beginning of 2019, while the U.S. dollar has depreciated 70% against BTC — as Stone Ridge founder Ross Stevens noted in the firm’s Oct. 13 press release.How do the cognoscenti explain it? The U.S. dollar is falling; bond yields are almost non-existent; and gold is underperforming. Liquidity-flush firms have fewer places to put their cash — so they are turning to cryptocurrency. “We are seeing a new trend emerge where corporations are using Bitcoin as a reserve asset for part or majority of their treasury,” pronounced Anthony Pompliano in his Oct. 15 newsletter. Saifedean Ammous, economist and author of The Bitcoin Standard: The Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking, told Cointelegraph:“While I would have expected to see such firms take small positions more as a hedge, it speaks volume to the growing credibility of Bitcoin that as soon as they became intrigued by the value proposition, they chose to go with a large allocation.”Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda — a forex trading company — told Cointelegraph that the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the macro backdrop for fiat currencies, adding: “The Fed, in particular, has clearly signaled an ultra-accommodative monetary stance will remain in place for a few years, and that is making many institutional investors scramble for alternative investments.”Gold, the traditional safe haven in crisis times, has disappointed recently, and as a result, “Bitcoin has emerged as a favorite diversification play away from bonds and will likely steadily attract new institutional investors,” said Moya. Ammous further added: “There is the short-term concern about devaluation of the dollar in light of the increased amount of government spending and stimulus in response to the corona panic crisis.”Paul Cappelli, a portfolio manager at Galaxy Fund Management, told Cointelegraph that “a more sophisticated investor base has come to understand its [BTC’s] value as a non-sovereign, fixed supply, deflationary asset.” Meanwhile, Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds, commented to Cointelegraph:But COVID-19 distress may soon abate, or so one fervently hopes. This leaves “the longer-term critical problem faced by many companies with the diminishing yield they can get on their cash reserves by holding them in banks or treasury bonds,” according to Ammous. In the past, companies could hold their reserves in government bonds and be reasonably sure of outperforming the consumer price index (CPI) — i.e., inflation. But today, “there seems to be a growing segment of companies that no longer reasonably expect that into the future,” said Ammous.Indeed, buried within Stone Ridge’s announcement was a call to banks and philanthropies to likewise make Bitcoin a principal component of their treasury reserve strategies. To that end, Stone Ridge was offering up the services of its New York Digital Investment Group unit, which holds a license from New York State to convert dollars into crypto and back again, along with core custody, financing, and Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer capabilities.Moya cautioned that BTC remains a risky asset, though that could soon change: “Both Europe and America are struggling with the coronavirus, and investors are widely expecting governments and central banks to continue providing massive amounts of stimulus into the economy. BTC for now remains a risky asset and primarily increases in value when risk appetite is strong. Eventually, once the dollar resumes a steady downward trend, Bitcoin and other cryptos will attract some safe-haven flows alongside gold.”Apart from what may or not happen with corporate treasuries, the Square Inc. investment could have reverberations. A $50-million investment in BTC may seem modest for a firm whose market capitalization now surpasses Goldman Sachs’, but most analysts expect that crypto investment will grow.Square has been bullish on Bitcoin for some years now. Its Cash App service enables users to buy and sell Bitcoin, and some analysts believe other payment firms will now have to facilitate crypto investment in some form — or risk being left behind. It hasn’t escaped notice, either, that the younger generation, the Millennials, are especially keen on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.But apart from payment firms, could institutional investors and/or Fortune 500 companies follow Square’s lead as well? “Yes. This trend has moved from an ‘if’ scenario to a ‘when’ scenario,” according to Cappelli. Institutional investors, too, will have to find new ways to diversify their portfolios and maximize balance sheet returns. Meanwhile, BTC has risen 50% since the beginning of the year.But only 18.4 million BTC are now in circulation, and supply could be a problem. “With only roughly 2.5 million Bitcoin left to be mined, many institutional investors will look at other cryptocurrencies for better upside potential,” added Moya.Ease of access and options that meet diligence and compliance standards are also critical, said Cappelli, adding: “Institutions mainly want their digital asset investments to look and feel like other more traditional investments in their portfolio with everything from service providers to reporting.” It’s helped that over the past three years, many traditional players have entered the space “like Fidelity, NYSE, Bloomberg, the CME, Deloitte, KPMG, etc. They’ve all expanded their offerings to include digital assets and this trend is growing,” Cappelli told Cointelegraph.This transformation won’t fail for lack of infrastructure, added Neo, who applauded the institutional-grade platforms that have been built by Fidelity and others. “We view education and regulations as among the most significant barriers” that large firms must overcome if they are to adopt crypto into their core businesses.What could be considered a significant crypto investment for a large hedge fund or institutional investor? “Given the volatility and where the asset class stands today, we have consistently recommended a 50 BP (basis point)-to-2% allocation for suitable investors,” answered Cappelli. As Bitcoin and the overall asset class matures, that allocation could grow further.Moya told Cointelegraph that hedge funds and institutional investors will be more likely to have around 1% exposure to cryptocurrencies. Publicly held corporations, for their part, “will be more interested in creating their own cryptocurrencies, but the regulatory battle that hit Facebook’s Libra project has demotivated many companies.” He added: “Eventually, a large company will take a decent-sized investment, and that should be enough to force other firms to follow suit.”Reflecting on the recent public-firm announcements, Ammous told Cointelegraph: “What was most interesting for me about the MicroStrategy and Stone Ridge purchases is that these are not companies that deal with Bitcoin as part of their core business, and yet they chose to place the majority of their corporate reserves in Bitcoin, not just a small fraction.”It was Satoshi Nakomoto’s vision that in times of crisis, governments would never resist the temptation to print more money — even at the risk of debasing their currency — so Bitcoin’s founder wrote into the cryptocurrency’s code a 21-million BTC limit. No more than that could ever be minted, and that appears to have served Bitcoin well in the time of COVID-19. As Ammous told Cointelegraph, “There seems to be a growing recognition that the strictly limited supply of Bitcoin gives it a good chance at maintaining its value well into the future.”"
131,"On Sept. 27, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong sought to center his employees’ work around the company’s core mission: “to bring economic freedom to people all over the world.” Armstrong argues for a narrow interpretation of Coinbase’s mission to build the best possible product because it is “already hugely ambitious” and because companies generally cannot succeed if their goals “include all forms of equality and justice.” Armstrong’s perspective is not unique to Coinbase and represents a broader tech industry incarnation of the white-savior complex rooted in the belief of the product’s inherent goodness. This belief is especially noteworthy in crypto, given its diversity problem. Views like Armstrong’s, when coming from a mission-driven cryptocurrency organization, ignore and insult the people and organizations on the ground doing the critical work to financially empower communities. Furthermore, these views overestimate the ability of cryptocurrency to address financial exclusion caused by structural problems as well as technical ones.Related: The avaricious misanthropy of Brian ArmstrongThe technology of cryptocurrency offers solutions and features critical to increasing financial inclusion. Payments can be made in places where cash is at risk of being stolen and where bank accounts are inaccessible. They can also be made anonymously and tied to contracts, all without the need for third parties.The technical advantages of cryptocurrency, however, do not line up perfectly with the root causes of financial exclusion. So, while companies such as Coinbase do important work proliferating cryptocurrencies, achieving economic freedom requires more, and crypto projects must be honest about their opportunities to improve financial inclusion as they reckon with their own limitations. If they are not interested in economic prosperity and freedom, that is perfectly fine — a company’s end goal is its bottom-line profits after all. But if crypto organizations are to legitimately claim a social mission, they must step out from behind their computer monitors to address the limitations of their technical products. Otherwise, their platitudes for financial prosperity read like an investment bank asserting that it brings economic freedom to the world through increasing market liquidity.Related: No, blockchain technology cannot solve everythingWhile cryptocurrency offers novel ways to create a new financial system, the technology and its proliferation cannot solve the underlying causes of financial exclusion alone. Today, 1.7 billion people do not have access to a bank account, and billions more do not have access to other basic financial services because institutions have long ignored and oppressed these communities. Of the people who do have access to the financial system, many are trapped in a cycle of debt without the means to generate wealth. According to The Boston Globe, the median net worth of non-immigrant African-American households in Boston is $8. The history of marginalization that cryptocurrency will have to grapple with manifests itself in lack of connectivity, distrust in technology, financial illiteracy, and historical economic and social inequality.Cryptocurrency requires internet access. Today, only 59% of the world has access to the internet. Smartphones, which serve as a lower barrier to entry for people to access the internet, have a penetration rate of only 45%. Hidden within these statistics, however, is the fact that many people who do have internet or smartphones may not have stable connections or regular access to electricity. The overall result is a digital divide preventing billions of people from using cryptocurrency.Crypto is a novel technology that looks to upend some of the most basic forms of everyday life. Fiat currency is not just an everyday tool but the very basis of people’s livelihoods. Distrust in cryptocurrency is to be expected, particularly when people cannot see the physical transaction and when mistakes as simple as a forgotten password can make money unrecoverable. Distrust is also higher among people with low income and limited education — the same people who are most likely to be unbanked or underbanked.Financial illiteracy is also tied to distrust. Financial institutions may offer difficult-to-understand financial products or training, particularly in emerging markets, and some take advantage of consumers through products such as predatory loans. Lack of financial knowledge also stems from a broader inability to access resources or spending adequate time to understand financial products. As a result, financial illiteracy may prevent people from knowing how or why to use cryptocurrency.Most importantly, financial exclusion is the result of poverty and inequality tied to oppression. Throughout history, institutions and people in power have excluded or marginalized certain communities, such as women, minorities, rural residents and LGBTQ+ people. Financial institutions have been part and parcel of this historical exclusion and oppression.Related: LGBTQ+ in blockchain/crypto: A safe space with room for more inclusionIn the United States, we cannot separate finance from its history in slavery or more recent racial discrimination in lending. Similarly, in Europe finance is intricately tied to colonialism. The history of oppression connects seamlessly to current wealth inequality and financial exclusion. If people do not have enough money, they simply have no need for access to the financial system.Cryptocurrency does not generate wealth simply from nothing — it only facilitates the holding and transfer of wealth. Without ways to generate wealth and amid widening economic inequality for over 70% of the global population, people will still find it difficult to use cryptocurrency or have no real use for it at all.For cryptocurrency to meaningfully move “the needle on large global challenges,” as Armstrong writes, the underlying causes of inequality must be addressed. And while mission-driven cryptocurrency organizations cannot expect to do this alone, they have an important role to play in developing and directing their products to be used in the service of addressing the underlying problems. Those who declare they’re on a social mission inevitably sign themselves up for this challenge.Cryptocurrency offers a novel technical solution to creating a new financial system — this achievement should be celebrated because it has the potential to be truly transformative. It can be used by people in economically unstable countries such as Argentina to avoid currency volatility or to make anonymous transactions in the face of repressive regimes, for example, Venezuela’s. In politically stable countries, cryptocurrencies can change everyday life, too. They give the means to bypass intermediaries that may not be robust, impose exorbitant costs, collect and sell user data, or exclude marginalized groups.Cryptocurrencies can create a financial infrastructure uniquely suited to addressing financial exclusion, but without enabling easier access to that infrastructure, its benefits are not fully realized. In response, companies can design easy-to-use crypto products and invest in educating their users. They might also build mobile-friendly decentralized applications, optimize for cheap smartphones and low-bandwidth connectivity, lower the technical barriers to become a validator, and create easy-to-understand user interfaces.But the real barrier is poverty and people’s inability to access the most basic infrastructure, including the internet and smartphones, which are outside of a cryptocurrency company’s direct mandate. Unlike a traditional company, a mission-driven crypto organization will have to dedicate its resources to addressing these more underlying systemic problems. This can take the form of funding initiatives to increase internet access and financial literacy or engaging in social activism by supporting community organizations working on the ground to alleviate poverty.A mission-driven company will have to understand the societal problems of today and determine when they can be solved by technology and when they require something more entirely.Companies are not inherently virtuous because they create technologies that might be used for good. Technology is neutral and open to the direction of anyone who can afford it. Good comes from the active development and implementation of technology by people and mission-driven organizations seeking the resolution of social problems. Mission-driven cryptocurrency organizations, therefore, must take responsibility for how their technology affects people’s lives and deliberately engage in broader social activism. To effectively do this, they need to be proximate to the communities in question and treat them as equal partners in the quest for social good.Twelve years ago, Satoshi Nakamoto published the technical design for Bitcoin (BTC) during a financial crisis originating from historically exclusionary institutions. The crisis of economic inequality, however, has not ended as evidenced by protests in the U.S. for racial justice and the COVID-19 pandemic, with a severe and disproportionate economic impact on minorities and women. The financial system needs to be reimagined in order to promote global economic prosperity. In this effort, cryptocurrency organizations can be a crucial player when they engage beyond their technical products to also address the root causes of financial exclusion.Armstrong is not wrong when he says that the trendy social activism of Silicon Valley companies has “the potential to destroy a lot of value at most companies.” Doing good costs time and money, and it is rarely profitable. If it were so easy and rewarding, financial exclusion would likely not be a problem for billions of people in the first place. But that is the point. If a company is to claim that it is mission-driven, it cannot simply make its products and assume that it will be used for good. Even if that assumption is correct, a mission-driven organization must do part of that work itself if it is to ensure its products and work are directed toward doing good.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors’ alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.This article was co-authored by Nikhil Raghuveera and Stewart Scott."
132,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating within a tight range for several months. If the top cryptocurrency successfully breaks out, Bitazu Capital founding partner Mohit Sorout says a record-high would be imminent.Since July 2020, Bitcoin has been ranging between $10,200 and $11,800, a 15% range. It has seen subdued volatility for a prolonged period, except for some short instances of a volatility spike.When Bitcoin stays stable for a long time in a tight price range, a major price movement typically occurs. Whether a breakout would occur in the near term or not remains an uncertainty. But if it happens, Sorout says it would take three months for BTC to hit $20,000.The daily Bitcoin chart with a trendline. Source: TradingView.com, Mohit SoroutBased on previous price cycles, Bitcoin tends to move fast after existing a long-range. The pattern historically applied both breakouts and breakdowns.From May 1 to July 20, Bitcoin ranged between $8,800 to $9,800, stabilizing at around $9,100. After two months of consolidation, it took BTC 12 days to record a 32% rally to $12,123 on Binance.Considering the tendency of Bitcoin to see large volatility spikes after prolonged consolidation periods, Sorout said:“Calm before the storm. If $BTC was to break out today, it would most probably reach its previous ATH of $20k within 3 months.”When asked about the reasoning behind the three-month span, Sorout said it is based on an observation of volatility.According to Sorout, a price increase towards $20,000 could happen even earlier than three months. He noted:“An observation based on how violent the rallies are after subdued periods of volatility. Could even be earlier.”One important variable to pinpoint is the decline in futures open interest compared to previous bull markets. Particularly after the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission or CFTC’s charges against BitMEX, overall futures open interest has dropped. This could lead to a more stable and gradual uptrend for Bitcoin, unlike past bull cycles.Year-to-date open interest of BitMEX.

133,"“Fiat lux”, said God, having created heaven and earth, which was filled with darkness. And then, there was light. At least, that’s what the Holy Bible tells us. Translated to English, this Latin phrase means “let light be made.”For Christians, who much of the global population, these words mark the beginning of time and everything else. Eventually, there came a time when audacious, power-hungry, control-freak governments took the word “fiat” (literally meaning “it shall be” or “let it be done”) and used it to disguise one of the biggest shams ever — fiat currencies.Eons later, in 2009 A.D., came the Bitcoin Genesis Block — the first chapter of a new bible in the making: the Bitcoin white paper. It marked the beginning of a new time of monetary independence and the gradual obliteration of the financial deception that governments play upon citizens.Now, almost 11 years later, we are moving with steady steps toward Judgement Day: the day that we come to own the money we earn. We will control our money and not the central bank-government nexus.Imagine a stone that I picked up while strolling on the beaches of Miami. It’s an ordinary stone of no real value whatsoever (except emotional value, of course). Now, imagine yourself as someone who trusts me — or better still, has faith in my words and actions. I give you this stone, saying that it has a value that you can exchange for goods — you believe me. Excited, I go back to where I’d been on the beach and discover a rather endless supply of these stones. Then, I catch hold of some other people like you, build a narrative of trustworthiness that is rooted in your naivete, and establish a new currency.This, in a metaphorical way, is exactly what fiat currency is — a bluff, a farce. So much so, thatRichard Russel fiat currencies as:The deceivers here, of course, are the governments and central banks.To define, fiat currencies are government-sanctioned money, whose value is merely on a contract of trust between the issuing government and the citizens: It’s not backed by any physical commodity of value, say, gold. That is as good as saying that fiat money derives its value out of thin air.A recurring phrase that you’ll find in any definition of fiat money is that “it has no intrinsic value.” It’s a lie that governments tell us, or a bad joke. Now, if you’re someone with a faithful, believing — I’d say anesthetized — mind, all this might appear to be a cynic’s rant to you. Yet, when you come out of the haze and take a closer look at all the and depressions and from around the world, you should see what I mean.This, precisely, is the “darkness” upon which the Bitcoin genesis block shed light, flashing like a bolt of lightning coming out of the 2008 global financial crisis — or should I say, scam. Indeed, if Bitcoin could speak, or if Satoshi Nakomoto hadn’t been anonymous, they would have exclaimed: “Fiat lux.” Anyway, that didn’t happen, and before discussing the genesis block and what it meant, let’s discuss another crucial aspect.Before anything else, let’s rewind. There was a time when the U.S. dollar wasn’t, as the famous author Robert Kiyosaki once called it, “fake money.” Until 1971, its value was based on the , and one U.S. dollar equaled the value of 24.75 grains of gold. That year, however, the United States adopted the fiat system. Thereafter, the U.S. dollar started deriving its value from the “full faith and credit” of the U.S. government. That’s when the devil got us, growing stronger and more monstrous every day.In the fiat system, “trusted intermediaries” such as banks, governments and other financial institutions act as pillars holding up the world’s infrastructure. They are also in full control of the nation’s money — our money. Although fiat money has value only as long as the people trust these intermediaries, governments can print as much or as few currency notes as they want.In an attempt to combat economic crises, governments often print more money, thus leading to inflation and depreciation in the currency’s value. In turn, this also means that our savings (stored in fiat currency) lose their value. Believe it or not — that’s the game.For instance, in 2000, the Zimbabwean government printed an abnormal number of notes to meet an ongoing crisis. Consequently, the nation experienced hyperinflation of 230 billion to 500 billion percent. No joke. At the peak of the nation’s inflation, 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollars 40 U.S. cents. That said, this doesn’t happen only in underdeveloped African nations. It’s exactly the same everywhere, to varying degrees.In 2008, with the of Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin white paper, the world of finance witnessed a ray of light, a flicker of hope. The darkness began to look less eternal.Since the mining of its first-ever block — the Bitcoin genesis block or Block 0, as it’s commonly known — Bitcoin has become a savior to many. Investing in Bitcoin, people have gone from rags to riches (although, in the early days, the opposite was also true).Now, you might be wondering how dare I compare Bitcoin with God, or even the Bible? More importantly, why do I call it the New Testament of finance? The allegory of darkness and all of that lines up, but there’s a more tangible reason as well: Bitcoin makes governments and their sanctioned deceivers irrelevant.Governments can make a fool out of us only because we trust them. On the other hand, before Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, there seemed to be no other way. Now, the times have changed, the death bells for government-sponsored scams have been tolled, and their echo resounds louder every moment.In introducing its underlying blockchain technology, the Bitcoin genesis block ushered a new reality. While storing and transacting value, we can now put our trust upon infallible mathematical algorithms and not corruptible intermediaries.Bitcoin introduced the possibility of a trustless world, eliminating the need for banks or any other middlemen. Now, two people can directly transact value (money or otherwise) over networks that are inherently secure and transparent. Above all, the value of Bitcoin (as well as other cryptocurrencies) is based on the pure demand of its users. As such, the dubious motives of centralized governments are powerless.We still have a long way to go in a world where Satoshi Nakamoto is the original creator and the Bitcoin genesis block is the first chapter of its bible. Maybe we could even create a new calendar with 2008 as the first year.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
134,"Earlier this week Bitcoin (BTC) price entered a bullish breakout to $11,725 following the previous week’s news that Square purchased $4,709 BTC but since then the price has slumped back into a sideways range. Several rejections near $11,500 and the recent news of OKEx halting all withdrawals as its CEO ‘cooperates’ with an investigation being carried out by Chinese authorities is also weighing on investor sentiment and Bitcoin price.The wave of negative news has pulled the majority of altcoin prices back into the red and extinguished the newly found bullish momentum Bitcoin displayed.The daily time frame signals that losing $11,200 could open the door for the price to retest $11,100, a level which resides in a VPVR gap and would probably give way to a further drop to $10,900.According to Cointelegraph Micheal van de Poppe, there is:Van de Poppe suggests that if Bitcoin loses the $11K support there is a possibility of the price falling below $10K to the 200-MA at $9,750 which is near a CME gap.Although the current price action is disappointing to bulls who want to see a retest of $12K, taking a bird’s-eye view shows that there are multiple factors playing out in Bitcoin’s favor.The recent BTC allocations by MicroStrategy, Square and Stone Ridge are positive, especially considering the current economic uncertainties that exist as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.Furthermore, volumes are surging again at multiple BTC futures exchanges and on Friday Cointelegraph reported that Bakkt Bitcoin exchange reached a new record-high for BTC delivery.Bitcoin has also largely ignored the majority of the negative news over the past two months and held above the $10K level as buyers show consistent interest in purchasing near this level.It’s also worth noting that only about 1.5 weeks have passed since Bitcoin exited a 24-day long compression phase which was followed by the most recent breakout to $11,750.Since the bullish breakout occurred the price has retested the $11,200 level as support but a deeper pullback to the 20-MA to test $11K as support wouldn’t be out of the ordinary. Even a drop to the $10,650 level near the 100-MA would simply be a retest of the descending trendline from the 2020 high at $12,467.For the short term, it seems likely that Bitcoin price will trade in the $11,400-$9,700 area, a range which may turn out to be a swing trader’s paradise.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

135,"Data from Arcane Research shows Bakkt Bitcoin exchange saw another record-high month from Sept. 20 to Oct. 20. This follows a noticeable rise in institutional demand for Bitcoin (BTC) from public companies in recent months.Bakkt, the digital asset payment platform and derivatives exchange, is tailored for institutional investors in the U.S. It is operated by Intercontinental Exchange, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange.When the volume of the Bakkt Bitcoin futures market increases, which physically settles Bitcoin contracts, it typically demonstrates growth in institutional appetite for digital assets.As shown above, Cointelegraph and Digital Assets Data reflect a significant surge in futures volumes across multiple exchanges in the month of October.According to the analysts at Arcane Research, 400 BTC contracts are set to expire in October at Bakkt. Month-over-month, the data shows a 14% jump from September.Bakkt’s volume and open interest are important in gauging institutional activity because it is one of the three widely utilized platforms by institutions alongside LMAX Digital and CME.As such, Arcane Research said that the substantial increase in futures contract deliveries on Bakkt signifies rising institutional demand. The researchers noted:Atop the high trading activity on Bakkt, LMAX Digital and CME are also continuously posting large demand.Data from Skew shows that LMAX Digital remains the biggest spot exchange in the global market by volume. According to Skew, LMAX Digital processed $135.6 million worth of BTC in the last 24 hours. This exceeded the daily volume of Coinbase, Kraken, and other major retail-focused exchanges.Since LMAX Digital primarily facilitates trades for institutions, the exchange surpassing Coinbase depicts the current institutional landscape of Bitcoin. There is strong demand coming from institutions, especially following recent high profile investments of Square and MicroStrategy.Similar to Bakkt, the CME Bitcoin futures market has also seen an increase in open interest. Since Oct. 2, following the monthly expiry for September, CME’s Bitcoin open interest rose from $345 million to $561 million.Industry executives and high-net-worth investors in the cryptocurrency market expect the trend of rising institutional appetite for Bitcoin to continue.Tyler Winklevoss, the billionaire Bitcoin investor and the co-founder of Gemini, said Bitcoin is steadily evolving into a corporate treasury asset.When MicroStrategy announced that it acquired $425 million worth of BTC, the company emphasized that it considers BTC as the firm’s primary treasury asset. Winklevoss wrote:"
136,"Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s cash-settled Bitcoin (BTC) futures trading products “contribute more to price discovery than its related spot markets,” according to findings in a new report by investment firm Wilshire Phoenix.The increasing volumes of crypto derivative products highlight greater participation from institutional investors and this will likely be positive for the entire crypto space.This is not unique to cryptocurrencies because even in most other asset classes, the derivatives markets lead the spot markets.In a separate attempt to determine the valuation of Bitcoin, several experts from JPMorgan Chase opined that Bitcoin’s price is overvalued compared to its intrinsic value and the analysts suggested that BTC could face selling in the short-term.The analysts consider Bitcoin to be a commodity and have calculated its marginal cost of production to estimate its intrinsic value.While fundamentals do work in the long-term, short-term price action is usually dictated by sentiment and technicals. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the path of least resistance.BTC/USDBitcoin (BTC) bounced off the $11,178 support on Oct. 15 but the bulls could not sustain the price above $11,500. This weakness could have attracted profit booking by the short-term traders and shorting by the aggressive bears.The bears are currently attempting to sink the price back below the critical support at $11,178. However, this level is likely to attract buyers because the 20-day exponential moving average ($11,081) is placed just below this support.The upsloping 20-day EMA and the relative strength index in the positive territory suggest that buyers have the upper hand.If the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, it will be the first sign of strength. The uptrend could pick up momentum after the bulls can sustain the BTC/USD pair above the ascending channel.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the pair below the 20-day EMA, a drop to the support line of the channel is possible. A breakdown of the channel could spark further selling, which could result in a drop to $10,000.ETH/USDThe bears are currently attempting to sustain Ether (ETH) below the moving averages. If they succeed, a drop to the uptrend line is possible. If this support also cracks, it will indicate a range-bound action for the biggest altcoin for a few more days.The flat moving averages and the RSI near 50 also point to a balance between supply and demand.However, if the ETH/USD pair turns up from the current levels or the uptrend line, the bulls will again try to push the price above the overhead resistance at $395. If they can pull it off, it will complete an ascending triangle pattern that has a target objective of $481.608.XRP/USDXRP broke below the moving averages on Oct. 15 and is on its way to the critical support at $0.2295. Although the altcoin had formed a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern, the bulls could not push the price above the neckline at $0.26 and the setup did not complete.The current price action of the altcoin is a good example of why traders should wait for the setup to complete before taking a directional bet. Buying in anticipation could quickly turn the trade into a loss.The XRP/USD pair is currently range-bound between $0.2295 and $0.26, hence, the bulls are likely to buy near the support of the range.A trending move will start after the bulls push the price above $0.26 or the bears sink the pair below $0.219712.BCH/USDBitcoin Cash (BCH) witnessed sharp selling at $266.46 that resulted in a retest of the breakout level at $242. The sharp rebound off this support suggests that the bulls aggressively accumulated at lower levels and $242 has now flipped from resistance to support.The upsloping 20-day EMA ($238) and the RSI above 60 suggests that the bulls have the upper hand. If the buyers can push the price above $266.46, the uptrend could reach $280 and then $300.This assumption will be invalidated if the bears sell at the current levels and sink the BCH/USD pair below the moving averages. If that happens, the pair could again drop to $215.BNB/USDBinance Coin (BNB) has turned around from $31.9798 today as the bears attempt to stall the uptrend and sink the price back below the support at $29.5646 and the 20-day EMA at $28.77.If the sellers can manage to sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bullish momentum has weakened. A break below $26 could suggest the start of a deeper correction to $22.However, if the BNB/USD pair rises from the $22.5646 support or the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend.A strong rebound will suggest that the bulls are aggressively accumulating on dips, while a weak rebound will indicate a lack of demand, hence, the bears could pounce on it.Therefore, traders can keep an eye on the strength of the rebound to determine whether the up-move will resume or the rally will fizzle out at higher levels.LINK/USDChainlink (LINK) turned down from the 50-day simple moving average ($11.22) on Oct. 13 but the positive thing is that the bulls are attempting to arrest the pullback at the 20-day EMA ($10.40).A strong rebound off the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the sentiment has turned from sell on rallies to buy on dips. The first target is $12 and above this, the LINK/USD pair could reach $13.28.However, if the rebound off the 20-day EMA is weak, it may again face stiff resistance at the 50-day SMA. If the pair once again turns down from this overhead resistance, it will increase the possibility of a decline to $8.7975.DOT/USDPolkadot (DOT) has turned down from the 20-day EMA ($4.22) and the bears will now try to sink the price below the $3.5321 support. If the bears manage a close (UTC time) below $3.5321, it will complete a descending triangle pattern.This bearish setup has a target objective of $1.4743. However, it may not be a straight fall to this level because the bulls could step in and provide support at $2.60 and again at $2.Contrary to this assumption, if the DOT/USD pair turns up from the current levels or rebounds off $3.5321, the bulls will try to push the price above the resistance line of the descending triangle.If that happens, it will invalidate the bearish pattern and that could result in an up-move to $4.6112 and then $5.5899.ADA/USDThe bulls could not drive Cardano (ADA) above the neckline of the possible inverse head and shoulders pattern. This could have attracted profit booking by the short-term bulls and selling by the aggressive bears resulting in a drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.10).As the 20-day EMA is sloping up marginally and the RSI is in the positive zone, the bulls may defend this support. If the ADA/USD pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will try to push the price above the neckline.If they succeed, the pair could start a new uptrend that may reach $0.128062 and above it $0.1445.This positive view will be invalidated if the pair continues to slip and it breaks below the 50-day SMA ($0.098). Such a move could result in a drop to $0.090.LTC/USDLitecoin (LTC) has dropped below both moving averages today, which suggests that the bears used the rally to the $51 resistance to initiate short positions. However, the bulls have not yet given up as they are currently attempting to defend the uptrend line.If the bulls fail to push the price above the moving averages, the selling is likely to intensify and the bears will once more try to sink the LTC/USD pair below the uptrend line. If they succeed, a drop to $42 is possible.Conversely, if the pair rises above the moving averages, the bulls will try to thrust the price above the $51–$52.36 resistance zone. If they succeed, the inverse head and shoulders pattern will complete and it has a target objective of $60.3702.BSV/USDBitcoin SV (BSV) has broken below the moving averages and is now likely to remain range-bound between $180.63 and $146.20. The fall today has invalidated the possibility of an inverse head and shoulders pattern.The 20-day EMA ($166) is flat but the 50-day SMA ($167) is sloping down and RSI has dropped below 42, which suggests a slight advantage to the bears. A break below $146.20 could start a new downtrend.However, if the BSV/USD pair recovers from the current levels or from the $146.20 support, the bulls will make one more attempt to drive the price above $180.63. A close (UTC time) above this resistance could start an up-move to $210.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

137,"The Bitcoin Improvement Proposals 340 through 342 were merged into the Bitcoin codebase on Thursday, signaling that the anticipated Taproot upgrade is ready.Taproot and the associated technology of Schnorr signatures are considered to be the most important upgrade for Bitcoin in the past year. It is primarily a privacy improvement for complex spending conditions on Bitcoin like multisig transactions, time locks and other conditions based on Bitcoin Script.As Cointelegraph reported previously, Taproot hides every additional spending condition beyond the one that was activated. For example, a transaction might be executed immediately if all four multisig signers agree, or it could require a certain amount of time to pass before funds are unlocke if only three out of four signers are present. Normally, an outsider is able to identify every possible condition, but with Taproot they will see only the one that was eventually triggered.Furthermore, thanks to Schnorr signatures, a pure multisig transaction can be made indistinguishable from normal transfers. It is worth addressing that Taproot makes no changes to mixing protocols like CoinJoin, which will remain easily distinguishable.While the initial code for Taproot was submitted for review in January, some complications primarily related to Schnorr signatures required an extensive amount of refinement.The proposals have now been fully reviewed by Bitcoin core developers and are ready to be included in a client release. Pieter Wuille, the lead developer for Taproot, told Cointelegraph that “it’s all done, except activation.”Cointelegraph previously reported that consensus for activation may require some time to be reached. The process could potentially last for years, though Taproot is generally considered much less controversial than previous upgrades like SegWit.The process starts as soon as the activation code is included in Bitcoin Core, allowing miners to signal approval for its inclusion. But Taproot seems to have come slightly at the wrong time for immediate activation.Jonas Nick, researcher at Blockstream and Bitcoin core developer, told Cointelegraph that “Taproot is not ready for activation yet.”He explained that activation logic is generally not included in a major release, referring to the upcoming 0.21 version. The codebase reached “feature freeze” on Thursday, with the base Taproot code making it just in time. Nevertheless, only bug fixes will be added from now on. Explaining why developers are cautious, Nick said:The logic to activate Taproot on mainnet is likely to be included in a future minor version, but in the meantime, Nick said that “Taproot could be activated on something like signet or testnet if someone produced the code for that,” as the raw implementation is already present."
138,"The New York Department of Financial Services, or NYDFS, has released a lengthy report analyzing the impact of July’s high-profile Twitter hack, which resulted in the theft of over $118,000 worth of Bitcoin (BTC). Far beyond the immediate material impact, the NYDFS states that the incident exposed deep cybersecurity weaknesses of a publicly-traded social media company valued at $37 billion and counting over 330 million active monthly users. The discovery has serious consequences in light of the platform’s ever-expanding influence on both financial markets and the political sphere. Two key sections of the NYFDS report, published on Oct. 14, tackle the Twitter hack’s impact on the department’s cryptocurrency licensees, and how these companies responded to protect their clients from the fraud. NYFDS also surveyed and compiled crypto firms’ recommendations on how to prevent a similar cyberattack from succeeding in the future.The agency notes that in the third phase of the hack, the attackers took aim at the Twitter accounts of crypto companies, which included NYDFS-regulated entities. These “responded quickly to block impacted addresses, demonstrating the maturity of New York’s cryptocurrency marketplace and those authorized to engage within it. Their actions show that New York continues to set a high standard and attract only the most responsible actors.”Coinbase, Gemini and Square, all of which provide wallet services and whose Twitter accounts were hacked, rapidly blocked the Bitcoin addresses posted by the hackers on Twitter. According to NYFDS’ survey, each of the companies blocked the relevant addresses within 40 minutes of their accounts being hacked. Fifteen surveyed crypto firms in total blocked transfers to the addresses, while seven did not. The report notes that some companies have different business models and do not directly handle custody and transfer services, which accounts for their inaction. Among those that do, Coinbase blocked around 5,670 transfers, valued at roughly $1,294,000; Square blocked 358, valued at roughly $51,000; Gemini blocked two, valued at roughly $1,8000; and Bitstamp blocked one, valued at $250.The other focus of the NYFDS survey and report was to analyze which security measures the crypto firms took to protect their social media accounts following the hack, and gather key recommendations to cement security going forward. These included using strong and unique passwords, monitoring social media accounts for unauthorized posts, using multi-factor authentication but avoiding SMS-based MFA due to its susceptibility to hacks, and limiting employee access to social media accounts. Placing the hack in context, NYFDS notes that in 2019, millions of people worldwide lost over $4.3 billion to cryptocurrency scams — up from just $650 million in 2018. Exploiting the pandemic, scammers have already stolen over $380 million in the first half of 2020. One scammer tactic that intersects with the Twitter hack “impersonating Elon Musk on Twitter” has already cost victims almost $200,000 in Bitcoin. Such incidents have spurred the entrepreneur to warn his followers:Report as soon as you see it. Troll/bot networks on Twitter are a *dire* problem for adversely affecting public discourse & ripping people off. Just dropping their prominence as a function of probable gaming of the system would be a big improvement."
139,"Large Bitcoin (BTC) transactions from Huobi cryptocurrency exchange are moving to OKEx despite the latter having temporarily suspended crypto withdrawals.According to data from crypto tracking service Whale Alert, a total of 1,995 BTC ($22.5 million) was sent from Huobi to OKEx shortly after OKEx officially announced it was suspending withdrawals on Oct. 16.The funds were transferred in two separate BTC transactions worth 998 BTC ($11.3 million) and 997 BTC ($11.3 million) at 3:51 a.m. EST and 06:22 a.m. EST, respectively.The transfers raise some questions as 1,995 BTC is now locked on the platform due to the platform temporarily blocking crypto withdrawals. “Dude go the opposite way,” someone from the crypto community commented on Twitter. Others suggested that the issue could be a result of delayed BTC transactions.The transactions from Huobi bring a significant amount of Bitcoin to OKEx’s total BTC balance. According to data from BTC balance-based exchange ranking Chain.info, OKEx now holds a total of 276,184 BTC on its cold vault, hot wallets, and deposit wallets. At publishing time, a total of 6,269 BTC left OKEx over the past 24 hours.Approximately five hours later, Whale Alert sounded the horn on another large BTC move, but this time the funds seemingly somehow left OKEx, amid closed withdrawals. Someone sent 3,500 Bitcoin, worth roughly $39,627,432 at the time of transfer, to Binance from OKEx, Whale alert tweeted, adding: ""We suspect these are internal exchange transfers. We are investigating the matter right now.""Referring to the 3,500 BTC OKEx withdrawal tweet from Whale Alert, a public statement from OKEx explained:""OKEx's wallet team has confirmed that the origin wallet addresses in said transactions do not belong to OKEx. The chief economist at major blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis also confirmed in a tweet today that the transactions in question had been 'mislabelled' and were not in fact from OKEx."" Earlier today, Chinese media reported that OKEx founder Star Xu was questioned by the police a week ago.UPDATE Oct. 16, 18:43 UTC: This article has been updated with added information."
140,"The founder of major global cryptocurrency exchange OKEx has been reportedly questioned by authorities previous to OKEx suspending cryptocurrency withdrawals.OKEx founder Mingxing Xu, also known as Star Xu, has reportedly been questioned by the police, Chinese news agency Caixin reported today. According to the report, the executive was investigated “at least a week ago” and has also been absent from work for some time.When approached for comment on Xu’s participation in a police inquiry, OKEx told Cointelegraph that the exchange is no longer affiliated with OK Group, where Xu is a senior executive, and therefore was not in a position to comment on his activities. The news comes shortly after OKEx suspended withdrawals of crypto assets on its platform today. According to the exchange, OKEx’s private key holders are cooperating with a public security bureau in an ongoing investigation. The exchange told Cointelegraph:OKEx CEO Jay Hao said that the decision to temporarily suspend withdrawals was taken “with user security in mind,” stating: "
141,"Bitcoin (BTC) hitting $1 million by 2025 is “about right,” Real Vision founder and CEO Raoul Pal has confirmed.In an interview with Stansberry Research last week, Pal, famous for his bullish stance on Bitcoin, said an “enormous wall of money” would flow into the cryptocurrency over the next few years.“I think that’s about right, whether it’s five years, six years,” he said when asked about the $1 million target. “We’re going to go through two of these halving cycles, and just from what I know from all of the institutions, all of the people I speak to, there is an enormous wall of money coming into this. It’s an enormous wall of money, just the pipes aren’t there to allow people to do it yet, and that’s coming, but it’s on everyone’s radar screen and there are a lot of smart people working on it[.]”Bitcoin’s current halving cycle began in May 2020 and will last approximately four years. Beyond Pal, a whole sphere of analytics looks at the impact of halvings, which cut the supply of new Bitcoins available per block by 50% and make consistently bullish predictions.Just this week, PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow family of Bitcoin price models, confirmed that BTC/USD was on track to increase by an order of magnitude after May.In terms of the “wall of money,” meanwhile, corporate Bitcoin buy-ins continue to surface this month, Cointelegraph reported.“I think it’s going to be not because the world’s collapsing; it’s because there’s going to be adoption by the real large pools of capital,” Pal summarized.Pal also revealed that he would be looking to sell his gold investments and convert them to Bitcoin due to the latter’s superior performance.Despite not “disliking” gold and remaining invested in both assets for the time being, the future was unequivocally skewed in Bitcoin’s favor, he said.“...When you get to the macro opportunity, when it’s all happening — Bitcoin starts breaking out of these patterns that it’s been forming, it is going to massively outperform gold, I’m 100% sure of that. In which case why would I have a gold allocation?”Bitcoin vs. gold 6-month chart. Source: SkewHere, too, Pal is not alone. As Cointelegraph noted, analysts including statistician Willy Woo have forecast Bitcoin breaking away from traditional asset correlation to forge its own path. The timeframe is unclear, Woo last month nonetheless anticipating it happening “soon.”According to a new report from crypto index fund provider Stack Funds this week, meanwhile, support is in place for BTC/USD to run to $15,000 after November’s U.S. elections."
142,"OKEx, one of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, announced a temporary suspension of withdrawals on Oct. 16. Upon the news, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) abruptly plunged 3% in 30 minutes across major exchanges.The nervousness in the market comes from the reason behind the withdrawal suspension and the potential implications it carries. The 15-minute price chart of Bitcoin. Source: TradingView.comThe OKEx team said one of the private key holders of the exchange is cooperating with a public security bureau in investigations. The team said:“One of our private key holders is currently cooperating with a public security bureau in investigations where required.   We have been out of touch with the concerned private key holder.  As such, the associated authorization could not be completed.  Pursuant to 8.1 Service Change and Interruption of the Terms of Service, OKEx may change the Service and/or may also interrupt, suspend or terminate the service at any time with or without prior notice.”Immediately after the OKEx statement was released, the price of Bitcoin dropped from $11,514 to $11,190. The 3% drop occurred within a 30-minute span, causing a market-wide pullback.Bitcoin exchanges typically implement a multi-signature system to process withdrawals from cold storage, i.e. a wallet that is not connected to the internet.To transfer funds from the cold wallet, the exchange often distributes several private keys to the owners and executives. In a multi-signature system, all or the majority of key holders must be present to sign off transactions.In the case of OKEx, the exchange said that one of the private key holders isn’t able to approve withdrawals. Jay Hao, the CEO of OKEx, said:“All operations @OKEx except digital asset/cryptocurrency withdrawals remain unaffected. All your funds and assets are safe. The investigation concerns a certain private key holder’s personal issue only. Further announcements will be made.”The price of Bitcoin fell sharply on the OKEx news for two main reasons. First, OKEx is a major exchange that processes substantial amounts of both spot and futures volume.Second, when it concerns an exchange with ties to China, there is usually heightened market speculation. Red Li, the co-founder of 8BTC, said:“OKEx first stated withdrawal will be suspended 15PM but quickly changed to 11AM. Rumor has it that over 800 accs in ‘certain’ exchange are involved with cross-border money laundering.”Leo Weese, the president at The Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, said he was surprised by the fact that one person could affect an exchange’s entire cold storage multi-sig system. He wrote:“That one person sits in China holding the keys to an entire offshore cryptocurrency exchange is probably the most surprising thing about this industry I learned this year. That customers don't demand transparency about key management comes in at a close second, though.”In the case of BitMEX, as an example, when the firm’s CTO Samuel Reed was arrested earlier this month, the majority of private key holders were able to sign off on transactions."
143,"Major crypto asset exchange OKEx has suspended cryptocurrency withdrawals, announcing that one of the holders of its private keys is “currently cooperating with a public security bureau” concerning ongoing “investigations.”The exchange noted that it has been “out of touch” with the key-holder, preventing the ""associated authorization"" from being completed. OKEx plans to resume digital asset withdrawals “immediately” once the key-holder “is able to authorize the transaction.”Citing its terms of service, OKEx said it had decided to suspend withdrawals but added that the security of its customers’ assets “will not be affected” by the events.Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen nearly 3% in response to the news, while OKEx’s native token OKB has crashed 15%.Hours before the announcement, on-chain transaction monitoring service Whale Alert noted several large transfers between OKEx and unknown wallets.Outgoing transfers of 1,180 BTC worth $13.6 million, 50 million Tron (TRX) worth $1.3 million, and 21,000 Ether (ETH) were made over six hours, alongside an incoming transaction of roughly $13.9 million in Tether (USDT). The transfers occurred during a similar time period to transfers of coins from the Bitfinex hack according to Whale Alert's feed, however this may simply be a coincidence given the large numbers of transactions that occur every day.Beijing based reporter Colin Wu, who writes at WeChat public account @wublockchain suggested the OKEx investigation may be related to money laundering.OKEx targets asian markets, although it is headquartered in Malta. Wu also alleged he'd discovered an ""OTC merchant on OKEx had mistakenly received 500,000 CNY from the fraud group and was hunted by the police across the provinces.""Wu’s information is unverified at this early stage. The OKEx situation occurs after a 48 hour period that saw at least 33 arrests resulting from separate law enforcement operations targeting global money laundering operations in North America, Oceania, and Europe."
144,"The latest findings by Santiment, published in Cointelegraph Consulting’s biweekly newsletter, indicates that discussions around Ethereum have switched from highly bearish to predominantly bullish. Historically, this hasn’t meant good news for the token's price.Ethereum’s on-chain activity, measured by unique daily addresses, has rebounded from its nose dive at the end of summer. The latest surge has taken Ethereum to a 3-week high of 420,610 addresses per day — marking a 25.2% growth compared to the day prior.Another noticeable trend is Ethereum’s 365-day dormant circulation, which tracks the renewed movement of all tokens that have previously not changed addresses for more than a year. This number has stayed relatively low since the October 7th bottom, with a recorded daily average of just 13,438 ETH, suggesting that long-term holders are still sitting on their bags despite the recent price bounceback.Ethereum’s Network Profit/Loss, which computes the average profit or loss of all coins that change addresses daily, are a good way of seeing which holders are panic selling at a loss. Amid a market-wide crash on March 13th, 2020, Ethereum’s network realized a cumulative loss of -$2,932,200 based on NPL: a 3-month low. In a similar fashion, Ethereum’s network realized a cumulative loss of $-998,998 on October 7th, shortly before the coin bounced back above $350.A number of Ethereum’s bottoms over the past 2 months featured the same behavioral pattern, suggesting a wave of panic sell-offs and short-term redistribution of Ethereum to strong hands — allowing for a more sustained bounce back. This metric remains important as statisticians can calculate the ""blood in the streets"". Ethereum’s 30-day MVRV ratio, which tracks the average profit (or loss) of all addresses that acquired ETH in the past 30 days, indicates that the short-term ETH holders are, on average, currently up +8% on their initial investment.At present, Ethereum’s 30-day MVRV ratio is still some ways away from what has historically been considered a ‘danger zone’, marking the levels at which short-term holders have looked to offload their bags in the past.Read the full newsletter edition here to get the entire scoop, complete with detailed charts and images.Cointelegraph’s Market Insights Newsletter shares our knowledge on the fundamentals that move the digital asset market.

145,"In recent months, there has been a considerable spike in institutional demand for Bitcoin (BTC) following several high profile investments. Over time, asset manager and 10T Holdings co-founder Dan Tapiero believes this could lead to a problematic shortage in BTC.Alongside investments from Square, MicroStrategy and Stone Ridge, Bitcoin inflows to Grayscale Bitcoin Trust have surged.Based on the rapid growth of institutional investments, Tapiero warns that short-sellers could see trouble in the future.In the third quarter of 2020, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust recorded an inflow of $1.05 billion. This marked the firm’s first billion-dollar quarter and also highlights record-high institutional demand. The firm’s quarterly report reads:“Grayscale recorded its largest ever quarterly inflows, over $1 billion in 3Q20, making it the third consecutive record-breaking quarter. Year-to-date investment into the Grayscale family of products has surpassed $2.4 billion, more than double the $1.2 billion cumulative inflow into the products from 2013-2019.”The timing of Grayscale’s record-breaking quarter is noteworthy because it comes several months after BTC price dropped below $3,600.Cumulative quarterly inflows into Grayscale trusts, including Bitcoin. Source: GrayscaleOn March 13, Bitcoin fell $3,600 after a $1 billion worth of futures contracts were liquidated. BTC has steadily recovered ever since, eventually rising above $12,500 in early September.Institutional demand for Bitcoin surged rapidly after what is now referred to as one of Bitcoin’s steepest falls in recent history and this indicates institutions see staying power. Considering the continuous increase in Grayscale inflow from institutional investors, Tapiero said:“SHORTAGES of Bitcoin possible. Barry's Grayscale Trust is eating up BTC like there is no tomorrow. If 77% of all newly mined turns into 110%, it's lights out. Non-miner supply will get held off market in squeeze. Shorts will be dead. Price can go to any number.”The speculation about a potential supply-side crisis around Bitcoin also coincides with the post-halving cycle. Bitcoin went through its third halving on May 11 and historically, halvings lead to extended bull runs in the next two years.The halvings are proven to have a direct impact on BTC price, especially over the long term as the rate at which the remaining BTC supply is introduced to the market slows down.Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million and as with each halving the amount of BTC miners can produce decreases. Hence, fewer BTC are available in the market to purchase every four years.In 2016, it took Bitcoin around 15 months to reach a peak after the second halving. If a similar pattern follows, a year from the most recent halving would be around the third quarter of 2021.Coincidentally, the current post-halving cycle is being met with unprecedented institutional demand."
146,"Using the analogy of a Hi/Lo poker game — a variety of poker which crowns the highest and lowest hands as victors — broadcaster Max Keiser explained citizens will ultimately lose when it comes to holding government-issued currencies. ""Unless you're a country, that can make money by debasing your currency, by getting kickbacks from Wall Street who packages all those currencies in the form of negative rate interest-rate bonds, then you only have one choice,"" Keiser said during an Oct. 15 episode of his show, the Keiser Report, adding:At the tail end of a wild year, which included the U.S. printing significant amounts of money, economic difficulties, and global pandemic concerns, a number of commentators continue to push a narrative that prioritizes alternative financial assets over cash.""The forex market, the paper-money pushers, the sovereign currencies — they're all trying to, quote 'stoke inflation,' but we know that's false,"" Keiser explained. ""They're trying to debase their currency to boost exports at the expense of everybody else at the poker table, the geopolitical game. [...] The question is — who will have the worst currency going forward?""Only governments and banks can win the low hand option, according to Keiser. Small players have another route, however — winning the high hand by owning gold, silver and Bitcoin (BTC). People often look to this trio of assets for inflation protection, and as hedges against other economic conditions. "
147,"Bitcoin (BTC) price broke upward in the first half of October, resulting in a rally from $10,500 to $11,700. However, the momentum may be shifting once more as strength diminishes across the cryptocurrency market. A similar setup also happened prior to Bitcoin’s latest upward break with sideways consolidation in BTC causing altcoins to drop south heavily, especially the Defi sector.But significant support at $11,000 is now a must-hold level to resume the bullish momentum, which may find difficulty clearing current levels as renewed coronavirus lockdowns are spooking investors.Traders still remember the previous pandemic fear in March that caused prices of many assets across markets, including BTC, to drop severely.BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewBitcoin’s daily chart shows a strict breakout above $11,000, which was critical for any bullish momentum.However, sustaining support at $11,000 is a must for the bullish case to hold weight, making a test of the upper range at $12,000 increasingly likely. Many investors tend to factor in a potential sell-off of the 150,000 BTC involved in the Mt. Gox fiasco each time a new deadline nears. However, the deadline for the release of these Bitcoins was extended once again today diminishing these fears, or at least until Dec. 15, 2020 BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewMeanwhile, the smaller timeframe shows a similar picture with the $11,000-11,150 area being a critical zone to hold as support. If that area is lost, a sharp dive is likely toward the $10,600 region. Even that CME gap below $10K may return as a topic of discussion. However, as the $11,000-11,200 level is such an important support zone to hold, holding here would warrant a test of the range’s upper region, lined out in the upper chart, namely $11,800-11,900 and potentially even $12,100. The real question is then whether Bitcoin has enough strength to break through that resistance level. Breaking $12K may see a massive bullish move that is likely to push up values across the entire crypto market. Total market capitalization cryptocurrency 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewThe total market capitalization is still stuck inside a range. The upper part of the range is defined by the resistance zone between $380-405 billion. The lower part is found at $265-285 billion and is still untested. At the start of a new bull cycle, previous resistance levels get tested for support before further continuation occurs. A test of the $265-285 billion areas seems likely in that sense, as that would sustain a further continuation of the range-bound structure. Those range-bound constructions are also signs of the accumulation part of a new cycle. Next to that, if the total market capitalization starts to move sideways, the 100-week and 200-week moving averages (MAs) will come in to play as potential support. Those indicators are significant signs of support and further continuation upward as they define bull/bear markets.BTC/USDT 6-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe most likely scenario would be more upside and a possible test of the $12,000 area after successfully holding the $11,000-11,200 region as support.However, an immediate breakout above $12,000 is not likely unless the U.S. Dollar Currency Index (DXY) starts to really tumble. Such a case would suit a very bullish breakout for the price of Bitcoin, opening up the possibility of new multi-year highs.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

148,"Bitcoin (BTC) has support to climb all the way to $15,000 if historic trends repeat themselves this year, a new report says.Compiled by crypto index fund provider Stack Funds on Oct. 15, the report highlights Bitcoin’s market cap vs. realized cap ratio (MVRV) fuelling gains, which could smash $12,000 resistance.Bitcoin has yet to attempt a breakout of $12,000, seeing rejection at $11,700 this week. This has failed to dent optimism among analysts, who believe that $11,000 will provide solid support.Going forward, however, the period following the United States elections in early November may result in more upside.For Stack Funds, this hinges on the MVRV ratio. This is currently at 1.8, with signs that a retest of 2.5 from 2019, when BTC/USD hit $13,800, is in play.“The current MVRV ratio is at 1.8, and is purportedly well supported by the trendline where bitcoin bottomed back in late 2018. The trend is also painting a similar trajectory as it did back in the 2017 bull run, with a steady growth inclination that tested an identical support trendline multiple times,” the report states. “Given the strength in support, we are expecting a significant break of 2.0 in the near term as it looks to retest the 2019 peak at 2.5, which will put Bitcoin price above the $15,000 level.”MVRV is a metric devised by analysts Murad Mahmudov and David Puell, also the creator of Bitcoin’s Puell Multiple. It uses market cap versus realized cap, the latter created by CoinMetrics, and designed to provide a more accurate valuation of Bitcoin than traditional market cap.Since late 2018, MVRV has been in a broad uptrend, broken only by the coronavirus cross-asset price crash in March 2020.Bitcoin MVRV ratio highlighting uptrend. Source: Stack Funds/ CoinMetricsStack also noted increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin as cementing the idea that the future is firmly bullish for price action.Stone Ridge investing $115 million followed Square’s $50 million purchase, both gaining publicity on the back of MicroStrategy’s larger $425 million treasury investment.As Cointelegraph noted, Bitcoin futures open interest is also climbing this month, signaling that institutional activity is picking up once more.“We further view that a re-positioning is occurring in the market with a possible shift in the economic climate, as futures volumes and open interest are starting to recover,” Stack’s report explains. “Our eyes are peeled on the $12,000 key resistance level, as we expect further consolidation around current levels going into the elections before breaking into the upside going forward.”"
149,"A bankless world is inevitable due to the “natural evolution of technology,” according to a top executive at multi-billion dollar investment manager, Morgan Creek Capital.The firm’s CEO Mark Yusko believes that a “silent revolution” powered by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) will eventually lead the world to a bankless society.In an Oct. 13 interview with Brazilian Dash-focused YouTube channel Dash Dinheiro Digital, Yusko said that people around the world will, in time, be able to “bank themselves through crypto.”Despite his claims regarding a bankless society, the CEO noted that he does not mean banks will disappear entirely, stating:“We will still need banks to do lending, digital currencies, or digital fiat to go along with crypto at the core. But the idea that we’re moving to a global borderless world, and nation-states will become less important, global systems will become more important, and you can be a citizen of the world as opposed to a citizen of a single nation-state.”Yusko is the founder, CEO and chief investment officer of Morgan Creek Capital Management. The company was founded in 2004 to provide investment management services to institutions and wealthy families as well as discretionary strategies to assist clients in building investment programs.Morgan Creek Capital is known for running a dedicated digital asset investment business known as Morgan Creek Digital. The subsidiary is co-founded by Yusko and Anthony Pompliano. In August 2020, Pompliano predicted that Bitcoin will eventually capture more of the market than gold, breaking the $400,000 threshold."

151,"Bitcoin (BTC) is bullish in three key areas and a “perfect” buy-in is now no lower than $11,000, popular trader Tone Vays says.In the latest edition of his Trading Bitcoin YouTube series on Oct. 14, Vays presented an optimistic take on the Bitcoin price, which he argues has barely any bearish characteristics.Examining the weekly and daily charts, Vays noted that there was little reason to expect a significant pullback beyond a “one to four-candle correction.”This is ongoing, with BTC/USD consolidating its gains from earlier in the week. Should this period last no longer than four days as Vays predicts, he said that he would look to “buy the dip” at $11,000.“I would be looking to buy the dip or buy the breakout, but I don’t know which one it’s going to be,” he summarized.“So if I am to buy the dip, where would the perfect dip be? Well, the perfect dip would be... around $11,000.”The advice came immediately after a warning not to short the current correction — a further indication that expectations remain skewed to the upside.The trend towards $11,000 may also break down early, in which case a buy area of between $11,537 and $11,570 would be suitable, says Vays, pointing to two technical highs from previous daily candles.BTC/USD 1-week daily price chart. Source: Coin360Along with Bitcoin’s weekly and daily charts, new corporate buys are buoying Vays’ bullish view, but he is not alone.As Cointelegraph reported, a number of analysts and traders, along with existing Bitcoin business executives, are becoming increasingly convinced that a watershed price moment is incoming.Corporate interest, in particular, was highlighted by Grayscale CEO Barry Silbert this week, being followed by fund manager Dan Tapeiro.A spike in Bitcoin futures interest further cements a return of institutional interest.Long-term indicators complement the picture, with stock-to-flow performance on schedule and fundamentals such as hash rate lingering near all-time highs.

152,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) rapidly fell after surpassing $11,500 on Binance between Oct. 14 and Oct. 15. Within two hours, it fell to $11,280, recording a 2.3% drop. After the fall, analysts are expecting another minor pullback in the near term.Three factors likely caused the rejection to occur include a sell-off on BitMEX, a major resistance level and the stock market pullback.On Oct. 14, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 0.58%, after initially seeing a minor upsurge.As the trend of the U.S. stock market trend started to shift, Bitcoin recorded a sharp decline. Within 15 minutes, BTC saw a 1.15% drop from $11,518 to $11,370.According to the data from Skew, the correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 has increased in recent weeks. In contrast, the realized correlation between BTC and gold has declined considerably in the last three weeks.Bitcoin correlation vs. S&P 500, gold, VIX, USD. Source: Digital Assets Data, Cointelegraph MarketsThe data suggests that Bitcoin is currently perceived more as a risk-on asset over a safe-haven asset. Whether that leaves BTC vulnerable for a pullback amidst a stock market downturn in the fourth quarter remains to be seen after a strong Q3.Some on-chain analysts spotted a spike in selling pressure coming from BitMEX, with major market shorts coming through. Before the initial drop from $11,540 to $11,280 occurred, many multi-million dollar short contracts appeared on BitMEX.Consequently, the open interest of BitMEX rose from around $397 million to $414 million, when the price drop happened.The repeated rejection from the $11,500 area has turned it into a technical resistance level in the short term.Following the struggle of BTC to break above $11,500, traders have started to ponder the possibility of a drop below $10,900. The 3-hour chart of Bitcoin with key support levels. Source: Michael van de PoppeMichael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said the $11,300 support zone remains the most critical level. A drop below it could send BTC to $10,600, Poppe said, explaining:“The view remains the same. Holding here and the market might continue moving upwards. Losing this area and I'll target $10,900 and $10,600 next.”Still, the medium-term prospect of Bitcoin remains positive, buoyed by optimistic on-chain indicators. Researchers at Glassnode found that 14% of the BTC supply is held in accumulation addresses.The rising number of investors holding onto Bitcoin, likely for a longer-term investment strategy, is a significant catalyst for BTC heading into 2021. The researchers said:“Bitcoin accumulation has been on a constant upwards trend for months. 2.6M $BTC (14% of supply) are currently held in accumulation addresses. Accumulation addresses are defined as addresses that have at least 2 incoming txs and have never spent BTC.”The confluence of repeated rejections from the same resistance level depicts a weakening short-term trend. But in the upcoming months, various on-chain data points suggest the likelihood of a strong market recovery."

157,"The first hint that Blockland - 21 Stories of Bitcoin, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency is perhaps not quite the same as the average book on the subject of crypto is splashed bold, right across its cover.Eschewing the usual staid design cues, it instead features Trevor Jones' artwork, “The Ecstasy (Bitcoin Angel).” The religious iconography of the image is striking, to say the least.And it is carried through to the language of several of the chapters (or stories), conveying both the almost mythical nature of Bitcoin’s origin story and the devout faith of the many different flavours of crypto-believer.So could Blockland be Bitcoin's first sacred text?Before we get to that, I must confess that I could have easily taken an instant dislike to this book.In the foreword, the author, Elias Ahonen, describes a whistle-stop crypto-fuelled globe-spanning trip of almost biblical excess, which brought back to mind the truly abominable The Little Book of Crypto by Cal Evans.But while Evans' similarly incredible travel anecdotes seemed designed purely to express how much cooler than the reader he considers himself, Ahonen has us feel like we’re drinking shots onstage at a huge Shanghai rap concert right alongside him.It captures the intensity and the insanity that can manifest itself in what is essentially still a prepubescent industry being showered with more money than it knows what to do with.So perhaps Blockland is actually cryptocurrency’s first rock’n’roll biography?The book tells 21 (often dramatized) stories of “Blockland” -- the cryptocurrency space to you and me — starting with the creation of the first “Golden City of Bit” and the settlers who initially chose to inhabit it.It tells of the pioneers who then decided to strike out and establish new communities, and the many ordinary folk who were drawn to the Blockland’s expanding world.The chapter themes range from the quasi-spiritual (Satoshi’s Testament, The Sects of Satoshism), to the pioneer spirit (The Prospectors, Computing Frontiers), and even the spirit of excess (Mining Madness, Tulip Hangover)While all of the underlying stories are true, the use of metaphor and allegory really does bring home what a magical and unlikely path cryptocurrency has taken to get here.The fact that these seemingly disparate chapters pull together to tell a coherent (and pretty much complete) story of cryptocurrency’s journey to date is very much to Ahonen’s credit.The author gives an even and unbiased view of the space in a manner that is both easily accessible and utterly charming. There is no papering-over of the darker elements of cryptocurrency, but the benevolent nature of the community also receives substantial page-time.Ahonen's previous book was the infinitely more straight-laced Encyclopedia of Physical Bitcoins and Crypto-Currencies, published in 2016, which led to him being described as “one of the first Bitcoin historians.”While both books are technically reference works, Blockland feels more like a fictional thriller in its pace and style.So… part holy scripture, part gonzo journalism, and 100% roller-coaster ride, Blockland succeeds amazingly in both mythologizing and explaining the current state of the cryptocurrency industry.This is the cryptocurrency book for people who are too cool to read cryptocurrency books. Buy it for yourself, then lend it to that friend you just know is a potential crypto-evangelist, if only they would take the time to learn about the subject.Just make sure he or she returns it. It belongs on your bookshelf, after all.The hardcover edition of Blockland: 21 Stories of Bitcoin, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency is available for pre-order from cryptonumist.com.The link provided is for a hardcover limited edition of the book at $59. At that price, you may want to be the friend who borrows it rather than the one who lends it… at least until a slightly less expensive version becomes available.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

The term open interest refers to the total amount of long and short contracts open at a given time and it is typically used to gauge trading activity in the futures market.CME Bitcoin futures volume. Source: SkewThe daily volume across other institution-focused platforms, including LMAX Digital and Bakkt, also remains high. This suggests that institutional volume is growing in general after BTC’s strong rally.In the past two months, three multi-billion dollar conglomerates publicly announced significantly sized investments in Bitcoin.First, MicroStrategy, a publicly-listed U.S. company on the Nasdaq, said it invested $425 million in Bitcoin. The company said it would treat BTC as its primary treasury asset, essentially as a hedge against inflation.Then, the $81 billion payments conglomerate Square followed with a $50 million investment. Square reportedly invested 1% of its portfolio into BTC, demonstrating strength in its long-term growth.On Oct. 13, as Cointelegraph reported, Stone Ridge, a $10 billion asset manager, purchased 10,000 BTC. The company is now the third major corporation in the U.S. to make a major Bitcoin investment in the past two months.Following the high profile investments into Bitcoin from MicroStrategy, Square, and Stone Ridge, institutional demand for Bitcoin might be growing naturally. Researchers at Skew said:“CME #bitcoin futures open interest is rebounding as the carry trade reopens. Watch the COT report this weekend for potentially more leveraged funds shorts.”Bitcoin futures data from Digital Assets Data also show a noticeable uptick in volume over the past 2 weeks. BTC futures volume by exchange. Source: Digital Assets DataIt is possible that CME Bitcoin futures open interest has been recovering after the September monthly expiration. Every monthly CME futures contract expires on the last friday of every month. Since the futures market resets after every expiration, open interest drops with it in tandem.But the overall increase in volume across various institutional platforms indicates that institutional demand is likely rising.Since early October, researchers at Whalemap have said OTC deals among whales have been increasing. Whalemap, a platform that tracks whale activity and the trades of high-net-worth investors, found that in-person deals have noticeably spiked especially before and after major announcements. They said:“I was looking forward to seeing if more OTC deals will come through, and they did. I am leaning more and more towards the idea that you can see these OTC deals happening on-chain before the news are released.”Atop the high institutional and whale activity, overall spot market volume has been increasing simultaneously.Aggregated daily BTC spot volumes.

160,"A new report from investment firm Wilshire Phoenix claims that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s, or CME’s, cash-settled Bitcoin futures trading products affect Bitcoin’s price even though they do not directly involve actual real Bitcoin (BTC).“The findings of Wilshire Phoenix indicate that CME Bitcoin Futures contribute more to price discovery than its related spot markets,” said an Oct. 14 report from Wilshire Phoenix, adding:“A leading futures market suggests the existence of a robust base of traders who may trade on such markets for many reasons such as trust in the exchange venue and lower latency.”Price discovery essentially refers to how each actual Bitcoin is valued on the market — its going market rate, or spot price. Wilshire’s report essentially found that these CME products affect the price of BTC more than the actual BTC itself, which trades on crypto-native exchanges. Launched in December 2017, CME’s Bitcoin futures do not handle spot Bitcoin. Participants trade contracts tracking the price of Bitcoin on the crypto markets, paying out those contracts into U.S. dollars at expiration. These contracts pay out based on a price index called the CME CF BRR, which comprises a price for BTC based on values seen across a number of spot crypto exchanges, called constituent exchanges. The CME’s futures products have yielded notable interest in the years since their launch. Even though the CME’s Bitcoin futures deal only in cash, crypto traders and participants pay attention to their price action — particularly chart gaps frequently referred to as “CME gaps”. These gaps are made when spot BTC opens the next trading day above or below the close of the previous day, based on spot BTC’s 24-hour trading schedule, as compared with the CME’s set hours of operation for the products. Bitcoin’s spot price has been known to travel back to any gaps left on the price chart. One aspect highlighted in the report is that the CME trades more total volume than any single spot exchange included in its CF BRR, the report detailed, adding: “which also facilitates price discovery within the futures market.” Additionally, CME Bitcoin futures participants trade notably bigger positions on average:“A relative number of small trades in a given market is typically statistically insignificant for price discovery purposes. The average trade size on the CME futures market facilitates its lead in price discovery versus the Constituent Exchanges.”The report also noted the presence of other mainstream futures markets affecting spot prices across other asset classes, so the findings are not out of the ordinary. “There are 85 institutions holding open positions in Bitcoin futures, this represents a similar number versus other CME futures in major currency markets such as the Swiss Franc, US Dollar Index, and Fed Funds,” Wilshire Phoenix partner and report co-author Alexander Chang told Cointelegraph."
161,"BitMEX recently faced major U.S. legal action, and KuCoin suffered a significant hack, all inside a several-day span — but why did these events not affect Bitcoin’s price in a more negative way? Aleks Svetski, CEO of Bitcoin investment app Amber, said it has to do with a number of factors, including big players buying Bitcoin (BTC).""Bitcoin’s price is a function of global demand vs a strict, immutable supply and diminishing schedule,” he told Cointelegraph, referring to the asset’s coin supply and mining payout halvings.“As more people, especially large scale organisations look to acquire some, it creates not only a price floor, but continues to increase upward price pressure,” he explained adding, “and finally, these new players are all holding their Bitcoin OFF exchanges, and thus it’s not available for sale on the market.”Over the course of 2020, a number of big players have publicized hefty Bitcoin purchases, including MicroStrategy, Paul Tudor Jones, and Square.In contrast to the bullish action, crypto exchange KuCoin suffered a hack totaling more than $100 million in theft. Several days later, U.S. government authorities hit major crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX with legal action, arresting one of its leaders.Neither of these events caused Bitcoin to fall into a downtrend, however. Bitcoin did not fall significantly on the KuCoin news, and only fell several hundred dollars on the BitMEX news — a relatively small reaction to a significant news event. In contrast, after sideways price action for a number of days, the asset began its journey upward out of levels of consolidation. Svetski added:"

Although the total amount invested by the companies is only about 3.2% of the current market capitalization of Bitcoin, the encouraging sign is that the investments have been rising consistently.If this trend continues and more institutional-sized investors enter the crypto space, Bitcoin price could rise quickly. Let’s analyze the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out what the dominant trend is in the markets.Bitcoin (BTC) broke above the $11,500 resistance and rallied to $11,719 on Oct. 12 but the bulls could not sustain the breakout. This shows that the higher levels are attracting selling by the short-term traders.BTC/USD daily chart.

If buyers can push and sustain the price above 11,560, the pair could pick up momentum and resume its uptrend. The first target on the upside is $12,048 and if this level is scaled, the up-move may reach $12,460.

Binance Coin (BNB) soared above the overhead resistance on Oct. 12 but the bulls could not build upon the momentum and that resulted in the formation of a doji candlestick pattern on Oct. 13.

163,"Multiple JPMorgan Chase experts analyzed Bitcoin’s current price when compared to other commodities, and noted that the asset could see selling pressure ahead. “The JPMorgan strategists said they calculated an intrinsic value by effectively treating Bitcoin as a commodity and looking at the marginal cost of production,” according to an Oct. 14 article from India’s BloombergQuint media outlet — a partnered entity involving Bloomberg and Quintillion Media. The article added:Bitcoin futures prices often trade slightly above or below the going market rate for the asset, also known as its spot price. Futures prices tend to get closer to spot prices as contracts near their expiration dates. Futures prices above spot can indicate bullishness, while prices below spot can indicate bearish expectations.JPMorgan’s specialists reported that Bitcoin's bullish positions outnumber its bearish positions, according to a futures-based indicator. The strategists also mentioned an increase in buying pressure resulting from the recent trend of mainstream financial giants entering Bitcoin; Paul Tudor Jones, MicroStrategy, and Square have all purchased heavy Bitcoin bags in 2020.Bitcoin has gained mainstream notoriety as a commodity in recent years, with participants commonly comparing to the asset as digital gold. The fact that traditional analysts have begun to view Bitcoin as a commodity could indicate a continuation of the asset's mainstream trajectory."
164,"Last week, Bitcoin (BTC) saw its price rise 6.95%, rising from $10,804 on October 5 to $11,555 by October 12. The surge marked the best performing week for the price of Bitcoin since July and data show a noticeable shift in market sentiment around the digital asset.According to data from TheTie, an alternative data provider for digital assets, the daily sentiment score for Bitcoin has reached 62.4. The metric measures the tone of conversations in Twitter to derive positive or negative sentiment in the market, and any score above 50 implies that market sentiment is positive.Bitcoin Price vs. Sentiment. Source: TheTieBitcoin and the rest of the crypto industry endured a fair share of negative press at the start of October. The CFTC and DOJ cracked down on BitMEX exchange, charging the company with illegally operating a derivatives exchange on Oct. 1 and the UK’s FCA banned retail cryptocurrency derivatives on Oct. 6. However, neither of these events produced the negative outcomes many investors expected. Moreover, the negative news was followed by bullish stories like Square allocating 1% of its assets to Bitcoin.Generally, bullish signs continue to pile up for Bitcoin and as the digital asset rallied to $11,500, the total market capitalization of the entire sector increased by 6% from $339 billion to $359. Furthermore, a recent report surveying over 30 panelists, including eToro’s cryptocurrency commentator David Derhy, Alpha5 CEO, Vishal Shah, and LMAX Group currency strategist, Joel Kruger, found that Bitcoin is set to hit $14,283 by the end of 2020, according to the panelist average.Numerous on-chain metrics also match the positive sentiment around Bitcoin. While investor activity has been picking up, the price has yet to follow. According to cryptocurrency analyst, Willy Woo, this signals an increase in “investor activity”, one that has yet to be accounted for in the price of Bitcoin. Woo said:“Investor activity” is predicated on on-chain volume. This is because when BTC moves between wallets between two different participants, we assume there was a payment for it off-chain (fiat or alt-coin). It’s an imperfect measure but approximates what’s going on.”Bitcoin NVT (Transaction volume vs price). Source: Woodbull.comNot only has activity increased but the number of coins held on exchanges has been on a steady decline, with the changing trend resembling the accumulation period that occurred before the 2017 bull market. As both fundamental and technical analysis paint a bullish picture amidst the current political and financial turmoil, a perfect storm seems to be brewing for Bitcoin.In 2020 DeFi played a key role in revitalizing the excitement surrounding cryptocurrencies and Ether (ETH) price but in the last two months the majority of DeFi tokens lost value. Data from DeFi Pulse shows that the total value locked in DeFi is at $10.89 billion. Meanwhile, Uniswap has $2.6 billion in total value locked and the decentralized exchange has continued to see a steady increase in trading volume.Total Value Locked in DeFi. Source: Digital Assets DataAccording to data from Flipside Crypto, around $300 million worth of tokens are being sent to DeFi dapps every day. This is outpacing centralized exchanges which currently see a daily inflow of around $156 million. Uniswap alone is currently responsible for 70% of the DeFi inflow, with $211 million going to their liquidity pools every day.All Ethereum network activity. Source: Flipside CryptoThe growth of DeFi protocols has brought renewed attention to Bitcoin and to date more than $1.1 billion worth of BTC has been tokenized on the Ethereum blockchain through Wrapped BTC alone. Flipside Crypto noted that roughly $385 million worth of wBTC and renBTC changed hands in September. While many factors point towards an eventful end of the year for Bitcoin, it’s worth noting that significant hurdles are ahead. Historical data shows Bitcoin has sold off at the $12,000 level at least three times this year as miners and whales take profit. With the price again approaching the $12K level, there’s the risk of this happening a fourth time.There is also the looming specter of regulatory crackdowns on the decentralized finance sector. While a blanket ban on DeFi will be difficult to enforce, centralized domains can be seized and project workers can be arrested. Such a scenario could have a devastating impact on Bitcoin’s current bullish sentiment, but for now, traders are expecting a rebound in DeFi. Such an event is likely to provide the fuel Bitcoin needs to push through the $12K level and achieve a new 2020 high."
165,"After the price of Bitcoin (BTC) achieved $11,720 on Binance, traders began to turn slightly skeptical on the dominant cryptocurrency. Despite the initial breakout above two key resistance levels at $11,300 and $11,500, BTC recorded several rejections. While it might be premature to predict a marketwide correction, the level of uncertainty in the market seems to be rising.In the short term, traders pinpoint the $11,200 to $11,325 range as a critical support area. If that region holds, technical analysts believe a significant price drop is unlikely. But if Bitcoin demonstrates weakening momentum below $11,300, the market would likely become vulnerable. Although the technical momentum of BTC has been declining, traders generally see a bigger support range from $10,600 to $10,900.Considering the array of positive events that buoyed the price of Bitcoin in recent weeks, a near-term pullback could be healthy. On Oct. 8, Square announced that it purchased $50 million worth of BTC, reportedly 1% of its assets. Then, on Oct. 13, it was reported that Stone Ridge, the $10 billion asset manager, invested $115 million in Bitcoin. The market sentiment is highly optimistic as a result, and a sell-off to neutralize market sentiment could be positive.Cryptocurrency traders and technical analysts are cautious in the short term, but not bearish enough to predict a clear top. Bitcoin has been ranging below $11,500, but it has also risen 5% month-to-date from $10,800. At the monthly peak, BTC recorded an 8% gain, which is relatively high considering the short period. As such, while the momentum of Bitcoin has dropped off in the past 36 hours, it is difficult to forecast a major pullback.Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, sees a healthy ongoing trend in the broader cryptocurrency market. The trader pinpointed that BTC could see a drop to the $10,600 to $10,900 support range, but the combined market cap of cryptocurrencies is clearly on track for an extended upwards rally, he said, adding: “Very healthy construction going on here. A higher-high made after a higher low was created. Just another range-bound period before breakout above $400 billion. The next target zones are $500 and $600 after that. But very healthy upwards trend.”Edward Morra, a Bitcoin technical analyst, cited three reasons for a pullback to the $11,100 level, noting that BTC hit an important “daily supply” level when it rallied to $11,700. This means there was significant liquidity, which was also a heavy resistance level. Morra also said the 0.705 Fibonacci resistance and the “R1 weekly pivot” make a drop to $11,100 more likely in the near term.A pseudonymous trader known as “Bitcoin Jack,” who accurately predicted the $3,600 bottom in March 2020, believes that while the current trend is not bearish, it’s not primed for a continuation either. BTC rejected the $11,500 to $11,700 range and has been trading under $11,400. He said that he would likely add to his positions once an upward price movement becomes more probable. The trader added: “Been reducing some on bounces — not too convinced after the two rejections on the two lines above price. Will add again as continuation becomes more likely.”Although traders seemingly foresee a minor price drop in the short term, many analysts are refraining from anticipating a full-blown bearish rejection. The cautious stance of most traders is likely the result of two factors that have been consistently emphasized by analysts since September: BTC’s strong 15.5% recovery within merely 19 days and little resistance above $13,000.Technically, there is no strong resistance between $13,000 and $16,500. Because Bitcoin’s upswing in December 2017 was so quick and strong, it did not leave many levels that could act as resistance. Hence, if BTC surpasses $13,000 and consolidates above, it would raise the probability of a retest of $16,500, and possibly the record high at $20,000. Whether that would happen in the medium term by the end of 2021 remains unclear.“Byzantine General,” a pseudonymous trader, said $12,000 is a critical level. A rapid upsurge above the $12,000 to $13,000 range could leave BTC en route to $16,500 and ultimately to its all-time high. The analyst said: “Volume profile based on on-chain analysis. 12K is such an important level. It’s pretty much the only resistance left. After that it’s clear skies with only a minor speed bump at 16.5K.”Cathie Wood, the CEO of Ark Invest — which manages over $11 billion in assets under management — also pinpointed the $13,000 level as the most important technical level for Bitcoin. As previously reported, Wood said that “in technical terms,” there is little resistance between $13,000 and $20,000. It remains unclear whether BTC can regain the momentum for a rally above $13,000 in the short term, leaving traders cautious in the near term but not strongly bearish.Various on-chain indicators and fundamental factors, such as HODLer growth, hash rate and Bitcoin exchange reserves indicate a strong uptrend. On top of that, according to data from Santiment, developer activity of the Bitcoin blockchain protocol has continuously increased: “BTC Github submission rate by its team of developers has been spiking to all-time high levels in October. This is a great sign that Bitcoin’s team continues to strive toward higher efficiency and performance going forward.”There is a possibility that the optimistic fundamental and favorable macro factors could offset any technical weakness in the short term. For alternative assets and stores of value, like Bitcoin and gold, inflation and negative interest rates are considered persistent catalysts. The United States Federal Reserve has emphasized its stance on retaining low interest rates for years to come to offset the pandemic’s effect on the economy. Recent reports indicate that other central banks might follow suit, including the Bank of England as it’s deputy governor Sam Woods issued a letter, requesting a public consultation, that reads:In the medium term, the combination of positive on-chain data points and the uncertainty surrounding interest rates could continue to fuel Bitcoin, gold, and other safe-haven assets. That could coincide with the post-halving cycle of Bitcoin as it enters 2021, which historically caused BTC to rally to new record highs. This time, the market is buoyed by the entrance of institutional investors as evidenced by the high volume of institution-tailored platforms."
166,"The latest research by Cointelegraph Consulting suggests that financial stimulus packages bolster the stock market and cryptocurrencies. The first round of checks worth $1,200 were deposited directly into bank accounts on April 11. A week later, the CEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, pointed out that the deposits in the amount of $1,200 on Coinbase were surging. Now, Washington is debating whether to issue a second round of checks. If they do, this could be good for the prices of all assets, including stocks and digital assets, in the short to medium term. If the House of Representatives passes the bill before the presidential election, the checks are estimated to be sent out by December.By the end of the summer, the S&P 500 recovered and even reached a new all-time-high. Bitcoin has also climbed from $6.5K in March to above $10.5K by October. The growth in the prices of these assets may be explained by the huge financial stimulus packages provided by governments around the world. The U.S. dollar money supply (M1 aggregate) rocketed from $4 trillion in the beginning of 2020 to $5.5 trillion as of the middle of the year.Expected inflation has also grown from 2.5% in January to 2.9% in June. In fear of an inflation outburst, the demand for the store of value assets increases. This is one reason for the rally in gold. Bitcoin is also often seen as an alternative to traditional safe havens. However, Cointelegraph Consulting’s research report shows that the volume of stimulus itself is not the only factor impacting capital market growth. The other crucial considerations are discussed in the report.By September, the total amount of fiscal packages in the major countries amounted to $10 trillion, or 7% of the global GDP. Due to the state-sponsored fiscal support, U.S. households have accumulated an extra $2 trillion in their bank accounts. Not all of these funds have been used for immediate consumption. Instead, the financial behavior of U.S. citizens has become much more conservative, and the household saving rate has doubled during the crisis from 7% to 15%.Although some citizens used state support checks to pay down debt, the indebtedness of U.S. households is still very high, which could make long-term price appreciation of traditional and alternative assets difficult to sustain.Read the full mini-report here to get the entire analysis, complete with charts.Cointelegraph Consulting reviews the industry’s most important news, including mergers and acquisitions, changes in the regulatory landscape, and enterprise blockchain integrations.

167,"EToro, the major multi-asset brokerage, released a crypto market quarterly report for Q3 2020. The report, titled “What Moves the Prices of Cryptoassets,” delves into the main factors that cause cryptocurrencies to rise in value.The 15 “significant developments” that directly affect the value of a crypto asset include mergers, funding, halving, partnerships, staking and announcements. The researchers analyzed how crypto assets perform after one hour, one day, and one week after the developments occur.According to data from eToro and The Tie, crypto assets typically rise the most over a period of a week after any type of announcement is made.During the first hour after an announcement, cryptoassets tend to increase by around 0.5%. A lackluster market reaction is expected given that it takes time for the information to circulate.On the first day of an announcement, crypto assets are likely to rise by 0.8% to 1.3%. It is understandable that cryptocurrencies increase more throughout the day than the first hour as news spreads.Throughout the first week of an announcement, crypto assets often rise by 2% to 8.2%, the most out of all timeframes.At least in the short-term, out of all significant developments, mergers and acquisitions trigger the largest rallies; halving, funding, partnerships, and staking lag behind acquisitions in daily, hourly and weekly performance.The average price change of crypto assets after a significant development. Source: eToroThe researchers at eToro also found that mergers and acquisitions also lead to a 90% chance of a positive return throughout the week. Notably:“Mergers and Acquisitions are remarkable, showing a 90% chance of a positive return after a week, averaging 8.23% in returns. This outsized return is likely due to the fact that most token-related M&A news are tightly held secrets. Further, M&A news in the context of tokens are typically done to add further value to an ecosystem.”The probability of a crypto asset’s price surge after a significant development.

It also shows that exchanges, projects and other related businesses have to be more cautious in handling potentially sensitive announcements and significant developments.The report shows that project-related announcements usually have a strong impact on the price of the pertaining crypto assets. As such, it is critical that the related parties or companies ensure that any relevant data does not leak to prevent market manipulation."

169,"Tether’s (USDT) stablecoin has been the leading base pair for cryptocurrencies for over eighteen months. This is a rather impressive feat given the ongoing court case with the New York Attorney General and the other frequent rumors that USDT is not sufficiently backed or subject to regulators' reach. USDT has also been the dominant stablecoin in China even though the country banned cryptocurrency exchanges in 2017. This is because large exchanges like Binance, Huobi and OKEx turned to the stablecoin as their leading base pair. It’s also worth noting that competitors like USD Coin (USDC), TrueUSD (TUSD), and Paxos Standard (PAX) had a combined capitalization of $520 million in June 2019. During the same period, USDT had already amassed a market cap larger than $3.1 billion.Over the past 15 months, Tether’s market cap grew to $15.7 billion, while its four largest competitors reached $4.1 billion. Regardless of all the USD backing controversies, USDT has held a nearly 80% market share of all fiat-backed stablecoins.A nearly identical story is noted in trading volumes, where Tether dominates with a 75% lead. Consolidated crypto volume by base pair. Source: CryptoCompareData from CryptoCompare shows USDT holding a nearly 73% volume market share over the past three months. Before investigating further, it should be mentioned that numbers will vary according to each data provider, as some exchanges are often excluded due to a lack of transparency.Despite these indiscrepancies, CryptoCompare Head of Research, Constantine Tsavliris, explained that:  ""In terms of Bitcoin trading into USDT or other equivalent stablecoins such as USDC or PAX, we haven't seen a significant shift in terms of volume.""Most traders have grown accustomed to using Bitcoin (BTC) as the primary gateway to cryptocurrencies. This solution might have been the only, or at least, the most liquid for most traders in 2017 or 2018, but as the stablecoin market grew, volumes on altcoin paired to USDT soared.A broader offering of altcoins pairs followed the higher stablecoin volumes, and as Coinbase, Huobi, and Binance launched their own stablecoins, this trend accelerated.It would be wrong to infer that Bitcoin's diminishing use as the main on-ramp to cryptocurrency is detrimental to its price. Those who acquire BTC as a pass-through might have increased its volume, but used the same amount to sell it later in exchange for altcoins. Moreover, even if one uses stablecoins as the leading on-ramp solution, eventually, part of this flow will spill to Bitcoin. Furthermore, most crypto assets are not direct competitors to BTC's store of value and scarcity propositions.Chainlink inflow and outflow past 24 hours. Source: Coinlib.ioFor example, the chart above shows $26.6 million in outflow from Chainlink (LINK) to BTC over the past 24 hours. A similar trend occurred with the remaining altcoins, confirming that Bitcoin is not losing volume as stablecoins establish themselves as the dominant base pairs.By analyzing the combined cryptocurrency market volume, one can determine whether stablecoins have been increasing overall market share or simply taking markets away from Bitcoin.Crypto total market 7-day average volume, USD billion. Source: TradingViewThe chart above is probably astonishing even for traders who experienced the late 2017 bubble. The $36.6 billion January 2018 daily average peak might have been excessive at the time but it’s rather shy when compared to the current $100 billion level.Regardless of whether faked volumes impact this view, we can see that, proportionally, there has been a sizable increase. This volume growth coincides with the stablecoin issuance from $3.6 billion in June 2019 to the current $18.9 billion.Michael Saylor, the co-founder and CEO of MicroStrategy, believes that BTC’s primary use is reserve currency. Therefore it does not compete with tokens like Ethereum (ETH) and stablecoins. Unlike traditional Bitcoin dominance data based on market capitalization, Saylor's analysis only includes coins based on proof-of-work mechanisms.Even if one compares Bitcoin's volume to a broader asset base, it matches the top 20 altcoins' sum when analyzing transparent volume. 30-day accumulated transparent volume, USD. Source: NomicsKeeping the above data in mind, it is safe to say that stablecoins are not competitors to Bitcoin in market capitalization or volumes. Tsavliris explained that he believes this is the case because:""For the top altcoins in the last few months, volumes aren't necessarily moving away from BTC markets. Rather, they are offered and utilized in tandem with USDT markets. USDT markets are attractive because they generally offer superior liquidity compared to BTC markets across most exchanges.""The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

170,"In a recently released report titled Bitcoin Investment Thesis, Fidelity Digital Assets demonstrated how portfolio managers could increase their returns by allocating a portion of their holdings to Bitcoin (BTC). The report also speculated that in the near future, increased institutional interest could expand Bitcoin’s market capitalization by hundreds of billions of dollars.Source: Fidelity Digital Assets.To support its thesis, Fidelity simulated sample portfolios starting with a default allocation of 60/40 between equities and fixed income instruments. They then diversified these with Bitcoin at a rate of 1 to 3 percent. In every scenario considered by Fidelity, portfolios holding higher Bitcoin allocations outperformed their less diversified counterparts.Related News: Fidelity says ""there is almost no relationship between the returns of Bitcoin and other assets""Assets that are negatively correlated or exhibit low correlations with the rest of the market provide additional benefits to portfolio managers. They allow for a reduction in volatility without having to sacrifice returns. Simulated portfolios that continued to hold Bitcoin benefited from the asset’s low correlation with traditional assets. The report acknowledged, however, that the increasing adoption of Bitcoin by the financial industry may lead to greater correlation in the future, thus reducing diversification benefits.Related News: Retail investors will ‘undoubtedly’ move to Bitcoin, says FidelityFidelity’s report additionally estimated the potential redistribution of investments from alternative investments and fixed income to Bitcoin. The former’s market is valued at $13.4 trillion, thus if Bitcoin were to capture 5% of this market, its market cap would increase by $670 billion. If it were to capture 10%, the market cap would increase by $1.3 trillion. The bond market is approximately worth $50.3 trillion. If Bitcoin were to capture 1% of that market, this would translate into another $500 billion.Ever-decreasing bond yields, the report argues, could push asset managers further toward alternative assets. If the most optimistic forecasts were to materialize, Bitcoin’s capitalization could increase to $2 trillion."
171,"In recent years, a battle of the minds has surfaced on whether or not Bitcoin’s price is correlated with other financial assets, such as stocks. A recent report from Fidelity Digital Assets brings clarity to the argument. Fidelity’s lengthy report, titled Bitcoin Investment Thesis: Bitcoin’s Role As An Alternative Investment, shows not only a lack of correlation between Bitcoin’s price and mainstream financial assets, but higher returns for BTC investors over a long-term time horizon. The report said:“Bitcoin’s correlation to other assets from January 2015 to September 2020 (displayed in the table below) is an average of 0.11, indicating there is almost no relationship between the returns of bitcoin and other assets.”A 0.11 correlation exists on a scale between -1 and 1, with a score of 1 meaning flawless correlation, and -1 yielding opposite price action, the report clarified. If Bitcoin had a -1 score, for example, then the asset would rise in price whenever stocks fall. A 0 score would mean no other asset movements would affect Bitcoin’s price. Related News: Retail investors will ‘undoubtedly’ move to Bitcoin, says FidelityIn recent years, Bitcoin has seemingly traveled a price path in line with mainstream markets at times. BTC dumped alongside stocks in March 2020 during initial COVID news. The digital asset, however, recovered much faster, with higher relative gains. More recently, Bitcoin suffered a slight drop in line with stocks on the news of delayed stimulus funding.Related News: Fidelity makes it clear: Bitcoin volatility is worth the risk for institutionsBut despite these short-term effects, Fidelity reported that “Bitcoin has distinct underlying fundamentals that are not affected by the health and economic situation created by COVID-19.”In the report, Fidelity noted that the uncorrelated nature of Bitcoin could be partially due to a new era of retail interest in investing, driven by social media interest. The report further discussed the fact that Bitcoin has a number of narratives that are of interest to different investing constituencies, arguing that despite the argument over whether Bitcoin is a store of value or a means of exchange, “One of the beautiful things about Bitcoin is that its success is not predicated on serving a singular purpose.”The digital asset has soared in price over the past decade, surpassing parity with the U.S. dollar, gold and other benchmarks, as previously described by crypto analyst and stock-to-flow model creator PlanB. On that journey, some people’s perception of Bitcoin has changed from a transactional currency to a store of value. Bitcoin’s age also plays a part in its lack of correlation. “Bitcoin is a young asset that, until recently, was untethered to traditional markets,” the report said. “As it is integrated in institutional portfolios, it could become increasingly correlated with other assets.”Mainstream Bitcoin trading products have trickled into the crypto space since the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s Bitcoin futures trading product launch in 2017. Since then, Bitcoin options have also surfaced on the mainstream market. As noted by the Fidelity report, correlations may begin surfacing, possibly now partially visible in the “Bitcoin CME gap” theory, around which many crypto traders place importance.In general, however, Fidelity noted a lack of mainstream correlation for crypto asset prices, citing a study from Yale University which looked at several top cryptocurrencies, including BTC and Ethereum (ETH). Fidelity reported:“Based on their analysis, the return behavior of all digital assets, including bitcoin, could not be explained by the risk factors that account for the returns in stocks, currencies, or precious metal commodities or by macroeconomic factors such as non-durable consumption growth, durable consumption growth, industrial production growth, and personal income growth.”Morgan Creek Digital co-founder and crypto industry expert Anthony Pompliano has spoken many times on Bitcoin as a non-correlated asset. Amid an uncertain global situation, such an asset might serve as a hedge, at least according to MicroStrategy, a large financial player that recently put $400 million into BTC.

172,"I recently caught wind of an interesting Cointelegraph article explaining how investors could earn 41% APY on their Bitcoin without converting it to renBTC or WBTC.In the article, the writer laid out a detailed case for generating yield on Bitcoin (BTC) holdings by investing in options markets instead of decentralized finance (DeFi) apps.While we are proponents of this exact strategy some of the explanations laid out in the article are more confusing than useful so I want to add a little clarity to the best way to execute this strategy.In the article, the author describes a covered call strategy as consisting of “simultaneously holding BTC and selling the equivalent size in call options.”When selling the calls against your long BTC you receive the call premium, which is the price the buyer pays for the option to buy BTC at the strike price specified in the call option contract. The returns on a covered call strategy, then, depend on the premium you can generate.Options premiums are difficult things to understand and it’s worth mentioning that Myron Scholes and Robert Merton won a Nobel Prize in 1997 for figuring out a reliable way to price them. But generally, the premium increases when the contract length is longer, when the difference between the price today and the strike price is smaller, and when BTC’s volatility is higher.Relationship of call premium to contract length and the difference between today’s price and the strike. Source: Ryan AndersonAs shown above, the most lucrative covered call strategies will be the ones that have contract lengths greater than a year, strike prices equal to (or less than) today’s price, and are created when BTC volatility is highest.At the time of writing, a call option which expires in June of 2021 and is struck at $10,000 BTC offers an annualized premium of 34.66%. This is even after considering BTC volatility is rather low these days compared to historicals.BTC volatility since spring of 2019. Source: Skew.comHowever, it’s important to recognize the risks associated with different covered call strategies.An easy way to visualize the exposure you get when trading options is to look at profit and loss on your position versus where the BTC price ends up on the day the contract expires.P&L charts for long stock and long call positions. Source: InvestopediaBy way of comparison to just being long on a stock, being long on a call is different because your downside is capped. You only ever lose the premium you paid for the call, but when the price of the asset is above your strike, you profit.A covered call is a position made by going long an asset and short a call option on that asset, so the combined profit and loss looks something like the below.P&L chart for a covered call. Source: InvestopediaThe exposure looks like a long asset exposure, with uncapped downside, until the strike price of the option.When the asset price is higher than the strike price at expiration, the call gets exercised and you sell your asset to the buyer.Because the investor owned the asset the entire time, this is not a loss in profit and loss terms, and so the upside exposure is merely capped.Here’s where we ran into some problems with the article’s framing of how to trade options. The author suggests that in comparison with DeFi-based yields:“Trading BTC options at Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), Deribit, or OKEx, an investor can comfortably achieve 40% or higher yields.”But when above we looked at essentially the best-case covered call we found that its annualized premium reached 34.66%. So where’s the difference?The author based the 40% figure on one call contract expiring at the end of November 2020 with a strike at $9,500. This strike price is lower than today’s price for BTC, which is about $10,750 per BTC. According to the author:“As previously mentioned, the covered call might present losses if the BTC price at expiry is lower than the strategy threshold level….Any level below $8,960 will result in a loss, but that is 16.6% below the current $10,750 Bitcoin price.”This, unfortunately, is a fundamentally mistaken way of thinking about covered calls. If an investor sells a call option with a strike price lower than today’s price (or the price the investor expects the asset to hold at day of expiry), they must be ready to sell your asset at that lower strike price.Put another way, if one holds 1 BTC today, when the price is $10,750, and then sells a call against it at a $9,000 expiry today, the lucky person on the other side gets to make a free $1,750 when they buy the BTC from the investor at $9,000.The author offers another set of strikes to consider, this time at $8,000 and $9,000, but the same error is committed when describing the profit and loss.In the article the author says:“A 25% APY return can be achieved by selling 0.5 BTC $8K and 0.5 BTC $9K November call options. By reducing expected returns, one will only face negative outcomes below $8,370 at the November 27 expiry, 22% below the current spot price.”This is mistaken again. Agreeing to sell at $8,000 when BTC is trading at $10,750, unless you have a real belief that the price at expiry will be below $8,000/BTC, is a negative outcome!From our experience, when an investor enters a covered call position, we believe they maximize their expected return when leaving a little room for upside performance in BTC.That’s why we favor selling about 20% higher than today’s price. What’s equally important, though, is the length of the option contract.Know your ‘options’ when trading options!Trading options on a less than monthly basis introduces some extra risk due to liquidity. In general, the most liquid contracts are the monthly expiries, a pattern that holds equally as well in crypto markets as in traditional markets, like equities, commodities, and foreign exchange.The author had set his call to expire at the end of November, which is a two-month contract. That’s ok from a liquidity standpoint, but that length neither maximizes the premium generated like a very long-dated contract would not minimize risk from length of contract like a one-month contract would.BTC Options OI by Expiry. Source: Skew.comFor that reason, we favor a strategy that involves trading one-month options. The major benefit of trading covered calls monthly is that investors reset their strike price every month.Selling calls 20% higher than today’s price is a dicier proposal if one has to wait two months or longer to reset, but when with resetting every month, the gains are also capped at 20% per month.Even BTC, the most volatile asset class by far, is rather infrequently growing by more than 20% per month. By contrast, 20% price moves over two months or longer are almost to be expected.Options trading is difficult and demands sophistication and forethought from the investors who seek to profit from it. While other strategies may offer higher headline returns at the expense of less-understood risks.As is always the case, investors should do their own research before making any investment decisions.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

173,"On Oct. 12 the price of Ether (ETH) soared 8.15% to reach a new monthly high at $387.75 on Binance. The rally from $366 to as high as $387.50 occurred as Bitcoin (BTC) price surged to $11,600, leading traders to speculate that the crypto bull market has restarted.Over the past few weeks Ether’s fundamentals have strengthened and despite a sharp downturn in the price of decentralized finance tokens, the number of active users in the Ethereum network has continued to grow.Ether follows Bitcoin in a strong intraday rallyWhen Bitcoin price rallies Ether is usually the first beneficiary and this was the case again as BTC price rallied to a key multi-year resistance at $11,500.During bull cycles or even short-term uptrends, Bitcoin follows Ether and vice versa. Both cryptocurrencies tend to move in tandem, with either one frontrunning the other.Throughout the past two weeks, traders focused on the favorable technical structure of Bitcoin. Crypto trader Cantering Clark said the “context” of the market momentum is also important.High time frame charts, including the weekly and monthly charts, depict a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. Adding to this, other events like Square and MicroStrategy investing nearly $500 million in Bitcoin could further amplify the positive sentiment. Clark explained:Fundamentals remain strong for EthereumAlthough the decentralized finance market has been flat since early October, the demand for Ether has not subsided.Activity on the Ethereum blockchain has consistently remained high. As a result, the hashrate recently hit a record high. Glassnode researchers wrote:The confluence of a strong Bitcoin rally and robust Ethereum fundamentals likely catalyzed the sharp Ether rally. In the near term, the next hurdle for Ether to overcome is the resistance cluster at $400."
174,"Bitcoin (BTC) is winning the battle of the safe havens as another corporate buy-in sees $115 million enter its books.Asset management giant Stone Ridge confirmed that it made the significant purchase via its spin-off New York Digital Investment Group or NYDIG, which now has over $1 billion in assets under management.“The macro backdrop against the public health backdrop has caused a lot of people to rethink their portfolio composition,” the company’s new CEO, Robert Gutmann, told Forbes on Oct. 13.Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, which purchased $425 million of BTC in August and September, responded:“As the trillions of dollars on the balance sheets of banks, asset managers, insurance firms, endowments, & family offices begin their migration to the #Bitcoin universe, they will need firms like NYDIG to guide them.  $1 billion down, more to go.”The news comes as a new report warns that the United States Federal Reserve will need to print $5 trillion next year.Published on Oct. 12, the report by economists Lawrence ‘Larry’ Summers and David Cutler calculates the indirect cost of the Coronavirus to be $16 trillion.“The total cost is estimated at more than $16 trillion, or approximately 90% of the annual gross domestic product of the US. For a family of 4, the estimated loss would be nearly $200 000,” it summarizes.“Approximately half of this amount is the lost income from the COVID-19–induced recession; the remainder is the economic effects of shorter and less healthy life.”Commenting on the findings, David Rosenberg, chief economist at Rosenberg Research & Associates, concluded that the Fed alone would thus need to print $5 trillion of liquidity in 2021.This would compound the feeling of unease which began with this year’s mass money printing, which has sent U.S. national debt over $27 trillion.Rosenberg told Twitter followers to buy gold, but for Max Keiser, there is a clear alternative which makes more sense.“Gold works, but #Bitcoin is THE FASTEST HORSE IN THE RACE,” he wrote in reply to Rosenberg.Bitcoin hit highs of $11,690 on Tuesday before returning towards $11,400 at press time, still on monthly gains of 10.5% and year-to-date returns of 60%. As Cointelegraph reported, hopes are increasing that the short term will bring further upside, with even $17,000 coming into play should $12,000 be flipped to support.For the fiat economy, however, the picture is looking much bleaker, according to new comments from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).Speaking to CNBC last week, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said that the outlook for many countries was now not a V-shaped recovery but a K-shaped one.“Most countries are going to be faced with uneven recovery and we see in many cases a ‘K,’ with parts of the economy doing really well, and other parts contracting dramatically,” she forecast.For Keiser, this was a textbook definition of a phenomenon he calls “neofeudalism.” This involves the concentration of more of the world’s wealth closer to the state at the expense of those further away, creating the modern equivalent of lords and peasants.“The extreme wealth concentration created by Covid becomes permanent. This would be a new Dark Ages,” he tweeted on Wednesday.“Bitcoin fixes this.”"
175,"At the start of October, the crypto market was faced with extremely tumultuous financial conditions, thanks in large part to the recent filings against BitMEX, which saw the company’s top brass being indicted by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission on several charges. Not only that, but just a few days before the BitMEX scandal came to light, cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin was hacked to the tune of over $275 million on Sept. 26.In the midst of all this, the crypto derivatives market also witnessed a major development in the form of Binance overtaking Huobi and OKEx to become the largest crypto derivatives exchange by volume for the month of September, with the platform recording a total trade volume of $164.8 billion for the month.The data, released by U.K.-based crypto analytics firm CryptoCompare, took into consideration the trading volume of the aforementioned exchanges and found that Binance drew in a total of $8 billion more in trade volume than its closest competitor, Huobi, which raked in $156.3 billion during the same time period, while OKEx drew in around $155.7 billion.Binance and OKEx demonstrated relatively similar derivatives volumes during July and August; however, it’s worth noting that during this same time window, Huobi had quite a margin on both its closest rivals. This then poses the question of how Binance was able to make such strides in just one month to overtake Huobi and OKEx so quickly. Providing his thoughts on the subject, Jay Hao, CEO of OKEx, told Cointelegraph:According to a Binance spokesperson, one of the key drivers that helped spur the recent market performance was user feedback, especially in regard to the less-than-ideal trading experiences that many customers had previously faced on other derivatives exchanges: “They told us about system outages or instability, interfaces that weren’t user-friendly, and that all the exchanges then were only offering incentives for market makers, which created a lopsided environment that disadvantaged market takers.”Another event that may have bolstered market confidence in Binance’s derivatives arm was Black Thursday, or March 12, a day that greatly impacted both traditional and crypto markets. While many other derivatives exchanges encountered significant outages, Binance offered uninterrupted service to its customers, thereby potentially cementing confidence in the platform.Lastly, during the course of summer this year, a number of users moved from Bitcoin to various altcoins and DeFi-based derivatives. During this transitional phase, Binance Futures expanded its offerings pool. The Binance spokesperson noted: “There’s also better awareness on how we balance Bitcoin and altcoins; altcoin futures volumes make up around 40% on Binance. We think we understand and reflect market conditions well.”While September saw Binance lead the derivatives roost, heading into October, OKEx is leading all Bitcoin futures exchanges in terms of Bitcoin futures open interest. In its most basic sense, open interest signifies the total number of outstanding derivative contracts — be it options or futures — that are yet to be settled. From a more technical standpoint, open interest serves as an indicator of options trading activity and whether or not the total amount of money coming into the derivatives market is increasing.On Oct. 4, OKEx’s 24-hour trading volume was over the $1.3 billion mark, dwarfing the $1.23 billion trade volume of its closest competitor, Binance Futures. Additionally, as can be seen from the chart above, open interest on OKEx is the highest by a wide margin, with the other five exchanges performing similarly to one another.Such positive statistical data seems to suggest that BTC futures and options sentiment has remained quite strong, despite the recent BitMEX lawsuit and KuCoin hack. Not only that, but OKEx’s futures open interest has risen from $850 million to $930 million since the start of October, something that is potentially indicative of a bull run in the near future. Providing his insights on the subject, Hao told Cointelegraph:On Oct. 11, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority — the country’s principal finance regulator — issued a blanket ban prohibiting crypto service providers from selling derivatives and exchange-traded notes to retail investors. While the U.K. derivatives market may not be large in comparison to others, the fact that a prominent regulator such as the FCA continues to claim that “cryptoassets are causing harm to consumers and markets” is rather alarming for the industry.The government agency is still alleging that digital assets have no inherent value — an argument that has been used against crypto since its inception. Moreover, another reason for the ban is the “extreme volatile nature” of crypto, which seems like another unjust evaluation considering the same can be said about many traditional stock options. The FCA claims that retail investors “do not understand enough about the derivatives market,” so there is no real need for them to invest in such offerings.That being said, it is worth remembering that when the ban was proposed in July last year, it generated a total of 527 responses from various companies that sell derivatives as well as crypto exchanges, law firms, trade bodies and other entities. In a 55-page report released by the FCA, a staggering 97% of respondents are shown to have opposed the proposal."
176,"The concept of a blockchain ""dark forest"" has been popularized recently by Ethereum and the existence of front-running bots that will copy any profitable transaction pending for submission.The bots are able to assess if any given transaction that just entered the mempool can be replicated, and they will immediately publish their own copy with a much higher gas fee, which virtually guarantees that they will be the first to claim it. The term ""dark forest"" is inspired from a sci-fi novel and indicates a place where detection means instant death — or in this case loss of funds.In Ethereum, this usually happens with public smart contracts that for some reason came in control of funds. Dan Robinson from Paradigm Capital demonstrated one such case with money mistakenly sent to a contract address. These types of bots also threw a wrench into Bancor’s vulnerability mitigation plan in June.Bitcoin (BTC) does not have smart contracts to front-run, but a post by BitMEX Research highlights how a similar event occurs when one uses brainwallets.A brainwallet is the term for a private key that is only stored as a memory in a person’s brain, meaning that no physical backups exist. This approach is generally discouraged because relying on a person's memory to store a complex alphanumeric string is not ideal.A potential solution to this is creating a wallet from an easy to remember phrase. This is what the analysts did by generating a seed phrase from extracts of famous literary works, including the Bitcoin whitepaper.Unfortunately, in some cases the BTC put into these wallets was swept away even before the transaction to fund them was confirmed. This was the case with simple seed words like “Call me Ishmael” from Herman Melville’s Moby Dick. Other longer and more complex excerpts were still swept within a day, with the Bitcoin whitepaper’s “The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity” lasting the longest.The analysts concluded that addresses generated from these types of complex, but public-domain seed words are fully compromised and are constantly being monitored.As Cointelegraph reported earlier, blockchain makes it hard to use any type of password-based generation mechanism. Passwords on traditional platforms are mostly protected by the fact that they’re stored on a secret database. The attackers must interact with it to make guesses, but the server will usually issue rate limit denials. Furthermore, having to make a web request to make a guess is already many times slower than hashing through locally-stored combinations.Blockchain private keys can instead be pre-generated from massive dictionary databases, making attackers the effective owners of those addresses. There are ways to mitigate these vulnerabilities by using salt — random bits of data added to throw off brute force attempts. But the fundamental issue of brainwallets is that any address that is sufficiently resistant to brute forcing will likely be difficult to remember reliably.There are many stories of people losing their BTC by forgetting a private key they stored in their brain, with one notable loss of $13 million reported in 2019 — though some believe it was fake. Ethereum is likely subjected to the same type of private key brute forcing, with millions of dollars in Ether (ETH) being reportedly stolen in the past."
177,"A Belgium-based crypto company says its automated bots help traders “work smarter, not harder.”According to 4C Trading, many crypto enthusiasts lack access to advanced trading strategies — and this can result in costly mistakes.The company says its bots trade around the clock, reducing the chance that users will miss trading opportunities that may occur when they’re away from their laptops.Its team has designed SMART Bots that “make calculated decisions based on split-second mathematical precision.”Crucially, 4C Trading says its products are geared toward traders of all abilities, regardless of whether they’re new to cryptocurrencies or an expert in digital assets.According to the company, its algorithm-backed bots act according to market fluctuations. This means that crypto is bought when there is a real surge in price and sold when there is a confirmed slump — helping to lock in profits.4C Trading says that setting up the bot is easy, hassle-free, and can be done within minutes, as it connects to exchanges via an API. This procedure only needs to be completed once, and the company’s customer service team is on hand to offer assistance if users have any difficulties.The platform claims that its bots have established a strong track record after being in operation for more than two-and-a-half years, and detailed information about past performance is offered through a dashboard. However, 4C Trading stresses that bots only spring into action when there is a confirmed shift of trend, adding: “It will open and close its trades a bit later than the initial surge or slump.”A total of three bots are in operation: SMART BTC, SMART ETH and LINK. Each offers a different experience given how each asset has varying levels of liquidity and trading volume.Right now, 4C Trading notes that the smart bots are on the Binance spot market while the Smart Margin is on Binance Futures and FTX.Although the company is tight-lipped about exactly how the smart bots work, the team says continual improvements are being made to its algorithms. It has also suggested that bots could be launched for other assets in the future providing that levels of liquidity are adequate.Security is a focus for 4C Trading, and the company stresses that because it’s a software solution that only executes trades, it doesn’t hold funds or facilitate withdrawals.To help crypto enthusiasts figure out whether automated trading is right for them, 4C Trading offers a seven-day free trial — and discounts if users commit to a six- or 12-month subscription.Three pricing tiers are offered for beginners, advanced traders and experts — with premium plans offering higher trading limits overall. According to the team, each pack comes with different Smart Bots, and Smart Margins are included in all packs. Bespoke packages are also offered for corporate and high-volume users.4C Trading’s three founders say they have been driven by a determination to build the best trading bots in the market, and they claim their products have been tested against marketplace rivals.One of the company’s main goals has been to help traders achieve a better work-life balance, meaning that they no longer need to be spending every waking minute poring over the latest Bitcoin and Ether prices. But given how volatility can strike at any time (March’s flash crash happened in the middle of the night for crypto traders in Europe), the benefits can extend beyond convenience.Disclaimer.

178,"A Bitcoin (BTC) sell-off and associated price fall are “not going to happen,” a well-known the CEO of a well-known analytics tool has said.In a tweet on Oct. 12, Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, noted that average inflows to exchanges were staying low despite BTC price gains.Ki highlighted CryptoQuant’s mean exchange inflow metric, which remains comfortably within the low-risk area, suggesting a low chance of a sell-off.Mean exchange inflow measures how much Bitcoin is entering exchanges, with the implication that it could be used for selling or trading activities. By extension, it gives an idea of whale activity — large volume hodlers planning to divest themselves of BTC.“$BTC dumping is not going to happen,” Ki commented. “All Exchanges Inflow Mean usually indicates how many whales are active on exchanges. Above 2 BTC is the danger zone, and we're still in the safe zone.”As such, BTC/USD climbing to near $11,500 this week has not increased investors’ temptation to sell.Bitcoin mean inflows vs. BTC/USD 1-month chart.

179,"Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has revealed that he and his wife decided to make a “derisking plan” for their crypto investments in 2012 — resulting in eight-figures worth of missed profit at current prices.In a series of tweets published on October 11, Schwartz revealed that he sold 40,000 Ether (ETH) for $1 each — a stash that would be worth more than $15.5 million at today’s prices. Schwartz mentioned the episode after revealing a derisking plan made in 2012, though the Ether sale occurred in a separate episode a few years later. The Ripple (XRP) executive also said that he regretted selling a significant sum of Bitcoin (BTC) for $750 and a large trove of XRP at $0.10, but did not reveal the volume of the sales.My decision to derisk was made in 2012 or so when I discussed investing in cryptocurrencies with my wife. She insisted we agree on a derisking plan right then. And I must say that every bitcoin I sold for $750 or XRP for $0.10 hurt.Schwartz revealed his early conservative downsizing while responding to Twitter user ‘PbuzzXr’ who claimed that “anyone pushing XRP while derisking is exit scamming” in a wide ranging thread.The user, who was not speaking about Schwartz specifically, added: “You can’t go around trying to build faith in others for XRP while you yourself have no faith in it and feel derisking it is your best option.”Ripple’s CTO emphasized that his decision to derisk in 2012 was informed by the fact he is “a risk averse person with people who depend on me financially and emotionally.”Last week, Ripple’s co-founder and executive chairman, Chris Larsen, criticized the United States for failing to keep up with the likes of China, Singapore, and the United Kingdom in fostering crypto innovation, hinting that the company may soon relocate from the U.S."
180,"A report published by major U.S.-based crypto exchange Kraken has identified signs the correlation between Bitcoin (BTC), the greenback, and legacy markets, is continuing to weaken.Kraken’s September volatility report found Bitcoin (BTC) largely maintaining a negative correlation with the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) since May, despite a brief coalescence between the two markets in early September.The report attributes BTC’s dollar divergence to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s plan to maintain zero percent interest rates until at least 2023, in addition to declining growth rates. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has shown positive correlation with the Euro since May.The report notes that while the start of the month saw an 8-month low for correlation between BTC and the S&P 500, the correlation would later increase as both markets experienced sideways consolidation.Bitcoin’s correlation with gold has remained positive since mid-July, with both markets experiencing bearish pressure over recent weeks.Looking forward, Kraken anticipates Bitcoin will post a stronger performance in October than in September, and this would be consistent with the trend exhibited in eight of the past nine years.The report predicts October will drive an 11% gain for BTC, suggesting Bitcoin will close the month at $11,850 — a 3% gain from current price levels. However, Kraken notes that Bitcoin has underperformed its monthly average during six of the nine months that have transpired in 2020 so far.Kraken's mild optimism is outshone by the bullish calls from two respected analysts. Former hedge fund manager Raoul Pal recently revealed he has shifted more than half of his personal investment portfolio into Bitcoin in anticipation of massive institutional adoption:And Alex Saunders from Nugget’s News compared the current set up to mid-2017 and predicted that institutional appetite for Bitcoin was likely to trigger a “breathtaking rally”:July 2017. $BTC at $2700 & investors were scared of Segwit, hard forks & FUD.

If the bulls can pull this off, the ETH/USD pair could rise to $488.134.The 20-day exponential moving average ($360) has started to turn up and the RSI has risen above 61. This suggests that the bulls have the upper hand.This positive view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from $395 and breaks below the 20-day EMA.

182,"Bitcoin (BTC) price had been acting inside a narrow range for the last few weeks but the momentum and trend shifted as a bullish breakout occurred on the announcement that Square had allocated 1% of its cash reserves to BTC.This bullish breakout even caused the price to rally from $10,600 to $11,500, which is almost $1,000 in a few days.Despite this strong upside move, traders are still cautious as they are unsure whether the bullish momentum is back or if this is just a temporary blip.BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe daily chart of Bitcoin is showing a clear upward move toward the upper range resistance. The critical factor to watch is whether the $12,000-$12,400 resistance zone breaks as that would imply another impulse wave is on the horizon.While most investors were expecting further movement to the downside, the complete opposite happened. In the past week several negative news items surfaced but none of these impacted the price of Bitcoin.However, what did move the market was the announcement of a $50 million allocation from Square. Shortly after the news, the triangle broke out to the upside and rallied right through the $11,100 resistance zone.BTC/USD 6-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThis led to a strong bullish reaction across the crypto markets. A more decisive move to watch for would be a clear breakout of the current range-bound structure and this would occur if the price can push above $12,000.Such a breakout seems unlikely to occur in the short term as Bitcoin’s price is approaching the resistance zone in one go.The current movements can be compared with the start of the previous bull cycle at the beginning of 2016.BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewDuring the start of the previous bull cycle, similar movements were seen. It’s before the parabolic moves occur, through which the period can be defined as boring.In 2015 and 2016, a period of six months was defined by range-bound construction before a breakout happened.During these constructions, previous resistances were confirmed as support, after which a dull sideways period continued to occur.BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewAs the chart shows, the previous resistance zone at $10,000 was tested for confirmation, and this is exactly what occurred.This confirmation led towards a bounce, just as the previous days have shown. The critical level to break for further bullish momentum is the $12,000 resistance zone.However, as the current construction is similar to the movements in 2016, a breakout could take a while to occur.In such a way, if the breakout above $12,000 happens, a bullish move towards $17,000 is very much on the horizon. The area around $17,000 is the next central pivot, and final hurdle before new all-time highs can occur.BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewA very likely scenario is the continuation of the range-bound movements, as discussed primarily in this article.In that sense, the upper resistance zone is found between $12,000-$12,400.

183,"Goldman Sachs, the $71.4 billion investment bank, is reportedly bearish on the U.S. dollar. For Bitcoin (BTC), which has recently rallied above the dreaded $11,100 level, this could serve as a potential catalyst.Bitcoin is heading into the last two months of the year with significant uncertainty. But if the dollar continues to slump, it could buoy the momentum of BTC and gold in the fourth quarter.Zach Pandl, the co-head of Global FX, Rates, and EM Strategy at Goldman, predicts the dollar to hit 2018 lows.In a note to clients obtained by CNBC, Pandl and his team of analysts pinpointed two major factors. First, Pandl said the potential “blue wave” election remains a significant risk to the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). Second, the prospect around COVID-19 vaccines remains unclear.On Sept. 30, Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel told the FT that the vaccine would not likely be ready until after the election.The lack of clarity on the production and distribution of vaccines, as well as the election risk, could hinder the dollar’s momentum. Pandl wrote:If the dollar drops, it would naturally benefit alternative stores of value like Bitcoin and gold. Since alternative assets are priced against the dollar, the decline of the DXY causes other stores of value to rise.Atop the declining dollar, Pandl additionally noted that potential vaccine breakthroughs could boost risky assets. As such, if institutions view Bitcoin as a risk-on asset, it could further boost the sentiment around BTC. Pandl wrote:A persistent narrative around the medium-term performance of Bitcoin has been its high time frame structure. The weekly and monthly charts of Bitcoin remain highly positive due to BTC’s reaction from the $10,500 to $10,700 support range.On Oct. 12, Bitcoin surged above $11,500 for the first time since September, demonstrating strong momentum.The recovery of BTC above the $11,300 resistance level is critical because it follows a series of negative events in October.From charges against BitMEX to U.S. President Donald Trump’s pushback on the stimulus, BTC faced numerous occurrences that could have led to a sharp pullback.Following a prolonged period of stagnance throughout September, the recent price action of Bitcoin remains positive."
184,"Bitcoin (BTC) starts the week above $11,000 as fresh gains continue to hold — is $12,000 next or will bears gain control?Cointelegraph takes five factors that could help decide whether this week is bullish or bearish for BTC price action. Bitcoin remains sensitive to macro phenomena as Q4 continues, and the U.S. election run-up could produce noticeable turbulence.The outcome of a Democratic win looks bleak for one macro indicator in particular: the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY), analysts say.In a report on Oct. 12 quoted by Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs warned that Joe Biden entering the White House could spook markets in advance, driving DXY down to its lows from 2018. Bitcoin has historically seen strong inverse correlation with DXY, and fresh lows could thus be a boon for hodlers. In August, $12,500 highs for BTC/USD came in tandem with DXY dipping to just above 92 points. 2018 saw a dive to 89 — 4% lower than at present.In addition, the roll-out of a coronavirus vaccine would serve to hinder, rather than help dollar strength.“The risks are skewed toward dollar weakness, and we see relatively low odds of the most dollar-positive outcome — a win by Mr. Trump combined with a meaningful vaccine delay,” Goldman strategists wrote.“A ‘blue wave’ U.S. election and favorable news on the vaccine timeline could return the trade-weighted dollar and DXY index to their 2018 lows.”Last week, Cointelegraph reported an opinion that, regardless of who wins in November, safe havens will win thanks to the election result, with one analyst eyeing a $4,000 price target for gold. Regarding the coronavirus, fresh restrictions coming in across Europe are set to produce more economic concerns. With the “second wave” seemingly firmly underway, various countries are seeking to enact repeated lockdown-style measures this week. Amid the turmoil, last-minute Brexit negotiations are adding to the headache for the United Kingdom, with a deadline for reaching some form of consensus on exiting the European Union now just days away.In the U.S., politicians have still failed to agree on a new stimulus package, which Americans are eagerly anticipating after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed the issuance of a second $1,200 stimulus check.Despite the gloom, stocks are up, with S&P 500 futures gaining 0.25% prior to the open on Monday. Leading the way is China, where a weakening yuan and investors hopeful that an upcoming speech from president Xi Jinping will serve to entice more foreign investment.Not so gloomy are Bitcoin’s network fundamentals this week. Depending on the metric used, hash rate hit new all-time highs over the weekend, suggesting that more computing power than ever is being dedicated to mining. According to data from monitoring resources Bitinfocharts and Blockchain, hash rate hit 155 exahashes per second (EH/s). 130 EH/s marked a tenfold increase versus when BTC/USD hit its record highs of $20,000 in December 2017.Hash rate is difficult to measure precisely, and different tools produce different results, but the trajectory is clear: Bitcoin miners are bullish.As Cointelegraph often reports, a popular theory suggests that highs in hash rate and jumps in network difficulty tend to produce Bitcoin price rises later on. “The correct hashrate-adjusted price for #Bitcoin right now is approx. $32,000 per coin,” Max Keiser, one of the theory’s main proponents, commented last week. “Once we get through this 2018 supply overhang and legacy exchange wash-trading supply glut we’ll see new ATH.”Difficulty has yet to show signs that it will follow hash rate to new records in the short term — estimates on Monday showed that the next readjustment will be neither up nor down, just like the last.Investor sentiment is slowly firming up when it comes to Bitcoin, according to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Data from the market indicator shows that after August sparked warnings of overexuberance, a subsequent dip is now balancing.On Monday, the Index was at 52, having passed the 50 mark for the first time since Sep. 21 over the weekend.That puts investor sentiment in “neutral” territory — a relief compared to the “extreme greed” of August and the “fear” that followed. The Index aims to show when a market sell-off is due, typically the closer its score gets to the top of its scale from zero to 100. Volatility, market momentum and volume make up half of the weighted basket of factors which produce the score.Lastly, despite few expecting its sudden push above $11,000, Bitcoin pundits are betting on further gains.As noted by Cointelegraph Markets analysts among others, the area around $11,000 previously formed a key area to break, with $10,800 acting as a “pivot” point which could propel the market higher once reclaimed.In the event, BTC/USD took $10,800 and another important level, $11,150, in its stride, sealing daily and weekly closes above that level and closer to $11,400. This came despite a mixed bag of news, which included the arrest of senior executives at derivatives giant BitMEX.For some well-known names, the bullish mood is palpable.“We're going much higher. You have been warned,” researcher Vijay Boyapati tweeted on Sunday.Meanwhile, a survey from Cointelegraph Markets’ Michaël van de Poppe saw over 60% of 4,000 respondents bet on $12,000 appearing before $10,700 — below the pivot level. "
185,"On Oct. 7 Cointelegraph reported that top crypto traders had kept a bearish stance since mid-September and at the time the Bitcoin (BTC) long-to-short ratio had reached its lowest level in 10 weeks. All of this changed in a matter of hours as soon as BTC broke through the $11,000 resistance.Whenever Bitcoin's volatility gets too low, it usually signals that traders became too complacent. Naturally, there will be periods of range trading, but short-term unpredictability is Bitcoin's defining characteristic.For pro traders, implied volatility is commonly known as a fear index because it measures the average premium being paid in the options market. Any unexpected substantial price movement (both negative and positive) will cause the indicator to increase sharply.Take notice of how the 3-month options recently touched its lowest levels in seventeen months. This should not be interpreted as a riskless market, as the S&P 500 3-month volatility currently stands at 28%. That's not even half of Bitcoin's current 60%; therefore, a $500 daily candle should not come as a surprise.The most recent two-weeks saw Bitcoin price trade in the $10,400-$10,900 range and BTC futures open interest increased by $300 million. This shows that although it was a seemingly quiet period, traders had increased their bets.Regardless of the reason behind the most recent price movement, top traders rushed to cover their short positions. Meanwhile, the futures contracts premium has remained modest, signaling room for a sustainable rally.The futures premium signals that all is wellA futures contract seller will usually demand a price premium to regular spot exchanges. This situation happens in every derivatives market and is not exclusive to crypto markets. Besides the exchange liquidity risk, the seller is postponing settlement, therefore the price is higher.Healthy markets tend to trade at a 5% to 15% annualized premium, known as basis rate. On the other hand, futures are trading below regular spot exchanges indicating short-term bearish sentiment.As the chart above indicates, the last time BTC futures held a 15% premium was on Aug. 18, and since then they have kept a slightly positive rate. Friday's rally was not enough to cause overleverage, thus reinforcing the short-covering thesis explained earlier.To better gauge how traders are positioning themselves as BTC looks to establish $11,000 as a new support level, one should monitor exchanges' long-to-short ratios.Top traders are 20% net longEven though each futures market is balanced between buyers (longs) and sellers (shorts), top traders' positions can differ from a broader client base.By exclusively aggregating top traders' net positions, one can determine how bullish or bearish their bets are.According to data from OKEx, the top traders' long-to-short ratio on the exchange bottomed at 0.75 on Oct. 9. This figure translates to a 25% net short position and can be interpreted as bearish.During the following 24 hours, these traders not only closed their shorts, but also reverted to a 25% net long position. This is a good indicator of a reliable recovery, as opposed to a simple short-covering scenario.Binance data depicts a similar situation, as its top traders' long-to-short ratio spiked from 9% to 23% net long during the same period. It is worth noting that methodologies between exchanges will vary. Therefore one should monitor changes instead of absolute figures.The above data indicate that top traders were, in fact, net short ahead of the recent BTC price surge. The futures premium has been held at a positive, healthy level, opening up room for further buy-side leverage.Instead of betting on a typical ""Bart Simpson pattern"", top traders changed their stance and are now leaning bullish, supporting the thesis of a bull run to $14,000.In the future, traders might consider shifting their positions according to data, instead of speculating on how price movements may or may not trigger trend changes.It does not matter if the price swing holds relation to Square's recent 4,709 Bitcoin acquisition. If top traders are becoming bullish, then this is typically a signal that the trend is strengthening in that direction.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

186,"In the past three years the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has shot down several applications for a Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund. This dashed hopes of many investors who believed Bitcoin price would rally higher if an EFT was approved. Although investors no longer pin BTC’s future on the existence of an ETF, regulators could eventually adjust their anti-crypto stance in the future.In an interview with Cointelegraph, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said that the regulator will have to become accommodative to innovation as several people from both the crypto space and traditional financial institutions seek their guidance.Bloomberg’s latest crypto newsletter predicts that a Bitcoin ETF could see the light of the day if Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is elected as the next U.S. President. The author believes that a change in guard may bring regulatory clarity that could attract investments into digital assets.Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360However, even if President Donald Trump is re-elected, Bloomberg expects Bitcoin to extend its uptrend through his second term as the digital asset will be buoyed by the rising debt-to-GDP, quantitative easing, and Bitcoin hash rate. Even if Bitcoin only rallies at half the speed of its 1,400% gain from 2016 to 2020, it would rally to $80,000 by 2024.The long-term forecasts are encouraging and so are the short-term charts. Let’s analyze the top-5 cryptocurrencies that may outperform in the short-term. The breakout of the symmetrical triangle on Oct. 8 attracted buyers who pushed the price above the overhead resistance at $11,178 on Oct. 10. However, the bears have not yet given up completely as they sold the rally to $11,482.44 on Sep. 10.BTC/USD daily chart.

This suggests that the sentiment has changed from sell on rallies to buy on dips.The moving averages on the verge of a bullish crossover and the relative strength index above 64 indicate that the advantage is currently with the bulls.If the buyers can push the price above the overhead resistance at $11,500, the next stop for the BTC/USD pair could be $12,000 and then $12,460. This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the 20-day exponential moving average ($10,853). Such a move will suggest that the current breakout was a bull trap.BTC/USD 4-hour chart.

The buyers will again attempt to push the price above $11,500 and if they succeed momentum is likely to pick up.However, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, it could consolidate in a tight range of $11,468.98–$11,178 for some time. A break below $11,178 will be a sign of short-term weakness.The bears defended the $0.26 overhead resistance on Oct. 10, but they could not sustain the selling pressure today.

The moving averages on the verge of a bullish crossover and the RSI close to 60 suggest advantage to the bulls.Contrary to this assumption, if the XRP/USD pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($0.246), it will show that the bears are aggressively shorting on rallies to $0.26.XRP/USD 4-hour chart.

187,"New data shows Bitcoin’s (BTC) current price action is showing higher levels of ‘HODLing’ activity than previous bull cycles.According to on-chain analyst Willy Woo, an indicator called “reflexivity” has been increasing in recent months. Woo explained that the indicator measures Bitcoin investors' tendency to hold onto their BTC as its price rises. It’s essentially an alternative way to gauge the HODLing activity of retail investors.This next bull run may eclipse the previous cycleThere are several reasons why retail investors might be holding onto their BTC even more so than in previous bull cycles.If Bitcoin rallies in 2021, most investors would see it as a post-halving bull rally. Historically, BTC has rallied 12 to 15 months after each halving, recording a new all-time high each time. Based on the tendency of BTC to rally after a halving, retail investors might be holding as a strategy to avoid being priced out if a strong sustained rally begins.Bitcoin has also shown a surprising level of resilience throughout multiple potential black swan events. After its initial recovery from the pandemic-induced crash in March, it has stayed above $10,000 despite numerous negative events.Most recently, the price of Bitcoin slumped after the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) charged BitMEX with violating the Bank Secrecy Act.After the CFTC announcement BTC price fell below $10,500 but it quickly recovered to the $10,700 support level. According to Woo, this is possibly due to the confluence of the two key factors. Woo explained:Heading into the fourth quarter, industry executives believe the U.S. presidential election could benefit Bitcoin and the positive HODLing data could further buoy BTC price.The U.S. presidential election and Q4 may push BTC price higherIndustry executives and prominent investors in the cryptocurrency industry foresee the upcoming presidential election in November benefiting Bitcoin.Su Zhu, the CEO of Three Arrows Capital, said a Democratic sweep would catalyze Bitcoin due to various macro factors.He also suggested that a second term for Trump could also benefit Bitcoin. He wrote:As Cointelegraph reported earlier this week, traders including Peter Brandt believe higher time frame charts point to a strong uptrend for Bitcoin. The combination of favorable technicals, strengthening fundamentals, and rising HODLing activity could buoy a BTC bull run in 2021."
188,"Members of Spain’s lower house of Congress saw a surprise in their inboxes, the equivalent of 1 euro in crypto.As reported by Spanish news outfit ABC, the plan is spearheaded by Tutellus, a decentralized platform looking to tokenize education technology, and the Blockchain Observatory. The project aims to promote the use of cryptocurrencies in the country. All 350 members of Spain’s lower house, or the Congress of Deputies, received the equivalent of 1 euro in cryptocurrency in their emails. Miguel Caballero, Tutellus founder, said the goal is to raise awareness about the future role of cryptocurrencies in society:“We have explained to your honorable members that we are in a time of profound change in the use of money, in addition to highlighting the important role that cryptocurrencies have today.”Caballero said the cryptocurrency “is not a donation” and acknowledged that some congress members might be more familiar with crypto. But for those who no experience with cryptocurrencies yet, Caballero said, this is an opportunity to learn more. Spain is not the first country to send cryptocurrencies to lawmakers. The political action committee (PAC) of the Chamber of Digital Commerce sent $50 worth of Bitcoin to all 541 members of Congress in early October, reported Decrypt. Spanish banks have been more interested in cryptocurrencies and blockchain in the past few years. Santander partnered with Ripple for a blockchain-based payments platform while the Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) launched a study to explore zero-knowledge proofs and other cryptographic techniques. The European Central Bank also announced it would look into a digital euro by 2021 and released a report diving into its possible impact on the retail market."
189,"Programmers have found a way to replace the core service offerings of Wall Street and an army of corporate lawyers with 800 lines of smart contract code.The “De” in DeFi stands for “decentralized,” meaning there are no intermediaries in the process. Despite the raw and unpolished user interface, billions of dollars in assets flow through new decentralized apps every day.We’re only at the beginning of the growing DeFi bubble, and there are already tokens worth more than Bitcoin (BTC). Some of these tokens are nothing more than a name, code and smart marketing. There are shrimp, burger, spaghetti and sushi tokens that have reached sky-high values, and many of these meme tokens even have “sequels.” It is madness in excess of the ICO bubble of 2017.Anything that can be tokenized can end up on a DeFi application. The pace of development is intense. Every day, new brilliant projects emerge — DeFi could end up being bigger than the internet one day. Anything is possible now.Peer-to-peer finance has also been operating silently in the background. It offers financial services to people based on real use cases like payments, remittance, wealth preservation and commerce. The people of emerging markets such as Africa and India, for example, seem to benefit most. All DeFi trades are peer-to-peer in nature, as they happen on a blockchain.Imagine a pure DeFi version where we can bridge fiat money like dollars and all the world’s currencies. Why does the world need this? Remember the frictionless onboarding part? It is actually a huge value add-on because over 40% of the emerging world that we serve cannot provide proper Know Your Customer services, as localized KYC solutions are not well integrated or developed. Furthermore, many people have no ID at all, which is another opportunity to provide financial inclusion to more people.There are 1.7 billion people who don’t have access to traditional financial services. If Bitcoin is layer one, then DeFi is layer two, and the “people” layer provided by P2P networks is the third layer. This decentralized, people-powered marketplace for money transfers just needs the frictionless onboarding that decentralization brings.Another huge benefit is the potential for decentralized price discovery. Current decentralized exchanges cannot do this, as they use a price “oracle” from centralized exchanges. However, decentralized people-powered marketplaces could offer a price based on P2P crypto to fiat trades. This can give us the true street price of Bitcoin to the dollar, which is something that would be of enormous value to people in hyperinflationary economies such as Zimbabwe or Venezuela, as people there often have to check many different sources.Additional price discovery models can be built on top of auction model exchange rules. There is a hidden world-changing product to be found here; price discovery of this nature would become the new standard and potentially tip the scales of geopolitical power.Remember that we’re in a bubble, but when it bursts, the next Bitcoin bull run will begin, so prepare yourself. As the world plunges into chaos, just remember that “it’s good to be into crypto,” as crypto is the hedge against the world of finance falling apart. Bitcoin and Ether are rock solid because they now serve as real use cases.DeFi tokens are literally playing with fire, and you might get burned. Those who win this game buy, hold and check the price constantly. Bitcoin will always be the backbone of the crypto economy, and it will grow. And DeFi will finish the job that Bitcoin started.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

190,"Decentralized exchanges have been around for a while now, but it’s only been since the grip of decentralized finance mania has taken hold that they’ve come into their own. The growth in DEX use has been nothing short of exponential, with volumes pretty much doubling in August and September compared with the preceding months.But is volume alone telling the whole story? Amid the DeFi frenzy, some of the biggest winners have been DeFi governance tokens. Kicking off with Compound’s COMP token in June, other projects that followed suit have seen similar patterns. Yam Finance’s YAM, SushSwap’s SUSHI and BurgerSwap’s BURGER have all seen massive popularity at launch, only for their price to start dropping once the initial hype dies off.Given the current data, it’s relatively easy to trace a direct correlation between the meteoric rise of DEX volume and the craze for issuing governance tokens that, so far, have not been able to hold on to their value beyond the initial hype.Cryptocurrency has always borrowed terms and concepts from traditional finance. The idea of an initial coin offering is derived from its traditional cousin, the initial public offering. But while an IPO is a signal of investor confidence in the future of a company, ICOs were a free-for-all, allowing anyone to mint tokens, regardless of whether or not there was any demand that would generate value.With DeFi tokens, there is an already-established product that’s providing some value to market participants. DeFi’s governance tokens offer holders a future stake in the development of the product. In this way, DeFi tokens are more comparable to the concept of an IPO than ICO tokens ever were.However, after the lockup period of an IPO ends, most investors dump their shares on secondary markets, according to findings from financial services firm UBS. This trend doesn’t bode well for any early recipients of DeFi tokens, as they usually HODL. Of course, DeFi is very much in its infancy, so it’s too early to draw any concrete comparisons. COMP, the token that kicked all this off, is only three months old. Omri Ross, chief blockchain scientist at trading platform eToro, believes that DeFi tokens should still be approached with caution:DeFi tokens may show eerie correlations with IPOs, but they buck a bigger trend within crypto markets. With a few exceptions, most coins tend to follow the price movements of Bitcoin (BTC). Currently, DeFi tokens are an anomaly in that respect. While BTC has been trading within a relatively narrow range over the last month or so, DeFi tokens have shown price movements entirely uncorrelated to BTC markets. Curis Wang, co-founder and CEO of Bitrue — an exchange that recently started offering both decentralized and centralized finance options — told Cointelegraph:All of these points raise some intriguing questions about the future direction of DeFi token markets. The concept of the IPO has sustained for decades. Investors still get excited enough to apply for an initial allocation of stocks, even if the numbers indicate they can expect to lose out. However, stock investors can, in some cases, hold their positions for decades. For example, Berkshire Hathaway has held stocks of Coca-Cola and Wells Fargo for over 30 years.In the notoriously fickle world of crypto investing, it seems a stretch to think that any investors would hold onto DeFi tokens for that long, particularly if their value continues to decline. Furthermore, there’s also the question of whether the law of diminishing returns will kick in, which would mean that each new DeFi token entering the market would become progressively less valuable than its predecessors.In a segment that seems to be propelled by hype, it appears to be more than just a possibility. If this does happen, then DeFi tokens may start behaving more like longer-established altcoins. This behavior would see them quickly settling into a place in the token rankings that more accurately reflects their longer-term value and mirrors BTC prices more closely.All of this speculation doesn’t consider the one factor that could kill investor appetite for DeFi tokens entirely: regulation. Despite DeFi’s ambitions toward decentralization, few projects can claim to be truly decentralized. There are teams of people that maintain the underlying codebases, pay for the hosting of app data and take care of the user interfaces.All the DeFi tokens in the world won’t stop the United States Securities and Exchange Commission or the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network from coming after anyone they believe to be responsible for contravening U.S. regulations, if and when the time comes. However, Wang still believes that the time has yet to come and that no regulation will be implemented in the short to medium term:The recent charges against BitMEX have already highlighted the potential dangers crypto companies and platforms may face if discovered to be lacking in Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering checks — DeFi included. Furthermore, CipherTrace has also stated that DeFi could make an attractive haven for money launderers.The fact that funds drained from the recent KuCoin exchange hack have made their way through Uniswap lends further credence to the idea. If the worst-case scenario happens, DeFi could go the way of the ICO, rendering DeFi governance tokens worthless as a result. EToro’s Ross thinks that this issue will eventually slow down the current DeFi craze: “DeFi products will likely face regulatory scrutiny as applications of blockchain technology find increasing adoption amongst a broader community of users.” He added:But for now at least, DeFi tokens offer dizzying returns for yield farmers who continue to make hay while the sun shines. What’s more, the craze shows no immediate signs of dying down, even though token prices are currently declining. However, those who’ve been around long enough to remember the post-ICO freeze of crypto’s long winter would do well to remain cautious of history repeating itself."
191,"Within a few years, a younger generation of financial services customers are going to be able to walk into a bank and gain access to credit products, savings accounts and investments that can host both crypto and fiat assets. In fact, the inroads that will allow for all of this to happen are already breaking ground.You probably already know that Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange based out of San Francisco, is now the first-ever cryptocurrency business in the United States to become a bank. For now, being an officially chartered bank means that Kraken will be able to offer more banking and funding options to existing customers. It also means Kraken Financial is going to be able to operate in multiple jurisdictions without having to deal with state-by-state compliance plans.Kraken is currently working with Silvergate Bank to offer SWIFT and FedWire funding options to U.S. customers. More and more of these kinds of partnerships will become the status quo in the near future. That’s why now is the time for traditional banks that are lagging behind to start paying attention.Silvergate Bank is a step ahead of the rest at the moment. The company boasts 880 digital asset companies as clients. Those clients have deposited more than $1.5 billion with the bank. That’s still a small amount of money relative to the market capitalizations of most major banks or even most major cryptocurrencies for that matter. That said, keep in mind that major crypto exchanges Coinbase and Gemini are now customers of JPMorgan, even though CEO Jamie Dimon routinely denounced the value of Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies just a few short years ago.Consumers will soon define a “full service” bank as one that offers financial services in both crypto and fiat. The time to start acquiring the necessary tools of the crypto banking trade is right now. Banks need to start adapting or get left behind. Make no mistake about it.But what tools do they actually need?A crime scene investigator can use a black light or fingerprint powder to uncover all kinds of evidence. The idea that Bitcoin or blockchains are completely private has been dispelled again and again. In fact, blockchain-based currencies are much more open to investigative methods than fiat currencies. It is certainly possible to uncover the origins of transactions. In order for banks to do that with cryptocurrency, they will need blockchain explorers and risk scoring tools that can go a step further than the current publicly provided services.Those forensics tools already exist, and they allow investigators to follow digital paper trails across addresses, wallets, transactions, blockchains and other digital entities, using techniques like clustering and heuristics. Companies in this space are developing their own proprietary searching algorithms designed to detect the origins of concealed funds and unmask criminals.Remember, traditional fiat is still the currency of choice for money laundering professionals. Cryptocurrency is in its nascent days and will emerge as a powerful force in reducing the money laundering risk around the world.Make no mistake about it, the decentralized finance sector of cryptocurrency holds virtually endless promise. Yield farming may be all the rage, but the DeFi sector is so much more than that.DeFi projects can allow you to take technical and fundamental trading advice from other traders and only pay a fee if you make a profit. You can pour your capital into digital investment portfolios without having to pay mutual fund fees that can eat away at hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of your retirement portfolio. Investors can also hold derivatives of their desired cryptos without having to constantly switch between blockchains. These innovations are just the tip of the iceberg. As the market continues to mature, more and more DeFi projects will allow us to do things in the future that we are not even thinking about right now.There is, however, one fundamental problem with all of this. The average banking customer isn’t going to engage with decentralized finance protocols for decades. Yes, the most avid crypto enthusiast knows enough to dig up the contract address of an ERC-20 token, trade it on decentralized exchanges, and invest that token through lending platforms and liquidity pools.However, the average person is likely still going to want to talk to a banker from time to time, even if they hold most of their wealth in the form of cryptocurrency. Furthermore, governments around the world are working on their own government-backed cryptocurrencies, which the average consumer will definitely want access to at their bank of choice.What will happen if banks don’t join the party?Any bank still approaching cryptocurrency with trepidation over the next 18 months is at risk of finding itself dead in the water at the hands of Kraken and other banks that jump on board and take the plunge.Now is the time for traditional fiat banks to engage in empowering the individual with greater access to crypto. If they don’t, they will be swept away by the rising tide of cryptocurrencies ripe to reinvent the world’s financial system one way or another.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

194,"The latest Bloomberg crypto newsletter contends that the election of Joe Biden as president of the United States would bring greater mainstream adoption of Bitcoin (BTC), including a potential exchange-traded fund approval. Further, it referred to the policies of President Donald Trump's administration with regard to crypto as “hands-off”:Considering that yesterday the Department of Justice published its 70-page ""Cryptocurrency: An Enforcement Framework,"" the newsletter likely was written prior to that.The author purports that the same forces would hamper DeFi's growth. Both conclusions are based on the assumption that a “Democratic sweep” would potentially enable greater regulatory clarity for the crypto space. The DeFi space has exploded this year in a completely unregulated environment. It is no coincidence that the perpetrators behind the KuCoin hack have been laundering their illicit proceeds through the biggest decentralized exchange, Uniswap.Bloomberg asserts that regardless of the election's outcome, “Bitcoin's price will keep going up no matter who's elected president, but at a moderating pace.” It also concludes that if Bitcoin’s price continues to grow during the next presidential term at even half of the pace it enjoyed from 2016 to 2020, it would reach $80,000 by 2024:Yesterday, Square made an announcement that it acquired $50 million worth of Bitcoin, signifying the increased adoption of the asset by the corporate sector."
195,"Within the last few hours, Bitcoin (BTC) price surpassed $11,000 in a swift turnaround from its swing low at $10,500 in early October. Analysts have attributed three major factors to BTC’s abrupt trend reversal.The potential catalysts are whale accumulation, a spike in institutional demand and the strength of the $10,500 support.Whales are either accumulating or refusing to sellEarlier this week, Cointelegraph reported that activity within whale clusters pointed to strong buying demand from Bitcoin and Ethereum whales. In the cryptocurrency market, individual investors who hold immense amounts of Bitcoin are considered whales.Data from Whalemap shows that whales have likely been buying Bitcoin from $10,370 onwards, and on Oct. 8, the analysts said that the $10,570 support held. This indicates that whales bought substantial amounts of Bitcoin in the $10,407 and $10,570 range.Since whales typically account for a large portion of the buying demand and selling pressure in the Bitcoin market, whale accumulation is a significant catalyst.Institutional demand is rising due to high-profile bulk Bitcoin investmentsIn the past two months alone, two multibillion-dollar conglomerates made public bulk purchases of Bitcoin.First, MicroStrategy disclosed that it had bought $250 million worth of Bitcoin on Aug. 11. Then it followed up with another statement revealing that it purchased an additional $175 million worth BTC.Following MicroStrategy’s announcement, the $81-billion payments firm Square said it bought $50 million worth of BTC.According to Peter Brandt, a veteran market analyst, the daily and weekly Bitcoin charts point at a “big buy signal” after Square’s investment.Brandt emphasized that a major corporation investing in Bitcoin is a highly significant event for BTC. He noted:The daily volume on institution-tailored Bitcoin exchanges, including LMAX Digital and Bakkt, has continuously surged since August.On top of favorable fundamental factors such as whale accumulation and a rising hash rate, the growth in institutional appetite for BTC is adding extra energy to the momentum seen in Bitcoin's price.The $10,500 support continues to holdThe $10,500 area has been a crucial support level for Bitcoin over the past three months. It has significant historical relevance and has acted as a pivotal level for short-term price cycles.Technically, holding the $10,500 support level is crucial in sustaining a Bitcoin uptrend. The level represents the July 2019 peak, and it indicates that BTC is using its previous peak to continue recovering to new highs.Ki Young Ju, CEO of on-chain analytics provider CryptoQuant, said that exchanges' netflow has declined to a one-year-low.Typically, sellers deposit Bitcoin on exchanges in order to sell the dominant cryptocurrency. Hence, when there is a lacking reserve of BTC on trading platforms, it means lower selling pressure.He said:The confluence of declining sell pressure, rising institutional demand and the favorable technical structure suggest that Bitcoin may have some success in flipping $11,000 from resistance to support."
196,"As the 2020 U.S. presidential election draws near, two crypto traders on Twitter shared their predictions for how Bitcoin's price could react to the event. ""If we have a clear winner and an easy transition of power, I do not see much of an impact on the price per coin,"" trader ""BigCheds"" told Cointelegraph. ""On the other hand, if we have a close and/or contested election, we should see a bounce in risk-off assets like gold and Bitcoin.""The election is a summation of 2020's wild year, with a number of other factors also remaining at play. ""This election year is certainly different considering what we have seen in the past due to the pandemic and the global economy taking a toll,"" Twitter trader ""CryptoWendyO"" told Cointelegraph. ""With an event like Covid, one would assume that Bitcoin would pump due to financial market uncertainty, however we are not seeing that,"" she said. Crypto Twitter has been filled with political talk in the weeks leading to November's presidential election. The event arrives at the tail end of a year featuring pandemic scares, business shutdowns and economic troubles.  ""Tensions are high especially with the election,"" WendyO said. ""Markets need money coming in to flourish and I’m not certain that will happen right now as the middle class is holding on to their capital,"" she added. Government stimulus money plays into the equation as well, with the current administration failing to reach a decision on further economic support. Mainstream markets and crypto both reacted to news that the president had decided to delay further stimulus talks until the election is over.""After the election as we will get more of an idea when the economy will open up I believe we will see a change in Bitcoin price and I'm hoping it's bullish but we must pay attention to current price action as well,"" WendyO explained, subsequently pointing out Bitcoin's struggle to decisively break and hold above weekly chart resistance levels.In the short term, Bitcoin's price recently broke back above $11,000, shining a ray of optimism.

197,"John McAfee’s recent detention in Spain caps off a few weeks where crypto news feeds have been dusted with reports of regulator enforcement actions and bans, arrests, and an exchange hack.Crypto news hasn’t looked like this in a while. The terrain of the crypto sector may once have been blighted by exit scams and cowboys, but the post-BlockFi, post-Grayscale crypto landscape is an entirely different beast.Does the recent spate of stories related to crime and legal proceedings suggest that the sector is being mopped up for a brighter future? Are regulators only now catching up? Or does it suggest that no matter how much it matures, the smell of money about crypto will always prove tempting for bad actors?After a year of deliberations, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority found crypto derivative products to be “ill-suited for retail consumers due to the harm they pose.” The sale of crypto derivatives and exchange-traded notes, or ETNs, to retail investors in or from the U.K. will be banned starting early next year.The announcement came Tuesday, the same day McAfee was detained at a Spanish airport. He now awaits deportation to the United States to face charges that carry a 30-year prison sentence.Only days ago, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed a civil enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against BitMEX and its owners. It alleged the unregistered trading platform violated a number of CFTC regulations, including failure to implement Anti-Money Laundering processes.The Department of Justice is pursuing BitMEX’s CEO, Arthur Hayes, as well as co-founders Ben Delo and Samuel Reed.In the regulator’s release, CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert fired a shot across the bow of the industry:Related: Indictments issued for BitMEX senior team are a signal to allThe Securities and Exchange Commission finally prevailed in its court battle with Canadian messaging platform Kik. The regulator filed a complaint against the company over its $100 million 2017 token sale, arguing it violated securities laws. On Sept. 30, a judge agreed. The two sides have until Oct. 20 to propose a judgment.Related: SEC versus Kik: SAFTs are far from safeNews of the hack of Singaporean exchange KuCoin at the end of September, to the tune of $200 million, kicked off the end-of-third-quarter news cycle. Exchange security lapses have not been as prominent this year as last, when 12 major hacks occurred, with around $300 million worth of digital assets stolen.2019, in fact, was the worst year so far for security breaches, kicked off by the Jan. 14 breach of Cryptopia. 2018 saw nine. They have ceased to become a prominent feature of crypto news in 2020, presumably because the less-secure exchanges have already been hacked into liquidation and security practices are broadly improving.End-of-financial-quarter crypto reporting tends to be anchored around Grayscale quarterly results, Bitcoin’s (BTC) price activity and, this year, the momentum in decentralized finance. Protocol exploits and food-meme tokens aside, DeFi is growing at warp speed and promises to usher in one of crypto’s most pressing use cases: banking the unbanked.(In fact, the pace of growth in DeFi is partly a product of significant levels of innovation that have manifested in envelope-pushing protocol names and practices.)This news cycle has been reminiscent of 2017 to 2018 when scammy initial coin offerings scarred the markets and crypto crime was considered almost a necessary concession to make in the name of eventual maturity.It has been a long time since crypto was pounded by news of legal action, bans and exchange hacks. Perhaps what we are seeing is law enforcement and regulatory agencies bringing the ICO era to a final whimper.The end of the legal drama around the sale of Kik’s Kin token came the same day as Salt Lending agreed to a settlement with the SEC over its own $47 million sale in 2017.If the curtains are finally closing on the ICO era, it is at least ironic timing that one of its loudest proponents, McAfee, is facing charges of his own. McAfee is, of course, innocent until proven guilty. But the fate of ICOs appears certain now. The Howey Test may be outdated, but it is the law.The apparent proximity of the timing of all these activities may have some pointing to a conspiracy among law enforcement agencies and financial regulators to clean crypto up for either a brighter future or to try to wrest control.Conspiracy theorists need to first prove conspiracies are possible before proving they happen. A logical flaw in the belief in conspiracies is that they often require capabilities that don’t exist. Human incompetence tends to get in the way.Although there is a disturbing sense of coordination about the number of things that came to a head all at once, the legal endeavors have more likely reached their conclusions naturally, without any effort to create a sense in the sector that the authorities are closing in. Many of these proceedings and investigations have been ongoing for a number of months.What the events of the past few weeks have taught us is that crypto cannot live sustainably outside the reach of the law. Our rules may be antiquated and broken. Over time, they will change. Over time, crypto will also change.Although 2019 was a record year for exchange hacks, it seemed to also usher in a sense of maturity, which has largely carried over through 2020. DeFi may be frothy, but it seems to have landed on an important function for blockchain technology.Hopefully, regulators are coming to terms with how the industry works and putting to bed some of the nefarious activity that has plagued the sector since 2017.We may be seeing the last wag of the tail of old crypto. Hopefully, the tail won’t wag the dog.Either way, we are talking about hacks and crime again. It all feels very 2018.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
198,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a recovery during the past week, surging by nearly 6.5% since Oct. 2. The resilience of the dominant cryptocurrency has traders pleasantly surprised, as many analysts anticipated a larger pullback. Following BTC’s rebound above the critical $10,500 support level to just over $11,000, the sentiment is turning optimistic.In the near term, traders believe $10,500 remains the most critical level for Bitcoin for numerous reasons. Most notably, it represents a historically important support level in both the ongoing cycle and previous price cycles. Throughout 2019, BTC consistently peaked at $10,500 and saw brutal rejection afterwards. Given that the $10,500 level has served as a heavy resistance area in the past, it is considered a strong support level.Whale clusters or bubbles also show that defending $10,500 is key for Bitcoin to retain its momentum. Whale clusters, tracked by researchers at Whalemap, form when whales buy Bitcoin at a certain level. Recently, whale clusters have emerged in the $10,407 to $10,570 range, which means whales are likely accumulating. Since whales tend to trade with a longer time frame, there is a decent probability that the $10,570 area will remain as a strong support level.In the medium term, traders foresee $13,000 as the main hurdle before Bitcoin sees a prolonged rally. According to the pseudonymous trader known as “Salsa Tekila,” previous macro price trends indicate $13,000 is the roadblock to an all-time high. If BTC continues to stabilize and consolidate above key support levels, the trader said a rally to a new record-high could occur in the longer term.Whether Bitcoin can stay above $10,500 and eventually break out at $11,000 to test $13,000 remains the biggest challenge. Between the first five days of October, various negative macro factors slowed the momentum of BTC. Since then, particularly following Square’s high-profile investment into Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency has recovered. In the fourth quarter, the bullish scenario hinges on BTC’s strength above $10,500 and whether it can surge past $11,000.In the first week of October, Bitcoin faced several threats that could have evolved into potential black swan events. On Oct. 1, the United States Commodities and Futures Trading Commission and the Department of Justice charged BitMEX and its executives. They alleged that BitMEX violated the Bank Secrecy Act, arresting BitMEX chief technical officer Samuel Reed in Massachusetts. After the DoJ publicly released a statement on the arrest, Bitcoin fell by 5% in the following 48 hours.Then, on Oct. 2, U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed on Twitter that he had contracted COVID-19. The news quickly rattled financial markets, causing equities to slump and Bitcoin to pull back in tandem. In the span of two days, BTC faced two unexpected macro events that considerably slowed its momentum as it hovered above $10,900. Had the two events not occurred, a retest of the $11,000 resistance level would have been likely.Now a week later, Bitcoin has recovered above its price level at which the BitMEX and Trump news came to light. The resilience of BTC against two events that could have potentially caused the markets to further plummet is encouraging.There are several key factors that aided the recovery of Bitcoin from the initial drop below $10,500. First, the U.S. dollar has declined in the past 14 days, indirectly causing BTC and gold to rally. Second, the news around Square’s $50 million Bitcoin purchase lifted the overall sentiment. Third, some analysts state that BTC was bullish before the Square news happened, with a favorable technical structure.When major decentralized finance tokens plunged, it led to nervousness in the market. According to “Light,” a pseudonymous options and futures trader, the short-term recovery of BTC is positive. In the near term, the trader suggested that an uptrend is more likely than a breakdown. “Bitcoin $BTC was already bullish before the Square news with no supply selling bottom of this trendline even as $YFI tried to kamikaze the whole market. Obvious what comes next.”Compared to MicroStrategy’s $425 million bulk BTC purchase, the $50 million investment is nowhere large enough to solely cause Bitcoin to soar. While Square is an $81 billion conglomerate and $50 million is a decent-size investment, it is not a major bet, although the implications were deemed substantial. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Denis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto exchange and broker Bequant, said the CFTC’s action against BitMEX is also a positive long-term development for Bitcoin:Based on the recent trend of BTC, its pullback in October, and subsequent recovery, traders remain neutral and optimistic. The majority are not largely bearish in the short to medium term due to the strength of the $10,500 support level. If the support breaks down, then the sentiment could change, but it has held up well so far.Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and Cointelegraph contributor, said that Bitcoin should first break the $11,000 to $11,200 resistance range, after which “acceleration” could occur. But there is also a possibility that BTC would see a low-volatility range between $10,500 to $11,200 in the foreseeable future.Van de Poppe also emphasized that Bitcoin is likely in the early phase where smart money and institutions are beginning to enter. Square and MicroStrategy’s bold investments in BTC could lead to an improved perception of BTC as a store of value; at the latest, it’s a bullish sign in the long term for van de Poppe: “The market is in the early stages of Smart Money and Institutional Investors, as MicroStrategy and Square opt-out of the U.S. Dollar and opt-in on $BTC. Very bullish long term.”Citing the realized volatility of BTC, which recently crashed to 20% for the seventh time in five years, other traders said a volatility spike is expected. Historically, when that has happened, the volatility of BTC spiked to 80% in the several months following. Given the likely upsurge of volatility in the near term, cryptocurrency trader Cantering Clark believes a major price movement is expected: “I think that given this prolonged state of compression that we get a big move before the weekend for $BTC. Either direction, I doubt we get some cookie-cutter retest.”In the short term, traders expect BTC to successfully retest the $11,000 resistance level and range between $10,500 to $11,000. In the medium term, analysts expect a potential breakout above $11,000, which could establish a broader range between $11,000 and $13,000 in the longer term, with the latter being the major roadblock to an all-time high. The confluence of a favorable technical structure, strong fundamentals as seen in Bitcoin’s hashrate, and growing institutional demand indicates that the general market sentiment remains positive."
199,"Gold will gain regardless of whether Donald Trump or Joe Biden wins the election, one analyst says as Bitcoin (BTC) targets $11,000.In an interview with the media division of precious metals giant Kitco on Oct. 7, Frank Holmes, CEO of U.S. Global Investors, said that he was “betting on gold” for bullishness by the end of the year.“It’s love season. It’s the seasonality of two wedding seasons in India, it’s the season of lights of Diwali, then we have Christmas, and it peaks for Chinese New Year,” he told the network. Gold, like Bitcoin, saw highs in August before a fall which came in line with renewed strength in the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY). The outcome of November’s U.S. election has the potential to influence USD standing considerably, but Holmes believes gold will shake off the result.“Some are betting on blue, some betting on red, and I’m betting on gold,” he added.As Cointelegraph reported, gold bug Peter Schiff has also painted a less-than-optimistic outlook for the dollar, arguing that a Biden win would be the worst case scenario.Holmes confirmed that he was eyeing a $4,000 price target for XAU/USD.Bitcoin has seen inverse correlation with DXY, which has managed to claw back its losses from earlier this summer. Sideways trading has mimicked the lack of progress in gold, with $11,000 remaining out of reach so far in October.News that payments giant Square had followed MicroStrategy in buying a large amount of BTC buoyed markets on Thursday, with BTC/USD nonetheless encountering resistance at $10,940 — the site of previous rejection late last month.For analysts, however, the move is a conspicuous sign of good things to come.“It is a major development that a global corporation is now putting $BTC onto its balance sheet,” veteran trader Peter Brandt responded on Twitter. Discussing Square, Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe warned that “dashes” of short-term bullish behavior may remain just that — unless Bitcoin can definitively overcome $11,000 resistance."
200,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is nearing $11,000 once again after a shaky start to October. Last week BTC fell below $10,500 but on Oct. 9 the price swifty recovered to $10,940.In the short term, there are three factors that could enhance bullish sentiment and push the price above $11,000. The possible catalysts are Square’s $50 million investment in Bitcoin, a prolonged accumulation phase, and the recent spike in on-chain activity.Square’s $50 million Bitcoin investment is symbolicOn Oct. 8, Square, an $81 billion payments conglomerate, announced that it had purchased $50 million worth of Bitcoin which represents 1% of the company’s total assets.In an official statement, Square’s chief financial officer Amrita Ahuja said the Bitcoin investment is a step toward financial inclusion. Ahuja said:A $50 million investment for a company the size of Square is not a major allocation but it does symbolize the rising institutional demand institutions have for Bitcoin as an investment vehicle and a store of value.The announcement comes merely a month after MicroStrategy, a Nasdaq-listed billion-dollar firm, bought $425 million worth of Bitcoin.Mohit Sorout, a partner at Bitazu Capital, pinpointed the positive market movement of Bitcoin despite negative events in early October. He noted:A prolonged accumulation phase is materializingBitcoin has been ranging in between $10,500 and $11,000 for most of the past month. As Cointelegraph reported, when BTC’s volatility sharply drops in an extended period, it makes a large price movement likely.The Bollinger Bands, an indicator which establishes the price range of an asset based on its volatility, have also narrowed significantly. The 30-day volatility is now at 20%, which historically was only hit 7 times in the past five years.Various technical indicators indicate that an upsurge in volatility is probable after a prolonged range. It also raises the probability of an accumulation phase forming, given that BTC has protected the $10,500 support level.BTC on-chain activity is risingAccording to on-chain analyst Cole Garner, the number of daily active addresses has spiked in recent weeks. Garner attributed it to a potential increase in demand from investors in China, after the state media’s positive crypto report.In addition to the Bitcoin blockchain network activity, the hashrate is continuously increasing to new highs. This suggests that miners are confident in the medium-term price trend of BTC. Researchers at glassnode further explained that:"
201,"Lightning network node operators running LND versions prior to the Oct. 1 version 0.11 upgrade have been urged to upgrade immediately after a vulnerability was discovered affecting LND versions 0.10 and below.The vulnerability was made public in an Oct. 9 announcement from Lightning engineer Conner Fromknecht, head of cryptographic engineering at Lightning Labs. Fromknecht said:Few details have been revealed so far, with Fromknecht assuring that the vulnerabilities will be disclosed in full on Oct. 20.This is not the first time a vulnerability has been discovered in the Lightning network. Last year, Lightning Labs CTO, Olaoluwa Osuntokun, confirmed instances of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) “being exploited in the wild.”Earlier this year, researchers warned about the privacy vulnerabilities in the Lightning network that could expose financial information of Bitcoin transactions that were believed to be anonymous.Currently, Lightning Labs, Blockstream, and ACINQ are the three major teams working on the development of the Lightning network."
202,"A report authored by the research team of ByteTree purports to debunk one of the most popular Bitcoin (BTC) valuation models — Stock-to-Flow. The model provides a very optimistic forecast for Bitcoin, claiming that a year from now we should see price levels above $100,000.BytTree’s co-founder and chief investment officer, Charlie Morris, dedicates the entire fourth chapter of the report to “debunking” it. The stock-to-flow models have been applied for decades to forecast the price of commodities like gold and silver. Stock is the existing supply of the asset and flow is the additional new supply that is being generated. Applied to Bitcoin, it hinges on the fact that its inflation or flow will be getting progressively smaller, while the stock-to-flow ratio will be getting progressively higher. Thus, producing “sky is the limit” forecasts for the price.Morris contends that the Bitcoin price is not dictated by the supply-side economics at all. In an economy, he argues, the market adjusts on both sides: supply and demand until the new equilibrium is reached. Since Bitcoin’s supply is fixed, it is left to the demand side of the equation to determine the price, he concludes.Morris believes that another problem with the model is that it overemphasizes newly-mined coins as if they were the only ones available for sale, “but anyone who owns Bitcoin is free to sell.” He also points out that the network's dynamics have changed:Further, he suggests the role of the Bitcoin miners has diminished over time as indicated by the decrease in the ratio of their revenues to market capitalization:He acknowledges that miners still play an important role as the network's maintainers “but their economic footprint is diminishing”. Morris provides another criticism of the model — it does not take into account the actual usage and adoption of Bitcoin, which he believes is the network’s intrinsic value:It's worth noting that the price has lagged behind the level forecast by the model in the months since Bitcoin's third block halving."
203,"Despite an uneventful month for Bitcoin (BTC) price, on-chain metrics suggest that Bitcoin may be gearing for an imminent bull run. Noticeably, the number of Bitcoin held on spot exchanges has been decreasing since the start of the year, according to data from on-chain analytics firms, CryptoQuant, and glassnode.Crypto analyst, Willy Woo, noted that this change in trend is extremely bullish for Bitcoin as it signals an increased demand for the asset and interest in holding it as a store of value. Woo tweeted:While a decreasing number of coins held by spot exchanges can also point to an exodus into derivatives exchanges, flows from the former to the latter have also been decreasing according to data from CryptoQuant.The flow from derivatives exchanges to spot exchanges and hard wallets could possibly be exacerbated by the recent CFTC and DOJ legal action taken against BitMEX exchange. The current accumulation resembles 2017The trend in coins held by spot exchanges started to change in the beginning of 2020 and it paints a familiar picture for traders. The dip resembles the accumulation stage of late 2016 which in turn fueled the 2017 bull market that saw Bitcoin price reach its all-time high of $20,089. Both stages have followed noteworthy events like the prospect of a Bitcoin ETF led by the Winklevoss twins in 2017 and the recent buying frenzy by business intelligence giant MicroStrategy. According to Woo, the market has failed to react to these on-chain indicators. He tweeted: The DeFi slump makes way for BitcoinA depleting reserve of BTC on exchanges is a bullish sign for Bitcoin from a macro perspective. However, some suggest the changing trend may be caused by the growing popularity of DeFi and other liquidity related protocols that have created a demand for tokenized Bitcoin and the liquidity that comes with the asset.This would still paint a positive picture for Bitcoin as it shows users prefer to receive interest for holding BTC than to take profit. While there is nearly $1 billion worth of Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain through WBTC alone, the tokenized version of Bitcoin only started gaining traction in late June 2020.Moreover, it also seems like the growth of DeFi has been stunted. Token prices have been plummeting and the total value locked in DeFi protocols continues to drop across the sector and also in the tokenized versions of Bitcoin.The current reduction in interested DeFi participants has led many analysts to infer that a possible cycling of DeFi and altcoin profits to Bitcoin is underway. If so, this suggests that Bitcoin is preparing for another bull run, especially as new participants continue to join the network."
204,"The number of Institutional investors stepping in to Bitcoin continues to increase and this appears to be inspiring some newfound confidence in Bitcoin price. Just today Square announced that it had purchased 4,709 Bitcoin (BTC) for $50 million.Square is not the only large company to take this action. Recently, MicroStrategy made waves for also announcing a significant purchase of Bitcoin.These news events could be a signal to investors that a new cycle is starting up and bigger parties are showing significant interest in Bitcoin.

That was the period after the halving, which caused a lot of sideways action in Bitcoin price for weeks.However, as bullish news enters the markets, some short term hype can be established in Bitcoin price action. A breakout out of the currenty triangle would be bullish for Bitcoin, but investors should be cautious.BTC/USDT 3-hour chart. Source: TradingViewAs the trendline is holding for Bitcoin, a breakout to the upside occurred. This caused the price of Bitcoin to break through the crucial triangle; however, that’s not the most crucial pivot to watch for.Investors should watch to see whether the previous support area between $11,100-$11,300 can break. If that area breaks and flips for support, further upwards momentum is warranted.Such a breakout would cause altcoins to show strength as well, as they’ve been hammered heavily in the previous weeks.

This makes the $11,100-$11,300 area is a critical zone for continuation.If this level cannot break and the trendline is lost, a likely retest of $10,000 is on the cards again.Until then, a dash of short term bullishness is all market participants can expect.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

205,"In a surprise move, Square announced the acquisition of 4,709 Bitcoin (BTC) worth roughly $50 million at time of publication. The company’s co-founder Jack Dorsey has been a long-term proponent of Bitcoin and crypto, while the company’s CashApp allows its users to invest in Bitcoin.This news comes months after another publicly traded company, MicroStrategy, decided to convert a portion of its treasury into Bitcoin. Currently, the company holds 38,250 BTC and its CEO Michael Saylor has become one of the most vocal Bitcoin advocates. Though MicroStrategy is a large company in its own right with a $1.5 billion market capitalization, it pales in comparison to Square, which holds an $81 billion capitalization.Square's accompanying press release indicated that the move is something of an ideological statement:On September 30, Dorsey chastised Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong for his apolitical leadership:#Bitcoin (aka “crypto”) is direct activism against an unverifiable and exclusionary financial system which negatively affects so much of our society. Important to at *least* acknowledge and connect the related societal issues your customers face daily. This leaves people behind: https://t.co/0LMlF1qcmGThe press release noted the investment represents approximately 1% of Square’s “assets as of the end of the second quarter of 2020.” As of June 30, the company’s total assets amounted to $7.8 billion, so the acquisition may represent closer to 0.64% of the company's assets."

The current TVL of tokenized Bitcoin is nearly $1.5 billion, of which WBTC currently represents one-third.Wrapped Bitcoin is now the fifth-largest DeFi protocol in terms of TVL, representing nearly 10% of the entire sector’s locked capital. WBTC’s TVL pushed above $100 million for the first time around July 8.Wrapped Bitcoin lets users lock up BTC in exchange for WBTC — an ERC-20 token pegged to Bitcoin — which allows BTC holders to access the diverse Ethereum-powered decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem using it as collateral.In the first half of 2020, WBTC’s TVL grew from $4 million to $36 million, demonstrating the extreme surge in demand for DeFi during the third quarter.The DeFi bubble has also benefited other Bitcoin tokenization protocols, with Ren’s (REN) VM locking up more than $300 million worth of BTC since launching at the end of May.The price of REN has increased by roughly 180% over the same period, with the token bouncing 14% over the past 24 hours after listing on Coinbase.Not all tokenization protocols have enjoyed sustained success, with PieDAO’s TVL recently retracing to May’s sub-$1 million levels after briefly spiking in July.The A16z-backed Keep Network has also missed out on the spoils of the recent DeFi frenzy, with the embattled tBTC protocol coming under fire recently for liquidating Ether belonging to all users in a group who see a single signer go offline."

While attempting to flee empty-handed they backed their white GMC Sierra pick-up truck into L&D Meats and Deli and smashed its front wall.The chance they’ll be caught seems quite high, as local police noted that the thieves managed to leave their tailgate behind.

Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a strong $10.9K rejection and a quick $10.2K bottom over the past week.The whipsaw price action has been the norm over the past three weeks and is quite gruesome for the bulls and bears. Regardless of the reason behind these moves, the recent newsflow of negative crypto events has clearly spooked investors.In the last two weeks KuCoin was hacked for $150 million, BitMEX was charged with multiple legal violations, John McAfee's was arrested, and the UK's  top financial watchdog decided to issue a ban on crypto derivatives exchanges.

There were hardly any weeks where the price action diverged between both markets. The few exceptions that do exist were in the first week of September and over the course of the past six days.To further understand if this divergence is caused by the growing interest in cryptocurrency or the lack of it, traders should check traded volume.BTC 7-day average volume.

This is clear evidence of investors' interest, at least at the current levels.One should not automatically conclude that traders are bearish exclusively due to volume metrics. For this situation to occur, both buyers and sellers must be unwilling to trade at the current price range.Excessive leverage from either side will be reflected in the funding rate. This happens due to each perpetual futures contract having embedded margin usage fees.Funding rates are usually changed every 8 hours to ensure there are no exchange risk imbalance and even though the open interest from both buyers and sellers are matched at all times, leverage can vary.If buyers are using more leverage than sellers, the funding rate will be positive, and buyers will pay. The opposite occurs when future contracts sellers are the ones demanding more margin.Bitcoin perpetual swaps 8-hour funding rate. Source: SkewAfter a brief spike early-September, the funding rate has been either flat or slightly negative. A negative 0.05% 8-hour rate equals to 1% per week and although reasonably high, not enough to pressure traders to close their positions. This doesn't necessarily translate to bearish investors, but it does signal that futures contracts sellers are the ones using more leverage.Exchange-provided data highlights traders' long-to-short net positioning. By analyzing every client's position on the spot, perpetual and futures contracts, one can obtain a clearer view on whether professional traders are leaning bullish or bearish.

Binance top traders BTC long/short ratio. Source: BinanceAlthough top traders at Binance haven't entered a net short position, they were 10% net long on Sept.13 and have kept a similar level ever since. As previously mentioned, exchanges have different methodologies for the longs-to-short index, and clients might hold more extensive (or smaller) BTC deposits there for various reasons.Both lackluster volumes and a slightly negative funding rate indicate a lack of interest among buyers at the current levels. Meanwhile, top traders and net position data show the lowest long-to-short ratio in 10 weeks.Even though this neutral to bearish stance has been kept since mid-September, the recent price action was not enough to produce bullish bets. The current scenario is likely to resolve with either a short squeeze once BTC breaks $11,500, or it could amplify a downturn if bears manage to wrest control of Bitcoin’s price and momentum.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

If the RSI breaks and sustains above the triangle, it will signal a possible breakout in the price above $11,200. Conversely, if the RSI breaks and sustains below the symmetrical triangle, it will increase the likelihood of a retest of the critical support at $9,835.Ether (ETH) again turned down from the middle band, which is the 20-day simple moving average.

The Bollinger Band is a widely utilized technical indicator that evaluates the volatility trend of an asset. It might signify that a huge volatility spike is imminent.The price of Bitcoin has been relatively stable from 2019 to 2020. BTC mostly ranged in between $6,000 and $12,000, apart from March when it plummeted below $3,600.The monthly Bitcoin price chart with Bollinger Band. Source: TradingView.com, Nunya BizinzIn the months to come, the volatility of Bitcoin could gradually increase if a similar pattern ensues as 2016.The Bollinger Band uses the moving average of an asset’s chart to determine a volatility range.For instance, when BTC becomes more volatile, the Bollinger Band widens, indicating a bigger price range is forming. If BTC becomes less volatile, the band narrows, suggesting a small range.The primary reason why a narrow Bollinger Band indicates a volatility spike is likely because it means the range is getting tighter.If Bitcoin drops or increases within a tight range, the possibility of breaking down or upwards from the range increases.As an example, it would be challenging for BTC to break out from a $9,000 to $12,000 range. The price range is broad and it would take significant buying demand or selling pressure for the range to break.In contrast, if the range is from $10,000 to $11,000, the probability of the range breaking down or upwards rises. According to Bitcoin trader Nunya Bizniz, the Bollinger Band for the monthly chart of Bitcoin has never been narrower.The monthly chart covers until 2013 when there was not a proper exchange market in place. Hence, it essentially covers most of BTC’s historical price cycles.The Bollinger Band width is reaching an unprecedented area that BTC has not seen before.

I haven't been this bullish on short term price appreciation for #Bitcoin since 2015.A later tweet added a caveat that BTC/USD could still drop to $5,000 and never reach $100,000.Price expectations remain subdued this month thanks to Bitcoin’s continued correlation to macro markets, notably indices such as the S&P 500 and gold. United States President Donald Trump’s recent brush with coronavirus served to underscore the relationship, with BTC/USD dropping from just under $11,000 to lows of $10,390.

217,"Back and forth discussions with regard to a second stimulus package for the people of the United States have been ongoing for months. Today, President Trump decided to push the matter back until after the 2020 presidential elections have concluded.

""Nancy Pelosi is asking for $2.4 Trillion Dollars to bailout poorly run, high crime, Democrat States, money that is in no way related to COVID-19,"" Trump said in an Oct. 6 tweet thread.No further stimulus package talk will occur prior to the election, the president said in subsequent tweets, while boldly forecasting victory. ""Immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business,"" he posted. Following these tweets, the market responded in disapproval. Stocks fell noticeably, while Bitcoin dropped approximately $200 before bouncing slightly, holding a press time price of  $10,577. Bitcoin's drop seems to suggest that the asset's price continues to react in tandem with mainstream markets, at least with regard to major fiscal news.

The build-up of a bull cycle takes a substantial amount of time before the climax can occur. Regardless, the total market capitalization was rejected at the $380 billion resistance level. A retest of the $255-$280 billion areas is a very likely scenario, which would lead to a confirmation of the 100-week and 200-week moving averages as well.BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe price of Bitcoin is still acting below resistance and losing momentum as the volume drains away. Given that the trend is down since $12,400, it’s more than likely to expect a breakdown. That would mean a rejection of the $11,200-$11,400 area. However, if the price of Bitcoin is able to crack this resistance, new highs are on the horizon as the major bullish pivot is broken. In the case of a rejection, the most likely support levels to watch are found in the $9,500-$9,800 and $8,800-$9,100 regions. If a further correction happens towards these regions, it’s likely to anticipate that the correction is over. Once this is the case, 2021 could be a very bullish year for the entire cryptocurrency market.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

219,"According to Cole Garner, a well-respected on-chain analyst, there is a 2,800 BTC sell wall on Binance. With Bitcoin (BTC) price currently trading at $10,700, this is equivalent to a batch of sell orders worth $30 million on just one exchange.While it does not necessarily indicate that a market-wide pullback is imminent, it hints that a major rally remains unlikely. In the short term, BTC likely faces a low-volatility range between $10,500 and $11,000, two key support and resistance levels.BTC/USD chart showing a 2,800 sell wall at Binance. Source: Cole Garner, TradingLiteIn the past two years, Bitcoin recorded net negative returns in the fourth quarter. Some attribute this to cyclical movements while others suggest it is purely coincidental.As Bitcoin heads into the fourth quarter there are several macro risks that could slow down its momentum. These factors include a highly contentious presidential election, a pandemic-induced economic slump, and the struggle of U.S. stocks.Atop the negative fundamental factors that could apply pressure on BTC, technicals suggest the probability of a breakout remains low.For instance, the massive sell wall on Binance is one of many technical reasons that a volatility spike is unlikely and possibly why Bitcoin price has been unable to push through the resistance level at $11,000.A few positives are, Bitcoin has also vigorously defended the $10,500 support level in the past week and the digital asset’s technical structure and sentiment are not bearish. Rather, they are neutral and point toward an accumulation phase.Based on the recent Bitcoin price trend and the large Binance sell wall, Garner emphasized that reaccumulation might occur. He said:“Binance with a 2800 BTC sellwall at $11k. Unstoppable force meets the immovable object. Welcome to re-accumulation.”Although technical factors might cause BTC to trade sideways between $10,500 and $11,000, industry executives say Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain overwhelmingly positive.Rafael Schultze-Kraft, the chief technical officer at glassnode, said Bitcoin has “massive room to grow.”Bitcoin Market Cap to Thermocap Ratio.

Current levels are a whole order of magnitude away from previous $BTC tops.”"
220,"Bitcoin still beats gold as an investment in 2020 despite the precious metal generating its biggest returns in a decade.In a knock to gold bugs, data shows that despite gold’s run this year, Bitcoin (BTC) still trumps every macro asset when it comes to investment profits.Fresh off its second-best quarterly close on record, Bitcoin is up almost 50% in 2020, while gold has managed just half of that at 25.6%.The S&P 500, an index with which Bitcoin has shown considerable correlation, is just 5.5% higher than at the start of January.

Prior to the end of 2017, when BTC/USD began consolidating after reaching all-time highs of $20,000, the differences are much more palpable. $1 invested five years ago is now worth $44.43, while $1 of gold is worth $1.67, according to Woo’s figures.As Cointelegraph reported, Woo has stated that he believes Bitcoin will soon decouple from gold and other traditional markets to carve out a price trajectory of its own.The cryptocurrency has weathered criticism from gold bugs as much as ever during 2020’s market volatility, with serial gold bug Peter Schiff among its most vocal naysayers. Schiff has toned down his skepticism in recent weeks, focusing on the U.S. dollar and the state of the country’s economic debt.U.S. total debt has now passed $27 trillion for the first time in history, according to the U.S. National Debt Clock.“The National Debt just past $27 trillion, up about $7 trillion since Trump took office.

221,"China may be behind a large spike in new Bitcoin (BTC) addresses as authorities launch a “targeted marketing campaign” — in favor of crypto.In a series of tweets on Oct. 5, analyst and market cyclist Cole Garner highlighted a two-year record increase in new BTC addresses last week.Using data from on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode, Garner noted that around 22,000 new Bitcoin “entities” appeared on one day alone. The normal level is between 5,000 and 10,000 per day.“New #bitcoin addresses were absolutely off the charts last week,” he summarized in comments.Garner was building on other recent insights from statistician Willy Woo. Late last month, Woo described what he said was “a spike in activity by new participants coming into BTC not yet reflected in price,” also from the Glassnode data.New addresses are an important volume indicator, Garner continued, and price action should follow. “Volume, precedes price,” he wrote.Bitcoin entity growth daily chart. Source: GlassnodeThe source of the new addresses cannot be determined with certainty. China, however, forms Garner’s best bet, as a widely-reported media campaign in the last week of September called cryptocurrency the best-performing asset of 2020.“Last week the Chinese government began a coordinated marketing campaign to focus Chinese retail investor psyche on crypto. Yes, this is really happening,” wrote in a further tweet.The move also caught the attention of Primitive founding partner Dovey Wan, who described the Chinese state media campaign as “curious.”“It’s rare for such a coordinated effort,” she commented at the time.China has traditionally been seen as a hostile environment when it comes to consumers’ ability to engage with cryptocurrency. A ban from 2017 still remains in place, with transactions confined to over-the-counter, or OTC trades, despite mining activities openly continuing.As Cointelegraph reported, meanwhile, bullish on-chain metrics for Bitcoin keep multiplying, with Woo among those calling for a breakout independent of traditional assets, notably gold, in the near future."
222,"For BitMEX, 2020 has been quite a rough year and from the look of things it’s only set to get worse. The popular derivatives exchange is no longer as relevant and impactful on crypto market price action as it was 2 years ago, but a significant short-term price correlation among top exchanges has been proven repeatedly.A well-documented case occurred in May 2019, when a large sell order on Bitstamp caused a cascading $250 million liquidation on BitMEX.The following month, a Coinbase exchange outage triggered a $1,400 Bitcoin (BTC) price nosedive, as reported by Cointelegraph. A well circulated report by Bitwise Asset Management clearly showed that the top exchanges traded ""extremely tightly.""The report detailed how top exchanges influence pricing suggested that their movement is synchronized even when measured in milliseconds. While BitMEX has denied the CFTC allegation of operating an illegal derivatives exchange, the problem is markets are not taking those words at face value, at least in terms of the futures premium.Whenever a trader opts to buy or sell a futures contract, one is incurring the exchange's solvency risk. Even though it is possible to deposit a smaller amount and leverage the position, the margin is unlikely to be recovered if the exchange is hacked or suffers unexpected losses.Therefore, if one exchange's futures premium differs from the majority, it is a very worrisome signal as it represents lack of trust.BTC 3-month futures premium. Source: SkewThe chart above shows how the BitMEX BTC futures premium has lagged behind the competition. This effect has also occurred in the past, but there has never been a continuous 5% difference.In normal situations, this would be considered an arbitrage opportunity. Savvy traders would buy BitMEX's cheaper contracts and simultaneously sell it using another venue.What should have been a regular trading movement escalated to a situation where futures contract buyers are unwilling to participate no matter how much cheaper BitMEX's contracts are. This is primarily because traders are worried about solvency risks.This price action is a self-fulfilling prophecy, where the lack of participants drives liquidity away, increasing withdrawals, and ultimately causes BitMEX’s pricing to decouple from other major exchanges.This negative spiral can happen even if one excludes the horrific scenarios of BitMEX funds being seized by government agencies, or worse.Bitcoin futures volume by exchange. Source: Digital Assets DataTherefore, BitMEX's dismissal can happen regardless of its futures open interest and trading volumes. The longer its premiums stay below competition, the less credible the exchange will be in the eyes of investors. This cycle will likely lead to more investors pulling their funds and permanently closing their accounts at BitMEX. There is also the possibility that these departures will cause a short-term negative price swing.To conclude, investors must not overlook these serious issues simply because BitMEX is honoring withdrawals or maintaining its current share of the market. Traders tend to overvalue volume and open interest metrics, but both can be easily inflated. The futures premium, on the other hand, is very expensive and difficult to manipulate.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

223,"Fraudsters are taking advantage of the irreversible nature of crypto transactions, says MyChargeBack’s vice president of global operations, Michael Cohen. When Bitcoin (BTC) was first envisioned, one of its selling points was the fact that it was offering better protection to retailers than credit cards. In one of his earliest emails — from November 10, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto parried a complaint from an early adopter James A. Donald, who lamented the fact that Bitcoin transactions are not instantaneously final:According to Cohen, in some cases, credit card chargebacks are possible 18 months after the transaction date. There are two classifications of credit card chargebacks: unauthorized use (when a criminal gains access to one’s credit card) and authorized (where a cardholder authorized the transaction but is not satisfied with the outcome). Cohen said that when it comes to crypto, consumers may have a chance of recovering funds only in the case of unauthorized transactions, as credit companies like MasterCard and Visa exclude certain industries like crypto and gambling from the second category. Cohen opined that the ubiquity of scammers who use crypto as a tool hampers mass adoption:Cohen said that one of the most typical tropes of scammers involves them offering some product or service (the most common tend to be related to forex trading) to an unsuspecting customer. Then at the last moment, the scammer convinces the unsuspecting victim to pay for the service or fund their supposed-account using cryptocurrency. According to Cohen, not all is lost for the victims, however; there may be potential avenues for redress.Cohen’s company helps the victims identify scammers by tracing their movements on the blockchain. Typically this leads to a crypto exchange where the criminals deposit the proceeds of their crimes before cashing out. Cohen said that many crypto exchanges have been receptive and are truly eager to stamp out users who engage their services for nefarious purposes.Recently, two offices of the U.S. Department of the Treasury have issued advisories to the crypto companies, primarily exchanges, about processing malware attack payouts. A few days later, the U.S. government went after BitMex and its founder for operating an unregistered trading platform. As crypto regulation tightens around the world, it appears that cashing out of ill-gotten proceeds could become increasingly more difficult for the criminals."
224,"In its latest crypto newsletter, Bloomberg observes that Bitcoin (BTC) ""has had a tendency of adding zeroes to its price,"" noting that the asset previously went from $1,000 to $10,000 in less than four years. Maturation may have slowed this trend somewhat, but Bloomberg does not appear to believe it has reached a full stop. They noted that such a rise could occur again, though it may not be for some time:Though this prediction might appear bold on the surface, it is rather conservative compared to other forecasts we've seen in recent months. A crypto analyst known as ""PlanB,"" has recently stated that Bitcoin is still moving in accordance with the Stock-to-Flow Model, which forecasts a $100,000 price by late 2020.In addition to historical trends, Bloomberg suggests that fundamental supply and demand factors support Bitcoin’s rise. It points out that about 90% of the total supply has been mined, while institutional demand continues to gear up with “Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) approaching Bitcoin equivalent holdings of 500,000.""Bloomberg’s short-term prognosis is that Bitcoin could revisit 2019's high of $14,000 by the end of the year."

Can the crypto markets resume their up-move, or will higher levels attract selling by the bears?Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin is currently trading inside a symmetrical triangle, which suggests that both the bulls and the bears are not clear about the next directional move. The big question is when will the breakout happen and which direction will it take.BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe BTC/USD pair has reached about three-fourths of the distance from the base of the triangle to the apex. Ideally, a breakout should happen within the next few days and both the bulls and the bears will attempt to dominate proceedings.The flat 20-day exponential moving average ($10,693) and the relative strength index close to the midpoint suggests that it could be anybody’s game.In a triangle, the price moves between the support line and the resistance line. After the bounce off the support line on Oct. 2, the bulls may attempt to push the price above the triangle. If they succeed, the pair could start an up-move with a target objective of $12,460.However, if the breakout fails and the bears sink the price below the support line, then a drop to $9,835 would be on the cards. The next few days are critical as the pair could start a new trending move.Ether (ETH) had turned down from the downtrend line on Oct. 1 but the bears could not capitalize on the weakness and sink the price to the $308.392 support. The long tails on the candlesticks from the start of the month show accumulation by the bulls at lower levels.ETH/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe bulls will now attempt to push the price above the downtrend line and if they prevail, a move to the 50-day simple moving average ($376) or even $395 is possible. A break above $395 may signal the resumption of the uptrend.However, the bulls are unlikely to have an easy ride as the bears will mount stiff resistance at overhead resistance and the 50-day SMA.If the ETH/USD pair turns down from the downtrend line, the bears will once again try to sink the price to $308.392. A break below this support may start a deeper correction to $240.The failure of the bears to sink XRP below the $0.2295 support on Oct. 2 and 3 attracted aggressive buying from the short-term traders who pushed the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.242) and the downtrend line.XRP/USD daily chart.

They are currently attempting to stall the up-move at the 50-day SMA ($0.256). If they can sink the price back below the downtrend line, it will suggest that the current breakout was a bear trap.Binance Coin (BNB) bounced sharply from just below the 20-day EMA ($26.94) on Oct. 2 and broke above the downtrend line on Oct. 4. However, the bulls seem to have hit a wall at the overhead resistance at $29.5646.BNB/USD daily chart.

This suggests that the bulls are hesitant to buy Bitcoin Cash (BCH) near the stiff resistance of the 20-day EMA ($225) and the downtrend line.BCH/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf the bulls do not push the price above the downtrend line within the next few days, the bears will again attempt to sink the BCH/USD pair to $210.The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory suggest a slight advantage to the bears.However, if the bulls overcome the selling and propel the pair above the downtrend line, a rally to the 50-day SMA ($244) is possible. This level could act as a stiff resistance but once crossed, the pair may rise to $280.The rebound off the $3.90 support in Polkadot (DOT) lacks strength, which shows that the bulls are in no hurry to buy at the current levels because they may not be confident that the correction has ended.DOT/USD daily chart.

Currently, all options are open, hence, traders may wait for a trending move to start before placing large bets.Chainlink (LINK) is attempting a relief rally from $8.7975 but the rebound lacks strength, which shows low conviction among the buyers to accumulate at current levels.LINK/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf the momentum does not pick up, the LINK/USD pair might again turn down from the 20-day EMA ($10.13). Such a move will suggest that bears continue to sell on minor rallies.The sellers will then try to sink the price below $8.7975 and if that happens, a retest of $6.90 will be on the cards.A breakout of the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the bears might be losing their grip and a break above the downtrend line could signal a possible change in trend.The bulls are defending the $0.144743 support but the rebound from the current levels could again face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($0.153) and then at the downtrend line. If Crypto.com Coin (CRO) turns down from either level, the bears will again try to sink the price below $0.144743.CRO/USD daily chart.

226,"Bitcoin (BTC) whale clusters point toward three critical price levels to maintain a bullish market structure in the near term.Whale clusters form when large investors purchase Bitcoin and do not move it, making it an unspent transaction. These clusters typically indicate where crucial support levels exist and the logic is that BTC needs to maintain this level to see a prolonged rally.According to data from Whalemap, the three important support levels marked by whales are $10,407, $10,570, and $10,667.Macro Bitcoin support levels represented as whale clusters. Source: WhalemapWhales, or individual investors holding large amounts of Bitcoin, usually seek significant liquidity to buy or sell. This is because they deal with substantial buy or sell orders and manage this need by targeting highly liquid price points.Whale accumulation often takes place as weak hands capitulate and typically a retail sell-off amidst peak fear in the markets coincides with whale purchases because there are large sell volumes to absorb.In the past five days, there were many reasons and unexpected events that could have pushed retail investors to sell.On Oct. 1, the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) charged BitMEX with violating the Bank Secrecy Act. Almost immediately after, BTC plunged by 4.1%.Then, on Oct. 2, U.S. President Donald Trump tested positive for COVID-19. The President’s unexpected COVID-19 contraction temporarily shook financial markets and added some selling pressure on Bitcoin.The two events caused fear in the cryptocurrency market to intensify and Bitcoin price fell from $10,900 to $10,500.Over the following days the price recovered to $10,670 and this new found resilience corresponds with the whale clusters that formed on Oct. 2.In addition to the activity of whales, there are two technical catalysts that could buoy the sentiment around BTC.First, the Bitcoin futures funding rate across major exchanges are either negative or neutral. When a funding rate is low, it signifies that the majority of traders on futures exchanges are betting against BTC.A prolonged period of negative rates raises the likelihood of a short squeeze, which could cause BTC to increase. A pseudonymous trader known as “Byzantine General” said:“We're getting closer to Monday and funding has gone more negative. Especially Binance, where most of the fish are.”Furthermore, since the CFTC’s charge against the exchange, market data provider Glassnode reports that investors pulled 45,000 BTC from BitMEX.Many industry experts foreshadowed regulatory action against BitMEX and the resulting Bitcoin outflow is not terribly surprising.One could argue that the outflow of funds from BitMEX to more reliable two exchanges could benefit the overall market sentiment. Particularly because Gemini is considered to be one of the strongest exchanges in the crypto sphere in terms of regulatory compliance."
227,"Bitcoin (BTC) hitting a $1 trillion market cap by 2025 is “conservative,” and those levels should hit in less than two years.That was according to Blockstream CEO Adam Back, who delivered a fresh bullish BTC price outlook on Monday.Back was responding to a report by Yassine Elmandjra, a crypto-asset analyst at investment advisor Ark, who in September forecast a Bitcoin market cap of $1 trillion to $5 trillion by 2030 at the latest.Ark is well known for its enthusiastic price forecasts for Tesla stock, which saw an almost unbelievable rise in 2020.“Conservative. I'd say #bitcoin likely sees $1 trillion market cap within 2 years, probably sooner. $1 trillion is about BTC $50k,” he said.As of October, Bitcoin’s market cap is just over $198 billion. For Back’s prognosis to come true, the market would need to see a 400% increase by 2022.For reference, at the start of October two years ago in 2018, the figure stood at $114 billion. BTC/USD traded at $6,600, two months before the pit of its bear market which bottomed out at $3,100.Bitcoin market cap historical chart. Source: CoinMarketCapFurther responses to Ark included on-chain data resource Ecoinometrics, which highlighted a $2 trillion Bitcoin market cap as equal to that of Apple.BTC/USD would trade at $100,000 under such circumstances, while to equal gold, the pair would need to reach $500,000.As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin price activity is currently much more subdued, with analysts expecting more sideways action to characterize the remainder of the year. At the same time, anticipation is building over BTC/USD abandoning its correlation to traditional macro assets and rising in line with historical behavior — specifically centered on predictions from the stock-to-flow price forecasting models. Stock-to-flow calls for an average price of $288,000 during the current halving cycle, which began in May and will last until 2024."
228,"A crypto compliance software company says it is constantly unveiling new AML and KYT features — and now offers coverage across 70 countries for more than 2,500 service providers.Crystal Blockchain was publicly launched in 2018 with the ambition of building a better, safer cryptocurrency industry. The brainchild of Bitfury Group’s software team, the company brings together experienced blockchain analysts, award-winning mathematicians and professional software developers.The platform currently supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Tether, XRP and Litecoin blockchains. As well as serving cryptocurrency exchanges, the Crystal Blockchain analytics platform counts banks and financial institutions among its clients.According to Crystal Blockchain, the goal is to help financial institutions to meet regulatory requirements set by the Financial Action Task Force in the United States and the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive by the European Union. The company says its analytics are necessary, given how virtual asset service providers are coming under increasing pressure to clamp down on illicit transactions made using cryptocurrencies. As a result, Crystal aims to ensure its clients are fully compliant with Anti-Money Laundering and KYT (know-your-transaction) measures.Crystal Blockchain has released a series of reports that shed light on the features it has developed, as well as some of the insights made by the team in recent months.The company says its technology is able to assess the risk parameters for any new transaction made on blockchains in real time, and it can then automatically recalculate risk scores for any other associated activity at a reach of up to 100,000 connected hops back and forth, providing broad-reaching risk management. A risk value is automatically assigned as soon as a transaction enters the mempool even before it has been confirmed on the blockchain.According to Crystal, regular monthly updates ensure that its compliance tools meet current global regulatory standards. The team says the whole process on its platform has been automated, meaning that it can be readily integrated with corporate collaboration software such as Slack. This means that, as soon as an account is set up on the Crystal platform, all important notifications and alerts are brought immediately to the attention of the client’s workforce in the space where they are working.In a recent report covering 2013 to 2020, Crystal Blockchain also uncovered some crucial trends relating to digital assets. Over this period, it found that the total volume of Bitcoin (BTC) directly transferred between exchanges in H1 2020 stood at $33 billion — an increase of 35% from the same period 12 months earlier.Further analysis also showed that the countries with the largest number of registered exchanges, as of H1 2020, were the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Singapore and the United States.“As FATF and 5AMLD regulatory procedures continue to progress, we expect that the number of exchanges operating with unknown countries of origin will continue to reduce. And as compliance costs increase, we also predict the number of registered exchanges will increase as well,” Crystal predicted.Moreover, the company says it now takes just a few minutes to locate online entities that are extorting payments from affected users.Crypto analytics software companies that are able to operate with such urgency could help the digital assets industry achieve legitimacy in the eyes of investors who may be interested in gaining exposure to Bitcoin and other digital currencies. It means that, should there be further hack attacks or security breaches in the future, there will be a greater chance that cybercriminals can be brought to justice quickly.Disclaimer.

The refund process has been continuously delayed since 2019, and the refunds won’t likely happen anytime soon.The Mt.Gox trustee statement. Source: Mtgox.comOn Jun. 30, the Mt. Gox trustee released a statement on the official Mtgox.com website. The trustee, in charge of redistributing the funds to former users, said the Tokyo District Court granted a deadline extension to Oct. 15. The document read:“In light of the foregoing, the Rehabilitation Trustee filed a motion to seek an extension of the submission deadline of the rehabilitation plan at the Tokyo District Court, and, on June 30, 2020, the Tokyo District Court issued an order to extend the submission deadline for the rehabilitation plan to October 15, 2020.”Based on this document, some investors have suggested it could cause 150,000 BTC to move, potentially rattling the market.But there are two key reasons the trustee would not move the Bitcoin in the near term. First, the extension pertains to submitting the rehabilitation plan, not refunding the BTC. Simply put, the Oct. 15 deadline is for the trustee to put forward a plan, not to refund investors.Second, the trustee has continuously requested extensions throughout the past year. An identical statement was put out in March 2020 and in April 2019, and deadline extensions were granted.Oct. 15 is not the actual deadline for user refunds and the trustee has delayed the process several times in the past. Based on these two factors, it is safe to presume that the 150,000 BTC from the Mt. Gox trustee won’t hit markets in the short term.In the past week, Bitcoin has faced numerous negative events that mounted significant selling pressure on BTC. On Oct. 1, the United States CFTC’s charge against BitMEX immediately caused Bitcoin to pull back by over 5% while 24 hours later, U.S. President Donald Trump contracted COVID-19, causing most asset classes, including BTC, to correct.Despite back-to-back pessimistic events, Bitcoin has shown surprising resilience throughout October. BTC still remains above $10,500, a price level that acted as a critical support area since August.In the medium to long term, on-chain analyst Willy Woo said the Bitcoin market outlook remains positive. He said:Capitulation happened last year at $3k, we've been in a bull market ever since, it's just been camouflaged by BitMEX traders with the wild swings they create. $4k->$14k was the mother of all squeezes, retracing back to organic valuation took a while. https://t.co/6qG1NpzlT2"
230,"Bitcoin (BTC) rose to highs of $10,730 before settling lower on Oct. 5 as markets fluctuated in line with United States President Donald Trump contracting COVID-19.Cointelegraph takes a look at the factors set to influence BTC price action this week, as the virus and its consequences dictate the macro mood.President Trump buoyed markets late Sunday as traders priced in the possibility that he would leave hospital on Monday after treatment for COVID-19.Futures were up, reversing losses on Friday, along with major stock markets including the S&P 500, to which Bitcoin continues to show high correlation.Trump’s coronavirus diagnosis had caused modest panic late last week, with stocks diving and BTC/USD reacting in kind, dropping from $10,940 to lows of $10,380. “It’s been a really interesting journey; I learned a lot about Covid,” Trump said in a video update posted to Twitter late Sunday, apparently addressed to a crowd of supporters situated outside his hospital prior to a surprise meet-and-greet:Wall Street had yet to open at publishing time, with resumption of trading set to dictate further market trajectory for the start of the week.BTC/USD vs. S&P 500 one-year chart.

New York continued with phased infrastructure shutdowns on Monday, while in Europe, the worsening infection rate caused Paris to close certain establishments.In a fresh toll to business, meanwhile, Cineworld, the world’s second-biggest movie theater chain, said it would close its entire operation in both the U.S. and United Kingdom until further notice from Oct. 8. Its shares subsequently plunged 56% to a new all-time low.Nevertheless, rumors abound that Trump’s situation may in fact spur both political sides in Washington to reach a stimulus deal, something which would have an immediate impact on markets. As Cointelegraph reported, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had already alayed fears of a continued stalemate by confirming that whatever happens, the package would include another $1,200 stimulus check for eligible Americans. The long-term impact of state-sponsored income is in itself controversial, with commentators previously arguing that once implemented, the checks would be difficult to simply “turn off.”At the time that the first round of checks hit in April, cryptocurrency exchanges noticed increased volume specifically for the amount of the $1,200 payouts.BTC/USD one-week chart.

Previously, estimates suggested that the metric would build on existing all-time highs to shoot higher still.In the event, a 0.09% dip extinguished optimism, which was running high after the previous readjustment saw an 11.35% uptick.Hash rate, a measure of the computing power dedicated to validating the Bitcoin blockchain, was also flat on Monday, hovering at 135 exahashes per second (EH/s).Seven-day hash rate highs had reached a record 143 EH/s in September, with another surge to 141 EH/s on Oct. 1.

If Bitcoin continues to sustain above the psychologically critical level at $10,000, more investors may consider adding to their portfolios.Despite Bitcoin’s sideways price action, a few altcoins have maintained their uptrend and others are showing signs of a possible bullish trend reversal.Let’s analyze the charts of the top 5 cryptocurrencies to see which critical levels may signal the start of a trending move.The long-term trend in Bitcoin is bullish as the 200-day simple moving average ($9,448) is sloping up. However, in the short-term, the flat 20-day exponential moving average ($10,682) and the relative strength index close to the midpoint suggests a balance between supply and demand.BTC/USD daily chart.

Hence, traders should be patient until the price breaks above or below the range.A breakout of $11,178 could start a rally with the first target objective at $12,460, while a break below $9,835 and the 200-day SMA may intensify selling as traders rush to the exit to dump their positions.BTC/USD 4-hour chart.

A breakout between half to three-fourths of the distance from the base of the triangle to the apex is considered as reliable.Therefore, the bulls and the bears might attempt a breakout of the triangle within the next few days. However, if that does not happen and the price reaches the apex of the triangle, then the pattern will be invalidated.Cardano (ADA) closed (UTC time) below the 200-day SMA ($0.0837) on Sep. 23 but the bears could not sustain the lower levels, and the altcoin climbed back above the long-term moving average on Sep. 24.ADA/USD daily chart.

232,"As the COVID-19 pandemic pushed the Egyptian economy into recession and deepening unemployment, more and more Egyptians see the benefits of trading and mining Bitcoin as an alternative source of income.According to Al-Monitor, many Egyptians, particularly young people, are interested in cryptocurrencies. Wael al-Nahhas, an economist and financial advisor to several investment institutions in Egypt, said:“Many young Egyptians started investing in small amounts despite the increase in the value of the bitcoin. They started mining Satoshi, which is 100 millionth of a bitcoin, and on a daily basis they are making profits of 4% to 5% from the difference between buying rates during the timing of demand decline and selling rates at the time of peak demand, besides some quarterly or yearly profits from unexpected hikes in bitcoin rates.”Unemployment in Egypt jumped from 7.7% during the first quarter of 2020 to 9.6% during the second quarter, meaning more than half a million Egyptians have lost their jobs, recent numbers from the Egyptian Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics said.Bitcoin trading then looks very attractive.Muhammad Abd el-Baseer, a Bitcoin miner and member of the Bitcoin Egypt Community, said other factors also made it easier for people to turn towards Bitcoin. He said the move to work from home, reducing working hours, and new curfews encouraged many Egyptians to invest in Bitcoin in their spare time. He estimates more than 16,000 Egyptians have joined the Bitcoin Egypt Community. However, he noted this number could be higher as people may teach their friends and family how to invest in cryptocurrencies.But while more Egyptians become interested in mining and trading cryptocurrencies, many are concerned that people could be targeted and accused of fraud without proper legislation. A law clarifying what activities can be considered legal or not around cryptocurrencies could come soon, according to experts."
233,"Bitcoin (BTC) price has been stuck in a range for weeks now but traders generally expect a slow fourth quarter for the top-ranked digital asset.Bitcoin quarterly returns (%). Source: Skew.comIn 2018 and 2019 Q4 closed net negative, injecting a bit of bearish sentiment into the market. In the near term, a boring Q4 of further downside from Bitcoin price could cause altcoin prices to dump further.At the moment, multiple technical analysts are closely watching the bounce in the Bitcoin dominance index to warn against an altcoin market pullback.As Cointelegraph reported, over the past two weeks most small altcoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens dropped by 30% to 60%.The slump in altcoins worsened when Bitcoin surged from $9,981 to $11,179 on Sept. 9 to Sept. 19 and during this period it appears that a take-profit rally took place. Analysts believe that profits from altcoins and DeFi cycled into Bitcoin and stablecoins.As such, while Bitcoin saw a strong uptrend, DeFi tokens declined and altcoins remained in a steady decline.The altcoin sell-off occurred as Bitcoin started to decline after rejecting from a key resistance level at $11,100. In the last 15 days, BTC has slipped by nearly 6%, stabilizing slightly above $10,500.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView.comAccording to Cointelegraph contributor Michael van de Poppe, the current slump is unlikely to end any time soon.In a tweet van de Poppe posted the following chart and explained that crypto markets typically see ‘boring and corrective’ phases during Q4. The traders said, historically Ether bottoms in December and begins to move by the next quarter.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView.comVan de Poppe predicted that “BTC dominance will run up, to have an altseason in Q1 20201.”A pseudonymous trader known as “Loma” echoed a similar sentiment. He said the last time altcoins plunged this hard, BTC saw a large drop in a short period.This time, altcoins are declining while BTC and Ether remain relatively stable above their respective support levels. The trader noted:“ALTs dumping right now while Bitcoin barely moving. Last time I saw that, Bitcoin painted a fat down candle.”Since the start of October, the cryptocurrency market has faced a number of negative events which could be weighing on investor sentiment.On Sept. 26 KuCoin exchange was hacked for $281 million and while Bitcoin price did not correct over the news, it could be preventing the build up of bullish momentum. This was followed by the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announcing that it had charged BitMEX with violating the Bank Secrecy Act on Oct. 1.Then, on Oct. 2, U.S. President Donald Trump tested positive for COVID-19, causing a stir in both traditional and crypto markets.After several major events investors expect increased volatility and some traders have suggested that a short squeeze could be on the cards.Another popular crypto-Twitter trader known as “Byzantine General” said it is the “perfect” moment for a short squeeze as it would shake out the weak hands. The trader also hinted that in his opinion, there is plenty of capital on the sidelines within the cryptocurrency market. He said:“With all the uncertainty going on right now, especially in crypto, it would be the perfect moment to blast up and leave all the weak hands behind. BTW the SSR is still historically low, meaning that there is a lot of dry powder on the side lines.”Overall, traders foresee a boring quarter ahead for Bitcoin and altcoins, but last month’s intense sell-off could eventually lead to a strong relief rally."
234,"Open interest for Bitcoin options hit their all-time high of $2.14 billion on Sept. 24, a day before a huge quarterly expiry of 89,100 contracts — i.e., 47% of existing options contracts at the time. Options are derivative contracts that give the holder the right (though not an obligation) to purchase or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price, also known as the “strike price.”Observing the OI trends before every monthly and quarterly expiry, there are spikes just before the date of expiry, and they have been incremental after each expiry, pointing toward the increased liquidity in the Bitcoin (BTC) options market and an increasing number of investors participating.Since this past expiry was a quarterly expiry for Q3, it was expected that the open interest would surge past the OI seen in the prior monthly expiries of the same quarter. Cointelegraph discussed this further with Shaun Fernando, the head of risk and product strategy at Deribit — a crypto derivatives exchange — who agreed by saying that “the trend of open interest increasing every quarterly expiry signifies a trend of an increase in liquidity in options,” further adding:Besides high OI being related to the liquidity of options and the increased number of market participants, they could also be driven by larger macroeconomic events within the crypto markets such as the decentralized finance hype and long term effects of the Bitcoin halving on the markets. Lennix Lai, the director of financial markets of OKEx crypto exchange, echoes this evaluation while addressing the reason why there is an immediate drop in OI immediately after expiration:The increasing trend in open interest in BTC options seems to be a positive sign for better things to come for the crypto derivatives market, according to Lai: “Indeed! The sign of the increasing open interest potentially reflects that more participants are entering the market. Furthermore, any additional stimulus to the market can set up an aggressive stage for BTC options.”Despite the price volatility expected prior to this expiry where nearly half of all Bitcoin options contracts in circulation were due for expiration, there was no significant price impact. One main reason for this could be the size of the options/derivatives market when compared to the spot BTC market. Although, investors hope that the options and futures market would grow to be a larger fraction of the spot BTC market, which has a market cap of $194.11 billion. Lai further opined that “the price influence is not as strong to create large variance,” adding: “While there is no direct correlation between OI and post/pre-expiry price in traditional markets, crypto markets do not stand aside.”Apart from this main underlying reason for why there isn’t a significant price movement is that the put-call ratios haven’t been heavily skewed toward one side. A put contract is an options contract that allows the holder the right to sell a specified amount of an underlying asset at a fixed time within a specific duration, whereas a call contract gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset under similar prerequisites. Dan Koehler, liquidity manager at OKCoin — a San Francisco-based crypto exchange — elaborated:“In the money” options refer to options that hold intrinsic value to the investors. An ITM call option means that option buyers would have the opportunity to buy the asset below its current market price, while an ITM put option gives the buyers an opportunity to sell the asset above its current market price. These are looked at as an “out of the money” options contract.The put-call ratio has been relatively stable, averaging around 0.7 over the past month, which indicates that there is still a bullish sentiment among investors despite the BTC spot price contracting $900 earlier in the expiry week. Although these are the major points, there are many factors within options expiration that play a role in whether the price of the underlying asset will see a larger price movement. Koehler points to “strike concentration of the 89K in OI” as being another significant aspect: “If the strike open interest doesn’t coincide with the current price of BTC, then the market makers will need to do less last-minute hedging that could result in pinned or slippery strikes.”Apart from options playing a role in indicating market sentiment near options expiration days, they are often an indicator of this sentiment as well. Fernando stated that “options can already have had an effect on the underlying before settlement,” further adding:Options serve various purposes for different kinds of investors. Risk-averse investors use options as a hedging tool that serve to reduce risk in their portfolios. For speculators, options offer a chance to have low-cost ways to go long or short on the market with limited, calculated downside risk. Options also give opportunities to potentially profit under any market scenario using flexible and often complex strategies like spreads and combinations.BTC options traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are referred to as “CME options on Bitcoin Futures.” They are often a sign of institutional interest in Bitcoin, which also seems to have increased leading up to the Sept. 25 quarterly expiry. Cointelegraph discussed the role of these options with Tim McCourt, the global head of equity index and alternative investment products of the CME Group, who stated:The opportunities that options and the derivatives market, in general, given to investors have contributed to increased price stability that is currently being witnessed for Bitcoin. The ability to take a plethora of opposing positions, through instruments like longs/shorts and puts/calls, has helped lessen the large and frequent price swings seen with Bitcoin in the past. Koehler added:"
235,"Bitcoin ends the week about 6 percent up, still beneath $11,000 but having set a record of 63 days above $10,000. Some traders are starting to find the digital coin’s stability boring.

ChartBTC has pointed out that only 2.5 million coins remain for mining; half will be mined in the next four years.Jack Dorsey, at least, still finds Bitcoin exciting.

He’ll have to explain that move to Twitter’s users though. A survey has found big gaps in mainstream understanding of the cryptocurrency industry.But plenty of people do get it. IoTeX, a connectivity company, has partnered with camera manufacturer Tenvis Technology to make an indoor security camera powered by the blockchain. Ucam uses a decentralized system with a private key to let users control all their own data. In Congress, the House of Representatives has passed an updated Consumer Safety Technology Act. The act includes regulations that define digital terms and require the Federal Trade Commission to report on the blockchain’s role in consumer protection. In Europe, the European Commission has taken another move towards giving its cryptocurrency industry a stronger legal foundation. The EC adopted a new digital finance package that includes its first legislation on crypto assets. If you’re looking to cash in on that progress, you can do worse than follow Tim Draper. The venture capitalist has described his crypto-portfolio. He holds Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Tezos, and Aragon. He didn’t mention whether he was holding any of the tokens on Kucoin. Analysts have now estimated that hackers might have taken almost $280 million during that hack. About $129 million worth of ERC20 tokens though, are now considered safe.And if you’ve been wondering what happened to Didi Taihuttu and his Bitcoin family, they’re still doing fine, traveling the world and living on cryptocurrencies.

236,"This year has been a strong one for digital asset markets, highlighted by growing institutional inflows and a propitious shift in the regulatory environment. Witness the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission’s September letter that says crypto exchanges that comply with SEC Rule 15c3-3 (the Customer Protection Rule) are free to trade digital asset securities. With more than 50 million people around the world investing and trading in crypto in meaningful volumes, Goldman Sachs has recently appointed a new global head of digital assets, as did JPMorgan in February. Goldman’s move was a noted reversal following a May earnings call in which one of its analysts questioned the legitimacy of Bitcoin (BTC) as an asset class.The timbre of digital asset markets is changing from primarily speculative in nature, driven by high-frequency individual traders riding waves of volatility, to longer-term buy-and-hold activity. For instance, Yale and Harvard have both made waves in recent months with SEC filings revealing multi-million-dollar investments in crypto funds as the asset class continues to gain momentum.Related: Ivy League universities set to boost the crypto industry with an injection of institutional investmentVisa, Mastercard and PayPal have made recent announcements that they, too, are embracing the digital asset markets, with Visa recently writing on its blog:Indeed, a growing number of organizations and governments around the globe are embracing digital assets for trading, investing and non-intermediated payments. As proof of this momentum, the World Economic Forum established a consortium to govern digital currencies this year, including government-issued stablecoins, which central bankers have increasingly embraced.As of mid-July 2020, according to the Bank for International Settlements report, at least 36 central banks have published retail or wholesale central bank digital currency work. At least nine countries have undertaken CBDC pilots; 18 central banks have published research on retail CBDCs; and another 13 have announced research or development work on a wholesale central bank digital currency.Regulatory clarity has been slow to materialize as a major impediment to adoption by traditional investors and service providers, however, change is undeniably underway.In addition to the recent SEC move, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency recently announced that national banks can provide crypto services, including holding private keys for customers and other custody solutions. And crypto businesses enthuse at the prospect of a harmonized patchwork of state and federal money transmitter rules. Such developments are making markets more palatable for participants entering this space.Related: US banks get crypto custody nod, but instant demand surge is unlikelyAccording to a new report by Fidelity Digital Assets head of research Ria Bhutoria:That being said, it’s a chicken-and-egg quandary: Progress with the regulatory and infrastructure development required to support digital asset markets has not kept pace with activity in these markets.As rules and regulations continue to be introduced and refined, a host of questions remain:The extent to which banks will custody private keys and act as fiduciaries or lay off the risks to other qualified providers is unclear. A growing number of crypto prime service providers have emerged to provide essential trading, lending, clearing and settlement functions, and the battle to compete in this underserved segment has ramped up significantly in recent months. The emergence of credible and capable prime service providers in the crypto world is critical.As the market for digital assets grows, the number of trade breaks and security breaches may rise if the infrastructure doesn’t mature, making security and compliance existential priorities for trading venues. For instance, there was also a massive Bitcoin selloff on the BitMEX exchange in March: Nearly $200 million was chaotically liquidated with overleveraged traders unable to move money between networks in time to unwind their positions. And according to the Fidelity Digital Assets report, there were 11 exchange hacks in 2019 resulting in $283 million in digital assets stolen. While the total amount stolen has declined year over year, which indicates security improvements, the number of hacks has increased.In the eyes of U.S. regulators, crypto businesses are virtual asset service providers that will soon be required to collect the names of transaction senders and receivers. They also must have AML policies and procedures in place. Indeed, crypto businesses have their work cut out to reconcile the morass of changing state, federal and cross-border rules. As market oversight remains fragmented and in flux, counterparties can be left holding the bag if a transaction goes awry.Related: Slow but steady: FATF review highlights crypto exchanges’ struggle to meet AML standardsOther industry-wide issues remain sticking points for institutions on the sidelines.For one thing, digital asset identifiers aren’t consistent across platforms and exchanges, and there are often different tickers for the same instrument. In the absence of a central crypto market-data repository, trying to process transactions in downstream systems for valuations, pricing, accounting and reporting can create a host of problems. Indeed today, it is virtually impossible for investors and other stakeholders to consistently and reliably calculate true realized crypto gains and losses.As this market segment grows and bigger blocks need to move between buyers and sellers, market participants need, more than ever, accurate market data and quality prime services such as lending, custody, margin, clearing and settlement to ensure customers have a safe environment in which to do business. More financial institutions will become active in this space once such concerns about regulatory uncertainty, market transparency, execution quality and capital efficiency are addressed. Fortunately, we are seeing evolutionary forces in crypto data management, rulemaking and reporting.A host of new providers are creating systems so consumers of decentralized crypto data, such as banks and other institutions, can more easily and accurately reconcile accounting and reporting. Additionally, watchdogs are beginning to apply traditional market protections to the digital asset ecosystem. For its part, the recent OCC guidance is a blueprint that other agencies can follow to usher standards and safeguards that will enable these burgeoning markets to thrive in the months and years ahead.Crypto businesses can navigate the rapidly changing business and regulatory landscapes by joining a number of highly active trade associations that are now shaping policy and industry change.It behooves market participants to become as active as they can in these associations as policymakers define digital assets and how they should be regulated. There’s strength in numbers, so engaging with other crypto businesses in dialogue with regulators affords the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on this rapidly evolving segment before a policy is set in stone.Keeping tabs on the nuance of change underway not only makes markets safer for all but can help financial services firms roll out potentially lucrative lines of business competitors may be pursuing, such as stablecoins for cross-border payments and crypto trading services. Eventually, today’s steep curve of market structure evolution will flatten, and digital assets will be commonly embraced. When that happens, those of us working diligently together now will be gratified to look back as agents of change.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
237,"On the morning of Oct. 1, the United States government authorities in New York issued indictments for four of the senior team of BitMEX, the famed “wild card” exchange based in Hong Kong. Despite that, the crypto exchange still continues to operate its services. BitMEX is one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges and has a reputation for being notoriously “relaxed” on Know Your Customer and ID procedures for its users — at least until mid-August of this year. Additionally, users are allowed a high withdrawal limit with little to no KYC.After doing some research, it is clear that the company operates a complex international corporate structure. It promotes its registration in the Seychelles with offices in Hong Kong and New York. Although, from a legal point, this could most likely be disputed. The company has often been in the top five exchanges internationally.The United States has a habit of listing “lenient” charges on warrants in order to obtain international extradition of those wanted under U.S. laws. Once the defendants have entered the U.S., the charges are then lifted with additional charges added. The reason for this move is that not every country recognizes these complex U.S. laws — especially in relation to money laundering and financial crimes. The extradition can be obtained on the lenient laws, with the charges to be improved once the individual is in the United States.If to read between the lines, the papers released by the authorities indicate that more severe charges could follow, including breaching international sanctions. The rumor mill in New York indicates that the Federal authorities believe BitMEX may have most likely been a “jumping-off point” for countries like Iran and North Korea to move out of their crypto positions. If that is the case, enabling them to do that carries a large level of charges with it. Breaching international sanctions is a massive issue, especially as far as the U.S. is concerned.During the course of the day as the news spread, Bitcoin’s (BTC) price dropped, and many users began making withdrawals from the exchange. Some experts tried to quiet the market down as the day went on by reassuring people that BitMEX isn’t going anywhere (with the belief that it is too big to fail).Adding to this, a spokesperson for HDR Global Trading Limited — one of the BitMEX companies — quoted to the New York Times:Regardless of how true that is, if to look at the timing of the statement, BitMEX may have been trying to ease the market more than take a stand on their situation.Related: 3 reasons why the CFTC action against BitMEX will not crash Bitcoin priceThe reality of the situation is that if found guilty, the assets of the exchange will most likely be used to provide restitution to victims of money laundering and other crimes. This realistically means the freezing of accounts, suspension of trading, and even blacklisting of the company in general, as well as selling international assets to pay back victims.At the time of writing, one of the four indicted individuals, Samuel Reed, has been arrested by authorities in connection with the warrants. The other three remain unaccounted for.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
238,"Thanks to regulatory uncertainty from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and a hodgepodge of state licensing requirements, the development of crypto trading in the U.S. remains stuck in the backwaters of trading reserved for Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board issues.In order to ensure the continued and healthy growth of digital asset markets, it is critical to expand the market share of institutional crypto trading. That’s a better business model for digital asset markets, and it will force U.S. regulators to act quicker. Digital asset markets embracing this will realize that better controls will attract more institutional liquidity, and organizing behind a governing set of control principles is where to start.Fortunately, the Association for Digital Asset Markets, or ADAM — a consortium of digital asset market players established in 2018 — took the lead in November 2019 by publishing its “Code of Conduct.” (The Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association’s “Best Practices for Digital Asset Exchanges,” published in 2018, is also a good reference.) Its code, which is a must-read for digital asset markets, has eight primary tenets: compliance and risk management, market ethics, conflicts of interest, transparency and fairness, market integrity, custody, information security and business continuity, and Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Finance of Terrorism.With this groundwork laid, next comes implementation. Again, there is no need to reinvent the wheel — existing standards and regulations provide guidance that can be tailored to any digital asset market. Turn first to Bermuda to find a regulator that has embraced digital assets and aimed to eliminate regulatory uncertainty. Even Wyoming, boasted as the state with the most progressive digital asset regulatory framework in the United States, modeled its digital asset statutes on Bermuda’s.Malta also has helpful prescriptive regulation (just turn a blind eye to the implosion of its efforts, generally), followed by New York. I will go a step further here and give you the links to the best provisions of the most relevant resources.Bermuda’s “Code of Practice” provides straightforward governance, compliance and risk management controls specific to digital asset markets. Mature organizations looking for more comprehensive guidance will want to check out Malta’s “Virtual Financial Assets Rulebook, Chapter 3, Title 3,” which could also be helpful for conflict-of-interest issues relating to operational independence, inducements and personal trading. The best — and most extensive — regulatory guidance for conflicts in financial firms, however, remains the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s October 2013 “Report on Conflicts of Interest.”Implementing sound transparency and fairness controls requires appropriate client disclosures. Bermuda’s client disclosure rules and New York’s virtual currency rules provide the clearest. most helpful guidance.For market integrity, particularly for U.S. digital asset markets subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulation, Cboe Futures Exchange’s “Rulebook” provides a well-organized resource.Bermuda’s “Digital Asset Custody Code of Practice” defines standards for digital asset private-key custodians across safekeeping, transaction handling and operations. The SEC’s “Customer Protection” rule and CFTC’s customer fund segregation rules, however, are poorly adapted to digital asset markets, as has been noted by both FINRA and the SEC.For cybersecurity controls, New York State Department of Financial Services’ “Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies” offers a well-rounded checklist, but for custody security, Bermuda’s “Custody Code of Practice” is the best resource. New York’s virtual currency rules provide a helpful business continuity checklist. “Must have” references for chief information security officers in digital asset markets include the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s “Security and Privacy Controls,” “Key Management,"" “Cryptographic Key Generation” and “Cybersecurity Event Recovery” guides.Bermuda’s “Prudential Standards” and “Sector-Specific Guidance Notes for Digital Asset Business” provide thorough Anti-Money Laundering guidance and even templates, but the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network — notably, its guidance related to convertible virtual currencies — remains the primary source (of course). For conducting an AML risk assessment, the primary resource should be the “Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual for Money Services Businesses.”It is time for digital asset markets to take the bull by the horns and start to break the regulatory log jam by leveraging ADAM’s principles and the above resources. Let’s be proactive to get the currents of crypto liquidity flowing through those backwaters!The author would like to express special thanks to Andrew Kuttin.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be, and should not be taken as, legal advice.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
239,"Bitcoin (BTC) price appears on the verge of closing another week pinned below the $11,000 resistance but given the major events of the week, things could have been so much worse. Cryptocurrency daily market performance snapshot. Source: Coin360The top-ranked cryptocurrency by market cap held its ground as KuCoin revealed more than $150 million worth of assets had been stolen from the exchange, and the price only stumbled slightly as the CTFC announced that legal action was being taken against BitMEX exchange. The price again avoided collapse when DOW and S&P 500 futures took a hefty drop upon the announcement that U.S. President Donald Trump had contracted the coronavirus. In the past, just one of the above events would have easily tanked Bitcoin price by at least 10% and as history shows, altcoins would have been crushed even further. According to Cointelegraph contributor Marcel Pechman, Bitcoin’s resilience to major negative news events shows that professional and retail investors remain bullish on the digital asset and Pechman suggested that the bullish uptrend to $12,000 could resume sooner than investors anticipate. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewAs has been the case for the past week, Bitcoin continues to compress within a symmetrical triangle and the price is holding above $10,500. The volume profile visible range (VPVR) on the daily chart shows a large $1,450 gap which is the length of the Sept. 3 candle where Bitcoin dropped from $11,400 to $9,950 and since this 13% correction the price has been pinned in this range.Currently the relative strength index is slightly above 45 and the moving average convergence divergence shows the MACD on the verge of rolling over the signal line as sell volume increases. This is not overwhelmingly worrisome and from a bird’s-eye view we can see the price is still making higher lows and lower highs as the price compresses. Although traders’ sentiment may be bullish, the key ingredient missing at the moment is volume.Regarding Bitcoin’s current range, looking back to May 25-July 20 the price compressed within a similar symmetrical triangle before breaking out with a strong 36% rally which took the price to the 2020 high at $12,480. Traders are likely watching the current structure to see if a similar scenario is in the making. As mentioned in a previous analysis, holding above $10,380 will keep the price in the symmetrical triangle but below this level there has been demonstrated interest from buyers in the $10,200-$9,800 range. In the event of a bullish breakout, Bitcoin price still needs to take out multiple resistance levels at $11,000 all the way through $11,400, hence the need for a high volume spike to obliterate all the overhead resistance. Generally, no news is good news and price action-wise, Bitcoin has done nothing newsworthy over the past week. In fact, the surprising news about Bitcoin is its lack of downside during an eventful week filled with events which would have clobbered the price in years past.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

240,"Over 45,000 Bitcoin has been withdrawn from BitMEX since the U.S. government levied charges against the exchange and its leadership. October 1 brought two devastating blows to BitMEX. First, the CFTC and DOJ brought charges against the exchange. Shortly thereafter, its founders (including CEO Arthur Hayes), were indicted by the U.S. government. The market reacted to the news with a sharp decline across many of Blockchain's biggest assets.This isn't the first time in recent months that BitMex has contributed to a downward turn. The exchange first began losing the trust of its participants following a blackout on Black Thursday which prevented users from trading or retrieving their assets. While users withdrew over 100,000 Bitcoin in the six months between that episode and these recent charges, the exodus of the past two days appears to be unprecedented in scale.According to data from Crystal Blockchain, in less than 48 hours, the net outflows from the exchange have exceeded 45,000 Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Gemini and Binance appear to be the biggest beneficiaries of these outflows, trailed by OKEx and Huobi. Over 20,000 BTC have been transferred out of BitMEX and into the latter four exchanges.It is unclear whether BitMEX will disappear into the abyss of time like many failed exchanges before it, or if the company will survive to trade another day. Robert Whitaker, the chief operating officer of Blockchain Intelligence Group and a former supervisory special agent at the Department of Homeland Security, told Cointelegraph that the most likely outcome would be monetary penalties and a promise on the part of BitMEX's executives not to engage in unlawful activities in the future."
241,"BitMEX used to be the indisputable leader of Bitcoin (BTC) futures trading and if something similar to yesterday's civil enforcement action were to happen back in 2015-2018 the crypto markets would have completely collapsed.Regardless of partial recovery to $10,600, which was relatively quick, derivatives markets held steady during the $500 drop down to $10,400. Neither BTC futures or options displayed any signs of discomfort to the negative news.The futures market nearly ignored the entire event and this is a strong indicator that investors remain bullish. It also suggests that markets will be testing $12,000 sooner than one might expect.BitMEX Bitcoin futures daily volume, 2019. Source: SkewAs shown above, BitMEX held nearly 50% of the market share until July 2019. This advantage came from being the precursor of the so-called perpetual contracts (inverse swaps) market. In addition to not requiring KYC, the derivatives exchange also offered up to 100x leverage and this helped in growing a vast user base.After the Black Thursday market correction saw Bitcoin price drop below $3,600, competitor exchanges scrambled to offer similar services and this led to BitMEX losing its dominant position throughout 2019. Some in the crypto community believe that BitMEX’s ban of U.S. clients was the primary culprit for the loss of market share, and others point to their aggressive liquidation engine as the catalyst. During the March 13 crash, BitMEX faced technical difficulties and went offline for 25 minutes. Somehow, as the outage occurred and Bitcoin price crashed below $4,000, BitMEX’s insurance fund was able to increase its holdings by 1,000 BTC over the next 48 hours. Since that event, the open interest on BitMEX futures has been pinned below $1 billion. BitMEX Bitcoin futures daily volumes, 2020. Source: SkewLooking at more recent data, BitMEX has become almost irrelevant in terms of volume. Over the past three months its market share hovered around 18% and while it is impossible to measure the exchange's impact on BTC pricing, it clear that it’s lost its edge over the past eighteen months.The basis indicator compares futures contracts price to the current level at regular spot exchanges. It is also commonly referred to as a futures premium. Healthy markets usually display a 5% to 15% annualized basis, in a situation known as contango. On the other hand, a negative basis (discounted futures) usually occurs during heavily bearish markets.BTC futures curve. Source: Highcharts.comThe above chart shows a 5.4% or higher annualized 3-month contract premium for every exchange except BitMEX. Essentially, professional traders are signaling that their expectations were not harmed by yesterday's events. If anything to be taken away by yesterday’s news, it’s that this is an exchange-specific issue with little to no impact on overall futures markets.It is worth noting that the futures premium can remain relatively steady while investors are closing their positions. This would undoubtedly be a very worrisome situation, as it would signal that traders are worried about the exchanges' liquidity.From this perspective, open interest is the most critical evidence of investors confidence in a particular market or exchange. Even if the total aggregate figure didn't change, an exodus from BitMEX to other exchanges would be reflected in open interest data.BTC futures aggregate open interest. Source: SkewTake notice of how uneventful yesterday's news was. BitMEX's open interest has held $650 million, down 11% from the previous day, while the aggregated figure was mostly unaffected. Huobi absorbed most of the change, indicating that some traders likely moved their positions.The 25% delta skew is useful for gauging professional traders' sentiment through options pricing. By comparing the implied volatility of similar-risk put and call options, an investor can assert whether it is more expensive to buy call (bullish) or put (bearish) options.Bitcoin 3-month options 25% delta skew. Source: SkewThe chart above shows that the 3-month options 25% delta skew has held in neutral terrain. A negative indicator means implied volatility for calls is larger than puts, signaling a slightly positive market expectation.The indicator has been oscillating between 0% and -5% for the past week, and is far away from a bearish scenario. If anything, yesterday's move can be deemed uneventful for options sentiment.There is no better indicator of a bull market than bad news. Regardless of BitMEX’s diminishing importance in volume and pricing, a government-backed action against a top-5 exchange would certainly have dampened the price had market sentiment been neutral or negative.Investors and crypto advocates should also factor in Kucoin's $150 million hack just 6 days ago. It literally had zero impact on Bitcoin price at the time. Now imagine those events happening a year ago, when BTC was in a downtrend after a failed $14K test as followed by a top formation at $12K.Meanwhile, as all of this BitMEX scandal takes place, gold touched a 2-month low at $1,850 on Sept. 28 and has now partially recovered to $1,900. There are also discussions to finalize a second round of economic stimulus to the tune of $2.2 trillion and in less than 30 days the U.S. will have its presidential election.Historically, all of these events tend to inject uncertainty into the markets and the fact that   Bitcoin derivatives' data continue to hold steady during such turbulent news flow suggest that $12K may be tested sooner than one might think.

242,"The shallow pullback in Bitcoin (BTC) following the news of the CFTC’s regulatory crackdown on BitMEX and the late announcement that U.S. President Donald Trump tested positive for coronavirus shows that the underlying sentiment is still bullish.Generally, most damage during such periods of negative news flow is caused by the squaring up of leveraged positions. Data shows that Bitcoin futures volume and open interest has been dropping since hitting the peak in early September. This means that there were fewer long positions that had to be squared up in a hurry and it also may explain why a sharper crash was avoided.Daily cryptocurrency market performance.

Let’s analyze the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot the critical support and resistance levels. Bitcoin once again reversed direction from close to $11,000 on Oct. 1, which shows that the bears are aggressively defending the zone between the 20-day exponential moving average ($10,704) and the 50-day simple moving average ($11,017).BTC/USD daily chart.

This uncertainty could resolve after the price breaks above or below the triangle.The gradually downsloping moving averages and the relative strength index in the negative territory suggest that bears have a slight advantage.If the BTC/USD pair breaks and closes (UTC time) below the triangle, it will suggest that the bears have overpowered the bulls. The sellers will then try to break the critical support at $9,835 and if they succeed, a drop to $9,000 could be on the cards.However, the long tail on today’s candlestick shows that the bulls are accumulating on dips to the uptrend line. They will now try to push the price above the resistance line of the triangle. If they succeed, the pair may face minor resistance at $11,178 but if the bulls can push the price above this level, a rally to $12,460 is possible. It is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout with certainty, hence, it is better to wait for the breakout to happen before taking large bets.The bulls had pushed Ether (ETH) above the downtrend line on Oct. 1, but they could not sustain the higher levels.

243,"The United States stock market plunged as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped 358 points in pre-market trading. The Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped to as low as $10,374 across major exchanges, but a larger pullback is unlikely.The one-hour Bitcoin price chart. Source: TradingView.comThree key reasons could buoy the near-term sentiment of Bitcoin. The potential catalysts are the likelihood of a stimulus package, BTC’s strong technical reaction, and the resilient $10,5000 support level.Throughout the past month, the Dow Jones has struggled to recover amid the resurgence of COVID-19 cases.Various macro and political factors, including U.S.–China relations and the stimulus stalemate, added significant pressure on the Dow.Since the Sept. 2 peak, the Dow has dropped 4.4%, according to Google Finance. Tech-heavy indices, like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, posted larger losses of around 5.6%.U.S. President Donald Trump’s unexpected positive COVID-19 test further rattled markets. The Bitcoin price dropped in tandem with the Dow in the past 12 hours after President Trump tweeted:Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!Although the news initially caused the markets to drop, it could cause the Republicans to reconsider the stimulus proposal.On Oct. 1, the House Democrats officially approved a $2.2 trillion stimulus bill, including direct stimulus checks. The Trump administration and Republicans rejected it, stating that there many unnecessary elements in the deal.But as the presidential election nears and the markets slump, it could cause the Trump administration to work towards the stimulus. When a stimulus gets approved, it will likely cause Bitcoin and the Dow to soar, potentially buoying BTC’s momentum.Bitcoin dropped to around $10,380 on Coinbase when the Dow plunged by over 300 points in the pre-market trading session.Since then, Bitcoin has seen a relatively strong recovery. BTC saw wicks below $10,400 on lower time frame charts but rebounded swiftly above it. BTC is now consolidating under $10,500, which has acted as a critical support level since early August.A pseudonymous trader known as “Benjamin Blunts” said BTC is more correlated to stocks than gold. Considering the strengthening correlation, if stocks rebound after the initial market reaction, it could relieve some pressure from Bitcoin. The trader said:“I think, once and for all we can all agree that #btc is not correlated to gold and is correlated to equities, no chopping and changing whenever it suits our bias, this is how it is now.”Realized correlation between Bitcoin and gold. Source: SkewIn the past two months, when Bitcoin consolidated just under a critical support level, it historically broke out.$10,500 is an important level that might decide whether Bitcoin moves towards the $11,100 to $11,300 resistance range or the $9,600 CME gap in the near term.Traders also suggest that the charges against BitMEX could turn out to be a non-event in the longer term. Cantering Clark, a cryptocurrency trader, wrote:“In terms of order flow, while open interest took a beating on Mex for $BTC, I am not seeing much of a disparity between other exchanges LTF volume data and Mex. Pretty much still at parity for what the norms have been. Is this going to be a non-event?”The confluence of analysts anticipating the BitMEX incident to have a lesser impact on Bitcoin in the near term and BTC recovering to the $10,500 support area maintains an optimistic medium-term outlook for BTC."
244,"Bad news — the increase in the Bitcoin (BTC) price over the past decade may have been overstated because of the accompanying fiat inflation. Since Bitcoin is typically denominated in fiat — United States dollars usually — it is not immune to its depreciation.In the decade that followed the economic crisis, the U.S. enjoyed some of the lowest inflation in history, which hovered around 2% annually. However, over the decade, this added up to almost 20%. Thus, if we use the 2010 dollar as our base and apply its subsequent depreciation to the price of Bitcoin, then the current price of $10,466 turns into $8,770. Though this may be a sobering realization for some long-time hodlers, it does not mean that Bitcoin was a bad investment or that it is not a good store of value.On the contrary, if we compare the performance of Bitcoin and USD in the last decade (again adjusted for inflation), then there is no comparison. One dollar invested in USD would have turned into 84 cents, while one dollar invested in Bitcoin would be worth $274,000. Cryptocurrency has clearly done a much better job of value preservation.Bitcoin is not immune to inflation either, but that might over complicate the story somewhat. As long as the fiat inflation rate stays low and Bitcoin continues to appreciate at a rapid pace that it has done until recently, the effect of fiat inflation may be negligible for most investors. The only way to escape it completely would be to stop denominating Bitcoin in fiat. Then, perhaps, 10 years from now, we would be discussing how many Satoshis one might hope to buy with a dollar."
245,"Bitcoin (BTC) futures volume and open interest are declining rapidly. Data shows that since the September peak, BTC futures volume has dropped by 60% from over $25 billion to around $10 billion.Bitcoin futures volume by exchange (September). Source: Digital Assets DataWhile the decline in trading activity could ostensibly seem like a negative metric, it could also indicate that a bull cycle is emerging. The Bitcoin futures market represents most of the overleveraged trades in the Bitcoin market and popular platforms like Binance, BitMEX, and ByBit enable leverage of up to 125x.When traders are highly leveraged, they are vulnerable to liquidation. For instance, if a 10x long contract placed at $10,000 is liquidated at $9,000, it forces the buyer to market-sell the position. Assuming there are a large number of traders in similar positions, this increases sell pressure and can catalyze a major sell-off in Bitcoin price.If the futures market open interest and volume spike, it puts Bitcoin in a vulnerable position and raises the probability of cascading liquidations like those seen during the infamous Black Thursday when over $1 billion worth of futures contracts were liquidated as Bitcoin price plunged below $3,600.The drop in futures volume can be perceived as a potentially bullish event as typically a small price movement could turn into a major price swing if mass liquidations are triggered at a certain price level.As such, the declining volume and open interest of the futures market could set the stage for a stable and prolonged rally to take form.Open interest and volume of Bitcoin during bull and bear markets. Source: amChartsDuring bull markets, there are often multiple spikes in open interest but the market stays neutral for a prolonged period, allowing spot volume to pick up. As shown in the chart below, while the futures market volume has dropped, spot volume has slightly increased.Spot exchange volumes. Source: Digital Assets DataWhile not featured on the chart, LMAX Digital, a Bitcoin spot exchange that tailors to institutions, recently overtook Coinbase to become the largest spot exchange.  Kyle Davies, the co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, explained:“Indications BTC is not a niche cottage industry: 1) BTC has strong correlation with equities and commodities but you only trade crypto 2) LMAX is the largest BTC USD spot exchange but you don’t have an account there 3) Trad billion $ entrants whom you have never heard of.”Considering the increase in institutional demand, the rise in spot volume, and the declining futures open interest, the ongoing trend can be considered bullish.In the near term, traders expect continued consolidation under the $11,000 resistance and this could extend the trend of decreasing volume in futures.Edward Morra, a cryptocurrency trader, said liquidity shows Bitcoin would likely face more sideways trading. He said:“My current outlook, either local top is in or another spike to take out stops. A lot of liquidity left below price.”"
246,"Within the last few hours Bitcoin (BTC) price plummeted as the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) charged BitMEX with facilitating money laundering and operating an illegal cryptocurrency derivatives exchange. An even larger shock occurred as authorities announced the arrest of Samuel Reed, one of the co-founders of BitMEX.BitMEX has been the most dominant Bitcoin futures exchange for a long time, at least until March 2020 when the massive $1 billion Black Thursday liquidation pulled the price below $3,750. In recent months, new competitors like Binance Futures and ByBit have significantly increased their market share.Although the industry expected that charges against BitMEX would come one day, the arrest of Reed is an unexpected surprise. Immediately after the news broke, BTC price plunged from $10,883 to $10,437, a 4.11% drop.Bitcoin/USD 1-hour chart. Source: TradingView.comFortunately, there are several factors that could aid the recovery of Bitcoin in the short term. The catalysts are the short duration of the current correction, Bitcoin’s previous reactions to regulatory threats, and the $10,500 support holding for the moment.The price of Bitcoin declined by more than 4% in two hours, a level of volatility it does not typically see.Usually, when Bitcoin falls with such intensity, it causes a cascade of liquidations. Since many trades in the futures market are highly leveraged, it leads to a loop of long contract liquidations, resulting in a larger fall.This time around, open interest and the volume in the futures market is significantly lower. There are fewer overleveraged trades actively open in the market and this reduces the probability of a massive correction.Over the years the cryptocurrency market has endured many negative regulatory actions enacted by governments across the world, but, as Bitcoin researcher Vijay Boyapati says, BTC strongly recovered from each one.While the charge against BitMEX could have a short-term bearish implication, in the longer term, Boyapati said a recovery is likely. He said:“The Bitcoin market has always reacted negatively to major exchange issues or government confiscations. Historically this has always presented a great buying opportunity for Bitcoin. The Department of Justice action against BitMEX will be no different.”For most of August and September, the $10,500 level has acted as a strong level of support. Bitcoin dropped below it briefly at times but quickly rebounded above it and this shows traders are confident that Bitcoin price will be higher in the future.Currently, traders are suggesting that the short-term trend of Bitcoin remains cautious but neutral in the medium term. Cryptocurrency trader Cantering Clark wrote:“In the near term, I think this presents some great two-way trade opportunities. Ultimately, a week from now, it's water under the bridge. This place has a short-term attention span and is quick to react.”Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, echoed a similar point of view. He stated:“People are responding: 'Don't you know about the Bitmex news?' Yeah, I do know. I also know about the tons of hacks that occurred on cryptocurrency exchanges, which became 'the' reason for a drop. I trade levels. News is 99% after due to inside info.”At the time of writing, Bitcoin price continues to trade within a symmetrical triangle and the $10,500 level is holding as support. For traders who focus on support / resistance levels, $10,200 is an important price to watch.If the price were to break below this level, many traders still expect the $10,000-$9,800 range to hold as support as buyers excitedly purchased dips to this level all throughout September."
247,"You can tell from Brian Armstrong’s opening words that he’s a numbers guy.“There have been a lot of difficult events in the world this year,” understated the Coinbase CEO in announcing that forthwith, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States would do a better job of ignoring them.According to Armstrong’s recent blog post, Coinbase’s mission is to “create an open financial system for the world.” He left out the second half of the company’s mission statement, the part about being “the leading global brand for helping people convert digital currency into and out of their local currency,” which doesn’t convey the nobility of his purpose as clearly, but does specify the source of his profits.And it’s really that part we should be focusing on, not the “economic freedom” that he describes as central to Coinbase’s purpose. Because Armstrong doesn’t address economic freedom in his letter. He doesn’t discuss why it is important, or why there’s a need for it, or who is suffering from a lack of it.Armstrong’s “mission focused” missive, which commits the company to apoliticization, conveniently overlooks the fact that economic freedom is a political and human issue. Proscribed activities at Coinbase now include debating “causes or political candidates internally” and taking on “activism outside of our core mission at work.”Taken in conjunction with the email he subsequently sent to employees in which he offered severance packages worth between four and six months’ pay to those who agreed that “life is too short to work at a company you aren’t excited about,” Armstrong’s posturing on the subject of non-posturing appears to be nothing more than a love letter to stakeholders in a potential IPO, complete with a rich dowry — the excision of dissent from Coinbase’s body politic.A direct listing for the $8 billion-valued Coinbase has been the subject of speculation within the industry, and that was also the vehicle chosen by Palantir to “cement billionaire fortunes” for co-founder Peter Thiel and CEO Alexander Karp. In a direct listing, shareholders sell directly to buyers and avoid lockups. And how crypto is that?It’s surely no coincidence that Armstrong’s email to employees was penned just a couple of weeks after  Karp told investors, ahead of his own IPO, that if they want to change the client base or culture they should “pick a different company.”Karp, not incidentally, has also stated that Silicon Valley’s “engineering elite… may know more than most about building software. But they do not know more about how society should be organized or what justice requires.”It’s almost as though Armstrong were reading the Palantir IPO playbook.Microsoft president Brad Smith is on record this year as saying that ""I don’t think our employees are naive. I think sometimes they are idealistic. I think the world needs a combination of idealism and pragmatism."" But he’s one of a diminishing number of tech executives who seem to be comfortable with the notion that employees don’t want to check their beliefs at the entrance to the ‘plex or the Park.Earlier this year Google fired four employees that it described as “engaged in intentional and often repeated violations of our longstanding data-security policies.” All four had, coincidentally, denounced the company’s treatment of its workers, and were uncomfortable with the company’s relationships with certain government customers.At Salesforce, employees protested the company’s relationship with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Amazon employees railed against selling facial recognition software to law enforcement agencies. Even Google relented in the face of employee opposition to using AI technology on a drone strike project.It’s clear that despite the extraordinarily employer-centric nature of American labor laws — which essentially offer carte blanche to employers to fire anyone, anytime, for any reason other than discrimination — Big Tech is facing a reckoning internally as well as externally.And it’s into this morass that Armstrong has waded, tepidly wielding a commitment to create an anodyne workplace bereft of political discourse that will surely thrill potential investors in Coinbase’s will-they-won’t-they IPO.There was a time when Google’s motto was “Don’t be evil.” It was a simple, elegant exhortation that helped align the company with the motivations and beliefs of its employees, customers, and yes, even investors. Evil may not have been defined, but that was part of the beauty of the sentiment. It deferred to the sense of righteousness that exists in each of us who choose to work within a “mission focused” organization.Today that motto is “Do the right thing.” Tell me that isn’t doublespeak for “We’ll decide what’s right, and you can tag along.”Creating an open financial system for the world is why many of us are involved in the digital asset industry. But our missions, plural, do not exist in a vacuum. And while there is plenty of self-serving in the crypto industry, the opportunity to rectify inequities appeals to many.Some of us interpret the “economic freedom” enabled by cryptocurrency as an opportunity to escape centralized authority, or to dodge the surveillance capitalists. Some of us see economic freedom as providing a financial infrastructure to the less advantaged citizens of our planet. Some see it as a personal message, a chance to secure our own economic freedom through investment opportunities that are more inclusive than the Cantillon Effect-perpetuating Accredited Investor rules.However we see it, economic freedom is an inherently political issue. Try as Armstrong might, it cannot be extricated from its historical context and neatly packaged up as a marketing slogan.Or maybe it can. After all, Palantir lists three guiding ideas on its website, including “Keep focused on the mission,"" which isn't a million miles from Armstrong's twice-mentioned ""laser focus on the mission.""You don’t need a B.A. in Economics to see where this is going.Cointelegraph is interested in hearing the stories of Coinbase employees and their reaction to Mr. Armstrong's letter.

248,"Bitcoin (BTC) may see a price boost this week as the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) weakens and one analyst tells American voters to buy.Data showed DXY dropping for a fourth day on Oct. 1, as negotiations over a new coronavirus stimulus deal continued in Washington.DXY and BTC/USD have demonstrated a strong inverse correlation in recent months. Recent DXY gains did not translate into intense selling pressure for Bitcoin, but fresh losses could yet buoy BTC bulls in the long term.The U-turn in DXY’s fortunes comes as the United States Senate attempts to thrash out a new deal on coronavirus aid which could come with a $2.5 trillion price tag.Speaking to FOX Business on Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed that talks were ongoing, but that any deal would include a fresh round of $1,200 stimulus checks for eligible U.S. citizens.“The good news is we’ve reached an agreement that if there is a deal, there are direct payments similar to last time that are in the package,” he said. Mnuchin was speaking a day after a heated debate between President Donald Trump and presidential hopeful Joe Biden. As tensions flared, popular trader Tone Vays sought to get viewers’ attention online by arguing that no matter who takes over control of the White House, money printing, like that which finances stimulus packages, would continue to hurt the dollar.“No matter who wins they will keep printing so BUY BITCOIN,” Vays wrote in a live chat as the debate aired.U.S. dollar currency index 3-month chart.

249,"The rising energy demand of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) has been a hotly debated topic. But the 3rd Global Cryptoasset Benchmarking Study by the University of Cambridge shows that 76% of cryptocurrency miners use electricity from renewable energy sources as part of their energy mix.The study found that over 39% of the total energy consumed by PoW cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and others comes from renewable energy sources. This is in contrast to a previous such study by the university, which found that only 28% of the total energy consumed for cryptocurrency mining came from renewable resources. In 2018, 60% of the miners used renewable energy sources as part of their energy mix.According to the latest study, hydroelectric power is the most common source of energy for miners. Almost 62% of miners are reported to be using hydroelectricity. Coal and natural gas sources take the second and third spots at 38% and 36%, respectively.Wind, oil and solar energy are the three other common energy sources for cryptocurrency miners.The report further divides miner energy consumption by region, noting that miners from Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America and North America use an almost equal percentage of hydroelectric power as compared to electricity from other sources such as coal, natural gas, wind and oil. Energy from coal is most common in the APAC region, contributing almost an equal amount of electricity to miners as hydroelectric sources. No miners from Latin America use coal-fired electricity to mine cryptos.The report also notes that APAC miners contribute almost 77% of the Bitcoin hash power but use the lowest amounts of renewable energy sources. And while North America adds only 8%of the total hash power, 63% of the energy consumed in mining Bitcoin came from renewable sources. Europe is only second to North America with almost 30% of its cryptocurrency mining powered using renewable energy. The continent contributes nearly 10% of the worldwide Bitcoin hash power."
250,"Active addresses and transaction counts on the Bitcoin SV network saw unbelievable growth in the two days leading up to the CoinGeek Live conference in New York this week.Active BSV addresses grew from 110,000 on Sept. 28 to 947,400 addresses today.That’s an astonishing growth rate of 761% in just two days leading up to CoinGeek Live, which kicked off on Sept. 30 at 9 am New York time and will run until Oct. 2.The spike in active addresses raised eyebrows on Crypto Twitter. Bitcoin SV and Craig Wright antagonist Arthur van Pelt reposted SirToshi's chart that calls attention to the fact BSV has managed to overtake the Ethereum network in the middle of a DeFi boom. He said sarcastically:Bitcoin influencer ‘Holdlonaut’ responded with a facepalm emoji.Transactions on the Bitcoin SV network more than doubled in the same period from 715.6K to 1,751K today. That’s a growth of 145% in the 48 hours leading up to the conference. Average transaction values, meanwhile, fell by two-thirds over the same period.However, it’s possible the spike could simply be a coincidence, as the network does see some unusual bursts of activity on occasion. Active addresses spiked to over 1 million briefly on June 24, and transactions spiked to 5.5 million on July 10.The CoinGeek Live conference is mostly an online affair and features speakers including nChain’s controversial chief scientist Wright, Bitcoin Association President Jimmy Nguyen and Fundstrat Global managing partner Thomas Lee.In his opening address, Nguyen said that Bitcoin SV has incentives to discourage bad behavior and noted that the original Bitcoin whitepaper mentions the word “honest” 15 times.According to CoinGeek’s report on Nguyen’s address, Bitcoin SV currently processes more 2,800 transactions per second on its mainnet, and is aiming for 50,000 in the near future. The forthcoming Teranode enterprise-tier protocol aims to have 1TB transaction blocks.Nguyen said that Bitcoin SV is “the foundational rule set for an entire network,” and is “re-inventing the internet.”In somewhat related news, the Supreme Court of Norway has rejected Craig Wright’s jurisdictional appeal. The Satoshi claimant had been trying to sue Hodlonaut for libel in the U.K. but will now have to go through Norwegian courts.Hodlonaut said the court has awarded him another $6,000 in costs on top of the $60,000 in costs already awarded:Supreme Court in Norway today rejected CSW’s jurisdiction appeal, awarding me costs of $6,000 on top of the $60,000 already owed.

251,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has remained relatively flat for September and the strong decline in altcoin and DeFi token prices seems to be making the situation worse for many investors. Despite this lack of bullish momentum, on-chain data reveals that new participants are joining the Bitcoin network at an alarming rate.  Although the price has failed to react to the sharp inflow of new participants, on-chain analyst Willy Woo believes that this is a strongly bullish sign. Sept. 30 Woo tweeted:“We're seeing a spike in activity by new participants coming into BTC not yet reflected in price, it doesn't happen often. This is what traders call a divergence, in this case it's obviously bullish”Bitcoin: Number of new entities vs price. Source: GlassnodeAs shown by the chart above, the number of new entities joining the Bitcoin network has been rising steeply since last week and the metric clearly surpassed the numbers recorded in August. The metric measures the number of clusters (wallets) owned by a given person or group.Some analysts believe that the surge in new entities could partially be attributed to the strong pullback in DeFi tokens and altcoins. In the past 30 days many have registered double-digit losses and this may have left investors looking for safer alternatives in the crypto market.While the price of Bitcoin has repeatedly failed to break through the $11,000 level, it has remained stable above $10,000 for the past month. Given the current economic and political chaos sweeping through the U.S. and other countries impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, Bitcoin’s price stability strengthens the argument that  Bitcoin is a solid store of value.Although the U.S. dollar has remained the most sought after asset in the face of the recent financial crisis, it’s possible that a second wave of coronavirus infections may negatively impact the global economy. Such an event would likely prod investors to invest in assets like gold and Bitcoin, especially if the dollar loses strength."
252,"Kosala Hemachandra, founder and CEO of crypto asset storage platform, MyEtherWallet, mined Bitcoin as a way to pay his Los Angeles rent between 2014-2015. When it came time to pay his bills, he would convert his coins into cash to facilitate the actual transaction.In conversation with Cointelegraph, Hemachandra reminisced about purchasing Bitcoin mining equipment in college while renting a room at his friend's home. ""I bought a Bitcoin miner and then I had it in my room,"" he told Cointelegraph in an interview. ""I was mining it and the amount that I earned through Bitcoin mining was enough to pay the rent for that room, so it was basically free, and then I did not have to pay extra for electricity.""During the first several years of Bitcoin's existence, mining proved to be a far more profitable gambit which required less advanced equipment than it does today.It wasn't all fun and games, however. Hemachandra noted ominously that Bitcoin mining equipment gives off significant heat, making life in that LA room a toasty experience. ""It's not as fun as it sounds,"" he said, explaining that the San Fernando Valley where he lived frequently hosted outside temperatures near 90 degrees Fahrenheit.""Since I'm running a Bitcoin miner in my room, it goes above that, and then the air conditioner I had, it was barely working,"" he remembers.

This bolstered the number of crypto transactions on their respective platforms, with 11% of responding customers stating that they were using crypto and other digital payment methods for the first time.The report also adds:“The interviewed merchants identified an opportunity to grow sales by reaching a new customer segment that prefers to pay with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies when shopping online. While cryptocurrency buyers still represent a relatively small share of spending, cryptocurrency recognition is significant and growing.”At the beginning of September, a British online food delivery platform called “Just Eat” added cryptocurrency payment support for its subsidiary in France."

255,"Bitcoin price is showing weakness after another sharp rejection from the $11,000 resistance level. As Bitcoin (BTC) enters the fourth quarter, the sentiment around the market remains generally cautious and neutral.Bitcoin might face a larger pullback in the fourth quarter due to several key factors. Throughout the past three years, every September monthly candle has closed red. The September monthly candle for 2020 is also on track to close as a red candle, indicating a lack of direction.From March through August, favorable financial conditions, a low-interest-rate environment and a multitrillion-dollar stimulus package caused Bitcoin and stocks to rally in tandem. In the upcoming months, due to the United States presidential election in November, the probability of a delayed stimulus approval is increasing. The growing uncertainty around the macro landscape and the financial markets in the U.S. could pressure BTC.Traders are generally cautious in the short term and optimistic in the medium to long term. Technical analysts have identified key price levels for BTC as $9,800, $10,700 and $11,800. As long as Bitcoin remains in between either the $9,800–$10,700 or $10,700–$11,800 ranges, low volatility is expected. As such, while traders are cautious around the near-term trend of Bitcoin, many do not foresee a large drop.As a potential area of interest, traders are considering the $9,600 CME gap that forms when Bitcoin price rises or falls below the CME Bitcoin futures market price after it closes for weekends or holidays. The $9,600 gap has yet to be filled, and given the tendency of most CME gaps to get filled, the level remains a target.The monthly candle of Bitcoin is expected to close below $11,000, which would confirm a red candle for the month of September. In technical analysis, if a new candle closes below the closure of the previous, it’s called a “bearish engulfing.”Additionally, Bitcoin’s monthly close would come after repeated rejections, as since Aug. 17, BTC has recorded four consecutive lower highs on the daily chart. A lower-high formation emerges when the latest peak is below the previous peak. In this instance, Bitcoin peaked at $12,468, $12,050, $11,179 and $10,950, respectively.Bitcoin faces two bearish technical patterns and structures on the monthly and daily charts. The two time frames are considered high time-frame charts in technical analysis, which could raise the probability of a short-term pullback.The price of Bitcoin briefly broke out of the $10,800 resistance level on Sept. 28. but a pseudonymous trader known as “Byzantine General” said it was most likely a bull trap. BTC rose to as high as $10,950 across major exchanges but was “hugging” the resistance level. When BTC struggles to cleanly break out of a key resistance level, the chance of a bull trap is high.Quick tip.

When $BTC consolidates just above support and keeps hugging it, it's almost always a bull trap.
Especially when the consolidation slopes downward.

When bitcoin breaks out, it usually blasts away and doesn't give anyone a chance to get in. pic.twitter.com/LQZtf6P6lBBitcoin’s recent fall from $10,950 signifies rejections at the monthly, daily and hourly time frames, as they demonstrate cautious/bearish structures in the short term. When that coincides with a monthly candle closure, it could amplify a near-term downtrend.The historical performance of BTC suggests a downtrend, as during the past two consecutive quarters, BTC recorded 42.46% and 13.59% drops, respectively. Given the tendency of BTC to underperform in the last quarter in the previous two years, the chances of a slow fourth quarter remain high.However, after undergoing a halving in 2016, BTC had a positive fourth quarter, recording an increase from $613.98 to $998.33. BTC is currently in a post-halving cycle, and if it follows past trends, it could see a gradual climb over the next 12 months. In the 2016 halving cycle, BTC took 15 months to peak at $20,000, which has remained an all-time high.In the past month, the U.S. stock market has continued to slump due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The concerns surrounding a second wave have been amplified by the lack of stimulus and the uncertainty around vaccines. A stimulus package would alleviate pressure from the economy and distribute direct checks to individuals, raising the overall liquidity in the market.However, Bitcoin, gold, stocks and risk-on assets are entering the fourth quarter without stimulus and with surging COVID-19 cases, and due to the election in November, Washington has been in a stimulus stalemate. House Democrats are reportedly preparing a $2.4 trillion stimulus proposal with direct payments. Whether it would be approved before the presidential election remains uncertainInvestor confidence has remained low throughout September, as a result. According to Bank of America, investors withdrew $25.8 billion from the stock market last week. This marked the biggest single-week outflow since June 2019 when trade-war fears raged. In a note, strategists at Bank of America cited the lack of clarity on the stimulus as a catalyst for the outflows, stating: ""With the biggest fiscal stimulus behind us and without explicit MMT hard for policy to catalyze big upside for stocks and credit next 6 months given starting valuations.”Although Bitcoin has increasingly decoupled from stocks and has shown more correlation with gold, it remains generally affected by the broader financial market’s sentiment. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Denis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto exchange and broker Bequant, said macro and political developments have been driving cryptocurrencies:Since June, on-chain indicators have continuously indicated a bullish uptrend for Bitcoin. Various on-chain indicators — ranging from whale activity, HODLing activity, address activity, hash rate and dormant supply — signal a healthy accumulation phase for Bitcoin.For instance, Glassnode chief technical officer Rafael Schultze-Kraft cited the “Bitcoin Short Term Holder MVRV” to suggest that BTC is at a pivotal point. He said that the on-chain indicator suggests a trend reversal when it hits 1. The last time it hit 1 was in March when BTC recovered from a steep correction to $3,600. Kraft said:Soona Amhaz, general partner at Volt Capital, referred to the address activity of the Bitcoin blockchain to pinpoint a healthy sentiment, saying it indicates substantive user growth. Overall, technical structures point toward short-term weakness and a longer-term accumulation phase. The uncertainty in the financial markets could intensify the selling pressure on BTC in the foreseeable future, but on-chain metrics depict a healthy, gradual growth rate for the network."
256,"Despite being, perhaps, the biggest tech buzzword of the last decade, blockchain technology has largely remained just that: a buzzword. While its best-known implementation, Bitcoin (BTC), has become a household name, the technology that underpins it remains little more than a mystery for most.By and large, this can be attributed to slow progress in the adoption of the technology for consumers and businesses, caused by divided attention. Rather than a collective push to build advancements only on the Bitcoin blockchain, we’ve instead seen a clamor to build too many alternate blockchain platforms.Resources that could have been used to scale the Bitcoin blockchain and develop new applications of its underlying technology have instead been applied to proliferating thousands of competing digital currencies and hundreds of alternate blockchain or distributed ledger technologies, driven by the pursuit of quick riches from launching a new venture’s own coin yet diversified by little more than three-letter ticker symbols.And so, our understanding of blockchain technology and its immense potential has largely failed to progress beyond its original use case for peer-to-peer electronic cash. Despite promises of a future in which smart contracts, identity management systems and data are all powered by the Bitcoin blockchain as part of everyday life, progress remains quantified solely by lines on trading charts.In large part, this is because people embraced too narrow a view of Bitcoin, thinking its blockchain was only intended for transferring monetary value. At its base level, a blockchain is simply a distributed data ledger used to permanently record transactions in an open, chronological, verifiable manner.When thinking about transactions, particularly as they pertain to blockchain technology, it’s easy to focus solely on payment transactions. But data transactions are a foundational aspect of modern life — in business, economics, law, politics, etc. Transactions that exchange information are everywhere around us. Yet how we deal with information transactions and the tools we use to manage them have failed to keep pace with the digitization of the rest of our lives.And with blockchain, our understanding of transactions must broaden further.Every communication, every contract, every task, every process and every payment can ultimately be distilled to a data transaction, similar to how every activity on the internet is ultimately broken down into data packets to be transmitted across the World Wide Web.As with blockchain, the internet initially developed from a first use case of the underlying data network: email for researchers over the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, or ARPANET. Building upon the TCP/IP communications protocol implemented over ARPANET, internet pioneers developed and scaled the internet to become the critical infrastructure it is today. Essential to realizing that vision was a commitment to a foundational common protocol, without which the openness and interconnectedness of the internet that transformed the world as we know it would not have been possible.And therein lies the issue with the development, so far, of blockchain technology. In a rush to capitalize on a growing wave of speculative investment, the numerous new attempted blockchains and distributed ledgers to emerge after Bitcoin have brought with them different variations of blockchain protocols, forcing competition not just on the price of their competing digital currencies but on entire network rulesets and ecosystems.Hundreds of different competing systems aren’t just inefficient — they undermine much of the transformative advantage of blockchain, which is to eliminate data silos, enable easy transacting with anyone and create a single source of information truth. Had hundreds of competing digital communications networks proliferated in the 1990s rather than consolidated around a single, ubiquitous internet with one World Wide Web, the immense value creation and information awakening that resulted would likely look very different today.We didn’t let that happen with the internet, so why should blockchain be any different?It’s time to get serious about the future of blockchain technology. It’s time for one world, one chain.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
257,"A widespread debate among investors is the correlation of Bitcoin (BTC) with other markets. A high degree of correlation between the equity markets and Bitcoin has existed, particularly in the last few months. In other periods, gold and Bitcoin appear to move in tandem.However, the correlation that should be watched the most is the dollar since the global economy is based on the strength or weakness of our world reserve currency, the United States dollar.BTC/USD vs. Gold vs. DXY 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe chart above shows gold, Bitcoin, and dollar values since the crash in March. The orange line is gold, the blue line the U.S. Dollar Currency Index (DXY), and the regular price of Bitcoin is shown by the black line.The sudden impact of the global pandemic increased the demand for U.S. Dollars, surging heavily in March as seen by the large blue spike. This spike caused the other markets to tumble as the price of Bitcoin dropped by 50% to as low as $3,700.However, since this massive crash, the DXY has been weakening day-by-day. This sudden weakness of the dollar caused other “safe haven” assets to rise significantly over the past six months. Bitcoin has increased 185% since the crash of March while Gold rallied 31%.But despite the general downtrend still intact, the U.S. dollar has seen a relief bounce in early September as a bottom construction was made. A bullish divergence was created to mark the start of the temporary bottom pattern, after which the 92.75 level was reclaimed as support for further continuation upward.U.S. Dollar Currency Index 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThis relief rally reached 94.60 points and caused other assets to drop substantially. Hence, more weakness in the commodity and crypto markets should be expected if the DXY continues toward 96 points.BTC/USD vs DXY 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewThe previous cycle highs were hit in 2014 and 2017 for Bitcoin, through which credible data can be derived from the correlation between the U.S. Dollar and Bitcoin.Throughout 2017, the U.S. Dollar showed significant weakness across the boards, as the EUR/USD pair rallied from 1.03 to 1.25 too. During this uncertainty and instability of the U.S. Dollar, Bitcoin had its peak rally from $1,000 to $20,000.More interestingly is the fact that Bitcoin’s peak high is surrounded by the cycle low of the DXY index.Since then, the DXY index has been showing some strength. Through this strength, the Bitcoin bear market was fueled until the previous months.A substantial weakness of the DXY index is causing the price of Bitcoin and Gold to continue rallying. Is history going to repeat itself?DXY Index vs. Gold 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewWhat can be derived from the chart above is the strength of gold since the dot com bubble popped in 2000. During the first stages of a potential crash is the liquidation phase when all markets drop as gold also corrected 30% in 2000. This is the hunt for liquidity to cover losses on the equity markets similar to what has been witnessed in March 2020.However, since the USD showed weakness in 2000, gold has been showing tremendous strength as a safe haven, which would have increased your portfolio by 600%.In the same period, the EUR/USD pair rallied from 0.85 to 1.60 in 2008. The momentum then flipped as investors flew to the USD as a hedge during the credit crisis.But in the current times of uncertainty with negative interest rates, increased debt levels, and deflation, Bitcoin is also doing relatively well.Of course, a potential drop by 25-35% could occur in the first stage of the crisis just like in March. But Bitcoin and gold would benefit significantly afterward as safe havens against a weakening dollar, which is precisely what happened in December 2017 as BTC hit its all-time high of nearly $20,000.The simple reasoning for this is that confidence in governments will also drop during times of economic uncertainty, e.g. the corona pandemic or systematic risk. Given this uncertainty and exponentially growing debt, the U.S. central bank has one option: devalue the currency, which means further weakness for the dollar.In other words, the prophecy of six-figure prices can become a reality if the dollar’s weakness continues into 20201.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

258,"A large goup of accomplaces allegedly financing a jihadist network in Syria have been arrested after a sting operation by French police — despite choosing cryptocurrency coupons in an attempt to cover their tracks.In a statement, police said that ""constant surveillance of these networks prompted terrorist organisations to seek more opacity by using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin,"" as reported on Sept. 30.Since 2019, the 29 accomplices have allegedly been supporting the operations of an  Al-Qaeda affiliate terror organization, called “Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham.” The network’s architects are reportedly two French jihadists in their mid-20s, who are both thought to be in northeastern Syria at present. Both were sentenced to 10 years in prison in absentia in 2016.The 29 members of the network were busted after being caught purchasing cryptocurrency coupons worth between 10 and 150 euros each ($12–$176) on multiple occasions in recent months from tobacco outlets across France.These outlets, known in French as tabacs, were last year integrated into crypto coupon services to encourage the adoption of cryptocurrencies by the French public.Today’s report on the financing of Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham notes that there are currently around 24,000 licensed tabacs across the country. Alongside the coupons the defendants allegedly used to credit their Syrian accomplices’ Bitcoin (BTC) accounts, these tabacs support a range of small payments services like cashcard top-ups and money coupons. These services, notably, don’t require proof-of-identity.The anti-terror prosecutors' office has claimed that the use of cryptocurrency coupons by the network represents a turn away from the more prevalent choice of cash to support nefarious activities.As Cointelegraph previously reported, a range of militant groups, most of which are defined as terrorist organizations by some countries, have increasingly turned to cryptocurrencies to support their fundraising activities. Most of these organizations are financially isolated, with many global banks barring services to them using illicit terror financing prevention mechanisms."

That number comfortably beats any other Q3 close on record, the next highest being last year’s $8,310.What’s more, Bitcoin may seal the second-best quarterly close of its lifetime — but that depends on whether it can stay above Q2 2019’s $10,590.“One more day to go and still looking like second-best quarterly close for bitcoin but it's a close call with Q2 2020,” Skew commented.Bitcoin quarterly closing prices summary.

The opinion is mixed for the short term, and concerns remain that BTC/USD may still drop to fill the last remaining CME futures “gap” at $9,600.“There’s a rangebound structure with the upper resistance zone at $10,800,” Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe summarized in an update on Tuesday.If BTC/USD fails to crack that resistance, he said, it was “very likely” that support levels lower down would be tested, notably $10,600, with potential for $10,400 and $10,200 to come into play.

As Cointelegraph reported, long-term behavioral patterns remain true to form for Bitcoin, with this week proving no different.Difficulty ribbon compression, a metric designed to quantify suitable BTC/USD entry points, has left its lower green “buy” zone for the first time since March.Network fundamentals also speak to overall strength, with difficulty itself at all-time highs and set for another upwards readjustment of around 3% in three days’ time.Hash rate, a measure of the estimated computing power being directed to mining, is also trending back towards its highest-ever levels.Among traders, however, discussion remains of potential near-term lows, including a dip below the CME gap toward $9,000."
260,"The Bitcoin (BTC) reserves of exchanges are continuing to drop, which suggests retail investors and whales might be accumulating.According to data from CryptoQuant, all exchanges’ reserves dropped to 2.4 million BTC, which is equivalent to $25 billion. In contrast, in October 2019, exchanges had around 2.8 million BTC, currently worth $30 billion.Bitcoin reserves on all exchanges throughout the past year. Source: CryptoQuantThe reserves of exchanges increase when investors deposit Bitcoin. Typically, deposits or inflows are considered selling pressure, because traders have to send BTC to exchanges in order to sell.Hence, when exchange inflows decline, it often signifies that the appetite to sell BTC by investors is declining.Another chart from CryptoQuant depicts the trend of net inflows of Bitcoin into exchanges in the same timeframe.Throughout the past two months, net inflows have generally remained in the negative 20,000 BTC level. Net inflows sharply dropped in recent weeks, specifically as BTC sharply rebounded from $10,300 to above $10,700.On Sep. 26, Cointelegraph reported that large whale clusters emerged at $10,407. Whale clusters form when whales accumulate new BTC and do not touch the new holdings. Clusters usually indicate that whales are beginning to accumulate in a new area.Considering the accumulation trend and the resilience of BTC above $10,000, investors likely have little appetite to sell.All exchange Bitcoin net inflow. Source: CryptoQuantDue to the confluence of the lacking willingness to sell BTC at current prices and consistent accumulation, BTC is on track for a strong quarterly close.Another possible reason behind the steep fall in exchange net flows might have been large-scale hacks.

BTC closed the second quarter at around $9,140. It would have to stay above $10,600 to secure the second-best quarterly close.The quarterly closing prices of Bitcoin since 2014. Source: SkewThere are several reasons behind the strong performance of Bitcoin throughout the third quarter. Most notably, BTC rallied in tandem with gold and stocks after the U.S. approved a stimulus bill.The initial kick start of a market-wide recovery from the stimulus, combined with a low-interest-rate environment, created a favorable macro backdrop. The analysts at Skew said:“One more day to go and still looking like second best quarterly close for #bitcoin but it's a close call with Q2 2020.”Throughout the year’s end, there are three key fundamental and macro factors that could buoy Bitcoin’s sentiment, namely the weakening U.S. dollar, the prospect of a stimulus package and vaccines.Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar is continuing to show weakness against reserve currencies, in the likes of the yen, yuan and franc as the Fed has doubled down on its average inflation targeting strategy. But while the prolonged weakness of the dollar might put the U.S. stock market at risk of underperforming against other markets, it should directly benefit Bitcoin and gold, which are priced against the USD."

262,"The number of investors interested in yield farming has grown immensely over the past 6-months as decentralized finance (DeFi) applications became better known and easier to use. This has led to an uncountable number of liquidity pools offering annual percentage yields (APY) surpassing 1,000% and the total value locked in DeFi contracts has risen to billions of dollars.Bitcoin investors who wanted a piece of the action managed to participate in DeFi yield farming by converting their BTC into tokenized formats like Wrapped BTC (WBTC) and renBTC (RENBTC). This allows BTC holders to interact with all of the ERC-20-based tokens, but some analysts question how decentralized the Bitcoin custody is behind those offerings; therefore, it makes sense to explore more centralized solutions.Although it is impossible to directly extract yield on Bitcoin (BTC) deposits at these DeFi platforms, investors can still benefit from centralized services. While it is improbable to find APYs above 12% there are at least safer ways to earn yield on ‘uninvested’ Bitcoin.Centralized services such as Bitfinex, Poloniex, BlockFi, and Nexo will typically yield 5% to 10% per year for BTC and stablecoin deposits. To increase payout, one needs to seek higher risk, which does not necessarily mean a less known exchange or intermediary. By trading BTC options at Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), Deribit, or OKEx, an investor can comfortably achieve 40% or higher yields.The buyer of a call option can acquire Bitcoin for a fixed price on a set future date. For that privilege, this buyer pays an upfront for the call option seller. Although the buyer might typically use this instrument as an insurance, sellers are mostly obtaining fixed income trades.Each contract has a predetermined maturity date and strike price, so potential gains and losses can be calculated beforehand. This covered call strategy consists of simultaneously holding BTC and selling the equivalent size in call options.It would be unfair to name it a fixed income trade, as potential losses loom whenever there is a more considerable price drop at options expiry. However, one can adjust such risk while setting up the trade. It is worth noting that limiting exposure will result in lower yields.Expected returns for a November $9.5K covered call. Source: DeribitThe above chart represents a covered call strategy for the November expiry, yielding a 6% return in two months, equivalent to 41% APY. As previously mentioned, the covered call might present losses if the BTC price at expiry is lower than the strategy threshold level.Although the 6% yield achieved by selling 0.5 BTC at $9K and 0.5 BTC $10K call options, the strategy needs BTC to sustain above $10K at the November 27 expiry to achieve its full return. Any level below $8,960 will result in a loss, but that is 16.6% below the current $10,750 Bitcoin price.By selling these call options, the investors will make 0.1665 BTC ($1,957 at current price); therefore, the covered call investor should acquire the remaining 0.8335 BTC ($9,793) either via futures regular spot markets. However, if the buyer is unwilling to take this risk, it is possible to reduce the loss threshold.It is worth noting that most derivative exchanges allow option trades starting from BTC 0.10, with CME being the only exception.Expected returns for a November $8.5K covered call. Source: DeribitA 25% APY return can be achieved by selling 0.5 BTC $8K and 0.5 BTC $9K November call options. By reducing expected returns, one will only face negative outcomes below $8,370 at the November 27 expiry, 22% below the current spot price. Take notice of how the $313 net profit stabilizes above $9K outcomes. To achieve this equilibrium, one needs to buy $8,187 worth of BTC, either via futures or regular spot markets. The call options premium will raise the remaining BTC 0.303 ($3,257), but only the option seller gets paid beforehand.Implied volatility is options markets main risk gauge, and it increases as traders perceive a higher risk of sudden price moves. This indicator will increase regardless of investors’ optimism, as volatility relies exclusively on absolute price changes. A constant daily 4% loss across a few weeks results in extremely low volatility, which would be the same as a fixed daily 4% gain. The volatility will increase in periods of extreme uncertainty; therefore, option sellers will demand a larger premium.Bitcoin 3-month options implied volatility. Source: SkewAs Skew data shows, the BTC 3-month options implied volatility currently stands at a 59% annualized basis. Despite being relatively low, the figure is still enough to provide a 41% APY using covered call strategies.Investors can benefit from a higher reading, but the risk of suffering losses using covered calls also increases. This reflects traders’ fear of unexpected price swings; therefore, an increased implied volatility indicates higher odds of an expiry price below the options strategies’ profit threshold.All passive yield strategies have embedded risks. While it is possible to use a stop loss on covered calls, it should be noted that options markets can be reasonably illiquid during intense BTC price swings. This means it’s important here to never close futures or spot positions independently from the options.DeFi might have its appeal, and even if one is willing to accept the risks associated with wrapped BTC, there are unknowns from faulty smart contracts, potential DeFi protocol breaches, clogs in the Ethereum network during peak traffic and the increased fees which can reduce profits and amplify losses. Outside individual pools and DeFi apps, there’s also room for oracle price sourcing manipulation which can cause cascading liquidations.The main advantage of the covered call is it enables investors to set their own appetite for risk and have a clearer picture of their potential profits. By opting for centralized solutions, investors can avoid high gas fees and the risk of being front run by wealthier or more savvy DeFi farmers.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

263,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) abruptly dropped on Sep. 29 from $10,950 to $10,630 overnight, recording a 3% drop. Following the rejection at $11,000, the sentiment of traders remains mixed.Some are cautiously optimistic under the premise that BTC reclaims the $10,700 level. Technically, analysts say that the $10.7k area is a critical pivotal price point for Bitcoin in the near term.Others say that the price trend of BTC has reversed in the short term after its rejection. The intense reaction of Bitcoin to a crucial resistance level at $11,000 presents a threat of a larger pullback.According to a pseudonymous trader known as “Byzantine General,” there are three key macro levels for Bitcoin.The three levels are found at $10,700, $9,800, and $11,800, with $10.7k presenting a near-term roadblock for BTC. The trader said:“10700 seems to be a key level. 9800 & 11800 are the closest 2 other important levels.”If Bitcoin convincingly reclaims $10,700, it would raise the probability for a retest of $11,800 heading into October. A new monthly candle would open on Oct. 1, and a price spike with a market open could occur.The price chart of Bitcoin with key levels. Source: Byzantine GeneralBut if BTC fails to remain above $10,700, it would amplify the chances of seeing $9,800. That would also make the $9,600 CME gap retest highly likely if BTC were to reject $10,700.Another pseudonymous Bitcoin trader known as “Benjamin Blunts” foresees the “savage rejection” causing a larger correction.He said that the recent rejection of Bitcoin at $10,950 tapped a critical Fibonacci level. In technical analysis, levels in the Fibonacci Sequence are considered pivotal areas for a potential trend reversal.The trader said a drop below $10,000, possibly to the $9,600 to $9,800 support range, could happen. He said:“Like clockwork, perfect tap of the 0.78 for BTC and savage rejection from it. expecting a new low below 9.5k from here, however am short ETH instead because I think it will fall more. make no mistake, this is a clear downtrend imo, back into mainly stables again.”Atop the bearish rejection, on-chain indicators and network activity signal short-term bearishness. Researchers at Santiment said the address activity on the Bitcoin blockchain has been slowing. The number of active Bitcoin addresses drops. Source: SantimentDeclining fundamentals while the market uncertainty intensifies could cause heightened levels of selling pressure. The researchers said:“Why is $BTC continuing to see drop-offs occur whenever we near $11k? Our DAA Divergence model indicates the network is seeing a severe lack of address activity. Today is the 5th most bearish output in the past 6 mths.”Typically, on-chain indicators and metrics are medium to long-term signals, and they often do not accurately depict short-term price trends. Hence, in the near term, the price of Bitcoin would most likely depend on whether it retests $11,000 or risks falling to the low $10,000s.However, other analysts are nevertheless seeing bullish signs. The difficulty hash ribbon indicator, for example, has been signaling a “buy zone” for Bitcoin, which buoys the medium-term bull case for BTC."
264,"Bitcoin (BTC) simply needs history to repeat itself to see significant price rises, according to two indicators now flipping bullish.On Sep. 28, on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode noted that Bitcoin’s difficulty ribbon compression had broken out of its green “buy” zone for the first time since the March coronavirus crash.Difficulty ribbon compression is based on difficulty ribbons, a metric devised by statistician Willy Woo as a way to gauge optimal times to buy Bitcoin.Ribbons use simple moving average values for mining difficulty, contracting as miners sell BTC to balance costs and then capitulate, often at the end of bear markets. This leaves stronger miners, and price recovery and then growth ensue. Compression adds standard deviation to the mixture, allowing analysts to quantify ribbon compression and work out when to enter the market even more precisel“Difficulty Ribbon Compression is trending up and broke out of the green buy zone for the first time since March,” Glassnode commented the data on Twitter. “Historically, these have been periods characterized by a positive momentum indicating significant $BTC price increases.”Woo agreed, adding that difficulty ribbons were “more reliable personal favourites” among Bitcoin price metrics. He said that BTC investors should prepare for a “great Q4 2020.”Bitcoin difficulty ribbon compression historical chart showing buy zone breakouts.

265,"A company that allows consumers to invest in Bitcoin on a tax-free basis says it has seen demand surge in recent months.iTrustCapital allows Americans to gain exposure to the world’s biggest cryptocurrency through a self-directed individual retirement account, otherwise known as an IRA. These vehicles allow owners to get involved in a diverse array of alternative investments, such as digital assets, precious metals and real estate.According to the trading platform, increasing numbers of investors have been moving their current retirement accounts out of traditional financial institutions that usually only offer stocks and bonds. Interest in cryptocurrencies has been buoyed by a number of high-profile advertising campaigns of late, and some have started to view Bitcoin as a safe haven against inflation and mass sell-offs in the equities market.There’s also another factor at play: the Internal Revenue Service’s determination to clamp down on cryptocurrencies. iTrustCapital says the message is clear: “There is no excuse for investors to not track, report and pay taxes on every single crypto transaction unless it’s in a tax-free, self-directed IRA.”Anthony Bertolino, the company’s director of customer experience, explained: “Buying and selling in an iTrustCapital account feels very similar to using Coinbase. You simply log in and trade in just three clicks. What separates us apart is that our users don’t have to worry about taxes because our accounts are IRAs.”iTrustCapital believes that tax-free options will only become more popular as increasing numbers of investors begin to explore what the likes of Bitcoin have to offer. The company says this approach delivers comparable advantages to investing in crypto normally but without as much hassle. To reduce the barriers to entry even further, the company also gives its clients institutional wallet custody and security through Curv — a business that “sets the standard for digital asset security.”Announcing the partnership back in July 2019, iTrustCapital CEO Todd Southwick said: “We chose Curv because securing our clients’ funds is paramount. By eliminating the private key from the transaction entirely and relying on math instead of hardware, we ensure that no person or piece of software can make a transaction on its own.”Given how self-directed IRAs are used to prepare for retirement, peace of mind is paramount. To this end, investors also get access to a $50-million insurance policy through Munich Re — an S&P AA-rated international insurance company.Bitcoin is especially popular among millennials, and substantial inflows of capital are expected in the coming years. According to iTrustCapital, the tax-free model it offers will help increase this even further. Tim Shaler, an economist who advises the firm, said: “We predict technology like blockchain and digital assets will create a new segment that, in addition to access to retirement capital, will inspire new uses for tax-advantaged accounts. We expect to see $1.5 trillion of capital moving into this new asset class within five to seven years.”Although there are a number of IRA providers that unlock access to crypto for investors, the company says it’s important for interested consumers to perform as much research as possible into the fees that these providers charge. In a recent blog post, Blake Skadron, the chief operating officer of iTrustCapital, wrote: “My number one red flag when researching any product or service is whether or not they clearly display their pricing and fees upfront. If you have to speak to someone to find out what it will cost you, the odds are you will pay too much.”Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

267,"In a February 8, 2011 post on Bitcointalk, Finney said that reading a book titled “Guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography” by Hankerson, Menezes, and Vanstone, gave him an idea of how to speed up signature verification by 25%. In the following post from the same day, Finney announced that he had already written “test code” and uploaded it to the Github repository. However, there was a problem with Finney’s proposal — his method had already been patented by someone else.“Method for Accelerating Cryptographic Operation on Elliptic Curves” (also known as GLV or Four-Dimensional Gallant–Lambert–Vanstone Scalar Multiplication) received a patent on September 19, 2006 — likely at a time when Satoshi Nakamoto was already busy at work on Bitcoin (BTC). In order to understand the invention, we have to dive a bit deeper into elliptical curve cryptography. The patent reads:The improvement comes from representing “the scalar k as a combination of components k, and an integer A”. Mathematical operations performed on k represented in this form appear to be less computationally expensive, hence the gains in speed.Finney’s 2013 proposal was implemented with the release of the libsecp256k1 library, but was never enabled due to existing legal concerns. That's how things stood until September 25, when the patent expired. According to the Blockstream co-founder Adam Back, the code is now expected to be activated in the next Bitcoin Core update.February 2011 seems to be the time when Finney was most focused on optimizing Bitcoin's signature verification. In a post from February 7, 2011, Finney said he was looking at “batch signature verification”, which he believed might speed up the process by a factor of four. The idea behind it was that instead of verifying signatures one by one, to verify them block-wise: hundreds or even thousands at a time. However, according to Blockstream’s co-founder Pieter Wuille (who was one of the authors of the libsecp256k1 library), when GLV is combined with batch verification, the gains disappear once you reach approximately 1,000 signatures:Indeed, it has been implemented for Schnorr signatures where it affords two-fold gains in speed. Back indicated that he expects a forthcoming release of Schnorr signatures which include batch verification:It is unlikely that Finney’s cryogenic housing allows for any movement, but if it did, we might get a sneak of a smile on his face."

269,"Cumulative transaction fees paid to Ethereum (ETH) miners for 2020 are now close to double those of Bitcoin (BTC), clocking in at $276 million versus $146 million.A chart released by Coinmetrics highlights how Ethereum fees went on a steep ascent in the latter part of the year, coinciding quite closely with the release of Compound’s token incentive. Cumulative 2020 fees on Ethereum equalized with Bitcoin’s on Aug. 12, continuing a break-neck ascent since.This marks a distinct change from trends in transaction fees from past years, where Bitcoin generally dominated over any other network by a wide margin. In 2019, Bitcoin came out with a five-to-one advantage in the same comparison.Cointelegraph previously reported that Ethereum first began posting higher daily fee revenue in June. As activity increased and the average transaction fee with it, total revenue began skyrocketing. Between August and September, Ethereum began breaking previous records and quickly became unusable for some participants.The culprit is most likely the boom of decentralized finance and yield farming, though stablecoin transfers and some alleged Ponzi schemes also make up a significant portion of block space usage on Ethereum.The current state of affairs is likely to wind down somewhat as DeFi euphoria settles, similarly to what happened in the crypto market at large in 2018.It’s interesting to note that Ethereum fee revenue briefly exceeded the block rewards for a few particularly high-activity days in the past few months. Overall, fees have crept up to steadily over more than 10% of total issuance since May — a threshold achieved only a few times in the coin’s history.This may be particularly valuable for ETH holders in light of the EIP-1559 proposal, which seeks to introduce a fee burn mechanism. While the specifics of the implementation imply that in periods of high activity there may still be bidding wars that directly benefit miners, high activity could lower the effective issuance rate to a significant extent.For Bitcoin, raising transaction fees to cover existing issuance is crucial for its long-term future, since block rewards will eventually expire. However, the cryptocurrency space in the past two years has begun trending away from Bitcoin-centric use cases to stablecoins and DeFi. While Bitcoin usage remains high, losing dominance to other blockchains may prove catastrophic for its long-term prospects."
270,"The global economy doesn’t seem to be in a good place right now, especially with countries such as the United Kingdom, France and Spain imposing fresh, new restrictions across their borders, thereby making the future financial prospects of many local business owners even bleaker.As far as the crypto economy goes, on Sept. 21, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped by nearly 6.5% to the $10,300 mark after having stayed put around $11,000 for a few weeks. However, what is interesting to note this time around is the fact that the flagship crypto plunged in value simultaneously with gold and the S&P 500.From a technical standpoint, a quick look at the Cboe Volatility Index shows that the implied volatility of the S&P 500 during the aforementioned time window increased quite dramatically, rising above the $30.00 mark for the first time in a period of more than two months, leading many commentators to speculate that another crash akin to the one in March could be looming.It bears mentioning that the $30 mark serves as an upper threshold for the occurrence of world-shocking events, such as wars or terrorist attacks. Otherwise, during periods of regular market activity, the indicator stays put around $20.When looking at gold, the precious metal has also sunk heavily, hitting a two-month low, while silver saw its most significant price drop in nine years. This waning interest in gold has resulted in speculators believing that people are once again turning toward the U.S. dollar as a financial safe haven, especially because the dollar index has maintained a relatively strong position against other premier currencies such as the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and the euro.Speaking of Europe, the continent as a whole is currently facing a potential economic crisis, with many countries dealing with the imminent threat of a heavy recession due to the uncertain market conditions that have been induced by the COVID-19 scare.While there has been a definite correlation in the price action of the crypto, gold and S&P 500 markets, Joel Edgerton, chief operating officer of crypto exchange bitFlyer, highlighted in a conversation with Cointelegraph that when compared with other assets — such as precious metals, stock options, etc. — crypto has exhibited far greater volatility.In particular, he pointed out that the BTC/USD pair has been sensitive to the movements of the U.S. dollar, as well as to any discussions related to the Federal Reserve’s potential strategy change seeking to spur national inflation to above the 2% mark. Edgerton added:Lastly, he opined that any changes to the U.S. tax code could also have a direct effect on the crypto market, especially as various states, as well as the federal government, continue to be on the lookout for newer tax avenues to make up for the stimulus packages that were doled by the Fed earlier this year.Sam Tabar, former managing director for Bank of America’s Asia-Pacifc region and co-founder of Fluidity — the firm behind peer-to-peer trading platform Airswap — believes that crypto, as an asset class, continues to remain misunderstood and mispriced: “With time, people will become increasingly more aware of the digital asset space, and that sophistication will decrease the correlation to traditional markets.”As part of its most recent plunge, Bitcoin stopped at a price point of around $10,300, resulting in the currency’s social media sentiment slumping to a 24-month low. However, contrary to what one may think, according to data released by crypto analytics firm Santiment, BTC tends to see a big surge whenever online sentiment around it is hovering in FUD — fear, uncertainty and doubt — territory.https://t.co/bFKcBHUDY4

1) Prices of $BTC and other #crypto assets tend to bounce most precipitously when the crowd is demonstrating a high level of FUD. This is exactly what we've been seeing for #Bitcoin, #Ethereum, and many #altcoins following the early September pic.twitter.com/YiCX3kZiurThe firm said that this trend of negative online sentiment witnessed since the beginning of September is not only relevant for Bitcoin but also for Ether (ETH), as well as some other digital currencies. It went on to state: “Generally, the best buy opportunities in #crypto come when the average trader is down, both psychologically and financially. This is what our metrics currently indicate.”The online sentiment of any cryptocurrency is usually calculated by accumulating social media datasets associated with the coin in question. This information is then processed using various machine-learning protocols so as to sort the data as being either positive or negative. Some analytics providers also make use of a metric called “market value to realized value,” or MVRV, which calculates the average profit and loss of different holders to determine whether a coin is currently over- or underbought.The tandem plunge in the value of stocks, gold and crypto was neither a coincidence nor due to any technical anomalies, as it’s normal to witness simultaneous dips across various markets during times of high uncertainty.For example, over the course of the last few months, a number of investors worldwide have assessed the risks related to their existing portfolios and have started to liquidate their most volatile assets — which, in most cases, are cryptocurrencies and equities. Tabar noted that such plunges are part and parcel of volatile markets and that similar scenarios (minus crypto) were also witnessed back in 2008:Last but not least, it seems as though the stock market will continue to remain in a highly uncertain space, especially as the devastating economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic will become exceedingly visible during the third and fourth quarters of this year.Perhaps most importantly, the dollar’s dominance is once again on the rise, as is highlighted by the fact that the number of U.S. mortgage applications in recent weeks has increased to levels 25% higher than this time last year."

In each case, however, BTC/USD managed to avoid a daily close under five figures. Since the lows, Bitcoin has recovered to trade in a corridor between $10,000 and $11,000, so far seeing rejection when attempting to climb higher.For some analysts, including Cointelegraph’s own Michaël van de Poppe, downside risk remains in the form of a retest of $9,600, which contains the only remaining lower CME futures gap. The brief trip to $9,800 failed to plug that gap, leaving expectations open for a repeat performance.For the meantime, however, moves are failing to impress.“Ultra boring markets, but couldn't break $10,800.

This was thanks to an investigation into United States’ President Donald Trump’s tax records, the results of which were published by the New York Times.The details include just $750 in tax paid by Trump in his election-year 2016, while no further links to Russia — a major source of contention at the time.Nonetheless, the publication could have implications for Trump’s chances in the run-up to this year’s election, and markets will be keenly watching for fresh turbulence.

273,"Big four accounting firm EY has launched a new solution for investigating on-chain data including Bitcoin (BTC) transactions. The new Explorer and Visualizer solution launched as a part of the EY Blockchain Analyzer product suite. According to an announcement on Sep. 27, the beta version is now available for free for individuals. EY also said that it will soon make the solution available as a service on its blockchain website.Users will be able to utilize search functionalities along with its visualization technology. It will allow audit teams to explore and track on-chain data by searching for specific transactions, addresses and blocks. They may then analyze the gathered data to manage legal, compliance and fraud risks. EY global forensic and integrity services lead Andrew Gordon said that the Explorer and Visualizer solution will make financial reporting for blockchain-enabled transactions more convenient. It will help “highlight potential outliers including fraudulent red-flag activities,” he added.Additionally, EY has launched a new procurement solution on its OpsChain platform — EY OpsChain Network Procurement — which will expectedly enable companies to privately and securely conduct end-to-end procurement activities on the Ethereum blockchain.Currently available in free beta, the solution is said to move business processes from enterprise resource planning systems to shared blockchain-based smart contracts, allowing them to automatically track volumes and global expenditure. The solution is also expected to help buyers and sellers have parity and work with globally agreed terms and pricing."
274,"With only 21 million Bitcoin (BTC) to be issued, a little under 2.5 million BTC remains for mining.In a tweet, ChartBTC said the Bitcoin network already passed the 18.5 million BTC mark in circulation. This means there is less than 2.5 million BTC left, or about 11.9% of the total Bitcoin to be generated.ChartBTC pointed out half of the remaining 2.5 million BTC will be mined in the next four years. Since the genesis block back in 2009, the Bitcoin network has already undergone three halvings, with the third halving taking place in May this year. As the issuance of new coins is halved every four years, the last Bitcoin is not expected to be mined until 2140. No new Bitcoin can be mined after that year.Source: ChartBTC As Cointelegraph previously reported, a group of eight Crypto Valley experts thought the last halving was different from those in the past because more people are considering storing their life savings in BTC.Since early 2020, institutional demand for Bitcoin had been steadily increasing.

276,"A pseudonymous Bitcoin (BTC) trader outlined 23 key technical and fundamental factors that could buoy BTC’s medium-term bull case.The data points shared by the trader, known as “Byzantine General,” fit into four major themes. They are a less overheated market, a neutralizing futures market, less leveraged traders and strengthening fundamentals.Since Bitcoin’s recovery from $10,300, a persistent narrative around the top cryptocurrency has been its negative funding rates.The Bitcoin futures market implements a mechanism called “funding” to prevent the market from dominantly swaying to one side. As such, when the market is majority bullish, investors betting on BTC surging compensate short-sellers, and vice versa.Throughout the past week, the funding rate of Bitcoin has either stayed negative or neutral despite its declining price. That meant short-sellers were continuing to bet against BTC but there were not enough long contracts to squeeze. The funding rates of Bitcoin. Source: Skew.comThe low probability of a long squeeze eventually led the market sentiment to change. Shorting Bitcoin quickly became an overcrowded trade, causing a short squeeze to occur.The trader emphasized that the consistently negative or baseline funding rate is a positive factor for BTC. He explained:“First of all, there is funding. One of the best indicators to gauge market sentiment. After the drop from 12k it has been consistently negative or baseline at best. Secondly, we have the contango index. This shows the difference between the price of SPOT exchanges & derivatives exchanges. When SPOT has higher prices the indicator goes lower, into the green zone. A consistent premium for SPOT exchanges is considered bullish.”For swing traders like Byzantine General, who focus on longer-term trades over short-term, changing market sentiment is critical.Bitcoin initially rejected the $12,000 to $12,500 resistance range on Aug. 17, then again on Sep. 2. The two consecutive rejections of Bitcoin at a crucial resistance area were brutal for futures traders. In the next two weeks that followed, the open interest of futures exchanges rapidly declined.The term open interest refers to the total sum of active long and short contracts in the futures market. In short, it shows the dollar sum of bets on BTC price movements.The sharp drop in futures open interest meant fewer individuals have been trading BTC with additional leverage. Major futures exchanges in the cryptocurrency market support up to 125x leverage. Typically, the high leverage opens up the possibility of massive price swings.The trader explained that lower open interest implies that there are now fewer leveraged positions in the market. For the medium-term trend of BTC, he argued it is optimistic. He said:“Is the market over-leveraged? The 12k range was absolutely brutal. We had multiple days of more than half a billion in liquidations. About a billion of OI got wiped out since the peak in the 12k range.”On-chain indicators could be useful in gauging the sentiment around the Bitcoin market by analyzing address activity and profits.Bitcoin net MPL indicator. Source: Byzantine GeneralAccording to the net MPL indicator the trader cited, the Bitcoin market is less overheated than before. Similar to previous bull cycles, the trader said it gave the cryptocurrency market a reset. He noted:“The net MPL indicator. This shows that the market isn't overheated anymore. We recently had a reset. Red zones are great buy zones. When we look at the previous bull-run in 2017 we can see that those small resets are turning points where momentum picks up again.”The crypto fear and greed index also shows that the market sentiment has become neutral after BTC’s recent recovery (higher values indicate the market is overheated). Crypto fear & greed index. Source: alternative.meAt its core, Bitcoin is a decentralized blockchain network that is maintained by computing power contributed by miners. As such, hashrate is often considered an important metric to gauge the fundamental strength of the blockchain.Hash ribbon indicator on top of BTC price chart. Source: TradingView.comThe hash ribbon indicator emerges when miners go through a capitulation phase where they sell significant amounts of Bitcoin. Although the sell-off initially places selling pressure on BTC, afterward, BTC tends to recover. The trader said: “Let's take a look at some fundamentals. Hash ribbons recently gave 2 consecutive buy signals. These signals happen during the first recovery after miner capitulation. The bitcoin production cost is currently green. Simply put, this means that miners are potentially taking losses. Maybe it's not very intuitive, but historically speaking these are amazing buy opportunities.”The confluence of strengthening fundamentals and technical factors suggests a less-overheated market and raises the probability of more upside."

278,"Volatility was expected throughout the week regarding the expiration of a significant amount of futures. However, this didn’t really happen while the macro-economic environment also remains uncertain.A hack of a major cryptocurrency exchange on Sep. 26 didn’t influence the price at all, which is a positive signal for the markets and a positive signal for the market’s maturity.However, is this boring price action going to continue for Bitcoin (BTC)? Let’s take a look at the charts.BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewSometimes charting can be relatively simple, and this is one of those cases. The price of Bitcoin fell below $11,100-11,300 earlier this month, establishing new support at $10,000.The level that has been lost, the $11,100-11,300 zone, is now confirmed resistance as well as the new upper resistance area.On the downside, a potential drop towards $9,600 wouldn’t be unexpected as the level around $9,600 is still untested with the CME futures gap continuing to linger.BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe 4-hour chart shows a clear bullish divergence implying a short-term trend reversal. Combined with the overly bearish sentiment across social media, the market was ready for such a relief bounce.The same bullish divergence was seen with other cryptocurrencies, so the relief bounce was felt across the majority of the market.However, as stated in the previous analysis, the $10,800 barrier is a crucial hurdle to take. If it can be overcome as a resistance level, the $11,100-11,300 area comes back into play.This $11,100-11,300 area is the final step before the continuation of the bull market. If Bitcoin’s price can break through that resistance zone, a test of the recent highs at $12,000-12,400 is on the table.Total market capitalization cryptocurrency 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewThe 1-week chart of the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies is showing a clear pattern. A fresh higher high was printed in the previous months, marking the potential start of a new uptrend.After a higher high, a new higher low has to be made in which a range-bound structure can be defined. The best area for such a higher low is likely the previous resistance zone, marked green in the chart, or at $250-275 billion, would be a beautiful support/resistance flip warranting continuation.If that area holds, it also shows why the beginning of a new cycle is relatively dull. During the start of a new market cycle, levels are flipped as support/resistance, after which months of range-bound periods can occur. An example is shown with the price movements of Bitcoin in 2016 (which was also a halving year).BTC/USD 1-week chart of 2016. Source: TradingViewDuring these periods, the price of Bitcoin stabilized in an accumulation range throughout 2015. After this accumulation range, Bitcoin’s price broke out and rallied towards the next resistance zone.This rally ended up with a 6-month long sideways range. A renewed breakout occurred, and another 6-month sideways range started. Hence, the current market sentiment can be compared with that period.But the real excitement will come when the total market capitalization and Bitcoin break into price discovery (over $20,000) as then potential parabolic runs can come back into play.BTC/USD 4-hour chart bullish scenario. Source: TradingViewIt should be noted that these scenarios are based on lower timeframes (4-hour) and, therefore, should be considered as a short-term outlook.As the price of Bitcoin is stuck in a range and currently facing resistance, it’s more likely to anticipate a breakdown to the $10,400 area. The $10,400 area is the vital area to hold for any bullish continuation.If Bitcoin’s price holds here, a potential higher low is defined, which would fuel further upward momentum. As the chart shows, the crucial breaker is the $10,800 area. If that area breaks, the next hurdle becomes $11,150-11,300.It would be unexpected to see a breakout above that area to occur, but that would warrant an even stronger bullish case.BTC/USD 4-hour chart bearish scenario. Source: TradingViewThe same levels surround the bearish scenario. A failure to break the $10,800 area would present a potential test of the $10,400 area.As discussed in the previous part, a potential higher low can be made, therefore, reintroduce bullish perspectives. However, if $10,550 fails to break, further downward momentum should be expected, including the still-open CME gap.

279,"Now that we are at the tail end of 2020, the big hardware manufacturers are starting to announce their latest, fastest offerings set to be released ahead of the holiday season. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency mining market continues to expand rapidly against all odds. Here’s an overview of which producers offer the best graphics cards in the market and which cards suit specific types of mining.In terms of choosing a cryptocurrency to mine in 2020, there have been no significant changes. This year, most video cards continue to be able to mine Ether (ETH) or its forks. As for Bitcoin (BTC), mining of the world’s first cryptocurrency stopped being available to ordinary people a few years ago, as it requires serious investments, special equipment and access to large amounts of cheap electricity. This is even more so the case now, as BTC mining is bringing in half the income after the reward halving took place in May. The difficulty of mining continues to increase, and in September, it updated to an all-time high of 19.31 trillion at block 649,152.As a result, many popular devices such as the Antminer S9 have become obsolete. After the halving, the most profitable miners became the Whatsminer M30S ++ from the Chinese company MicroBT, which can deliver a hash rate of up to 112 terahashes per second and bring in just over $8.50 per day in profit, and Bitmain’s Antminer S19 Pro, which can reach a hash rate of 110 TH/s and see a daily profit of just under $8.50. But the prices of these miners are rather steep: A Whatsminer M30S++ costs $1,800, and the Antminer S19 Pro comes in at $2,407.When it comes to Ether and its forks, graphics-card mining is once again becoming popular for several reasons. First, over the past two years, Ethereum’s hash rate has decreased by 15% (when compared with August 2018), now sitting at 256.221 TH/s. This means that Ether is now easier to mine. Second, both modern and old models of cards can still be used for mining. For example, the Nvidia 1050 Ti, released in October 2016, and the Radeon RX 580, released in April 2017, are still very popular. Prices for such old cards are constantly decreasing as newer cards come out, which is encouraging miners to return to the market. But most importantly, the price of ETH tripled from the start of 2020 to the beginning of September, making Ether still very profitable to mine.There is another factor that attracts the interest of miners: the upcoming transition to Ethereum 2.0 and a proof-of-stake algorithm, which is expected to commence before the end of the year. A spokesperson from WhatToMine, a popular web-based calculator for evaluating the profitability of mining cryptocurrencies, told Cointelegraph that Ether will continue to be in demand, not only this year but also in 2021:“This cycle we can expect further expansion of DeFi projects, which will in turn make ETH network more and more popular. As a result block reward for ETH (the fee part) should increase in cycles with general uptrend, making ETH mining the most profitable for GPU miners.”At the beginning of the year, Cointelegraph reviewed the graphics cards of the two largest manufacturers, Nvidia and AMD, and Nvidia cards seemed to have an upper hand in mining. However, taking into account the fact that Ether mining has gained a second life, AMD cards should not be written off, as the company’s Vega and RX generations are still very suitable for Ethash algorithms.Regardless of the manufacturer, the most important factor is return on investment, as any miner must first invest a decent amount of money before turning any profit. A standard rig requires six graphics cards, and as a result, a miner can spend over $9,000 if buying the popular Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti with 8 GB or 11 GB of RAM memory. But what about those who can’t afford the top shelf but still want to make a profit? Here are the most popular graphics cards right now for Ether mining that cost under $400.This card was released in October 2019, meaning the tech is still fresh. The graphics card has 6 GB of memory and Turing architecture, which executes more clock frequency, uses less power and has 20% better performance than the GTX 1660. The price of this model ranges from $240 to $250.In summer 2019, AMD introduced a new line of RX 5700-series graphics cards to the market. These cards use fin field-effect transistor, or FinFET, technology, which results in better energy efficiency when mining due to the reduced size of electronic components and lower current consumption.The specifications of the RX 5700 include 8 GB of GDDR6 memory and a power consumption of 180 watts. The RX 5700 XT has a power consumption of 225 W, but the base frequency is also 10% higher than in the RX 5700 model. These cards are slightly more expensive, costing around $430, but can be snatched up with a discount at around $400.The RTX 2060 Super card may not be an obvious choice, as apart from having 8 GB of memory, it is no different from the RTX 2060. But at the same time, it uses five different algorithms — GrinCuckarooD29, GrinCuckatoo31, DaggerHashimoto, X16Rv2 and BeamV2 — which makes it more stable, safe and suitable for mining. In fact, this is an intermediate option between the RTX 2060 and the RTX 2070, but it can be found online for just $399, while the RTX 2070 will cost you around $530 — and a $130 difference is a lot of money in this business.AMD’s RX 580 was released back in 2017 and is still one of the best low-budget GPUs for mining, with a price ranging between around $180 and $230. The card is used mainly for mining Ether and has 8 GB of memory, but it consumes little power at just 150 W. The only potential competitor might be the RX 570, but those card with only 4 GB of memory will no longer be able to mine Ether in 2021.Nvidia has a dedicated series of graphics cards for crypto mining. The Nvidia P106-100 “mining edition” is based on the Nvidia GP106 GPU (Geforce GTX 1060), which is almost the same as a regular Geforce GTX 1060 but with some slight modifications. The P106-100 has no video outputs and no rear panel, and the card is equipped with 6 GB of memory. The ""mining edition"" in the name does not mean that the new product is better at mining than the usual version but rather that it’s designed specifically for miners, as everything considered nonessential has been removed, allowing it to be sold for around $320, a whole $170 cheaper than a GTX 1060 unit.How long will it take for these budget cards to recoup their initial price? For comparison, one of the most popular cards for mining today, the Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti, brings in around $1.66 per day when mining Ether. If purchased for an average price of around $1,400, this graphics card will take about 28 months to pay for itself, without taking into account the cost of electricity. So, here is what the calculations say: The Nvidia GTX 1660 Super, which can be bought for $240, would bring $0.65 per day and take 12 months to pay for itself. The AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT costs $400 and would have an 8.5-month payback time while bringing in $1.56 per day. The Nvidia RTX 2060 Super can be bought for $399 and will bring $0.92 per day when mining Ether. This card will pay off in 14 months. The Radeon RX 580 is a very popular card due to its rather low price of around $200, and this card will recoup in just seven months, bringing in almost a dollar ($0.96) per day. Created specifically for mining, the Nvidia P106-100 will bring $0.85 per day and, at a cost of $320, will pay off in just over 12 months.However, this is not an exact science, and every miner should keep in mind that the algorithms of any crypto are constantly becoming more complex, which makes it harder to mine and longer to recoup their investment into their mining equipment.Given the excitement around decentralized finance, a crypto boom looms on the horizon once again, and the upcoming new products may take it further. In September, Nvidia released its new generation of GeForce RTX 3000 graphics cards, with some people already saying that it can produce 81–89 MH/s during Ether mining. And the upper-class model, the GeForce RTX 3090, is expected to demonstrate 120–122 Mh/s. If so, then Nvidia may face a shortage of cards, as miners will buy everything, leaving gamers with nothing.But AMD is not lagging behind and will present its Radeon RDNA 2 line at the end of October, which will directly compete with the 3000 series from Nvidia. The emergence of new cards will be of great interest to the crypto mining community. Andrej Škraba, head of marketing at NiceHash — a crypto mining and trading platform — is confident that the technological innovations of AMD and Nvidia will bring higher productivity:“Nvidia just launched 3000 series, but current availability is super low. New RTX cards will bring higher hash-rates and miners will be upgrading their used 1060s and old AMD cards (480s/580s). We still have to wait for the AMD announcement to see what they will bring to the market.”"
280,"The basis of any exchange of value is trust. The more two parties trust each other, the more they will feel confident engaging in transactions. Not just engaging in a high volume of transactions, but higher value transactions, too.Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies are certainly accomplishing a lot when it comes to creating a decentralized environment where the ability to trust another party is taken out of the equation by a blockchain. Hardcore enthusiasts who already understand this are the ones most willing to reach into their coffers and pour money into the crypto revolution. The truth is, though, that the average consumer still isn’t at that point yet.Some libertarians probably don’t want to hear this, but in order for the crypto world to reach critical mass, it needs much broader adoption, and the average consumer is going to need another layer of protection in place. They need a set of rules and somebody to complain when things go awry.Related: Why we need evolutionary, not revolutionary, regulatory initiativesBlockchain technology certainly does an amazing job of allowing participants to exchange value in a trustless environment. If you don’t share your private keys, nobody can steal your value. Teaching this to newly minted crypto holders is fundamental to getting them to buy in.While many view that next step as a hindrance to adoption, regulation in the crypto space will most certainly accelerate it. The more layers we add to the safety net for consumers, the more confident new investors and adopters will be in getting involved.The Bank Secrecy Act took effect in the 1970s and stands as the first piece of significant legislation in the United States surrounding Anti-Money Laundering and terrorist financing. It essentially forces banks to cooperate with the U.S. government in fighting financial crime. Following the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in September of 2001, the Patriot Act was born, further opening up the lines of communication between banks and governments in the same vein.Fast-forward to 2019, an international governing body called the Financial Action Task Force extends the travel rule to include not just banks but virtual assets and exchanges. The rule stipulates that virtual asset service providers must share the identities of users trading assets worth $1,000 or more.Related: FATF AML regulation: Can the crypto industry adapt to the travel rule?Tracking and providing that information sounds pretty straightforward, and it should be that way. But it also means virtual asset service providers need to fulfill all kinds of other tasks in order to become compliant, including:The inherent challenges with the FATF travel rule are certainly very real ones. For one, it requires buy-in from many virtual asset providers running blockchain projects and exchanges using different technologies. This makes tracking customer information at a granular level more difficult. That said, the benefit of the travel rule will outweigh those challenges. It stretches beyond the typical KYC procedures most crypto service providers follow. KYC relates mostly to an organization’s internal processes. The travel rule is much broader in nature. It pushes both virtual asset providers and governments to be transparent. It aims to go beyond the idea of individual nations subscribing to their own rules surrounding crypto.The Ontario Securities Commission in Canada recently ruled that cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, which operates out of the Seychelles Islands, isn’t properly registered to serve residents of the province and thus has to cease accepting new registrations and trades from Ontarians.More of these kinds of rulings will continue to come out of the woodwork, forcing virtual asset service providers to either adjust and comply, or take on the risks associated with doing business under the radar. The former and not the latter is the better long-term proposition for both crypto businesses and investors alike.There are several tools — and more are coming — that aid regulators in continuing to develop better frameworks. They allow the average consumer to feel more comfortable with getting into cryptocurrency through any number of properly vetted on-ramps.Most avid crypto traders are familiar with blockchain explorers — either publicly available or advanced ones being developed by private companies — that aim to dig deeper into the origins of transactions. This gives law enforcement the technology needed to track stolen funds, money laundering and criminal purchases made with crypto. The action of law enforcement adds trust to the ecosystem, making it safer for broad adoption.Risk-scoring solutions are also being developed that allow market participants, including exchanges and individuals, to see whether counterparty wallets or proposed transactions carry risk. This knowledge will allow exchanges to steer clear of stolen funds, money laundering and bad actors. This again adds trust to the ecosystem.Just in the last few days, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, a regulatory body representing all U.S. states and territories, has announced the launch of a new regulatory framework for payment companies, money service businesses and cryptocurrency companies. Only Montana, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico are not included in the launch.Related: How the US and Europe are regulating crypto in 2020This new framework requires major payment providers like Western Union, PayPal and 76 other money services and crypto-related businesses to undergo a thorough examination of their AML practices. Altogether, this new framework will regulate payment services that are responsible for transferring over $1 trillion in customer funds annually.Ultimately, this launch and the broader impact of the FATF travel rule will serve to hold both businesses and market participants accountable for tracking transaction data, engaging in proper KYC protocols, and serving crypto adopters both old and new with added layers of protection that make investing in cryptocurrencies a more welcoming proposition.Increased regulation and law enforcement is the path leading to exponential increases in the adoption of digital assets both now and in the future. And it is inevitably coming.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
281,"In an official statement, KuCoin Global CEO Johnny Lyu confirmed a major hacking attack on Sep. 26. The breach affected the firm’s Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and ERC20 hot wallets, after private keys were leaked. Reports estimate the breach to have affected $150 million in user funds.Following the security breach, the price of Bitcoin barely moved, however. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Ether and decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens also remain relatively unfazed by the hack.A cryptocurrency exchange security breach historically led to market-wide sell-offs due to the fear of hackers potentially selling the proceeds.But Tether (USDT) has moved quickly to suspend the transfer of assets that are linked to the security breach. Major exchanges, including Bitfinex, also froze USDT associated with the hack.The swift response from Tether and top exchanges could prevent most of the funds from being moved by the hackers.Bitcoin outflows on Kucoin after the hack. Source: CryptoQuantAccording to Paolo Ardoino, the chief technical officer at Bitfinex and Tether, the two entities froze $33 million in total. If early estimates are accurate and $150 million were hacked, that represents 22% of the lost funds. He said:“Bitfinex froze 13m Tether USDt on EOS as part of the hack, Tether just froze 20M Tether USDt sitting on this Ethereum address https://etherscan.io/address/0xeb31973e0febf3e3d7058234a5ebbae1ab4b8c23 as precautionary measure. Stay safe everyone!”In the official statement, Lyu said KuCoin is now in contact with Huobi, Binance, OKEx, BitMax, and ByBit. The company also said it is cooperating with law enforcement and relevant blockchain projects.At least in the near term, it would make it challenging for hackers to try to move the funds. The CEO said:“We are in contact with many major crypto exchanges such as Huobi, Binance, OKEx, BitMax and Bybit, as well as blockchain projects, security agencies, and law enforcement to work on this. Some effective measures have been taken, and we will update with more details soon.”While a small amount of the hacked funds are in Bitcoin, most are reportedly stored in ERC 20 tokens. The risk of the tokens is that hackers could potentially utilize DeFi protocols in an attempt to eliminate “tainted” tokens. But according to Primitive Crypto founding partner Dovey Wan, hackers struggled to handle the tainted funds. She explained:“The hacker who hacked Kucoin apparently is a Defi noob, tried to sell on Binance and didn’t swap the tainted USDT on Curve. All Defi infra are natural mixers with ultra low slippage… Hackers with normal IQ will soon figure out, this is not some alpha leak and Defi infra is designed to serve all purposes ... if a hacker can hack a cex, no point he/she has no idea how to successfully liquidate via dex.”After reclaiming the $10,407 whale cluster that has turned into a support area, Bitcoin has seen a short-term trend reversal.The 4-hour chart of Bitcoin.

282,"Back in April of 2020, Cointelegraph took a close look at the KuCoin cryptocurrency exchange. Investigating the apparent lock of the primary domain name, which was a result of a legal case under the jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore, we concluded that:Now $150 million is missing from KuCoin in what has been described by the exchange as a ""security incident"", and while the directors of the exchange refused to answer our questions five months ago (and implied that our accurately-sourced reporting was untrue), perhaps their customers will hold them to account this time.In March 2020 KuCoin was facing the possibility of a class action lawsuit focused on potentially ""false and/or misleading statements to account holders"". In another suit, Chase Williams v. KuCoin, filed in the Southern District of New York, the exchange was alleged to have engaged in an unlicensed securities offering. In addition to KuCoin, the latter suit named three individuals connected with KuCoin: Michael Gan, Johnny Lyu, and Eric Don.A few days before these legal woes began to surface, KuCoin announced a corporate restructuring which included reassigning the company's trademark from one Seychelles-registered entity to another, and appointing a new director whose affiliation with the exchange had previously been unclear.If the opacity of the ownership is concerning, there's another perennial question that raises flags in virulent shades of crimson. Where is KuCoin, anyway? Chase Williams suggests that it began as a Seychelles business with headquarters in Hong Kong, before moving to Singapore, and that the three named directors in its suit are believed to reside there. But like many cryptocurrency exchanges, the actual location of its office (if it has one) and staff is unclear.There's an old maxim in cryptocurrency. Or at least, as old as the industry itself. ""Not your keys, not your coins."" It simply means that when your funds are held by a third party, you don't control them.Despite countless warnings about the perils of leaving funds on exchanges, crypto traders continue to trust that the security of exchanges (and the integrity of their staff) is sufficient to prevent the loss of their tokens. Despite countless warnings, they are wrong.Whether it be a hack, a social engineering attack, or a plain old-fashioned exit scam, the allure of free money is too hard for criminals to resist. The bank robber Willie Sutton concisely (if apocryphally) explained ""I rob banks, because that's where the money is."" And exchanges will continue to represent an attractive target so long as crypto holders continue to leave their money lying around in hot wallets. Johnny Lyu of KuCoin has insisted that customers should ""Please rest assured that if any user fund is affected by this incident, it will be covered completely by KuCoin and our insurance fund."" And as the misappropriated funds begin to move to other exchanges, evidence is beginning to appear that all may not be lost. Paolo Ardoino of Bitfinex noted via a tweet that his exchange has frozen $13 million in USDT for instance, and this type of inter-exchange collaboration may help to deter thieves in the future.Of course, I'm hoping that KuCoin has the resources in its insurance fund to cover losses of this magnitude. Johnny Lyu seems to think so: ""Yes, it’s enough. Starting from early 2018, we have established the insurance fund to deal with unexpected security issues such as this."" Perhaps the exchange will publish a wallet address to prove that such a fund exists, and that it will pay out against all valid claims. Then again, the principals couldn't be clear with us on such basics as their location, their corporate structure, the legal status of their domain name — so maybe this level of transparency would be a stretch.But there's a simple fix that almost anyone can perform, a fix that ensures your funds cannot be stolen in an exchange hack. It's a fix so easy, so obvious, that the owners of around $150 million of cryptocurrency are right now kicking themselves for not performing it.Don't keep your crypto on an exchange if you aren't using the service.Not your keys, not your coins."
283,"Bitcoin (BTC) whale clusters indicate that the price could be in a short-term trend reversal after BTC’s recovery beyond $10,700. In the past two days, BTC price rose by nearly 6% from $10,135 to $10,755 across major exchanges.Whale clusters form when large investors accumulate Bitcoin and do not spend or move their holdings for significant periods of time. This typically indicates that whales expect BTC price to increase in the near term.The hourly map of Bitcoin whale clusters. Source: WhalemapWhalemap, an on-chain analysis firm that tracks whale activity, identified $10,407, $10,570, and $10,667 as whale clusters. In the short term, the three levels are likely to serve as potential support areas if BTC remains above $10,700.According to the analysts at Whalemap, Bitcoin can remain in a bullish trend as long as it defends $10,407. The analysts emphasized that the trend suggests “bulls have won,” as the market sentiment improves from the recent upsurge. They explained:“Feels like bulls have won. Many supports below at $10,407 and $10,570 and volume profile support at $10,500. Should not be going below $10,407 to stay bullish.”An interesting irregularity in the recent Bitcoin rally is that it has decoupled from gold, as Cointelegraph reported. While gold dropped slightly by 0.32% in the last 24 hours, BTC rallied above $10,700.Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst, said decoupling indicates that the momentum of Bitcoin is strengthening. He said:“Bitcoin will decouple from traditional markets soon, but driven by its internal adoption s-curve (think startup style growth) rather than changes in perceptions as a hedging instrument by traditional investors.”Atop the various technical factors buoying the uptrend of Bitcoin, the current fundamentals project a positive near-term outlook. Earlier this week, data from Glassnode showed that the number of small Bitcoin addresses abruptly plunged in September. Despite this, the analysts at Glassnode noted that the data is not concerning and does not impact network fundamentals. They explained:“The recent drop in #Bitcoin addresses holding ≥ 1 $BTC is of no concern and has no relevance regarding network fundamentals. This was merely an exchange doing inhouse cleaning, and merging a bulk of small UTXOs in separate addresses into a single one.”Cryptocurrency trader Edward Morra believes that the market has to move above $10,830 to confirm a bullish continuation. If BTC rejects $10,830 and returns back below $10,500, the $9,800 to $10,830 range could cause BTC to stagnate over a prolonged period. Morra said:“Below daily resistance, above daily support = Ranging market. Price currently at a bearish throwback at $10,830. If we move above, expect a re-test of daily resistance at $11,200. Not interested in trading chop range - Wait for expansion. Support = $9,800 - $10,100.”"
284,"According to a recent report by CryptoCompare, a digital asset data resource, aggregate trading volumes exchange traded products (ETP) have plummeted drastically in the month of September. Aggregate ETP Volume ($millions) Source: CryptoCompareOverall daily cryptorrency ETP volumes plunged by roughly 74%, dropping from $186.5 million exchanged in mid-August to an average of $48 million in mid-September. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust product represents the overwhelming amount of trading activity in cryptocurrency ETPs, and has therefore taken the biggest hit when it comes to trading volumes. Grayscale’s top 3 cryptocurrency products, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), and Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETCG), lost a combined 77% in trading volume, decreasing from $180 million per day in mid-August to roughly $40 million. Top Grayscale Trust Products by Daily Volume ($millions) Source: CryptoCompareThe total asset under management figure (AUM) for Grayscale has also decreased since mid-August, although not nearly as drastically. Grayscale’s AUM has dropped 3.3% from $5.9 billion to $5.7 billion in the last 30 days.According to Constantine Tsavliris, Head of Research at CryptoCompare, the decrease in volumes for these crypto investment instruments has a lot to do with the recent price action of Bitcoin and other crypto assets. He told Cointelegraph:“The BTC price dropped from approximately $12k to $10k at the beginning of September. Since then, markets have generally been bearish with a few bull runs throughout the month. ETP investors generally invest long-term, and therefore the recent drop in price combined with a generally bearish market has acted as a signal for more cautious trading behaviour.”While Grayscale has seen the biggest slide in trading volumes, the drop in institutional volume for cryptocurrency ETPs seems to have affected most of the market and not just Grayscale. Tsavliris told Cointelegraph:“Other ETPs generally experienced a decrease in volume as well. However, Grayscale's products are the most well-known, and their products represent the majority of current ETP trading activity - even after the sharp decrease. They manage assets upwards of $4.7bn for their Bitcoin Trust product, with 84% of new investments in Q2 coming from institutional investors dominated by hedge funds. As a result of their market position in the US as well as their clientele, their trading activity was more sensitive to the factors mentioned above.”"

The allure of digital currencies is likely to increase further if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approves a Bitcoin ETF, but only Commissioner Hester Peirce is supportive of such a move.

286,"Several crypto assets are currently priced near their mid-2017 valuations, potentially offering a second chance to latecomers. One major caveat, however — these assets may never reach their highs again, or even rise at all from here. Buyers beware and do your own research. Litecoin (LTC) sat at a price of around $33 on June 11, 2017, according to a historical snapshot from CoinMarketCap. Its current press time price trades slightly higher, at around $46 — a dramatic difference from its all-time highs near $365. Ethereum (ETH) held a price of $340, just $2 away from its current press time price near $342. Ripple's XRP hosted a $0.27 price tag. Currently, the asset actually boasts a lesser price at $0.23 per coin. Zcash (ZEC), on the other hand, cost $331 per coin back then. The asset currently trades near the $54 mark, a far cry from its former glory.  Crypto has provided second and third chances at wealth through the years, although second chances sometimes come in different shapes and sizes. Just because these assets carry prices similar to years prior, it does not mean that those assets will ever see any price increase from here whatsoever.Decentralized finance, or DeFi, appears to be a current early adopter category within the crypto industry. Many assets involved in the sector presently see obscenely bullish price action while participants seek high interest rates in tandem with loans and other speculatory activities. This sector, however, is also quite risky and complicated. Opinions vary on the viability of the DeFi niche as a whole. "
287,"This is Part 3 of a three-part series in which Andrew Levine outlines the issues facing legacy blockchains and posits solutions to these problems. Read Part 1 on the upgradeability crisis here and Part 2 on the vertical scaling crisis here.Upgradeability, vertical scaling and governance: What all three of these issues have in common is that people are attempting to iterate on top of a flawed architecture. Bitcoin and Ethereum were so transformative that they have totally framed the way we look at these issues.We need to remember that these were developed at a specific moment in time, and that time is now in the somewhat-distant past when blockchain technology was still in its infancy. One of the areas in which this age is showing is in governance. Bitcoin launched with proof-of-work to establish Byzantine fault tolerance and deliver the decentralization necessary to create a trustless ledger that can be used to host digital money.With Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin was seeking to generalize the underlying technology so that it could be used not just to host digital money but also to enable developers to program that money. With that goal in mind, it made perfect sense to adopt the consensus algorithm behind the most trusted blockchain: proof-of-work.Proof-of-work is a mechanism for minimizing Byzantine fault intolerance — proving BFT is not as easy as people like to pretend. It is not a governance system. Bitcoin doesn’t need a governance system because it is not a general-purpose computer. The reason general-purpose computers need a governance system is that computers need to be upgraded.One needs no clearer proof than the magnitude of changes planned for Ethereum 2.0 and the aggressive advocacy for the adoption of the necessary hard forks. We are not the first to point out this problem. The founders of Tezos accurately forecast this problem, but they ultimately failed to deliver a protocol that meets the needs of most developers for the following reasons:Developers must be able to code up the behaviors they would like to see in the blockchain as smart contracts, and there must be an on-chain process for adding this behavior to the system through an explicit upgrade path. In short, we should be able to see the history of an upgrade just as we can see the history of a given token.The appropriate place for governance is in determining which smart contracts are made into “system” contracts based on whether they will increase the value of the protocol. The challenge is, of course, coming to a consensus on that value.The most controversial point I will make is the critical need for algorithmically distinct classes that act as checks and balances on one another. While intuition might suggest that more classes make consensus more difficult, this is not the case.First, if the upgrade candidates are already running as smart contracts on the mainnet, objective metrics can be used to determine whether the ecosystem would benefit from turning the “user” contract into a “system” contract. Second, if we were not trying to bundle upgrades into hard forks, they could be piecemeal and targeted. We would simply be trying to assess, in a decentralized manner, whether the system would be improved by a single change.It is commonly understood that in any economy, there are essentially three factors of production: land (infrastructure), labor and capital. Every major blockchain only recognizes one class: capital. In PoW chains, those who have the most capital buy the most ASICs and determine which upgrades can go through. In proof-of-stake and delegated proof-of-stake chains, control by capital is more direct.In addition to being problematic on its face, the absence of any other classes to act as a check on capital has a paradoxical effect that leads to political paralysis. No group is homogenous. Classes, properly measured, create efficiency — not inefficiency — by forcing the members of a class to come to a consensus around their common interest. Without such pressure, subclasses (groups within a class) will fight among one another, leading to gridlock. Properly designed classes motivate their members to come to an internal consensus so that they can maximize their influence on the system relative to the other classes.If we can codify individual classes representing infrastructure, development and capital, then upgrades that receive approval from all three classes must, by definition, add value to the protocol, as these three classes encompass the totality of stakeholders within any economy.Such a governance system, when combined with a highly upgradeable platform, would be able to rapidly adapt to the needs of developers and end-users, and evolve into a platform that can meet the needs of everyone.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
288,"Decentralized exchanges are undoubtedly an exciting development in crypto. DEXs facilitate the trading of cryptocurrencies directly between users, without the need for a trusted intermediary. This, in turn, allows users to keep custody of their funds.However, while DEXs have their advantages, they still lack in terms of regulations and scalability, which are key considerations that could determine the future trajectory of the crypto industry. Centralized exchanges will continue to play a pivotal role in this ecosystem, providing the depth of liquidity needed to grow the wider crypto community.DEXs tend to not be regulated and not require their users to undergo Know Your Customer verification. DEXs may be peer-to-peer marketplaces running on a blockchain and run by smart contracts, but many wrongly believe that DEXs have no liability.In the current landscape, it will be increasingly unlikely for DEXs to avoid regulations or fly under the radar of regulators, especially as customer protection takes on greater prominence in this space.Centralized exchanges are ahead in this regard, as they are already subject to regulations and most have KYC verification processes in place. The centralized exchange verification process, for example, is a standardized compliance measure for KYC, Anti-Money Laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws and regulations. These security practices discourage illegal transactions and improve wallet security on the platform.While growing in popularity, DEXs tend to have lower volume and liquidity than centralized exchanges. Having sufficiently deep liquidity helps centralized exchanges contain big market swings and volatility spikes.Such deep liquidity can be found on exchanges such as Bitfinex, which has the most depth of liquidity for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Bitfinex’s underlying strength and depth of liquidity were most evident over a 24-hour period on March 12 and 13 when the price of Bitcoin plummeted by 50%. Bitfinex was reported to have represented the majority of top-tier exchange trading volume across BTC/USD and BTC/Tether (USDT) markets during this period.While DEXs offer non-custodial solutions and run everything on-chain, the fact that every single order and transaction is made public on-chain leads to a possibility of blockchain node operators frontrunning users’ trades. This can hinder the individual trading experience as well as the growth of the crypto community.DEXs still have room to grow when it comes to scalability due to its limited capacity.Some of the fastest blockchains claim to process as many as 50,000 transactions per second. However, this may be misleading, as this metric may not mean a throughput of 50,000 transactions per second across each pair or product listed. If more than one product is listed, the capacity may drop to 500 transactions per second per product.With more users pouring into DEXs, this may cause delays to the network, increase network transaction fees, as seen on Ethereum, and hinder the scaling of blockchains.Meanwhile, centralized exchanges have proven to be scalable, high-performance infrastructures, and their connectivity supports a variety of strategies, including high-frequency trading. This allows centralized exchanges to attract professional investors and institutional investments that the crypto industry needs to scale and eventually achieve mass adoption.Related: Institutional investors are turning their attention to decentralized financeIn fact, centralized exchanges have even been taking a page out of DEXs’ book and offering features such as non-custodial solutions. Such hybrid solutions allow centralized exchanges to provide a high-performance experience and the benefits of self-custody while remaining compliant with regulations.As DEXs gradually find their place, it is clear that centralized exchanges will continue to evolve and play a key role in leading the crypto industry and community in the years ahead.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
289,"Bitcoin (BTC) may soon “decouple” from traditional assets, says statistician Willy Woo as a key gold relationship breaks out of a long-term downtrend.In a tweet on Sep. 25, Woo forecast that Bitcoin would act like a successful startup in accruing new interest and going its own way.Adoption, he argued, would follow a classic S-curve pattern, much in the same way that a startup grows. This would take precedence over investors looking for a hedge against other assets.“Bitcoin will decouple from traditional markets soon, but driven by its internal adoption s-curve (think startup style growth) rather than changes in perceptions as a hedging instrument by traditional investors,” Woo wrote.“Fundamentals of user adoption have already broken all time highs.”As Cointelegraph reported, both Bitcoin network hash rate and difficulty are at record levels, underscoring the competitiveness and long-term appreciation of profitability among miners.Just as Woo predicted a breakaway from Bitcoin’s current dependency on factors such as the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY), another chart highlighted that change may already be afoot.Bitcoin’s price ratio versus gold, in a downtrend since the all-time BTC/USD highs in December 2017, broke to the upside when the pair reclaimed $12,000 at the end of July.A subsequent retest of the trendline appeared to confirm new support, resulting in a bounce to the upside.The weekly chart performance over the past three years was keenly noted by Travis Kling, hedge of crypto hedge fund Ikigai.BTC/USD vs. gold ratio historical chart showing downtrend and breakout. Source: Travis Kling/ TwitterWoo’s words meanwhile come as arguably this year’s biggest Bitcoin adopter, MicroStrategy, likewise denies that its move to purchase $425 million of BTC was a hedge.In an interview with RT host Max Keiser on his Keiser Report TV show on Thursday, CEO Michael Saylor explained that he genuinely wanted MicroStrategy to adopt a “Bitcoin standard.”“What we have is a war on currency, and not a war to make the U.S. currency weaker than the euro; the war on currency is anybody holding currency is getting attacked,” he said.“And so now we’re starting to realize that currency is being made toxic by the political… financial policies of the central banks, you kind of have to run away from that currency to something that’s not toxic, and I think that Bitcoin is that non-toxic currency.”He noted that swapping cash for Bitcoin also made sense because scarce assets were inflating by up to 25% in 2020, and 10% each year thereafter. Sitting on cash reserves, therefore, was akin to an “ice cube that’s melting.”"
290,"Authorities in Russia appear to be going after Binance — the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange — as its domain is now in the list of prohibited websites in the country. On Sept. 24, Binance officially announced on its Russian Telegram channel that Russian telecom regulator Roskomnadzor has added the website to the register of platforms disseminating prohibited information.According to the announcement, Binance has been placed in the list due to distribution of data related to the acquisition of digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC). Gleb Kostarev, Binance’s head of operations for Russia and the CIS, told Cointelegraph that the exchange announced the news immediately after the exchange received a notification from Roskomnadzor.Despite the domain being placed on the list of prohibited websites, Russians can still access it without any additional tools like a VPN. As of press time, the URL can be found on the official register of blacklisted sites of Roskomnadzor. According to the data, the website was listed on June 2, 2020, while the access to the website “is not limited.”In the public announcement, Binance executives emphasized that they haven’t received any information about the restriction prior to Sept. 24, stating:As Binance's website was purportedly blacklisted by Roskomnadzor in June 2020, the action appears to be unrelated to Binance’s plans to launch its crypto debit card in Russia since the plans for it were announced slightly later, in September 2020.In late August, Roskomnadzor also blocked BestChange.ru, a major cryptocurrency website in Russia that provides an aggregator service of about 400 local crypto exchange websites."
291,"Popular day trader and founder of Barstool Sports Dave Portnoy revealed that he bought $1.25 million worth of Bitcoin even though he thinks its “just one big Ponzi scheme” in an interview with crypto podcaster Anthony Pompliano. Portnoy summed up his view of crypto trading as:The sport and pop culture celebrity, whose day trading exploits have become hugely popular during the coronavirus pandemic, only recently delved into the world of crypto. He entered the Bitcoin (BTC) market in mid-August, following a meeting with the billionaire Winklevoss twins.Portnoy said that he knew within 15 minutes of seeing responses to his Twitter posts about Bitcoin, that he had to get into crypto because “these are kind of like my people.”At one point, Portnoy claimed, he held $1.25 million in BTC. However just eight days into his crypto experience, his Chainlink investment took a sharp hit, at which time Portnoy announced: “I’m out on crypto because coins don’t always go up.”Following his exit, Portnoy appeared to be having withdrawals, claiming his “heart is crypto” and he’ll be back.However, Portnoy appears to have been shaken by the experience. The price volatility on his crypto portfolio of over $1 million was too erratic and he thought it was too much money to gamble with when he didn’t know what was going on. “There is no rationale why it is going up, I have no idea why it is going up or down,” he explained,Even though he’s pulled out, he still intends to get back into Bitcoin eventually. “I’ll get back into Bitcoin.

292,"Today the price of Bitcoin (BTC) abruptly rose by 6% from $10,136 to as high as $10,743. After this powerful 24-hour rally, analysts are now turning cautiously bullish for various reasons but will Bitcoin price be able to tackle the $11K mark any time soon?Cryptocurrency daily market performance snapshot. Source: Coin360Currently, the factors that appear to be lifting investor sentiment are negative funding rates, BTC whale activity, and the U.S. dollar’s recent weakness.BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView.comAt the moment, Bitcoin’s funding rate across various futures exchanges is either neutral or negative, despite the price hovering above $10,000.Bitcoin futures exchanges utilize funding to ensure there is balance in the market and it disincentivizes the majority of the market to prevent the market from swaying to one side for a prolonged period.If long contracts, or traders betting on a Bitcoin price increase represent the overwhelming majority, they will need to pay short contract holders. The opposite applies if short contract holders dominate the market.When the funding rate turns negative, it means the majority of the market is shorting BTC. Typically, when funding rates remain below zero, it causes a short squeeze and a surge in BTC price. It can also be an indication that the short bet is overcrowded, raising the likelihood of an upsurge.A popular pseudonymous trader known as “DonAlt” tweeted that it is “weird” to see sentiment bearish with negative funding rates. He said:“It's very, very weird seeing sentiment be this bearish, with neutral or negative funding above $10K. Don't think I can remember a time where that has happened before.”The trader also noted that he sees an absorption of selling pressure at $10,000. He added: “Now I'm seeing absorption at $10K, it looks like the only people selling are people on derivatives and I've closed my shorts to see how the next week is going to play out.”The overcrowded Bitcoin market with short contracts coincides with some top whales possibly moving their holdings off exchange.According to Whalemap, a group of on-chain analysts who track crypto whale activity, top buyers moved their BTC on Sept. 23. A map of unspent HODLer Bitcoin. Source: WhalemapThe analysts said top buyers moving their funds have typically been a bullish catalyst for BTC. They explained:“Top buyers were moving their coins yesterday. From my personal experience looking at this metric, next day after top buyers move, we go up.”As the number of COVID-19 cases surges in the U.S., lawmakers are locked in a stalemate over the future of a much needed stimulus package and this is leading strategists to speculate on a weakening U.S. dollar.Before the initial rally, Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said $10,700 to $10,800 is likely for Bitcoin. The trader emphasized that if the dollar slows down, the $11,200 to $11,400 range could be a reasonable target. He wrote:“Nice, we're holding here. Looks ready to test the $10,700-10,800 areas and maybe even $11,200-11,400 if the dollar slows down for a bit.”"
293,"Researchers at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance recently revealed that 100 million people around the world currently hold Bitcoin (BTC) and other blockchain-based assets.In 2018, the 2nd Global Cryptoasset Benchmarking Study estimated the number of identity-verified crypto users at about 35 million globally. As of Q3 2020, there are up to 191 million accounts opened at crypto exchanges — a figure which doesn’t include self-hosted wallets.The researchers explained the significant increase:“This 189% increase in users may be explained by both a rise in the number of accounts (which increased by 37%), as well as a greater share of accounts being systematically linked to an individual’s identity, allowing us to increase our estimate of minimum user numbers associated with accounts on each service provider.”The study also highlights the geolocation of consumers, as crypto firms operating from North America and Europe “report higher user activity, with the median firm indicating that 40% of total users are considered active.” According to the researchers, this figure was much lower for APAC and Latin America-based firms, which reported a rate of 16% and 10% respectively.The Centre's methodology combined public data and surveys, using a combination of verified user data and the average share of ID-verified accounts surveyed for the study.Despite researchers' claim that there are limitations to the methodology used in the study, they believe that the published numbers offer “a reliable, approximate figure of the total number of crypto asset holders globally.”"
294,"A newly discovered trojan, known as Alien, is attacking crypto apps on Android phones, including Coinbase, Blockchain.com, and Luno. This new malware strain is based on the notorious Cerberus trojan, which wreaked havoc in the Google Play store until the team responsible became complacent. Lack of continued distribution allowed Google Play Protect to almost completely eradicate Cerberus by August 2020.Alien targets 226 Android apps, mostly geared toward the banking industry. In addition to stealing user credentials, the malware can install and remove applications from the infected device, and even intercept notifications:The choice of Coinbase and Blockchain.com is understandable as these are two of the most popular crypto apps. It is less clear why the hackers targeted the much smaller Luno exchange (which was recently acquired by the Digital Currency Group), yet omitted (so far as we know) other industry giants like Binance."
295,"In a virtual fireside chat with the D.C. Bar, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce criticized the commission’s long-standing resistance to a Bitcoin ETF.Moderator Ashley Ebersole asked about the SEC’s highly public dissatisfaction with a long series of Bitcoin ETF proposals in the U.S. Peirce, who is often known as ""CryptoMom,"" responded with opposition to those rejects: “I’ve been pretty outspoken about my disagreement with my colleagues on disapproving some of these exchange-traded products.”Bitcoin is not uniquely volatile as a base investment for an exchange-traded fund, Peirce argued. “I would like us to look at how we’ve looked at similar products in the past. Many other products that we have are based on products that are messy,” she continued. “You can still have an orderly product built on top of it.”Ji Kim of Gemini Trust continued along the same line of questioning as to what the SEC’s concern with a Bitcoin ETF is. Peirce answered “You can’t assume that markets are not going to function if they’re not subject to the exact same sort of regulation as securities markets are.”Regarding a recent interpretation from the Treasury’s bank regulator that banks can custody reserves for fiat-based stablecoins, Peirce noted that the SEC was paying close attention to such developments “There is a lot of regulatory coordination going on.”Despite the new ruling, Peirce cautioned that some products advertised as stablecoins are in fact securities: “You can’t just put the label stablecoin on it and expect it to be regulated that way.”Commissioner Peirce started her second term at the SEC last month, meaning she is set to remain on the commission until 2025."
296,"This is Part 2 of a three-part series in which Andrew Levine outlines the issues facing legacy blockchains and posits solutions to these problems. Read Part 1 on the upgradeability crisis here and Part 3 on the governance crisis here.The advent of the internet has revealed that we have a digital self that can amplify our real-world power thanks to the ability to interact with people anywhere on Earth and coordinate actions that our physical selves never could.But our digital selves are shackled — imprisoned on private computers belonging to Facebook, Google, Amazon, Netflix, Twitter, and the list goes on. These private monopolies don’t actually produce technology; rather, their product is us — our digital selves — and their entire purpose is to extract as much value from us as they possibly can.Many people recognize the potential for blockchain technology to disrupt these private monopolies and oligopolies, but unfortunately, no specific blockchain has been able to reach beyond the walls of the existing blockchain and cryptocurrency community.And if it did, it would not be technically capable of supporting the kind of growth and adoption needed to empower every person on Earth to take control of their digital selves. Why is that? Is it just a matter of picking the right features? Switching to proof-of-stake? Sharding?Unfortunately, the problem is much bigger than one or two missing features and will not be resolved by the planned changes to existing protocols because the problems lie at the very foundation of how they are constructed. The very architecture limits the potential for these platforms to scale vertically.Vertical scaling is how you manage the growth of a single node (computer) in a network. Blockchains are databases that never discard information. Information is only added to the database, never removed. This makes growth an even bigger problem. Not only that, but most blockchains are not designed to make efficient use of the various parts of a computer. This adds up to a big database, consuming a lot of computational resources on a given machine in an inefficient manner.In order to compensate for these shortcomings, node operators rely on expensive enterprise-grade hardware — specifically, random-access memory, or RAM, and non-volatile memory express, or NVMe, which is what pushes network participation (node operation) beyond the grasp of ordinary people. And somehow, we’re supposed to believe that is not bad for decentralization!Ironically, one of the strongest arguments for the existence of a vertical scaling crisis is the level of demand for horizontal scaling solutions.As of this writing, an Ethereum full node still does not exceed 500 GB. That’s nothing! And yet, it is also absolutely true that a complicated, risky mechanism needs to be added to Ethereum so that its blockchain can be broken up into bits and pieces, and that precious computational resources need to be spent on simply enabling these “shards” to communicate with one another, let alone perform meaningful computations.The problem is that horizontal scaling — sharding — is not a substitute for vertical scaling. Imagine you have a factory producing 1,000 cars per year, but there is sufficient demand for 2,000 cars. What do you do first: build a new factory or try to make more cars out of the factory you already have? Vertical scaling is optimizing the factory to produce more cars before simply building a new factory. Blockchain nodes are the “factory,” and what determines their output is how efficiently they use the components in a computer.Speaking from direct experience, blockchains are horribly unoptimized with respect to node resource management, which makes them the perfect candidate for vertical scaling solutions.In blockchain, there are essentially two lineages: Ethereum and BitShares. Many people might not be familiar with BitShares, but its architectural design underpins some of the most performant blockchains in the space, including EOS, Hive and Steem. While Ethereum, and the many chains that are modeled on it, remains the most highly valued general-purpose blockchain with the most decentralized applications and unique users, the BitShares line absolutely dominates in terms of raw transaction activity, making it the performance king.My team, arguably, has more experience in the BitShares line than any other team on Earth, so we will focus on that design. Because blockchains in the BitShares line are capable of performing so many more transactions per second, this actually increases the importance of vertical scaling — because their blockchain state is growing so much faster.Vertical scaling, in the computing context, is essentially all about using the cheapest form of memory (disk) whenever possible and to the greatest extent possible. In the case of blockchains, the two most relevant processes are fork resolution and storing state. There are all of these different versions of the database out there (“forks”), and the nodes have to come to a consensus on which one is the “right” one. That’s fork resolution.Now, you have an irreversible database that needs to be stored. Ideally, you want that stored on the cheapest possible medium (disk) as opposed to the most expensive (RAM).Because you want forks to be resolved as fast as possible, you want these computations to be done in RAM (fast memory). But once the forks have been resolved and new transactions have been added to the irreversible state, you want to store this database in disk. The problem with blockchains from the BitShares line is that they achieve their performance through a design that never actually reflects the current state of the blockchain. Instead, when each block is applied, the pending transaction state is “undone,” the old values are written back to the database, and then the block is applied.One problem with this approach is that most of the time, this means performing the exact same calculations again and writing the same state back to the database that was just there, which is extremely inefficient.Even more relevant to the issue of vertical scaling is that this design means the irreversible state as a whole cannot be stored on disk without having to “pop” blocks back out of disk and into RAM to resolve forks. Not only does this increase the RAM load on a given node, but it also has very serious consequences with respect to leveraging RocksDB.RocksDB is a database technology developed by Facebook to power its news feed. In short, it enables us to get the performance of RAM but from disk. Many blockchain projects are using RocksDB in various ways, but the problem with the database design we have outlined is that the constant need to undo pending transactions and rewrite to the database negates the benefits of RocksDB.Facebook’s news feed is all about database reads. Consider how many posts you scroll through before you engage with a single one. For that reason, RocksDB is designed to work best when there are far more reads to the database than writes. The database design outlined above leads to so many database writes that it negates the benefits of even using RocksDB.In order to take full advantage of RocksDB, we need to rebuild the blockchain from the ground up to efficiently ferry blocks from RAM to disk while minimizing the number of writes so as to benefit from RocksDB. We can accomplish this by eliminating the need to undo/rewrite and creating a single database that tracks irreversible state and never needs to be undone.This would enable us to minimize RAM use in nodes by efficiently ferrying irreversible blocks out of RAM and into disk without having to bring them back. We estimate that this could reduce the cost of running a node by as much as 75%! Not only would this make node operation more accessible, increasing the number of nodes in operation, but these cost savings would ultimately be passed along to users and developers.Existing blockchains are reaching the performance limits of what they can get out of a single node as a consequence of how they resolve forks and how they store their blockchain state. In this article, we have explained how database design can lead to a fork resolution process that increases RAM use as well as database writes that negate the benefits that could accrue from the use of RocksDB, ultimately leading to less efficient blockchain nodes.The truth is that there is a lot more to vertical scaling than this single problem. Blockchain ecosystems are complex, with many components that feedback into one another. Decreasing the cost of running an individual node is critical for increasing the number nodes in operation and reducing the costs of using the network, but there are also tremendous gains to be had by minimizing network congestion, incentivizing efficient node operation and more.Our goal is not to explain in detail how one can solve the vertical scaling problem but to give some insight into the nature of what we think is a dramatically underappreciated problem in the blockchain space. Horizontal scalability is absolutely a very important area of interest, but if we ignore the problem of vertical scalability, all we will accomplish by horizontally scaling is dramatically increasing the number of horribly inefficient nodes.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

Source: WhalemapWhalemap, an on-chain analysis firm that tracks Bitcoin whale activity, observes areas where whales, or high-net worth individuals, accumulate or move their holdings. Green clusters indicate areas where whales last bought Bitcoin. Given the tendency of whales to wait until break even or in profit to sell, the clusters could act as resistance areas.There are an abundance of whales who are at a loss or breakeven until BTC hits $10,842, clusters show. That also means that there is potentially a high number of whales that might sell in the near term.The whale data also shows that some whales likely sold in the $10,900 to $11,100 range. The “HODLer” activity of whales indicates sell-offs at that resistance range, which is typically a bearish sign.The researchers at Whalemap said HODLer activity has declined in the past two days, showing an uncertainty in direction. They explained:“HODLer activity: Looks like they were quite active at the 10.9-11k prices. Not a good sign usually. But, we are quite clear so far for today and yesterday's HODLer bubbles also do not show much activity.”The timing of BTC’s rejection from $11,100 matches the clusters and where whales began to sell. Bitcoin has also struggled to recover beyond $10,570, the second and the largest whale cluster in the short term.Bitcoin has continued to see steep rejections since its steep drop from $11,179 to $10,296 on Sep. 21. The levels of $10,550, $10,450 and $10,370 have served as resistances in the last 48 hours.The clusters and the sell-off of whales above $11,000 indicate BTC is likely to stagnate in the foreseeable future. The decreasing activity among whales also hints that a large spike in volatility is not expected.The HODLer volume of Bitcoin whales. Source: WhalemapCryptocurrency traders are seemingly anticipating an extended period of consolidation, at least throughout September. Considering the intensity of the BTC drop within a short period, BTC would likely remain less volatile.Edward Morra, a Bitcoin trader, said the BTC price trend remains bearish until it closes above $11,000. As the clusters show, BTC faces numerous heavy resistance levels on its way towards the $11,000 level.The lackluster technicals of Bitcoin coincide with an unfavorable macro backdrop. In the near term, the weakness of gold, the stock market, and the rally of the U.S. dollar could amplify selling pressure on BTC. Morra said:“Still bearish since September started, bullish either above $11k on daily or below in untested demand.”Cantering Clark, a cryptocurrency technical analyst, said the $9,600 to $10,000 range could form a “bear trap.” The $9,600 remains an unclosed CME gap, which makes it a likely short-term target. He said:“Think over the coming weeks we have a lot of ranging and consolidation to do. I do think that this 9.6-10k area is going to set up a nice bear trap at some point. Will be looking to swing SOS for that.”"

In the latest episode of his Market Pulse YouTube series, Vays said he was looking for a BTC price bottom of $9,000.BTC/USD has maintained $10,000 support this week but has so far failed to reclaim higher levels after its fall from $11,000 several days ago. “If we break down, I think $9,000 is a very good ‘buy the dip,’” Vays said.“What is my worst case scenario low point if we break down? My worst case scenario is $7,000.”Vays added that $9,000 for him was the “most realistic” outcome of a bearish trend taking hold of Bitcoin markets.“The longer Bitcoin stays above $10,000, the more bullish Bitcoin is,” he continued.“Consistency on the way up is bullish; consistency on the way down is bearish.”Bitcoin has focused on $10,000 in a way which is bullish compared to its bottom of $3,600 in March, but less convincing versus recent highs of $12,500. Reclaim $12,000, however, and for Vays, “the sky’s the limit.”BTC/USD 1-month price chart.

Next month, that level will increase to sit in line with Vays’ $7,000 prediction.According to Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe, however, for the time being, BTC/USD has avoided losing the support that would open up the prospect of retesting the CME futures gap at $9,600.Still in play from July, the gap is the last noticeable short-term price draw at lower levels from futures, with the only other lying much higher at $16,000."
299,"Russia’s Ministry of Finance is continuing to push regulations for the cryptocurrency industry by proposing new tax requirements.The ministry now reportedly wants to introduce criminal liability for failure to declare taxes on crypto, including prison terms of up to three years.According to a Sept. 24 report by Kommersant, the ministry proposes that individuals who fail to report an amount of over 1 million Russian rubles ($13,000) in annual crypto operations should serve a three-year prison term or hard labor.The ministry also proposed major fines for smaller unreported amounts. As such, any physical or legal entity in Russia would have to report their annual crypto income if its amount exceeds 100,000 rubles ($1,300). Failure to report such amounts are subject to fines of 30% from the total amount of crypto assets held, but no less than 50,000 rubles ($650), the report notes.The authority also proposes to require local cryptocurrency exchange services to report transactions on taxes every quarter. According to Kommersant, the new proposals refer to both Russia’s new crypto law “On Digital Assets” and the upcoming bill “On Digital Currency.” In the current version of the law “On Digital Assets,” Russian lawmakers do not provide either taxation rates for crypto, or general rules to report those transactions.It is not immediately clear what kind of crypto transactions the ministry wants to tax, as the authority only recognizes a few ways to obtain crypto. In early September, the ministry proposed a blanket ban on any crypto transactions except for obtaining it through three methods: inheritance, bankruptcy and enforcement proceedings."
300,"Crypto market data aggregator Glassnode has published data indicating that Bitcoin’s (BTC) realized capitalization has increased by more than 50% since tagging its all-time high of $20,000 at the end of 2017.The realized capitalization metric measures the value of each BTC when it was last moved on-chain, which enables analysts to estimate the aggregate cost-basis of market participants.However, coins on centralized exchanges are absent from the metric, indicating the data is probably more accurate in terms of the cost-basis of long-term investors rather than intra-day speculators.Bitcoin’s realized cap currently sits at $115 billion — $43 billion more than at the all-time high in 2017. Bitcoin’s current $190 billion market cap suggests that the BTC hodlers are presently enjoying an aggregate profit of 65%.Coinmetrics’ chart shows that realized capitalization continued to grow higher in the early months of 2018, pushing to test $90 billion three times between January and May despite prices having crashed back below $10,000.While pre-halving speculation saw Bitcoin’s realized cap grow by 6% in Q2 2020, the violent ‘Black Thursday' crash quickly reversed 2020’s gains. Since May, the BTC’s realized capitalization has steadily trended upwards.According to crypto data researchers IntoTheBlock, more than 72% of crypto addresses are currently profitable, with the largest sum of investments having been made in the $1,040 to $5,285, and $8,450 to $9,560, price ranges.Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum’s (ETH) realized capitalization of $26.3 billion is still a long way from reclaiming its past highs — currently sitting 25% lower than its 2018 record of $35 billion.Ether’s realized cap also experienced a much longer down-trend than BTC, having posted a local low of $22.4 billion during mid-April 2020. According to Intotheblock, 62% of Ether addresses are currently in profit, the largest share of which were purchased for less than $160."
301,"Tim Draper, the prominent venture capitalist and tech billionaire who purchased nearly 30,000 Bitcoins (BTC) that were seized from the Silk Road, has revealed his digital currency holdings span at least half a dozen different crypto assets.  Speaking at a recent investment conference, Draper revealed that his holdings include Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ripple (XRP), Tezos (XTZ), and Aragon (ANT), adding:Draper’s comments come only three weeks after his Twitter account appeared to be subject to a hack to promote BCH. The suspicious tweet announced that the VC had purchased BCH, thanking a fake account impersonating Roger Ver for providing “this innovation”.But the fact he does actually hold Bitcoin Cash casts a new light on the incident.Draper has been an active cryptocurrency investor for seven years, having made multi-million investments into several startups and burgeoning projects, including major U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase. In 2019, he announced that he had moved entirely out of public stock in favour of cryptocurrency.Draper has long been known to dabble in altcoins, having confirmed in 2017 that his fund participated in the Tezos ICO after a class-action lawsuit was filed against the project.On a Quora forum in October 2019, the billionaire said that he thinks the DLT payments processor Ripple was doing all the right things, and is set for “explosive growth”, leading to much higher prices, adding:Which only goes to show that even billionaires aren't very good at predicting prices.Earlier this year, he revealed that Ethereum (ETH)-based project Aragon received a $1 million investment from him in return for 1 million ANT tokens, effectively giving him 2.52% of the token’s total supply.His altcoin investments still appear to be dwarfed by his BTC holdings. In 2014 he purchased 30,000 BTC at the price of $632 per coin. This initial BTC investment has increased over 1,500% to the approximate value of $315 million.Draper is also unlikely to sell anytime soon, as earlier this year he reconfirmed his 2018 predicted that the coin will rise past $250,000 within the next two years. If this occurs, his BTC holdings would hold a value of $7.5 billion."
302,"As of now, the $622 million total open interest for BTC futures expiry on Friday seems quite relevant. This Friday, a total of $100 million in CME Bitcoin (BTC) options are set to expire. 58% of these are call (buy) options, meaning buyers can acquire BTC futures at a fixed price.As the expiry draws near, call options 10% or higher above the current BTC price are deemed worthless. Therefore, there’s not much to gain in rolling over this position for October. September CME call options open interest (contracts). Source: CMEEach CME contract represents 5 BTC, and the chart above shows which are the most significant levels for September call options. Note that a striking 86% of those are set at $11,300 and above. Hence those options are currently priced at $10 or less. This means there will be less pressure coming from the CME options expiry, with $8 million call options open interest ranging from $10K to $11K. On the other hand, put options between the same range amount to $12 million in open interest. As both call and put options are relatively balanced, the overall impact should be little to none. Therefore, one must check the remaining exchanges to analyze the options expiry impact.As the options markets leader, Deribit, holds a 75% share, equating to $554 million worth of open interest in BTC options set to expire this Friday. This figure is evenly distributed between call (buy) and put (sell) options.Deribit September BTC options open interest. Source: DeribitUnlike CME, Deribit traders have been more modest as only 70% of the call options open interest for September sits at $11,250 and above. As for the ones ranging from $10K to $11K, there’s $74 million in call options stacked against $110 million in put options.Although the Deribit number is far more significant than the CME’s, the $26 million imbalance does not seem relevant considering the underlying $2 billion in BTC daily volume.Futures contracts are a completely different instrument from options, as buyers and sellers must be evenly matched at all times.Although every contract is similar, perpetual futures (inverse swaps) do not expire. They are simply rebalanced every 8 hours, which means there is no impact on expiry dates.On the other hand, some derivatives exchanges offer regular futures contracts with monthly expiry. Unlike options markets, these traders can keep their positions open by rolling over ahead of expiry.CME has $284 million worth of BTC futures set to mature on Friday, although this figure should be reduced as traders move positions to October and November contracts. OKEx leads the remaining exchanges with $147 million, while Deribit has $73 million, Huobi $63 million, and BitMEX holds $46 million.As of now, the $622 million total open interest for BTC futures expiry on Friday seems quite relevant, considering spot (regular) exchanges maintain $2 billion in daily volume. During most of 2018 and 2019, there has been a pretty consistent Bitcoin price drop ahead of each monthly CME expiry. A more recent Cointelegraph study has shown that since October 2019, these such movements ceased to exist. To further disprove the CME negative price impact theory, let’s look at the last three expiries.BTC price in USD. Source: TradingViewJune was the only month where a 2% negative performance preceded the contract expiry.  Meanwhile, both July and August presented positive returns, therefore invalidating any negative expectations.The above data shows traders should be less worried about CME expiry, as it does not seem to have produced a significant impact in the previous months. Most likely the high correlation with the S&P 500 has been the primary reason behind the CME’s decaying influence.As for the 86% of worthless CME call options, those buyers will most likely have less appetite for the upcoming exposure. Therefore, overall sentiment from Friday is likely to have a negative impact going forward.Both OKEx and Deribit weekly contracts mature September 25 at 8:00 AM (UTC). Later on that day, CME futures are set to expire at 3:00 PM (UTC).The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

If the bulls can push the price back above $10,625, the recovery can extend to the 50-day simple moving average at $11,197.BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf the bulls can push the price above the 50-day SMA and the downtrend line, the recovery is likely to pick up momentum and reach the recent highs of $12,460. A break above this resistance will increase the possibility that the uptrend resumes.However, if the BTC/USD pair turns down from $10,625 or the 50-day SMA, the bears will once again try to sink the price below the $9,835 support. If they succeed, the decline can extend to the 200-day SMA ($9,204).The 50-day SMA has started to slope down gradually, while the 200-day SMA is moving up slowly. This suggests a balance between supply and demand and points to a few days of range-bound action between the moving averages.A breakout of either moving average will be a significant event that is likely to start a trending move.After the sharp fall on Sep. 21, the bulls are attempting to arrest the decline and start a relief rally in Ether (ETH). However, the small inside day candlestick pattern on Sep. 22 shows a lack of urgency among the bulls.ETH/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf the ETH/USD pair does not break above the downtrend line within the next few days, the bears are likely to intensify their selling. The relative strength index in negative territory suggests that the advantage is with the bears.If the pair turns down from the current levels or the downtrend line and breaks below the $308.392 support, the decline can extend to the 200-day SMA ($255).Conversely, if the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, it will be the first sign of strength. A breakout of the 50-day SMA ($389) will suggest that the correction has ended and a retest of the recent highs of $488.134 may be on the cards.XRP closed (UTC time) below $0.235688 on Sep. 21 and since then, the bears have not allowed the bulls to reclaim the level. The bears will now attempt to sink the price below $0.2290 and resume the downtrend.XRP/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf they succeed, the XRP/USD pair could decline to the 200-day SMA ($0.214). The bulls will try to defend this level aggressively because if the price sustains below the 200-day SMA, it acts as a stiff resistance as seen between March and July of this year (marked via ellipses on the chart).The first sign of strength will be a breakout and close (UTC time) above the downtrend line. This will increase the possibility of a move to the 50-day SMA ($0.269), which could act as a resistance. However, if the buyers can push the price above this resistance, bullish momentum is likely to pick up.The bulls purchased the dip on Sep. 22 but could not maintain the buying pressure today. This has renewed the selling and the bears are now attempting to sink Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to the critical support at $200.BCH/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe price is trading below both moving averages that are sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone, which suggests that the bears have the upper hand.If the $200 support cracks, the BCH/USD pair might start a new downtrend that can result in a fall to $140.This bearish view will be invalidated if the pair rebounds off the $200 level aggressively and rises above the 200-day SMA ($243).Polkadot (DOT) is witnessing a stiff battle at the $4 support level with the bears attempting to break below it and the bulls trying to defend it.DOT/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe small range day on Sep. 22 and the doji candlestick pattern today shows indecision among the bulls and the bears about the next direction.If the bears can sink the price below $3.90, the DOT/USD pair may decline to $3.5321. This is an important support to watch out for because if it cracks, the drop can extend to $2.60 and below it to $2.00.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push the price above $4.50, an up-move to $4.921 is possible.Binance Coin (BNB) plunged below the 50-day SMA ($23.78) on Sep. 21 but the bears could not sustain the selling pressure and the bulls reclaimed the level on Sep. 22. Currently, the bulls are attempting to sustain the price above the 50-day SMA.BNB/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewA breakout of the downtrend line will be the first sign that the correction might be over. Above this level, a relief rally to the $25.82–$27.1905 resistance zone is possible.However, the bears are likely to defend the downtrend line aggressively. If they can again sink the BNB/USD pair below the 50-day SMA and the $22 support, the decline may extend to the 200-day SMA ($17.95).The bulls are likely to buy the drop to the 200-day SMA and the strength of the rebound will suggest whether the downtrend is over or not.Crypto.com Coin’s (CRO) pace of decline has slowed down near the critical support at $0.144743, which shows that the selling pressure is reducing. However, any recovery attempt is likely to face resistance at the downtrend line.CRO/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewA weak relief rally from the current levels will suggest a lack of confidence among the buyers that the correction is over. That could attract selling by the aggressive bears who will then try to sink the price below $0.144743.If they succeed, the CRO/USD pair can decline to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.12749 but if this support also cracks, the next major support is $0.11, just above the 200-day SMA ($0.107).This bearish view will be invalidated if the pair turns up from the current levels and rises above the downtrend line.Litecoin (LTC) plummeted below the 200-day SMA ($46) on Sep. 21. If the bulls do not push the price back above this moving average quickly, the possibility of a fall to the next support at $39 increases.LTC/USD daily chart.

Any pullback is likely to face stiff resistance at the 200-day SMA.If the LTC/USD pair turns down from the 200-day SMA, it will increase the likelihood of a break below $39. If that happens, the decline may extend to $32. Conversely, if the bulls can push the price back above the 200-day SMA, the pair can move up to $51.Chainlink (LINK) broke below the $8.908 support on Sep. 21 and has continued its journey towards the next critical support at $6.90, which is just above the 200-day SMA ($6.62).LINK/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe RSI is close to the oversold levels for the first time since March, which suggests that the decline has been overdone in the short-term. Therefore, as the price nears the critical support at $6.90, the bulls might buy the dip.If the rebound off this level can rise above the downtrend line and the $8.908 resistance, it will be the first signal that the downtrend may be over.However, this does not mean that a new uptrend will start immediately because, after such a sharp fall, the price usually forms a bottoming pattern before turning bullish.The bulls purchased the dip below $146.20 on Sep. 22 but they could not push Bitcoin SV (BSV) above the downtrend line. This shows that the bears are selling on pullbacks to this resistance.BSV/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe downsloping moving averages and the failure of the RSI to rise above the 40 level suggests that the bears are in command.If the BSV/USD pair turns down and breaks below the $146.20–$135 support zone, a new downtrend might start. The first support on the downside is $100 but if the bears sink the price below it, the decline can extend to $77.Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, the pair could rise to the 200-day SMA ($185).The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

304,"A large portion of Bitcoin's (BTC) value lies within its limited 21 million coin supply, which means ownership of a small portion could lead to significant wealth — if mass global adoption occurs. ""There is only 0.0027 BTC for the current 7 billion people,"" trader, Bitcoin evangelist, and Twitter personality Davincij15 said in a Sept. 22 tweet, noting the worlds total population in relation to Bitcoin's total supply. Davincij15 is known for his early Bitcoin commentary, which harkens back to the asset's early days in 2011.The math behind Divincij15's idea is logically sound, although his line of thought relies heavily on a few factors — mainly Bitcoin's global adoption. The asset currently holds a market cap of approximately $194 billion. Gold, on the other hand, boasts a $9 trillion market cap. Bitcoin requires significant growth to reach the status of gold, an asset much of the world sees as a time-tested store of value. The U.S. dollar currently stands as the worlds reserve currency, holding a $1.98 trillion circulating supply, according to U.S. Federal Reserve data, which is somewhat closer the Bitcoin's market cap. Other factors go into the numbers than the circulating supply, however. The actual appropriate number comparison against U.S. dollars could be significantly higher. Altcoins present another hiccup in the equation. If people invest in other crypto assets, then money is diverted away from BTC, making it harder for the asset to reach top billing as the world's go-to option. Still, Bitcoin has garnered a large amount of attention and growth in 2020, including investment from mainstream giant, MicroStrategy."

306,"This is Part 1 of a three-part series in which Andrew Levine outlines the issues facing legacy blockchains and posits solutions to these problems. Read Part 2 on the vertical scaling crisis here and Part 3 on the governance crisis here.It is our belief that there are three fundamental problems, or crises, that are standing in the way of blockchain adoption: upgradeability, vertical scaling and governance. In this article, we are going to explore the upgradeability crisis and how computer operating systems could serve as a useful analogy that holds the secret to resolving this crisis and enabling blockchains to achieve mainstream adoption.The most powerful concept for understanding the upgradeability problem is “antifragility.” Proposed by Nassim Taleb, antifragility is a property of systems that improve when stressed. Fragile systems can seem to be working great most of the time, but when stressed, they fall apart, or “blow up.”Antifragility is a property that emerges from multilayered, hierarchical systems that contain fragile subunits that by breaking/dying/blowing up result in an overall healthier system. In nature, we call this process evolution. Evolution occurs when a species replaces a less successful trait with a more successful trait. In computing, we call such improvements “upgrades.”The problem with the major blockchains we know today is that they weren’t designed to be upgraded, which means they can’t evolve. The reason why evolution is so important is that it enables systems to survive “black swans,” which are highly unpredictable events with severe consequences. Not only can antifragile systems survive black swans, they actually get better from them.In blockchains, there are virtually no separate layers with fragile subsystems that enable healthy adaptation to stressors. Instead of designing from a perspective of humility, the creators try to present themselves as infallible visionaries who have designed a perfect system that immediately deserves a high valuation.There is no greater proof of this than the reliance on hard forks for system upgrades. A hard fork is the opposite of an upgrade path. It is tossing out the old system and replacing it with a new one.There is, however, a silver lining to this analysis, which is that the solution is less about breaking through technical barriers than it is about breaking through psychological barriers. We aren’t designing blockchains from first principles, but are still primarily iterating on top of preexisting architectures like those in Bitcoin and Ethereum.There are many ways to implement a blockchain, but we often assume that the way in which these protocols implement some component of the blockchain is by default the “right way.” These protocols totally frame the way we look at these issues, leading us to create mental “maps” of the problems that were “drawn” before we had even begun exploring this new territory.Bitcoin and Ethereum were essentially the first decentralized computers. As with any new computing paradigm, in the early stages, engineers and developers are focusing their attention on whether they can even use the technology to solve a specific problem and, if so, use it to build their application. There’s no tooling and no platforms they can take advantage of, so they have to build everything from scratch and optimize their stack for their specific application.The end result is a monolithic piece of code powering an application designed to solve a specific problem.These early applications can be quite successful thanks to the first-mover advantage, but when it comes to software development, the success that comes from being a first mover is illusory. The first movers in software find the features, or “behaviors,” that users will find most valuable, thereby validating the new technology.But maintaining this advantage is nearly impossible because the application is built on a mountain of old code that few people understand or are capable of upgrading. Bugs are a nightmare to fix, and just maintaining the existing code becomes a Sisyphean task; forget improving it.At this stage, the apps can die for any number of reasons, but the underlying cause of death is that they are fragile. The black swan that ultimately wreaks havoc on existing apps is the development of the operating system. Operating systems make it an order of magnitude easier for developers to launch the same kind of applications, with the same core behaviors featured in the first movers.The advent of operating systems enables the technology to scale to the next level by making it easier and faster for developers to release better programs that penetrate more of the market and reach more users. Plus, it gives us another layer in the stack. Now, if one application blows up, the most critical lower layers remain unaffected.So, problem solved, right? While first-generation operating systems provide a massive competitive advantage to the application developers who adopt the right ones, they also suffer from the same upgradeability problem of the first-generation applications. They emerge as a means of providing core features, security and a shared user base, but not to maximize upgradeability. So, they eventually become feature-bloated, complex and difficult to upgrade.Upgrading the system requires a system reboot and reloading process that becomes longer and more disruptive the bigger and more complicated it gets. While one layer (the OS) is insulated from the mistakes made in another (the application layer), the OS itself remains fragile.Blockchains like Ethereum and EOS were designed like these early operating systems. They provide core features, security, a shared user base and a programmable “user space” that developers can leverage to add the custom features they need to power their specific applications.In the case of blockchains, the problems that plague first-generation operating systems are amplified due to immutability; they are constantly growing in size, which places additional stress on infrastructure and creates a distinct scaling challenge.Further, because they are decentralized, upgrades must make their way through a governance process that ends, under the best of circumstances, in the execution of a coordinated effort in which all of the computers stop running the old software and start running the new software (a new “fork”) at the exact same time. This is far from easy, which is why calling it a “hard” fork is especially apt.When certain changes require a hard fork, people are forced to bundle those changes because implementing them piecemeal would result in additional network downtime. This results in a “rider problem” similar to what we see in governmental systems where unrelated changes get attached to important changes. In other words, there is a centralization-in-time problem. Because every important thing must be done at the same time, and because people disagree on what is important, the moment in time when those changes must be implemented creates an attack vector.Regardless, hard forks wind up being big, political, risky and, most importantly, they take down the network! This dramatically slows the rate of progress, and because every major blockchain works this way, the sector as a whole stagnates.What we need is another layer beneath the operating system that enables the entire system to evolve. In operating systems, that layer is called a BIOS — a basic input/output system. But it’s important to remember that we are only using operating systems as an analogy. We need to construct this layer from first principles specifically for use in blockchains. That layer, like every other layer, must be made up of fragile subunits that can somehow “break” without blowing up the system as a whole.The creation of the BIOS was a critical step for mainstreaming computers because it enabled developers to rapidly build, test and iterate upon the applications that would make personal computers useful to ordinary consumers.If we want to cross that same chasm, we don’t just need a better blockchain OS, we need an operating system that is built on a BIOS-equivalent for the specific purpose of upgradeability.We must be able to add any feature to the blockchain without requiring a hard fork. This will enable the blockchain to adapt to stressors (attacks, bugs, missing features, etc.), improve itself, and scale to meet the needs of the masses.Until that day comes, the quality of blockchain-based applications will continue to stagnate, and the space will remain dominated by projects that might look like they are working on the surface but that aren’t being widely adopted, are inherently fragile and will one day “blow up.”The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
307,"In the previous weeks, the majority of the cryptocurrencies have seen a massive crash. Losses of 50-80% have been witnessed in the markets, particularly affecting the DeFi space.The major losers in the previous weeks were Curve DAO Token (CRV) and SushiSwap (SUSHI). Next to that, one of the biggest decentralized exchanges UniSwap (UNI) has also seen a substantial correction. Its token UNI dropped by 57% since its recent high at $8.65.Is the correction over for the DeFi sector, or will the crashes continue to last? Let’s take a look at the charts’ technicals.UNI/USD 6-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe 6-hour chart of UniSwap shows a 57% correction since its high at $8.65. After this, support was found between $3.50-3.80.Short-term relief is shown on the chart as UniSwap bounced with 35% in the previous days, but the trend still shows a downtrend. The first significant resistance zone is seen between $4.90-5.20, which is colored red. A further move up to $7 is on the tables if UniSwap shows strength and can break through this resistance zone.UNI/USDT 2-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe 2-hour chart shows a temporary trend shift. For the first time since the retracement, the price of UniSwap made a new higher high, as the previous high of $4.50 was broken.The price of UNI rallied from $3.75 to $5, marking a new higher high, which means making a new higher low now would likely be followed by a move up.In that perspective, the green zone between $4-4.25 should warrant support for a higher low. If that area sustains support, I’d be looking at a potential rally towards $6.It’s not surprising for other DeFi coins to follow suit as UniSwap is the leader in the DeFi space.SUSHI/USDT 2-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe chart of SushiSwap is less bullish than UniSwap but shows a few signals of a potential trend reversal.If the $1.30-1.325 area flips for support, a significant support area can be flipped again, which warrants a potential continuation upwards. This upwards run could continue toward the $1.65-1.70 area, as that’s the first significant resistance area.Of course, if the price of SushiSwap loses $1.30, a further downward drop becomes likely, in which Fibonacci extension has to be used for negative price discovery.CRV/USDT 2-hour chart. Source: TradingViewCurve DAO Token is showing an even worse chart than SushiSwap, and any bullish arguments are hard to find here.In the previous analysis, the Fibonacci extension tool was used to define lower target zones. If a particular asset goes into positive or negative price discovery, the Fibonacci extension tool is to define potential target zones, as seen with CRV.The target zone around the 1.618 Fib was hit, but the overall chart still looks overly bearish. In that case, the crucial breaker for Curve would be a breakout above $1.20. If that area breaks as resistance and becomes support, continuation toward $1.65-1.85 is likely.If that flip of $1.20 occurs, a potential relief rally on the market will likely occur. Overall, the sentiment is close to depression, another argument for a reversal to happen soon.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

308,"Christie’s is set to sell its first nonfungible token in an upcoming auction of what has been characterized as “the largest artwork” in the history of Bitcoin (BTC).Art historian turned blockchain artist Benjamin Gentilli, as part of the Robert Alice art collective, has created ""Portrait of a Mind"" — a monumental series of 40 paintings stretching over 50 meters in length.Drawing on the history of 20th century conceptualism as well as the founding myth of Bitcoin’s creation, ""Portrait of a Mind"" is a complete hand-painted transcription of the 12.3 million digits of the code that launched the cryptocurrency.By scattering the codebase into 40 globally distributed fragments, the project will “draw up a global network of 40 collectors where no one individual will hold all the code,” Gentilli said. He explained:“In each work, an algorithm has found a set of hex digits that together are highlighted in gold. These read a set of coordinates that are unique to each painting. 40 locations across 40 paintings - each location is of particular significance to the history of Bitcoin.”Speaking to Cointelegraph, Gentilli said he remains curious as to why much of the commemoration of Bitcoin emphasizes the publication of the whitepaper over and above the codebase itself, which, for him, is “the real historical document.” Christie’s will sell one painting from the series, “Block 21 (42.36433° N, -71.26189° E),” as part of its “Post-War and Contemporary Day Auction” on Oct. 7, at the end of a week-long exhibition of auctioned works in New York. The piece includes a unique fungible token as an integral part of the work and will be offered at an estimated price of $12–18,000.Early collectors of paintings from ""Portrait of a Mind"" include Binance founder Changpeng Zhao and Bloq chairman Matthew Rozsak. Gentilli has said that by showcasing and selling an NFT at Christie’s, he hoped to spur other contemporary artists to take a look at the NFT space. Aside from the creative inspiration artists can draw from cryptocurrencies’ complex cultural, technical and politically dynamic history, NFTs can also give artists “more control and a better stake in their practice over the long term,” he said.Just last week, Cointelegraph reported on the auction of a digital art piece based upon Bitcoin's fluctuating price action, which sold for over $100,000. Like “Portrait of a Mind,” the artwork integrated an NFT to vest its collector with tokenized ownership rights."
309,"Bitcoin (BTC) speculators waiting for a BTC price drop of even 35% will probably be waiting forever, new data shows.In a tweet on Sep. 22, quant analyst PlanB noted that Bitcoin will break the habit of a lifetime if it goes lower than $6,700.PlanB was referencing the 200-week moving average (200MA) for BTC/USD. A popular tool in his work, the 200MA has never been broken during Bitcoin price downtrends.As of Tuesday, the level equated to $6,700 and continues to rise by around $200 every month.As long as historic behavior continues as it has done since Bitcoin’s 200th week of existence, $6,700 will now form a definitive price floor.“BTC 200WMA never goes down. BTC monthly close has never been below 200WMA,” PlanB confirmed earlier in September when the figure stood at $6,600.He added that in March 2017, Bitcoin saw a “struggle” to clear the significant $1,000 mark for good. After succeeding, however, all-time highs of $20,000 arrived by the end of the year.This month, meanwhile, Cointelegraph noted that significant buy support from whales lays far higher, at $8,800.Bitcoin price vs. 200-week moving average historical chart.

Bitcoin should be in line to trade at an average $288,000 by that point — an “order of magnitude” more than at present, but so far, stock-to-flow has charted BTC price rises with complete accuracy and its methodology is yet to be disproven.Meanwhile, a survey about the future of Bitcoin price action published following the 200MA update has attracted 14,000 responses.

Since its weekend lows, Bitcoin prices have recovered around 2.4% to current levels.https://t.co/bFKcBHUDY4

1) Prices of $BTC and other #crypto assets tend to bounce most precipitously when the crowd is demonstrating a high level of FUD. This is exactly what we've been seeing for #Bitcoin, #Ethereum, and many #altcoins following the early September pic.twitter.com/YiCX3kZiurIt added that this is what has been happening since early September when markets plunged $60 billion in terms of total market capitalization.The analytics provider added;Following the early September slump, when there was also a lot of negative social sentiment, Bitcoin recovered around 12% to top out over $11k, and the same could happen again.This latest plunge a couple of days ago has resulted in a much smaller drop off for Bitcoin prices with just 7.5% lost to its low of $10,300.Santiment added that Bitcoin's weighted social sentiment on Twitter continues to hover around near two year lows indicating that there are a lot of doubters in the price level, keeping support at the mid-$10k zone. This would be good news for whales, the report added, which tend to go against the crowd.There was a similar opportunity with Ethereum where sentiment is also close to two-year lows.The metric is derived using a machine learning model on a large Twitter dataset containing over 1.6 million tweets which are ranked as positive or negative.The analytics provider also referenced another metric called MVRV which is a ratio that calculates the average profit and loss of different holders to determine whether a coin is currently over or under bought. It indicates that more people are currently down which could be a good entry point as there is an average return of negative 3.5% for traders over the past 30 days.Additionally, the Bitcoin Fear and Freed Index has now dropped into the fear zone at 43 which confirms the findings.Trader and Blockroots co-founder, Cantering Clark, stated that the current situation could be shaping up as a bear trap and Bitcoin could be seeing relief in the near future;Bitcoin investor Lark Davis says that regardless of what crypto markets are doing, September is usually a bad month for stock markets and Bitcoin’s correlation could lead to some rocky weeks ahead;Historically the S&P 500 has done poorly in September, and quite badly in October of election years. #Bitcoin's high correlation to the equity markets could mean that we are in for some big bumps over the next 6 weeks.

311,"Independent Bitcoin Lightning developer, Joost Jager, has outlined an exploit of the micro-payments network that could result in channels being compromised with very little effort and negligible cost.However, he said he’s hard at work on a possible solution.1/ Lightning is great, but can't say it is battle-tested. If script kids would be interested, they could take down those shiny new 5 BTC #wumbo channels with negligible cost and no effort at all. pic.twitter.com/9PTkxfF042Jager specifies that the attack could be carried out on wumbo channels, which essentially allow larger transactions between mutually agreeing parties on the Lightning network.A wumbo channel removes the limit to the total amount of Bitcoin that can be held in a regular Lightning channel — which is around $1,760 worth at today’s prices. It also removes the approx. $450 limit to how large an individual payment can be.Jager said the wumbo channels can be exploited because the channel cannot hold more than 483 hash and time-lock contracts (HTLCs) at any time regardless of its capacity. So a malicious actor sending 483 micro-payments to themselves, and holding on to the HTLCs is enough to incapacitate a channel for up to two weeks.The developer demonstrated that this could be achieved by using the maximum route length to add loops and more contracts to quickly reach that total for just a small initial outlay, 5.8 million satoshis in this example.He added that he had started a new firewall for Lightning nodes project called Circuit Breaker to address this problem. When asked whether this 'griefing attack' is the biggest unsolved attack vector on LN today, he added;With wumbo channels a user can signal that they want to send more BTC than the regular limits and find a node that is willing to receive. Regular Lightning users sending micropayments will not be affected but it is a much better option for business and enterprise payments.Wumbo channels are growing in adoption and Bitfinex has been the latest to announce support for them;#Bitfinex brings the Wumbo channel support to its #LightningNodes, allowing you to deposit and withdraw large amounts of #Bitcoin quickly and cheaply⚡

312,"Last Friday night, crypto YouTuber Ivan on Tech messaged me on Twitter. Shortly into our conversation, he graciously offered me an investment opportunity in “Bitcoin trading/mining”, courtesy of a platform that he alleged was associated with Binance. In reality, however, I was being approached by an Ivan impersonator, peddling a crypto affinity scam. The platform ""Ivan"" advertised, called Cryptobinance, has no affiliation with the actual Binance exchange, a representative of the company told Cointelegraph. But I played along with the scammer to see what additional information could be elicited from him. I told him that I was impressed by his offer and would be willing to invest 50 Bitcoin (BTC) into the scheme — funds that I claimed were part of my pension plan.I registered at Cryptobinance. The next step for me would have been to send some Bitcoin to the supposed-exchange's address in order to fund my investment activity. According to data from Crystal Blockchain, the address supplied (39vgPqvsT1YbahCUcRrjtHR6a1oWaUZzxN) has been active since August 23 and has received 0.3 BTC thus far. The address appears to belong to a Coinbase user. We do not know if this is the only address that this particular scammer uses to solicit unsuspecting investors, but a search for this address on the Bitcoinabuse website did not return any reports.Meanwhile, Ivan’s impersonator assured me that this investment would be fantastic for my portfolio:I was curious to see how low this scammer would go. After some consideration, I decided to invent a friend who I claimed was a paralyzed army veteran. My brave, though entirely fictional, companion had saved up some money, meant to be used for his medical expenses. These facts were of no consequence to faux-Ivan:Without hesitation, the scammer assured that both of us would profit handsomely, if only we would entrust our savings to Cryptobinance.It appears that not much has changed in terms of how Twitter handles scam-related accounts, in light of the now-notorious hack of its services back in July. During that event, a few teenagers held much of the online world hostage after managing to take over accounts belonging to Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and many others. Naught but a lack of ambition and foresight on the part of the hackers limited this major attack to a mere 12 BTC in damages. According to Blockstream’s co-founder Adam Back, it is almost impossible to convince Twitter to crack down on impersonators who openly scam the platform’s users:The problem has become so serious for Blockstream that they even created their own database of all scams trying to profit on their brand.Similar complaints have been levied against another major platform, YouTube. The abundance of YouTube scams involving Cardano (ADA) has forced its founder Charles Hoskinson to embed “I will never give away ADA” into his YouTube streams.At the same time, many legitimate crypto YouTubers have fallen victim to the platform’s censorship. Perhaps these platforms do not feel that the crypto niche is important enough to allocate adequate amounts of resources to monitoring for unscrupulous activities. However, as Twitter’s founder Jack Dorsey is a major crypto advocate himself, it comes as a surprise that Twitter hasn’t grasped the seriousness of this issue.This is especially problematic, given the proximity to the U.S. presidential elections and the many legitimate fundraising efforts occurring in tandem. If social media giants are unable or unwilling to establish adequate solutions to these dire threats, the blockchain community may need to provide users with their own viable, decentralized alternatives.There is no doubt that this behavior violates Twitter's Financial scam policy, which reads:The issue appears to be that the company may not have enough resources to police its large and ever-growing user base. In 2019, Dorsey and Vijaya Gadde, who leads trust and safety legal and public policy at Twitter, appeared on the Joe Rogan podcast to answer questions about the company's efforts to regulate speech on the platform. During the podcast, Gadde said that every day, users generate hundreds of millions of tweets, while the company employs only 4,000 individuals. Thus, much of the monitoring duties are delegated to contractors, whose numbers are adjusted dynamically depending on the demand. Dorsey said that in his opinion, blockchain technology is a game changer for the industry, as internet content will live forever, which presents unique challenges and opportunities:Towards the end of the conversation, YouTuber Tim Pool, who was co-hosting the podcast with Rogan, said that he hopes to see the blockchain version of Twitter soon, with Rogan responding: According to a spokesperson from Binance, the company files approximately 180 monthly scam reports. Similar to Blockstream, Binance has built an online portal, called Binance Verify, that allows users to determine the authenticity of all Binance-inspired accounts and websites.Cointelegraph has reached out to the real Ivan on Tech, but did not receive a response in time for publication."
313,"The $900 Bitcoin (BTC) price drop over the past two days might have been scary for novice traders, but those trading futures and options don't seem bothered. Cryptocurrency daily market performance snapshot. Source: Coin360As Bitcoin price rallied to $11,000 on Sept. 19, investors may have become overly excited as the price briefly broke an important resistance level. The steady rally lasted ten days and saw Bitcoin’s dominance rate rebound for a 15-month low and this had some traders calling for a return to the $12,000 level.This sentiment began to shift once it was clear BTC would not be able to hold the $11K mark and the correction to $10,300 had some analysts calling for a sub-$10K CME gap fill. While retail investors may have been spooked by the slight correction, professional investors gauge market conditions and sentiment by using different tools than those used by day traders and the retail crowd. Indicators such as basis, options skew, and futures open interest price provide real-time data on how professional traders adapted after the drop to $10,300, along with BTC's brief rebound to $10,500.The first step pro traders use is to look at futures open interest data to measure the total value of active contracts. Whenever traders have their positions liquidated due to insufficient margin, the exchange automatically closes their positions.As shown below, BTC total futures open interest dropped less than 5%, remaining at a healthy $4 billion level. The current figure is stable compared to a week ago, and indicates that liquidations due to insufficient margin were not that significant.Total BTC futures open interest. Source: Bybt.comThe underwater leveraged longs could undoubtedly have added more funding to prevent their positions from being forcefully closed. To assess whether this is the case preventing yesterday's sharp price drop from impacting liquidations, we need to analyze future contracts basis.Basis is also frequently referred to as the futures premium, and it measures the premium of longer-term futures contracts to the current spot (regular markets) levels. Professional traders tend to be more active than retail on such instruments due to the hassle of handling expiry dates. These fixed-month contracts usually trade at a slight premium, indicating that sellers request more money to withhold settlement longer. On healthy markets, futures should trade at a 5% or more annualized premium, otherwise known as contango.BTC 3-month futures annualized basis. Source: Skew.comThe above chart clearly states that the futures premium (basis) did not abandon its bullish stance, holding a near 6% annualized level. Apart from a brief moment on September 3, when Bitcoin faced a $2,000 drop over two days, the basis indicator has held above 5%.Nevertheless, this premium could have been caused by factors not directly related to traders' bullishness. If competing products in decentralized finance (DeFi) pay high incentives for cryptocurrencies deposits, sellers will demand a higher premium on future contracts.To clarify such uncertainty, one should turn to Bitcoin options markets. Call options allow the buyer to acquire BTC at a fixed price on contract expiry. On the other hand, put options provide insurance for buyers and protect against BTC price drops. For this privilege, the buyer pays an upfront premium to the contract seller.Whenever market makers and professional traders are tending bullish, they will demand a higher premium on call (buy) options. This trend will cause a negative 25% delta skew indicator.The opposite will hold true whenever large investors are worried about a short-to-medium term price correction. The put (sell) options that protect from downside should trade at a larger premium than call (buy) options during bearish markets. This situation will result in a positive 25% delta skew indicator.BTC 3-month options 25% delta skew. Source: Skew.comAlthough there is no set rule, a 25% delta skew indicator ranging from 10% negative to a positive 10% level could be deemed neutral. Numbers below that range are almost certainly an indicator of bullishness, and that is currently the case.Currently, there is no indication of desperation, bearishness, or unusual activity regarding BTC futures and options markets. Instead, the primary metrics show resilience and a slight bullish stance, a scenario which is opposed to what one might expect after the price failed to break through the $11K resistance.Yesterday's move happened in tandem with a 7.5% increase in the S&P 500’s volatility (VIX) indicator. The VIX has long been considered the traditional markets primary fear indicator.

Therefore, one shouldn’t alter their BTC positions exclusively based on the moves mentioned in this article.

This is apparently due to several members testing positive for COVID-19.

315,"Former police chief Yuri Zaitsev was recently sentenced to eight years in prison for acting as a bounty hunter for a dark web marketplace. In December 2018, Zaitsev was working as the leader of his unit within the Main Directorate for Drugs Control of the Republic of Khakassia — a law enforcement division analogous to the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA. At that time, he initiated contact with the operator of a darknet marketplace, offering to help hunt down a man who had appropriated drugs that were entrusted to him for placement in dead drops. In Russia, unlike the U.S., most dark web entrepreneurs do not trust the post office for shipments. The prevailing mode of dissemination of these illegal products is instead completed through dead drops — a method of delivery by which two parties can pass items or information back and forth without ever needing to meet in person.According to the Main Investigation Department, the cop received the equivalent of 52,000 rubles in Bitcoin (BTC) for his services. At the time, this was equivalent to approximately $750 U.S. doll, or 0.2 BTC. He was found guilty on charges of bribery and the disclosure of classified information.According to Zaitsev's wife, his prosecution was punishment for investigating senior officials within his agency. He was subsequently fired and prosecuted. From October–November 2019, Zaitsev uploaded a number of videos to YouTube in which he allegedly exposed corruption among senior officials in his Directorate. This appears to be what led to criminal charges against him for the disclosure of classified information. In November 2019, Zaitsev uploaded an appeal to President Vladimir Putin on YouTube in which he pleaded his case, but to no avail.During the unrelated Silk Road investigation, numerous law enforcement officials fell afoul to what they perceived as easy, untraceable Bitcoin. DEA Special Agent Carl Force managed to elicit 1,200 Bitcoin from Ross Ulbricht. He obtained the funds using an elaborate scheme in which he created multiple fake personas ranging from a major South American drug trafficker to a corrupt law enforcement official. One of the tasks assigned to him by Ulbricht was hunting down and murdering a former associate who had allegedly stolen Bitcoin from him. The actual thief was another law enforcement official involved in the investigation. The murder was staged by Force but never materialized in actuality.The events that took place in Khakasia a few years after the Silk Road saga seem in some ways like a cheap local knockoff of an expensive HBO show. As Karl Marx once said, history repeats itself “the first time as tragedy, the second as farce.”"
316,"A new survey commissioned by crypto asset insurance company, Evertas, a cryptocurrency insurance firm, found that institutional investors plan to significantly increase their stakes in Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets in the future.After surveying 50 institutional investors that collectively manage over $78 billion in assets in the United States and United Kingdom, a standout response was that 26% of participants believe that pension funds, insurers, family offices and sovereign wealth funds will raise their stakes in cryptocurrency “drastically”.64% of participants believe the increase in interaction will be moderate, but the group also expects that hedge funds will be more actively engaged in crypto. 32% of respondents believe hedge funds will increase their crypto holdings drastically.Institutional investors seem keen to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies partially because they believe regulations for the crypto market will improve and become clearer in the future.Others believe that the market will eventually become bigger, providing better liquidity, a feature that most institutional investors require. As the market improves, many also believe there will be a wider range of investment vehicles for institutions to choose from.The survey also found that there are still many bumps in the road to crypto institutionalization. More than half of the participants said that they are concerned about the lack of insurance for digital assets, while others are worried about the quality of custodial services, trading desks, reporting facilities and the procedures of other companies working in the sector.J. Gdanski, CEO and Founder of Evertas, told Cointelegraph:“Our research shows that institutional investors are enthusiastic about increasing their exposure to cryptocurrencies and crypto assets in general, but there are clearly many issues regarding the infrastructure that supports these markets that still concerns them. These clearly need to be addressed if the full potential of investment from institutional investors in crypto assets is to be realised.”While the outlook on regulating Bitcoin and other established crypto assets may be positive among institutional players, the same may not be true for other sectors of the cryptosphere.Such sectors include decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoins, which have seen massive growth in 2020 and may soon face their own regulatory hurdles.While the price of Bitcoin has failed to live up to the post-halving rally that many investors anticipated, institutions remain interested in Bitcoin. Recently, the trading volume for Bakkt’s Bitcoin futures reached a new record of more than $200 million worth of contracts exchanged, suggesting that institutions are still accumulating BTC.Furthermore, mainstream fund managers are beginning to enter the market, a sign which the majority of the Evertas survey participants believe is a major factor in the institutional adoption of crypto.Just last week MicroStrategy CEO, Michael Saylor, followed the footsteps of veteran investor, Paul Tudor Jones by purchasing 21,454 BTC. Earlier in the year Jones revealed his stake in Bitcoin, describing the assets as the “fastest horse” with the best odds performance wise.As investors’ interest in crypto-assets grows and the regulatory landscape for these assets becomes more clear, it's expected that the wave of institutions flocking to Bitcoin will continue to increase."
317,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) brutally rejected the $11,100–$11,300 resistance range with a 6% drop. Following the steep pullback, analysts remain cautiously optimistic toward BTC and the rest of the cryptocurrency market.Analysts have generally attributed the short-term fall of Bitcoin to the uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic. On Sept. 21, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by over 800 points at the day’s lowest point. Bitcoin, gold and other risk-on assets fell in tandem, causing a sell-off across most asset classes.The recent pullback was similar to the market crash in March wherein the majority of assets dropped altogether. Hence, analysts say that some progress in the development of vaccines or a new stimulus package could rejuvenate market sentiment.Speaking to Cointelegraph, John Todaro, head of research at TradeBlock — an institutional trading platform — said the near-term performance of BTC is conditional. Todaro believes investors are increasingly positioning for “more risk-off” assets due to a contentious election, lacking stimulus and rising COVID-19 cases. If the three factors continue to worsen, then Bitcoin will likely see a larger pullback.But the price of Bitcoin could also recover in the short term if there are improvements in any of the three factors. For instance, if a stimulus bill is approved, it would immediately cause stock market sentiment to rapidly improve and, in turn, cause a BTC rebound. Todaro noted:The current market dynamics of Bitcoin are significantly different from previous cycles because they are dependent on the traditional financial market. The overall sentiment of investors across various asset classes is moving simultaneously due to the pandemic’s economic effect. Strategists are unsure whether the recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases could cause additional restrictions and lockdowns in Europe and in the United States, but Wall Street is bracing for another potential downturn. Sam Stovall, chief market strategist of CFRA, told CNBC: “Things had to have changed for investors to be so nervous.”The short-term bull case for Bitcoin would be a swift retest of the $11,100 resistance level. Bitcoin has tested the resistance area only once since its correction on Sept. 2. The resistance level will weaken if BTC continues to wear it down with repeated retests. For that to happen, the overall investor sentiment across various markets, including gold and stocks, has to improve.Bitcoin has one potential catalyst that could ignite a rally despite the weakness of the traditional markets. In the past several days, decentralized finance tokens have plummeted in value. As Cointelegraph reported, even DeFi giant Yearn.finance’s YFI token and Uniswap’s UNI fell by 46% and 48%, respectively, within a week. The drop occurred as BTC rallied from $10,300 to $11,100, leading analysts to think the take-profit pullback of DeFi tokens is buoying the buying demand for BTC.The cycling of profits from DeFi tokens to Bitcoin does not necessarily mean the market is rebounding. But Todaro noted that investors might be moving their funds to more reliable and stable assets, like Bitcoin. If the trend continues, there is a chance BTC sees another take-profit rally while the DeFi market corrects. Todaro explained:Denis Vinokourov, head of research at crypto brokerage and exchange firm Bequant, told Cointelegraph that political factors and the pandemic fueled BTC’s recent drop. He pinpointed the passing of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as a key factor. He clarified that the level of uncertainty in the U.S. markets heading into the election was already high, but now investors are even more uneased:But Vinokourov emphasized that Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) could rebound strongly due to their “solid network fundamentals.” The correlation between the U.S. stock market and BTC could be short-lived, given that the markets slumped unexpectedly within a short period of time, with unprecedented intensity.The fundamentals of Bitcoin have strengthened in recent weeks, especially as the blockchain network’s hash rate reached an all-time high. The timing of the upsurge of the hash rate is noteworthy because it comes less than four months after the last block reward halving. Following a block reward halving, the hash rate tends to drop because the amount of BTC mined decreases. The continuous increase in the hash rate indicates miners expect a higher BTC price in the medium term.Not only has the hash rate recovered to pre-halving levels, it has exceeded the previous high to reach a new all-time high, and Vinokourov expects a rebound to occur shortly because of strong network fundamentals: “Looking at the playbook following the covid-19 related sell off in March, which also spilled over into digital assets, markets tend to decouple.”In the near term, traders anticipate BTC to range between the weekly low at $10,200 and the $10,600 resistance level. A pseudonymous trader known as “Salsa Tekila” said a “choppy” range in the near term is most likely. He stated:Some traders such as Cantering Clark believe that BTC is primed for a relief rally. Similar to the stock market, BTC saw an intense pullback in a short period, which typically results in a short-term recovery. The futures and options markets tend to neutralize after a big price movement, leading BTC to recover with low volatility. The trader noted:"
318,"In a broad sense, 2020 has been the year of the COVID-19 pandemic. As it toward 1 million deaths and over 30 million infections, governments have been found wanting. Our institutions have crumbled, leaders reacted too slowly, and all of the systems both in place and newly created to protect us — healthcare, aged care, testing, protective equipment supply chains, contact tracing, etc. — have collapsed. But 2020 has also very much been the year of decentralized finance, which has come to be known as DeFi.To understand why DeFi has captured the imagination of the entire crypto landscape is to understand that it is less about the outrageous returns offered to yield farmers and more about the future possibilities it presents.Cryptocurrency, and the technology behind it, has always been about future possibilities.When Bitcoin () was born to little fanfare in 2009, it was quickly recognized by those familiar with it as having the potential to be the future of money. 11 years on, Bitcoin, with its decentralized global system of and miners keeping the network operational and secure, has met its promise and more.Not only is it a reliable and fast way for people to permissionlessly send money to each other, it has also become a genuine enterprise-grade investment vehicle, and its investment worthiness appears to be growing. it in anticipation of capital growth.“Bitcoin as an investment vehicle” aside, it remains, in essence, money — a new currency for a new, hyper-connected world.“Bitcoin as money” still works like money insofar as it still relies on a financial ecosystem around it to keep it alive. But that ecosystem is somewhat limited; it consists of those that secure the network on which transactions are transmitted (miners and node operators), wallets, and exchanges where it can be exchanged for other digital and, increasingly, fiat assets.But a financial services architecture as we know it incorporates a whole lot more in terms of functionality: lending, borrowing, earning interest, paying interest, investing, etc. Bitcoin was never intended to cater to all those mechanisms — but DeFi is.The next logical step in the evolution of crypto’s gradual assumption of the roles played by traditional finance is being taken by the growing Ethereum-based decentralized finance ecosystem.DeFi, in many ways, is Bitcoin 2.0. And for that reason, DeFi — although based on Ethereum’s composability and smart contract functionality — furthers the Bitcoin narrative into the future that Bitcoin first allowed us to believe in. With each new DeFi protocol, that future is closing in on us: a world without banks as we have come to know them.DeFi demonstrates the complementary nature of Ethereum to Bitcoin. By recreating the financial system not from within but from the outside, Ethereum is hosting a movement that completes the circle Bitcoin started.Our banking system is as as our COVID-19 response was, but can DeFi actually replace it? The DeFi subsector’s most vocal critics would point to the emergence of SushiSwap, Cream and Yam, along with many others, to suggest the movement resembles more of a circus than a legitimate threat to a giant financial services sector.Those protocols are considered vampire forks, which are forks of existing protocols, designed to suck liquidity from them. If vampire forks are destructive — and there is no certainty they are — a seminal Rolling Stone article helps put them into perspective. When running through the central role Goldman Sachs played in virtually every financial collapse of the last century, Matt Taibbi called the behemoth:DeFi’s vampires probably serve to further the ecosystem by stress-testing it. Legacy finance’s vampires have had only one function: to take money from everyone else to strengthen themselves.From the Great Depression, to the dot-com bubble and burst, to the housing crisis, the “great vampire squid” had self-serving financial destruction in mind and its tentacles on virtually every lever that produced those catastrophic episodes in our recent economic histories.The sector as a whole has long since stopped serving most of our needs.

319,"The world now has so much debt that, for the first time ever, it is impossible to add more, says Max Keiser.On the latest edition of his Keiser Report TV show on Sep. 22, the RT host warned that central banks were responsible for global debt reaching a new “inflection point.”Together with co-host Stacy Herbert, Keiser referred to comments from Singapore’s central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which last week warned that copying economic recovery methods after World War Two would not work in 2020.Central banks worldwide have intervened in markets, buying equities and other assets in a highly controversial move designed to limit the economic impact of Covid-19 and its lockdowns.“First, it’s quite obvious that you can’t keep increasing your debts,” MAS chairman Tharman Shanmugaratnam said.“But I don’t believe that the new higher levels of debt that many countries are now moving towards are going to be sustainable without imposing significant costs on growth as well as equity within their societies.”The United States’ national debt alone has ballooned to $26.7 trillion this year, up $4 trillion since June 2019.“There is no capacity for the Earth’s economy to carry any more debt; we’re at the saturation point,” Keiser summarized.Regarding the consequences for increasingly indebted countries, he said that ordinary consumers would simply foot the bill from now on:“Now, every dollar that these central banks print will go directly into consumer price index inflation — and you’ll see it at the cash register immediately, and that’s going to incredible social unrest[.]”In the 1940s, states which had built up debts from combat were able to inflate them away. This time, Herbert said, there were so many insignificant gig economy jobs that wages would not follow price rises, leading to the kind of gap between the elite and the rest of society that Keiser has termed “neo-feudalism.”Federal Reserve balance sheet 10-year chart. Source: Federal ReserveKeiser has long championed Bitcoin (BTC) as an escape route from the knock-on effects of fiat inflation.With its fixed, unalterable emission and decentralized network, Bitcoin represents the antithesis of centrally-controlled money. BTC/USD has shown to rise in step with central banks’ inflating balance sheets, but remains susceptible to U.S. dollar performance, Cointelegraph reported.“Bitcoin, like Gold, is inversely correlated to the USD — *not* the stock market,” Keiser pointed out on Sep 22. “Don’t be fooled by randomness.”Beyond its technical prowess, Bitcoin also promotes so-called low-time-preference living — saving money, safe in the knowledge that its value will not be inflated away over time.As Saifedean Ammous explains in his popular book, “The Bitcoin Standard,” this ultimately allows for better and quicker advancement of society in time than simply spending money as quickly as possible on as much as possible.Keiser and Herbert noted that MicroStrategy’s decision to put over $400 million of cash reserves into Bitcoin was proof of the low-time-preference mindset encroaching on big business."
320,"Wealthsimple Crypto, the first regulated cryptocurrency exchange in Canada, is rolling out its trading platform to the public today.Starting from Sept. 22, users in all 13 provinces and territories in Canada will be able to sign up for the new product and start trading cryptocurrencies.At the launch, Wealthsimple Crypto will allow users to buy and sell Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) through the platform’s mobile app. Deposits and withdrawals can only be made in Canadian dollars,The public launch of Wealthsimple Crypto comes shortly after the company received regulatory approval from Canadian securities regulators on Aug. 7. To date, Wealthsimple Crypto is the only crypto asset platform that has been authorized to operate in Canada by the Canadian Securities Administration (CSA), a representative told Cointelegraph.Prior to public launch, Wealthsimple Crypto was available in beta, allowing Canadians to join a waitlist to be invited to use the platform. According to Wealthsimple’s representatives, more than 130,000 Canadians joined the waitlist so far.Wealthsimple will not hold any cryptocurrency assets in its own hot or cold wallets. Blair Wiley, Wealthsimple's general counsel, says that the crypto custody service on Wealthsimple is provided by Gemini, a major United States-based digital asset platform founded by Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss.According to Wiley, collaboration with Gemini is one of the factors that contributed to Wealthsimple Crypto becoming regulated in Canada. The exec previously said that trying to offer too many services can be an impediment to becoming a fully regulated exchange, stating:Based in Toronto, Wealthsimple is a Canadian online investment management service focused on millennials. The company announced its plans to offer crypto trading in July 2020."
321,"Bitcoin (BTC) hitting its highest in over a year was different from the 2019 bull run because exchange balances fell, a new report says.Published on Sep. 21 and seen by Cointelegraph, Delphi Digital’s Bitcoin Outlook highlights unique trends in BTC price action.According to the three researchers who compiled the report, Bitcoin reaching $12,500 last month had little in common with its run to $13,800 in 2019.This is because exchange balances at the time increased, while this year, they continued falling despite price rises. As such, overall selling pressure among traders and investors is less this time around.“Unlike the 2019 price uptrend, which coincided with BTC stock increasing, this current trend has seen a divergence between BTC stock and price,” the researchers argue. “This suggests a more sustainable move upwards for BTC, in comparison to that of 2019 as data indicates a holder base with longer time horizons.”The findings chime with other recent research into hodler behavior, with on-chain analyst CryptoQuant reaching similar conclusions regarding exchange balances.Bitcoin held on exchanges has declined from all-time highs of 2.96 million BTC in February to press-time levels of 2.59 million BTC. BTC/USD is trading in a similar range to that date — $10,430 versus $9,580 on Feb. 20.Bitcoin exchange balances 6-month chart. Source: GlassnodeContinuing, Delphi notes that other factors could serve to change hodlers’ habits. For example, they could be using stablecoins as collateral for trades or simply leaving BTC on exchanges instead of making the effort to store them in private wallets.“When price increases and BTC stock decreases, this indicates a BTC accumulation trend,” the researchers nonetheless state.As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin volatility did produce brief periods of unrest for miners despite network fundamentals now sitting at all-time highs.Inflows of BTC from mining pools to exchanges have seen several spikes in recent months, but as time goes on, Delphi notes, their impact is becoming less of an issue.“On September 13th, we saw the largest daily yearly inflow coming in at 1114 BTC. Notably, this did not trigger negative price action,” the report adds. “The recent large inflows (marked by the green bubbles) were met with sufficient bids, indicating a healthy demand side.”On Twitter, Paul Burlage, one of the researchers, drew specific attention to the growth in Bitcoin whales now moving in tandem with price growth.Bitcoin whale vs. price growth trends.

323,"After outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) strongly in August, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) tokens are now plummeting as many registered losses of up to 50%. Cryptocurrency daily market performance snapshot. Source: Coin360At the moment, the two coins garnering the most attention are Yearn.finance (YFI) and Uniswap (UNI) as both have dropped by 46% and 48% since reaching a monthly peak.YFI/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView.comThree catalysts appear to be behind the correction: Ether’s pullback, profit taking from BTC’s previous rally and a strong sell off amongst DeFi-tokens.The overwhelming majority of DeFi tokens have dropped by 15% to 25% on the day. Even cryptocurrencies that are not directly considered to be DeFi tokens, like Chainlink (LINK), saw a 15% price drop.While the pullback of DeFi tokens coincides with the decline in Ether price, a take-profit correction was expected by many analysts.As an example, Yearn.finance has evolved into a dominant player in the DeFi market in less than three months. In the process, the price of YFI rose by 1,200% on Binance to a peak at $43,966.Uniswap’s native governance token UNI saw a similarly explosive upsurge in a significantly shorter period.As Cointelegraph reported, Uniswap airdropped 400 UNI tokens to every user that used the Uniswap decentralized exchange before Sept. 1. At its peak at around $8.80, the 400 UNI tokens were worth $3,520.UNI saw a massive price spike in a short period because of multiple major exchange listings. Within the first five hours of launching, Coinbase Pro, Binance, and FTX listed UNI. As a result, the price of the token surged from $0.30 to $8.80 in less than five days.UNI/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView.comDue to the massive gains of DeFi tokens in their USDT and BTC pairs, a profit taking correction was widely anticipated but the intensity of this correction has many traders surprised.Historically, Ether has led the rallies among altcoins, including DeFi tokens. In some bull cycles, Ether also front ran BTC price. For example, from March to August, as Bitcoin price recovered from the infamous Black Thursday crash, Ether price strongly outperformed BTC.However, Since Sept. 1, Ether has struggled to match the performance of Bitcoin. While BTC rallied from $10,300 to $11,100, Ether remained pinned below $400.In the past 20 days, Ether price declined by around 28% and in the same period, BTC recorded a 12% drop against the U.S. dollar.Ether’s short term weakness was likely caused by the increased selling pressure on DeFi tokens, hence the nearly 50% correction from the likes of UNI and YFI over the past few days.The sentiment around BTC’s rally from Sept. 9 to Sept. 19 remains mixed. Interestingly, BTC alone saw a strong upsurge, while Ether, altcoins and the majority of DeFi tokens remained stagnant. This is somewhat atypical as usually when Bitcoin is range bound, altcoins rally, and when Bitcoin rallies moderately altcoins may lag but still tend to follow BTC’s bullish price action. This short term inverse correlation between BTC and altcoins suggests that BTC saw a take-profit rally as investors cycled profits from DeFi tokens to BTC."

These suspicious transactions have been flagged as possible money laundering or criminal activity by the banks internal compliance officers.

This has led to panic selling by traders who are dumping equities, gold, crude oil and cryptocurrencies and instead are buying the U.S. dollar. However, after the initial round of selling, most asset classes are likely to chalk their own course depending on their long-term fundamentals and cryptocurrencies may be among the first to rebound.Let’s study the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to spot the critical support levels that could attract buyers.Bitcoin turned down from the 50-day simple moving average ($11,225) on Sep. 19 and broke below the 20-day exponential moving average ($10,781) and the $10,625 support today. This fall suggests that the bears used the recent relief rally to $11,000 to initiate short positions.  BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe bears will now try to sink the price below the $9,835 support and if they succeed, it could result in panic selling that may drag the price down to $9,000 or even further.If this sharp fall was followed by a strong rebound, it would suggest that the bulls are accumulating at lower levels and such a move might attract several buyers once again.However, if the BTC/USD pair fails to rebound quickly from the lower levels, then the recovery is likely to take much longer as the bulls will then wait for a bottoming formation to complete before buying.Contrary to these assumptions, if the pair rebounds off the $10,000–$9,835, support, the bulls will once again attempt to push the price above the downtrend line. If they succeed, then the uptrend is likely to resume.The pullback in Ether (ETH) stalled close to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $398.263 and turned down on Sep. 20.

A break below this support could result in a decline to the next support at $18.This bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls can push the price back above $25.82. Such a move will suggest that the current decline was a bear trap.Chainlink (LINK) is in a downtrend as it continues to make lower highs and lower lows.

325,"Before the recent halving, many were prophesying a so-called “death spiral” for Bitcoin. This theory hinges on the idea that the halving of the block reward leads to an exodus of miners due to the sudden unprofitability of mining activities. As a result, the network hashrate decreases and the block time increases, meaning that miner revenue further diminishes, pushing more miners off the network. This loop would then allegedly continue until there is no one left to mine Bitcoin (BTC).Bitcoin mining difficulty. Source: Glassnode.On September 20, Bitcoin experienced one of the biggest upward mining difficulty adjustments in its history. In fact, it is the second major upward adjustment since the halving. So, were the doomsday prophets right all along?Bitcoin hashrate and block time (14-day average). Source: Glassnode.In order to answer this question, we have to understand what triggers difficulty adjustments. All Bitcoin miners compete to solve the next block. The more hashpower the network enjoys, the faster that can happen. In order to make sure that the generation rate remains at an interval of 10 minutes per block, Satoshi Nakamoto embedded a feature into the protocol that adjusts the difficulty approximately every two weeks. If during this period, the time between blocks falls below that mark, the difficulty adjusts upwards. If the time between blocks rises above that number, the opposite occurs.These two recent adjustments came as a result of an immense increase in hashpower. Thus, instead of supporting the death spiral scenario, it would appear to indicate the excellent health of the Bitcoin network."

""Bitcoin is better at being gold than gold — and not just incrementally, but by an order of magnitude or 10X better,"" Winklevoss said in a Sept. 21 tweet.  Over the last decade or so, Bitcoin has risen dramatically in price, surpassing numerous landmark price comparisons along the way. For many, it is now seen more as a store of value than a transactional currency, and the public often compares the digital coin against gold; a time-tested method of value storage used for thousands of years.""I don't understand why there's a competition between gold and Bitcoin,"" NebraskanGooner, a pseudonymous crypto trader on Twitter, told Cointelegraph. ""I consider them both a store of value,"" he added. NebraskanGooner is also the founder of LVL, a banking solution in the crypto space.  In his social media post, Winklevoss included a chart pitting the two assets against each other. Out of seven categories, gold ruled one — the total amount money held in the asset. Gold has a market cap of $9 trillion, while BTC has a market cap of $200 billion. Otherwise, Bitcoin took the win for scarcity, durability, portability, divisibility, storage and counterfeit difficulty. Bitcoin has also recently gained further notoriety as a store of value in the mainstream public eye in 2020, as multiple mainstream giants have invested heavily into the asset."

It seems likely that continuation toward 95 points is on the horizon unless a rejection occurs in the 93.50-94 range. The downtrend may resume continue if DXY rejects and loses the 92.75 area.

The crucial resistance zone to test and break for a bullish continuation is the $10,700-$10,750 area, which is also unlikely to expect at this time. If this zone fails to break or the price loses the $10,200 area, investors’ attention will shift back to the untested level around $9,500-$9,700.

328,"I thought we were the good guys when I worked in operations security for the Austrian government. After I learned how trivial it was for certain institutions or people in certain positions to fetch all the data related to citizens, I quickly began to understand how privacy had been under siege for probably 100 years. In a post-COVID-19 world, I fear those attacks are getting worse.When I took the job as an OpSec specialist for the government, I would have never thought about what I think today: I became skeptical of the system. I question everything now. Initially, however, I did not have the guts to confront anyone about it.I grew up as the son of an Austrian diplomat, and for a time, we lived in Northern Africa. Later in life, I returned to Africa and traveled around while on a vacation from government work. That’s when I went through a period of personal transformation.I realized my true passion was working on technologies that could make our world a freer, fairer and more peaceful place. If I had continued on the path I was on, I feared I would have had a mental breakdown. I no longer wanted to be a part of the system. I wanted to do things that I could be proud of. I yearned to try and change the world.I quit and joined the nascent cryptocurrency industry — not to make money but to help to make the world a better place. Blockchains drove freedom, freedom of speech, equality and peace. When I quit my comfortable government job, everyone I knew laughed at me. They asked: What is Bitcoin? and Why aren’t you doing something real?The answer is simple: I believe in privacy and freedom of speech. I believe humans should be free. I don’t believe humans should be forced to do anything. Each individual should be free to do as they please, as long as it doesn’t harm anyone else. When I am on my deathbed, I don’t want to regret the work I’ve done. I don’t want to leave my kids in a world worse off than I found it — like in the Oceania of George Orwell’s 1984. We seem to be on that same path.Governments have abused the coronavirus pandemic to become more centralized. As I read reports about contract-tracing software and contact tracers, I see how this pandemic has been used to implement stricter controls on the people. The Great Lockdown — as the International Monetary Fund dubbed the response to the COVID-19 pandemic — has convinced me that we are not free. We were banned from traveling in recent months, and many of us are still not allowed to meet with those outside of our households. We are not allowed to visit our parents, grandparents and our siblings, yet multinational corporations are open, and many have never closed their doors.Related: How to keep data private with Google and Apple’s contact tracing appThe lockdown’s requirement of social distancing — which I would call “anti-social distancing” — will have a big mental health impact worldwide. Reports demonstrate an increase in anxiety, depression and suicides. Younger people will be especially affected because they’re the ones seeking to grow their social network. We’ll see the effect on these people in five to 10 years. And if the pandemic gets worse — say, it comes back this fall or winter — then we could go back into another lockdown, resulting in longer-term implications for our rights, economy and society.Related: Why privacy is the main issue in the time of the COVID-19 pandemicThere are times when you just know the odds are against you. For those of us who are proponents of freedom and decentralization, this is one of those times. We live in a centralized society. Our personal freedoms and rights have all too often been an illusion. There is a high chance that the decentralized world crypto seeks to create will fail. We have to accept this. But, we also have to accept the challenge. We have to deliver more than is expected of decentralized systems in order to prove them viable. There will be nothing more satisfying than delivering on our promises to bring more freedom to the world.Bitcoin (BTC) is a secure, borderless and non-inflationary currency. It has inspired decentralized innovation and the foundation of a more equitable world. In this world, operating systems and devices — including personal computers, smartphones, the Internet of Things, etc. — are run on a decentralized client and not controlled by a central authority.Blockchain networks, peer-to-peer networks and decentralized technologies form the base layer in this free society. Anyone, anywhere could communicate, earn money, and build a reputation over this collage of social and financial networks while enjoying freedom of speech.Crypto has come a long way since my friends and family laughed at me for leaving that comfortable government job all those years ago. I’m still looking forward to passing on to my children that brighter future I’ve always dreamed of.

If BTC ends Q4 with a net gain, it would be three consecutive winning quarters for the first time in three years.But historical data is not in Bitcoin’s favor as the last two Q4s closed with 42.54% and 13.6% drops, in 2018 and 2019, respectively.The historical quarterly returns of Bitcoin. Source: Skew.comFrom late 2016 and up to 2018, Bitcoin saw five positive consecutive quarters to record an all-time high by the end of 2017. Analysts attributed that historic rally to two major factors. First, BTC saw a massive mainstream frenzy across major markets including the U.S. and South Korea. Second, BTC came off a block reward halving in July 2016, a generally bullish milestone event for the network.A block reward halving has a positive impact on the price of BTC because it has a direct effect on its newly issued supply. A halving decreases the rate at which new BTC is created by half, causing the circulating supply to drop over time.As such, BTC tends to see big rallies after halvings. The problem is that in 2016, the post-halving rally came 15 months after the halving occurred, and some analysts have indeed drawn similarities with how the beginnings of that bull run to the current period.The latest halving, which occurs every four years, happened in May 2020. If a similar cycle as 2016 plays out, BTC would likely see an explosive rally by the last quarter of 2021.However, since 2018, Bitcoin has underperformed during the fourth quarter. The subpar performance could be cyclical for various reasons. Investors in the U.S. could sell BTC for clarity on year-end taxation and holders in Asia might sell ahead of the new year.But two factors could potentially boost the bullish case for BTC by the year’s end: gold’s rally and the dollar’s weakness. Strategists at the Swiss investment banking giant UBS expects gold to continuously rally throughout 2021. The prediction coincides with the fundamental weakness of the dollar against other reserve currencies.In the near term, traders are becoming more cautious about the price trend of BTC, particularly as the U.S. dollar is starting to find some footing in the run up to the U.S. election. Meanwhile, technical analysts are closely observing two important technical levels at $10,500 and $10,000 for the price of Bitcoin. As Cointelegraph reported, losing the $10,000 support area could lead to a major pullback. The movement of whales indicates that the $9,800 support region has weakened, which might cause a bigger correction.The daily price chart of Bitcoin with key technical levels.

331,"Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week still looking for $11,000 support as macro markets wobble over coronavirus and banks’ criminal activities.Cointelegraph highlights five factors that could shape BTC price action in the coming days.While central banks grappled with dramatic shifts in United States economy policy, fresh leaked files showed yet more evidence of largescale money laundering.A huge trove of documents from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), dubbed the FinCEN Files, found its way to investigative journalists throughout the world this month, and the focus was clear: illegal activities gone unnoticed.One example involves HSBC, which continued allowing funds to move through its accounts despite being notified of their criminal origins. The bank’s shares were down to 25-year lows on Monday.Other revelations include much activity linked to the Russian elite using United Kingdom banks to avoid Western sanctions.Bitcoin proponents were quick to call out the irony of the situation, given the history of many banks in the files claiming that Bitcoin itself facilitated crime.A pair of advertisements in Hong Kong for Bitcoin and HSBC ironically summarized the status quo, with statistician Willy Woo tweeting:“‘Be your own Bank. The story continues’. HSBC on point!”Central banks around the world continue to deal with coronavirus fallout, meanwhile, and the European Central Bank (ECB) will meet to discuss its response — and possible implications for the euro — this week.As Cointelegraph reported, the Bank of England (BoE) is currently entertaining the possibility of introducing negative interest rates for the first time in its history.Trading in Asia opened on a weaker note Monday, with the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index down 1.5% — driven by HSBC shares hitting their lowest since 1995.A similar picture came from Europe, with the Stoxx Europe 600 down 1.6%. In the United States prior to the opening bell, S&P 500 futures were down 1%.The U.S. faces a mixed bag of woes as politicians struggle to agree on a fresh coronavirus stimulus package and elections draw nearer.This week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will testify before Congress, after last week’s speech about the central bank’s extraordinary economic policy progress left many skeptical about its capabilities.“We do have concerns down the stretch about the markets reacting poorly to some of the uncertainties facing us — the election, potentially around Covid-19, and the fact that we don’t have a stimulus package yet,” Rebecca Felton, senior market strategist at global asset manager Riverfront Investment Group, told Bloomberg.“I would have to think we could be volatile to the downside here.”Any combination weighing on the strength of the U.S. dollar is currently a boon for Bitcoin, continuing its inverse correlation with the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY).On the day, safe-haven gold was up 0.1% against the dollar at $1,953.U.S. dollar currency index 6-month chart.

The difficulty, arguably Bitcoin’s most important fundamental feature, increased 11.35% at the latest automatic readjustment on Sunday.According to estimates from BTC.com, the next readjustment in 12 days’ time is already set to add another 10.2%.The fresh upside underscores fierce competition among Bitcoin miners to gain block rewards — rewards which remain unalterably constant at 6.25 BTC per block regardless of how many are competing. Hash rate, meanwhile, an estimate of the total computing power dedicated to the Bitcoin network, hit a fresh record of 143 exahashes per second (EH/s) on Saturday.Bitcoin 7-day average hash rate 6-month chart. Source: BlockchainA popular theory suggests that price bullishness follows fundamentals, and miners’ belief in Bitcoin’s long-term profitability is now clear to see.BTC/USD stayed rangebound over the weekend, failing to flip $11,000 into any form of a support level. The ranging behavior continued a pattern from last week, during which Bitcoin nonetheless managed to exit higher from fundamental support at $10,000. For Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe, keeping $11,000 and the higher $11,200 as resistance means that Bitcoin will stay in the $10,000 zone for the time being.“Given that we’ve got this rangebound construction, we have to check the lower timeframes, in which the most likely scenario is a case of testing the upper resistance zone of $11,200 to $11,400, and given the significance of this resistance zone, it’s unlikely that we’re going to break through it in one go,” he summarized in a Twitter update Saturday.BTC/USD subsequently fulfilled the prophecy, seeing rejection at just below $11,200 on Sunday.In terms of further downside potential, should lower support give way, the open CME futures gap at $9,600 remains in play. Analysts stayed divided over whether the recent dip to $9,800 could be classed as sufficient to “close” the gap — Bitcoin may attempt to hit it definitively or leave the recent lows as a bottom. According to the popular Crypto Fear & Greed Index metric, investor sentiment is broadly recovering from the trip below $10,000.On Monday, the Index, which takes a basket of indicators to measure investor sentiment, was in the “neutral” range of 48/100.Previously, as Bitcoin circled $12,000, it measured almost its highest score ever — a warning, creators say, that the market is due for a correction. Once that happened, a sense of overselling entered, slowly balancing out through the past week to leave the Index at its current reading.Crypto Fear & Greed Index 1-month chart.

332,"Historical data shows that some miners began to sell Bitcoin (BTC) at the end of July, leading to increased selling pressure in the cryptocurrency market.Eventually, the dominant cryptocurrency fell steeply from mid-August, recording a 13% fall and since then BTC has struggled to retake the $12K mark.Bitcoin selling by miners from 2017-2020. Source: CryptoQuantAccording to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, continued selling by miners might not be enough to prevent a bull run. On-chain data analysis firms closely observe the movements of miners and whales because they hold significant amounts of BTC.Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst, explained that miners represent one of the two external sources of selling pressure for Bitcoin. He previously said:“There’s only two unmatched sell pressures on the market. (1) Miners who dilute the supply and sell onto the market, this is the hidden tax via monetary inflation. And (2) the exchanges who tax the traders and sell onto the market.”When miners start selling their Bitcoin holdings, typically to cover expenses, it could trigger a correction in the cryptocurrency market.For instance, From Aug. 17 to Sept. 5, the price of Bitcoin dropped from $12,486 to $9,813. During that time, several whales sold Bitcoin right at $12,000 and the same behaviour was observed amongst miners.The selling pressure coming from miners and whales noticeably has been attributed to the current crypto market slump but in the longer term, Ki explained it is not enough to stop a prolonged bull run.If miners abruptly sell a significant amount of BTC, it could cause a severe correction as a small price movement could trigger liquidations from heavily-leveraged traders. Hence, even a relatively small sell-off by miners could theoretically cause massive price swings.Ki says the intensity of the sell-off from miners was not strong enough to halt future bull runs. He said:“Miner Update: Some miners began selling at the end of July, but I think in the long-run, miners didn't sell BTC large enough to stop the next bull-run.”According to ByteTree, the net inventory of Bitcoin miners declined by 125 BTC per week in the last 12 weeks. The data indicates that miners sold approximately $1.362 million BTC per week week atop the BTC that they mined and sold.Amount of BTC mined and sold in the last 12 weeks. Source: ByteTreeAs Ki emphasized, the data shows that miners sold substantial amounts of BTC, but not in amounts that were irregular to normal behaviour.Bitcoin is still hovering above the critical $10,000 technical support level despite multiple attempts by bears to drop the price below the key level.The resilience of Bitcoin amidst a heightened level of selling pressure suggests a cautiously bullish trend in the long term.The Bitcoin short-term holder NUPL.

Rafael Schultze-Kraft, the CTO at Glassnode, said:“Short-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (STH-NUPL) with a #bullish signal here imo.

333,"MicroStrategy’s decision to use Bitcoin as its primary reserve currency has Michael Saylor seemingly favoring the asset over altcoins.In a Sept. 20 tweet, the business intelligence company’s CEO stated that he considers Bitcoin (BTC) to be a crypto asset network, unlike tokens like Ethereum (ETH) or stablecoins, which he referred to as “crypto-application networks.”Posting a chart from analytics site Bitcoin Dominance, the CEO claimed that the coin’s dominance “has advanced from a low of 71.05% on December 20, 2017 to 93.57% today.”When considering network dominance in the crypto industry, I find it clarifying to separate crypto-asset networks like #Bitcoin from crypto-application networks like Ethereum & stablecoins. Bitcoin dominance has advanced from a low of 71.05% on December 20, 2017 to 93.57% today. pic.twitter.com/03cbWVyoLYHowever, Saylor is intentionally selective when it comes to this data. Bitcoin Dominance’s figures do not include initial coin offerings or stablecoins, but rather “only includes coins using proof-of-work that are attempting to be money.”According to CoinMarketCap, which takes stablecoins like Tether (USDT) into account, Bitcoin’s dominance was at a yearly low of 56.67% as of Sept. 13, while Messari shows the metric closer to 59%. Both are far from the 93% dominance Saylor tweeted. Ethereum and DeFi have been driving alt season this year, as the 10 largest DeFi tokens now represent a market cap of roughly $9 billion compared to Bitcoin’s $200 billion.Though initially claiming “Bitcoin’s days are numbered” in 2013, Saylor has turned bullish on the crypto asset in recent weeks following MicroStrategy’s purchase of $250 million worth of BTC as a reserve currency in August. He announced on Sept. 14 that the firm subsequently bought an additional $175 million of BTC.“Bitcoin scales just fine as a store of value.”Saylor isn’t alone in the crypto community in discounting the vast majority of altcoins. Emin Gün Sirer, the creator of the first proof-of-work-based crypto, said in April that Bitcoin maximalists are correct to label “95% of the things out there as scams.”“They’ve just recycled something that belongs to someone else,” he said."
334,"The total crypto market capitalization has recovered from the Sep. 6 lows near $314 billion but it is struggling to sustain above the $350 billion mark, which shows that higher levels continue to attract sellers.Bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance fell from above 68% in mid-May to about 56% in the first half of this month as DeFi tokens embarked on a strong bull run. However, in the past few days, the DeFi assets have witnessed sharp corrections and their volatility has increased. This could possibly shift traders’ attention back to Bitcoin. It’s also possible that Bitcoin’s inability to hold above the $11,000 level could also be negatively weighing on the confidence of altcoin and DeFi-token traders.Crypto market data daily view.

335,"I started exploring Bitcoin first in 2012 and, still today, I am fascinated by the opportunities and future potential digital assets pose as an emerging alternative asset class.One of the most relevant recent developments, which is often not covered, is the emergence of crypto hedge funds. Compared to the early days of crypto assets, when there were mainly private investors or traders in the space, a massive inflow of professionals entering the market has begun with the emergence of crypto hedge funds.In fact, looking at data from 150 of the largest global crypto hedge funds, 63% were launched in 2018 and 2019, according to a survey by Big Four audit firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and Elwood Asset Management Services earlier this year.Related: Today’s cryptocurrency trusts and hedge funds amid financial crisisBased on the annual PwC–Elwood Crypto Hedge Fund Report, the most common crypto hedge fund strategy is quantitative (48% of funds), followed by discretionary long-only (19%), discretionary long/short (17%), and multi-strategy (17%).When it comes to crypto fund performance, systematic crypto funds have been outperforming passive strategies (investing long-only), discretionary long/short, and multi-strategies quite significantly. In 2019, the average crypto hedge fund performance by strategy was as following:In 2018 — which was a very challenging year for digital assets — quant trading was the only strategy that generated positive returns:These numbers suggest that systematic hedge funds are the best performing strategy for digital assets, but, in general, all crypto hedge fund strategies are able to generate sustainable alpha.The vast majority of investors in crypto hedge funds are either family offices or high-net-worth individuals. A growing number of funds of funds have been investing in crypto hedge funds, causing the whole ecosystem to evolve quite quickly.The fact that the percentage of crypto hedge funds with assets under management of over $20 million nearly doubled to $44 million last year indicates that more funds are reaching a critical size, which enables them to sustain their strategy.More and more talent from the traditional hedge fund world is moving into digital assets, including established hedge fund titans like Paul Tudor Jones.Wall Street is also becoming more open to Bitcoin (BTC) as a new asset class, and well-known Wall Street names including George Ball, the former CEO of Prudential Securities, suggested Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies could be “a safe haven” for investors and traders as an alternative investment.The news of MicroStrategy buying $250 million in Bitcoin (60% of their treasury) in August 2020 and stating: “Bitcoin is digital gold — harder, stronger, faster, and smarter than any money that has preceded it” have been a big boost for established investors looking into the crypto markets.Back in May 2020, I explained why Bitcoin is an ideal inflationary hedge, and institutional investors are increasingly looking at this emerging asset class from a hedging perspective. It is obvious that investments in crypto hedge funds will be a big part of these additional inflows of capital.Given the transparency among most regulated crypto hedge funds with external investors regarding the fund’s performance and assets under management, the growth in investments is becoming apparent.Total assets under management of crypto funds worldwide doubled from 2018 to the end of 2019 (from $1 billion to $2 billion); and there are clear indications that this number will have roughly tripled by the end of 2020. Compared to other alternative asset classes, these are still rather small sums, but the growth rate indicates the direction the industry is moving in.Increases in assets allocated to crypto hedge funds and further indications that Bitcoin is a digital store of value and a new hedge against inflation show why and how demand from investors has been accelerating.Looking at the talent moving into the space and the increasing demand from institutional investors makes me quite confident about the near future.It will be crucial for the industry to generate sustainable alpha in the future and prove that active investment strategies among crypto hedge funds are superior to a passive long-only approach, such as “holding.” This performance was demonstrated to date by the outperforming of successful crypto fund managers.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

337,"We aren’t taught real economics in school. We learn, instead, voodoo economics. For example, rarely — if ever — do professors present us with the valuable insights highlighted by the Austrian school of economics. Individuals, therefore, need to break their conditioning to understand how the financial world works. The truth of how the financial system was built, how it works, who controls it, and so on is a whole new world to them.If you really dig into the truth and start to see how it all works, you might make certain connections, such as why Jesus expelled the money changers from the Temple, how Britain became a great Empire, and why the U.S. dollar has been losing its purchasing power. So many people use money on a daily basis but don’t question the system behind it.I ponder two theories about the future of the financial world. One theory is that smart tech nerds have created blockchain technology, decentralized finance and all these technologies that are taking over the world. The other theory is that big financial institutions or governments have experimented with similar technologies and are today perhaps 10 years ahead of the publicly available DeFi movement. Either way, the elites behind The Great Reset at the World Economic Forum, who seek to remake the global economy, obviously have a plan and a new financial system ready to go.While the elites work to reset the global economy for their benefit, crypto startups are developing services that compete with the most powerful Wall Street firms and central banks. Entrepreneurs and developers have begun building what they call decentralized finance, which represents an entirely new system where users can lend money in a decentralized manner, among other options. A few years ago, your only choice was doing so through a bank.Although only central banks could print money not so long ago, DeFi is creating technologies where people are able to code their own transactional currencies in the form of tokens or cryptocurrencies. The internet decentralized the process of creating and distributing content; for example, anyone could then have a YouTube channel. DeFi does the same for finance.We once used gold as a universal currency because it was scarce. Bitcoin (BTC) copied this scarcity model. The Medici were behind the first banks that encouraged people to store gold with them in exchange for a piece of paper representing a claim to your gold. They realized no one would ever claim all the gold at once and started making loans against their assets — similar to some of the DeFi technology of today. In a sense, by looking back at the history of banking, you can predict the future of DeFi.The most promising DeFi apps today include protocols for decentralized interest rates, liquidity pools, stablecoins, etc. For instance, let’s say you have $10,000 in your bank, and the bank gives you 0% interest or negative interest on that money. DeFi platforms offer solutions where you can earn 3%–4% on that same $10,000.The big banks are threatened by DeFi. They were anti-Bitcoin while behind the scenes experimenting with the blockchain technology underpinning it. They suspected Bitcoin could shift the balance in the financial world. Now, they are launching their own stablecoins and distributed ledger infrastructures.If you look at JPMorgan Chase, it has recently launched its own distributed ledger with the Singapore government. As is generally the case, innovators at the grassroots level were two to three years ahead of these giants. For that reason, I don’t see big banks making any groundbreaking moves into DeFi just yet. The big banks will first focus on proven distributed ledger solutions, such as cross border payment solutions, replacing internet cloud systems with distributed ledger cloud systems, and so on.Many factors today affect the future of DeFi. One, for example, is Ethereum 2.0 and its attempt at solving Ethereum’s scalability. Its success or failure will affect everything related to the Ethereum blockchain.Another factor is how banks and regulators react to the phenomenon of DeFi. For now, it must regulate itself as an industry. We must behave ethically and develop solutions, such as insurance, which give people safeguards. Unless we develop and meet such criteria, DeFi will not be able to compete with the traditional banking system.Crypto entrepreneurs should educate the public about DeFi to help them understand why this new technology could benefit people’s everyday lives. Furthermore, the mass adoption of DeFi alone is unlikely. Some people simply don’t want to deal with a technology that is completely decentralized.The DeFi industry would benefit by incorporating certain aspects of the old financial world into their business model. That’s where the combination of DeFi and centralized finance, or CeFi, comes into play.Centralized and decentralized apps can be combined to create new types of economies and to encourage more people to use DeFi. At the end of the day, you shouldn’t just trust smart contracts with all of your savings. The industry is not that advanced yet.New digital economies can spring from anywhere in the world and take many forms, creating opportunities for everybody. DeFi does not exist in a vacuum. For instance, it depends on the evolution and decentralization of technology in general, including internet and security practices.In addition, the old-fashioned financial system is stiff competition. As an industry, we must be honest with where we can improve, and better understanding the public is one of those areas. By combining DeFi and CeFi, we can make the transition from a centralized world to a decentralized world more smoothly and, ultimately, win the age-old battle between DeFi and CeFi.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
338,"The number of Bitcoin (BTC) addresses holding 1 BTC plummeted to a four-month low on Sep. 20, according to the data from Glassnode. But it is premature to suggest that it is a bearish sign for the top cryptocurrency.The noticeable decline in small Bitcoin addresses coincides with the explosive expansion of the decentralized finance (DeFi) market.Since Aug. 1, the total value locked in DeFi protocols on Ethereum rose from $4.091 billion to $9.77 billion. The massive increase of capital in DeFi caused the demand for tokens like Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) to surge.The total value locked in DeFi. Source: Defipulse.comUsers primarily utilize DeFi protocols to earn yield with their cryptocurrency holdings. Since it is not possible to transfer Bitcoin to Ethereum, users convert BTC to wBTC, and then use wBTC on DeFi platforms.Using wBTC to gain exposure to DeFi platforms and yield allows Bitcoin holders to achieve two things. First, BTC users can still utilize DeFi protocols without selling BTC. Second, Bitcoin investors do not lose the potential upside from BTC’s price movements.The number of small Bitcoin addresses holding 1 BTC likely dropped as the demand for wBTC increased. Users might have converted their BTC to wBTC, as the popularity of DeFi rose.In July, Jack Purdy, a researcher at Messari said the dominance of wBTC would likely continue over the short to medium term. He said:“For these reasons, wBTC is poised to continue its dominance in the short to medium term. That being said, there’s still the looming threat of government intervention once these assets grow large enough to catch the regulator’s attention.”But the decline in small addresses and the upsurge of wBTC do not necessarily hint at a bearish trend for Bitcoin.Eventually, when users decide to pull their wBTC out of DeFi protocols, they would convert them back to BTC. If the addresses moved BTC to Ethereum’s wBTC, it does not indicate that the users sold BTC.Instead, it suggests that it might be a short-term trend that might last until the end of the ongoing DeFi cycle.On Sep. 18, Skew reported that the value of wBTC is accelerating towards $1 billion. According to data from CoinMarketCap, 76,047 wBTC are currently in circulation suggesting more users are transferring BTC to Ethereum-based DeFi platforms for yield.The wBTC market cap. Source: SkewSince wBTC represents the exact value of 1 BTC, it is not a bearish trend for Bitcoin over the longer term. In fact, one could argue it is a positive metric because users are reluctant towards missing out on potential BTC upside.While DeFi platforms allowing users to gain yield using wBTC are profitable, there exist high-risk and high-return pools. The rising market capitalization of wBTC suggests many users do not want to risk losing out on a potential BTC rally."
339,"The open interest on Bitcoin (BTC) options is just 5% short of their all-time high, but nearly half of this amount will be terminated in the upcoming September expiry. Although the current $1.9 billion worth of options signal that the market is healthy, it’s still unusual to see such heavy concentration on short-term options.By itself, the current figures should not be deemed bullish nor bearish but a decently sized options open interest and liquidity is needed to allow larger players to participate in such markets. Total BTC options open interest. Source: SkewNotice how BTC open interest has just crossed the $2 billion barrier. Coincidentally that’s the same level that was achieved at the past two expiries. It is normal, (actually, it’s expected)  that this number will decrease after each calendar month settlement.There is no magical level that must be sustained, but having options spread throughout the months enables more complex trading strategies. More importantly, the existence of liquid futures and options markets helps to support spot (regular) volumes.To assess whether traders are paying large premiums on BTC options, implied volatility needs to be analyzed. Any unexpected substantial price movement will cause the indicator to increase sharply, regardless of whether it is a positive or negative change.Volatility is commonly known as a fear index as it measures the average premium paid in the options market. Any sudden price changes often cause market makers to become risk-averse, hence demanding a larger premium for option trades.BTC 3-month options implied volatility. Source: SkewThe above chart clearly shows a massive spike in mid-March as BTC dropped to its yearly lows at $3,637 to quickly regain the $5K level. This unusual movement caused BTC volatility to reach its highest levels in two years.This is the opposite of the last ten days, as BTC’s 3-month implied volatility ceded to 63% from 76%. Although not an unusual level, the rationale behind such relatively low options premium demands further analysis.There’s been an unusually high correlation between BTC and U.S. tech stocks over the past six months. Although it is impossible to pinpoint the cause and effect, Bitcoin traders betting on a decoupling may have lost their hope.BTC (red) correlation to the U.S. technology sector (blue). Source: TradingviewThe above chart depicts an 80% average correlation over the past six months. Regardless of the rationale behind the correlation, it partially explains the recent reduction in  BTC volatility.The longer it takes for a relevant decoupling to happen, the less incentives traders have to bet on aggressive BTC price moves. An even more crucial indicator of this is traders’ lack of conviction and this might open the path for more substantial price swings.Most of the relevant Bitcoin options mature on the last Friday of every month and some concentration on the shortest ones is expected due to covered call trades. This strategy consists of buying BTC either via spot (regular) or futures markets and simultaneously selling call options.A covered call is closer to a fixed-income trade, aiming to pocket the substantial option premiums on BTC markets. At expiry, this trader will be liquidating both his positions on spot, futures, and options markets.BTC options by open interest. Source: TradingviewThe unusual situation displayed on the  chart above shows how 53% of the 2020 calendar options are set to mature on Friday, Sept. 25. By comparison, this is roughly the same amount of open interest for Ether (ETH) options expiring in Sept. and Dec. There might never be a reasonable explanation for why BTC options are so heavily concentrated but a similar phenomenon occurred back in June which cut BTC options open interest by $900 million. As of now, there are no signs of weakness from options markets, but as Ether options stand at $450 million, any number below $1.5 billion would certainly not look desirable for Bitcoin.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

340,"So Bitcoin appears to end this week within tickling distance of $11,000. Experts suggest that the next test of upper level support will be at $11,100 before a move to $12,100. Statistician Willy Woo is optimistic. He thinks there’s little chance of a “catastrophic” dump.Some Bitcoin though, can’t be dumped. More than a billion dollars’ worth of Bitcoin has now been tokenized to access DeFi protocols on the Ethereum network. That’s almost 100,000 Bitcoins and more than 12 percent of DeFi’s combined capitalization.Those tokens have been having a difficult time lately. Almost all DeFi assets posted a loss recently, with some dropping as much as 50 percent. The market has now rebounded, rising by 19 percent in a single day.But if you want to know where the market’s going—at least the Ethereum market—you might want to check the Polkadot price movements.

341,"The cryptocurrency market is still in its infancy, and the overpowering sense of possibility is strong. The range of attitudes toward crypto is generally broad, but recent surveys shed light on certain inclinations one way or another. On one hand, we see beginners who venture into projects they fail to fully grasp, and on the other, we see aspirants to crypto investing who question their capability of getting involved.At one end of the spectrum are the crypto dilettantes, where interestingly, understanding and confidence tend to be inversely correlated. Last year, Dutch bank ING interviewed around 10,500 people in Europe about cryptocurrencies. Of the 13% with the lowest crypto knowledge, 80% demonstrated high or medium confidence in its future. The cognitive bias these findings suggest makes for an uncomfortable journey toward crypto mass adoption. Still, I believe that interest, whether matched by sound understanding or not, is a step in the right direction.An earlier survey that polled 1,000 online investors reveals that 44% of respondents were not trading crypto because they felt they lacked the proper education. More than half of the women surveyed, in particular, admitted that a shortfall in knowledge was the biggest barrier to entry into crypto investing, even though their interest in doing so matched that of the men. A separate poll conducted by Grayscale last year finds that U.S. investors would be more likely to invest in Bitcoin (BTC) if they were more knowledgeable about the asset, relative to stocks and bonds.This limitation no longer goes unnoticed in the space. CoinMarketCap’s interim CEO, Carylyne Chan — who recently resigned — shared she was leaving the cryptocurrency data website with the hope that it will play a more prominent role in cryptocurrency education.Falling into the FOMO or being frozen by the FUD is simply questioning your own judgment. Would either of these externally imposed calls to action or inaction ever go as viral if people were simply better informed?The blame is not entirely on the individual, however. With reputable publications circulating articles on how you are the only one not striking it rich on BTC, there’s no wonder people are rushing to create a wallet. Yet the only acronym you should swear by is DYOR before you “dip your own resources” into “the next Bitcoin.” This whole narrative leads to ill-considered investments and propels the search for a quick crypto buck.As a result of the low barriers to entry, inexperienced investors without a financial background venture into the crypto space in expectation of instant returns. It is a legit strategy to reap profits off of day trading, but it is unfair and short-sighted to make the entire industry about that. How do we expect traditional financiers and those coveted “billionaire’s approach” proponents to take digital assets seriously, given that for most crypto investors, long term is a week?The perceived dichotomy between digital and traditional finance can be debunked by showing potential investors that basic financial principles are a stepping stone for successful crypto involvement and that a misunderstanding about an ordinary process in corporate finance can put all players involved at a loss.One feature that occurs in both types of finance is dividends payments. This year, many companies globally tried to distribute dividends against a backdrop of bankruptcy filings and record unemployment in the markets. Those with a solid financial understanding would be aware that while the control over dividends policies falls entirely under the company distributing them, the share/token price is entirely market-driven, and crypto markets are notoriously more volatile. Dividend payments impact price: Typically, a rise is expected on the announcement date and a decline by a similar amount on the ex-dividend date.Understanding these principles when expecting dividends from crypto companies means users will be more aware of their movements during these times, whether they’re rushing to buy more tokens, which can inadvertently cause the price to spike, or selling their tokens once the dividend amount is revealed.Mainstream companies face the same trials as crypto companies in this regard. According to a report by Janus Henderson, a fund manager that tracks dividends globally, there have been cuts in dividends payouts in every region except North America. Mainstream financial companies failed to meet shareholders’ expectations, and the worry is that by the time these companies can afford to pay dividends — in, say, 2021 — they will have already lost the trust of their investors.For blockchain companies with sustainable business models, the disconnect with finance concepts that do-it-yourself investors from the still-niche crypto community seem to display is discouraging to see. Being the sovereign of your assets comes with a set of responsibilities, and we are all learning together how to overcome the challenging parts of this industry for a stronger future.Apparently not when it comes to U.S. and European institutional investors. New research from Fidelity Digital Assets shows that 36% of the nearly 800 institutional investors polled are already invested in digital assets. A whopping near 80% of them find something appealing about the asset class, be it the innovative technology or the high potential upside. The legitimacy of crypto in traditional financial markets will be much easier to achieve if we see more and more examples of backers that are in it for the long run.As well as seeing examples, believing in the future of a new technology does not always have to be met by a resounding yes or no. That’s precisely why you need education — to see the nuance, critically. The economic crisis stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic made everyone look to places other than just central-bank-regulated currencies, and a modern gold rush ensued, followed by very volatile months for Bitcoin.Most traditional investors are already backing BTC and altcoins, but no one dumps all their billions of dollars into a single asset class. Michael Novogratz, veteran hedge fund manager turned crypto crusader, put it quite wisely for those of us who were confused:Novogratz is advising digital asset novices to put no more than 2% of their funds into BTC, saying that holdings beyond that threshold should be reserved for professionals.Other firms such as Fidelity have shown the seriousness with which they are taking Bitcoin as an investable asset, as well. Fidelity recently filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission informing the regulator of a new fund dedicated to Bitcoin, and it has been an example of a traditional fund that sees the potential of digital asset investment in the long run.In the end, despite these limitations, it is up to the whole community — businesses and individual investors alike, but also regulators and legislators — to make sure we know enough to invest well and to invest safely.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: TradingView.comAccording to CryptoQuant’s Ki Young Ju, fewer whales have been sending BTC to exchanges. Historically, the data indicates less selling pressure from high-net-worth Bitcoin holders.Simultaneously, the daily volume of Bakkt’s institution-focused Bitcoin futures market achieved a record high. Operated by ICE, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Bakkt facilitates BTC trades for institutions.The Bitcoin whale activity and Bakkt’s record volume suggest that both whales and institutions could be accumulating BTC.Whales and institutions have an immense impact on the Bitcoin price because of the sizes of their trades.One whale that sold Bitcoin at over $12,000 after holding it for two years had around 9,000 BTC. At the current market price of BTC at $11,070 that is nearly $100 million USD.Considering the reduced risk of large sell orders, the declining appetite of whales to sell BTC is a positive factor. Ki said:“Exchange Whale Ratio hits the year low—the fewer whales moving to exchanges, the less dumping, and makes the higher BTC price.”The data CryptoQuant is referring to is a broad reserve of Bitcoin holdings of whales on exchanges. There are some whales that are selling at the current prices, as Cointelegraph previously reported. But the data shows that the majority of whales prefer not to sell at $11,000.The optimistic activity of whales coincides with a clear spike in institutional demand for Bitcoin on Bakkt.Bitcoin whale activity on exchanges.

Source: SkewBased on the data, an argument could be made that some institutions are possibly acquiring BTC after MicroStrategy’s high-profile investment, particularly as some popular pricing models suggest undervaluation at current levels.

Following the strong performances of DeFi tokens, investors might be cycling the profits back to BTC and stablecoins.A pseudonymous trader known as “Light” said:“Sold all ETH and alts over the last week. Rotated into BTC and fiat. Almost everyone is criminally underexposed to Bitcoin and just as criminally overexposed to DeFi. When everyone is on one side of the ship.”The Bitcoin dominance index.

343,"The recent week has been relatively dull on the price movements of Bitcoin (BTC), as a slow upward trend was established after Bitcoin’s price found a footing at above $10,000. This rally then continued toward $11,000 on Sep. 18 but was pushed back by some short-term resistance levels. The previous week has been focused solely around Uniswap (UNI) and the airdrop of its token, combined with several listings on high-end exchanges.

The $11,200-11,400 area has been acting as support for a substantial period before the big crash to $10,000 occurred. If this area between $11,200-11,400 can be broken, a retest of higher levels is back on the table. However, as the chart also shows, the level to test around $9,600 (which is also the CME gap) wasn’t fully filled. The level got front-run by traders, and the price of Bitcoin bounced back above the $10,000 level. A range can now be constructed with these two regions. On the downside, the $10,000 area is a significant support zone with the potential of $9,600 being hit. On the upside, the $11,200-11,400 area is a crucial resistance area to break.

Key levels to watch include sustaining support at $10,750 and to resume the rally toward the resistance zone where a rejection will be the first thing to watch. If a rejection occurs, a bearish retest and confirmation of resistance of $11,000 will warrant further downward momentum, as the chart shows.BTC/USD 2-hour chart.

346,"Joel Birch, co-founder of automated crypto investment platform Stacked, detailed his initial dive into Bitcoin (BTC) as a way of gambling on the internet. ""I bought my first Bitcoin because I was playing Blackjack online,"" Birch told Cointelegraph in an interview. ""Bitcoin was about $250 a piece, and so, back in 2015, I lost what would be the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of dollars today, playing Blackjack.""Between 2015 and 2017, Bitcoin rose from $200, all the way to $20,000 on some exchanges, meaning Birch's early Blackjack losses turned out to value much higher than he thought at the time of his 2015 gambling.  Birch, also known on Twitter as ""Bitcoin Birch,"" explained he made much more money based on Bitcoin's price moves than his online card playing endeavors. Birch described looking at his online gambling Bitcoin holdings one day, seeing his account valued 30% higher in U.S. dollar terms, based simply on Bitcoin's upward price movement. ""That was the first time it kind of clicked,"" he said, realizing his inept Blackjack skills while simultaneously seeing opportunity in crypto. Many early crypto participants got their feet wet in the industry via similar (if tangential) avenues. Yellow Card crypto exchange CEO Chris Maurice sold Bitcoin on eBay and at Taco Bell locations, for instance. "
347,"Mainstream business intelligence behemoth MicroStrategy has made a number of headlines in recent days for its initial $250 million Bitcoin (BTC) investment. The company later poured a subsequent $175 million into the asset — a lengthy endeavor totaling almost 100 hours of work. ""To acquire 16,796 BTC (disclosed 9/14/20), we traded continuously 74 hours, executing 88,617 trades ~0.19 BTC each 3 seconds,"" MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor said in a tweet Friday.Approximately ""$39,414 in BTC per minute, but at all times we were ready to purchase $30-50 million in a few seconds if we got lucky with a 1-2% downward spike,"" he said, referencing the firm's willingness to buy BTC at a cheaper price, if the opportunity presented itself.MicroStrategy stands as one of the latest mainstream giants entering the crypto space. The company took a leap of faith into Bitcoin, picking up 21,454 BTC, worth $250 million at the time, putting the coin in place as a reserve asset for the entity, according to an Aug. 11 announcement.Following the initial investment, the entity bought an additional 16,796 Bitcoin, which took a bit of time and effort, as seen in Saylor's tweet.While showing mainstream interest in the asset, the mass-scale Bitcoin pickup also proved the coin can scale effectively as a store of value — a doubt in people's minds since 2017, when the network slowed dramatically while also requiring high transaction fees."
348,"“Right Place & Right Time,” a digital art piece based on Bitcoin's (BTC) fluctuating price action, has sold for more than $100,000.""The Master NFT of Right Place & Right Time was sold to TokenAngels for $101,593. — but happy to call it $100,000,"" Matt Kane, the artwork's creator, told Cointelegraph on Friday. NFT stands for nonfungible token — a unique digital asset that does not synonymously value others like it. NFTs have begun surfacing as artwork, giving the tokenholder ownership over the art. ""Right Place & Right Time"" is an NFT art piece showing a creatively designed image of Bitcoin's logo. The patterns and overall look, however, change along with Bitcoin's price action. Kane said he cannot remember when he actually began creating the art piece. ""I've lost track of time in creating it,"" he said.Many artists put their masterpieces on the blockchain via Async Art, while Volatility.art is a place viewers can see Bitcoin art formed from its daily price action.""Right Place & Right Time"" stands as a unique piece. The master NFT sold for $100,000. This master NFT, however, will create 210 different NFT artworks based on Bitcoin's price action and the subsequent patterns that pop up on the master art piece. ""Each NFT will be created by the original master NFT,"" Kane explained. ""The compositions are created using an algorithm I wrote which visualize a single day in Bitcoin price volatility,"" he noted. ""I'll maintain some creative influence, altering colors and other design elements as the project matures over time,"" he said, adding: ""And of course I curate which days are minted.""When each of the 210 pieces are purchased, the master NFT owner receives 21% of each sale, Kane explained. ""The purchasers of these 210 will [also] have the option to buy a print counterpart of their NFT art,"" Kane added. The 210 and 21% numbers give tribute to the Bitcoin's maximum supply — 21 million coins. The crypto and blockchain space has seen its art scene rise as of late, as a number of various art-related initiatives have popped up across the industry.

349,"According to data from Whalemap, an on-chain analysis firm that tracks Bitcoin (BTC) whales, the $9,800 support has weakened.The researchers at Whalemap track whale activities by following addresses owned by whales — individual investors that own large sums of BTC. They explained:“Some HODLer activity yesterday. Bubbles show where these HODLer coins were coming from. The biggest bubbles come from the pre-corona area at 9800. To me this means our support at 9800 just got a little weaker.”Several whale clusters at $9,800 have become larger in the past several days. The data suggests that whales who bought at $9,800 are moving their BTC to exchanges.Major Bitcoin whale clusters on the daily price chart of Bitcoin. Source: WhalemapSince the data shows that some whales who bought at $9,800 might be preparing to sell, an argument could be made that the support has weakened.But whether the weakening support would mean BTC would drop below $9,800 is a different scenario. The $9,800 level is weaker than before but that does not necessarily mean that BTC would drop below it as a result.A short-term bearish scenario could play out if other whales push BTC down to the $9,800 support level. Only then, the weak support could amplify the downturn of BTC in the near term.If Bitcoin does not drop to sub-$10,000 in the immediate future, then the support level itself becomes less relevant.Red bubbles on the Whalemap’s charts grow when whales move their funds out of their wallets. The researchers explained:“Red bubbles show locations at which the hodlers originally held their BTC before transacting it. So imagine you bought bitcoins at the $20k peak and yesterday you decided to send them to an exchange for instance. In this scenario - red bubble at 2017 peak will appear.”In the short term, a bearish case for BTC is that whales who bought at $9,800 sell above $11,000, bringing the price down to sub-$10,000 for a pullback.On Aug. 23, Cointelegraph reported whales who bought Bitcoin in late 2018 sold two years after holding onto their BTC. Since then, the BTC price fell sharply from $12,500 to as low as $9,800 across major exchanges.Similar to late August, Bitcoin is at a heavy high-time frame resistance at $11,100. A sell-off from whales at the current level could trigger a sizable pullback and a strong market reaction.A highly-anticipated CME gap also exists at $9,600 and the rejection of $11,100 could lead institutions to try to close that gap.For now, the sentiment around Bitcoin remains overwhelmingly positive. Bitcoin has remained above $10,700 following its recent minor rejection from $11,100.The 1-hour chart of Bitcoin with key levels.

350,"According to a recent survey of Huobi traders, 45% of respondents have time horizons longer than one year, with 12.5% saying that they are willing to wait over four years for a return on their investment. This seems to contradict the widely accepted view that most crypto investors are just there to make a quick buck.When asked which asset they have held the longest, it’s no surprise that 69% said it was Bitcoin (BTC). Despite the vast majority of respondents belonging to the 26–50 age range, most of the respondents have less than three years of investment experience.Also, more than half of the surveyed individuals have an annual income of $10,000 or below. Though this may seem low, we should note the survey took place in the “emerging markets,” according to Huobi, where this level of income may not necessarily be considered low. Another important consideration is that only 491 individuals responded to the survey, thus it is unclear how representative this sampling is.It appears there is a shift taking place in the way cryptocurrency is being perceived by both retail and professional investors, from a get-rich-quick scheme to a more long-term game."
351,"As an anarcho-capitalist, I hold that property rights are sacred and that violence is acceptable only when our natural rights, as embedded and enshrined in the Constitution and Bill of Rights, are under a direct and imminent threat, and only in self-defense. I might be the first anarchist, anarcho-capitalist, or minarchist you’ve ever met. Those labels may sound scary to some — that’s fine.Democrats and Republicans call each other scary names all the time, too. But all my labels mean is that I believe in a monetary system that presumes freedom more consistently than that which is advocated by a typical Libertarian. I identify as such due to a moral judgment I made, one that I arrived at after observing the results of our country’s fiat paper money, odious debt and central banking system. After analyzing these with reference to foundational concepts and principles of economics, I think others will see the generally accepted alternative of Democrat socialism vs. Republican capitalism as I do.Since it is no longer backed by a valuable commodity such as gold, our currency is subject to manipulation and valuation based on the level of “trust” in its value. That, in large part, means trust in government. But upon what record of honesty and integrity do you trust the government? Most people who have witnessed government mismanagement and corruption of all matters — big and small — are rightfully skeptical. But they do not often view the money in their wallet with the same degree of skepticism. And that’s a mistake.Two recently published studies produced by Brown University estimate the cost of the War on Terror since Sept. 11, 2001 at $6.4 trillion and more than 800,000 lives, half of which were civilians. Adding indirect deaths as a consequence of the war, the number of lives lost climbs to 3.1 million. If they knew these numbers at the time of deciding to go to war, would Congress and the American people still have believed our actions would produce the most cost-effective results, worthy of that human sacrifice? Surely not. We were all manipulated, during a time when our emotions were prepotent and information was scarce, we were pressured by patriotism, and we believed our fiat paper currency could help us afford it. We were wrong.Hard money regimes are abandoned in wartime, because the debasement of money is a prerequisite of most wars. An honest currency system backed by Bitcoin (BTC) or gold would require Americans to explicitly consent and confirm their willingness to pay for military aggression, as well as all other routine functions of government and the private sector.An honest currency demands that, when we go to war, we have skin in the game. It’s a small sacrifice to write an IOU for other people’s money, but people more carefully reflect upon the cost and benefits of a purchase when they see their budget shrink in real time.Bitcoin functions as a reserve currency, denationalized and therefore detached from government manipulation. When it first emerged during the 2008 global financial crisis, banks did not trust each other’s balance sheets and would not lend to each other, which exposed the fragility of markets for traditional fiat currency. If our markets were not manipulated by the central bank, the time preference of money would not be perverted, and our preferences for consumption today vs. saving for tomorrow would be reflected in interest rates.Prior to the creation of the Federal Reserve, the government did not spend much as a portion of gross domestic product, and private savings rates were high. People invested, bought real estate and deposited money in the bank, accumulating wealth through the power of compound interest. Inflation and interest were under control. However, since 1971, we have abandoned all sense of market discipline and substituted central bank discretion in its place. And fiscal policy, no longer encumbered by its tie to a supply of physical gold, became more interventionist: Governments borrowed more, companies borrowed more. As a result, we all owed more, because all debt eventually flows down to the individual. We may not feel it, but we pay it.John Exter, ex-vice-president of the New York Federal Reserve, wrote in 1971:Other economists agree. Adam Smith, the father of the modern political economy, said:When he was a congressman of Nebraska, Howard Buffet, father of Warren Buffet, argued that “paper money systems have always wound up with collapse and economic chaos.” Further, a recent Bank for International Settlements report concluded that the unprecedented growth in central banks’ balance sheets has had an adverse impact on the functioning of capital markets.In other words: Financial markets are dysfunctional, they no longer price risk appropriately, and they pervert the allocation of capital. They exacerbate inequality and, at the same time, make us all poorer.If all Americans had used Bitcoin in 2001, we would have had to consent to taxation in order to fund the war-on-terror, therefore immediately feeling the impact of that decision. On the flipside, the value of savings would also be realized, allowing us to better appreciate the effect of adopting a sensible energy policy along with a more efficient allocation of other resources. Prices would again function as a representation of our individual preferences rather than government promises.Most importantly, using Bitcoin forces us to weigh the options of war and welfare. Using the figures stated above, for example, we would have had to decide if it was worth spending $800,000 per person killed.With respect to debt manipulation, note that not all debts are the same. Some debt lays the foundation for future returns that will exceed the cost of infrastructure. Other debts will never be repaid, referred to as odious debt.All debt issued by the U.S. government is odious debt. According to Alexander Nahum Sack in 1927, odious debt is issued by the state to strengthen its power and repress the population. The central bank is aware, as are Wall Street banks, that the spending is profligate, especially hostile debt incurred to prosecute wars. Few believe we can grow ourselves out of this hole, and some want to roll it over into perpetuity. Many advocates of Free Lunch economics believe the State can continually issue debt without limit, because there is no limit to future cash flows collected through increased taxes.While the debate rages on, so does the debt. And, for many people, the size of the debt no longer has any meaning. The numbers are too large to grasp. They’ve never been asked to sacrifice anything as a result of it, and they cannot imagine what their quality of life would be, living in a country without it.How can so many Democrats and Republicans believe that there is no limit to indebtedness? No limit to the growth of central banks’ balance sheets? That, somehow, increased market concentration and further concentration of economic and political power combined with very little investment and low productivity growth, will make us wealthy?Fiat paper money exists only through the monopolistic force of the state. Paper money is dishonest, corrupt, deceitful, and is managed by a cartel. Distrust and power are its currency. The use of fiat money requires permission. It is always subject to confiscation and surrender.Bitcoin does not allow odious debt and debt that is not explicitly agreed to. It has other attractive features as well: immutability, decentralization, privacy and scarcity; easy to divide and easy to transfer; there’s no need for an intermediary, no need for permission; no one can debase it and no authority controls it; and lastly, the ledger does not lie.I believe we are in the early stages of forming a new social consensus — a trust revolution. It will be a global one, independent of geography, religion, nationality, culture, ethnicity or gender.Denationalized money like Bitcoin is an investment in social consciousness. It fosters voluntary trade, it forces the market to celebrate wins and acknowledge losses, and brings more individual control over how we assign prices to the things we value — including our very lives.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

352,"Bitcoin (BTC) as a store of value “scales just fine,” the CEO of the company that just purchased 38,250 BTC has said.In a tweet on Sep. 17, Michael Saylor revealed more information about MicroStrategy’s dramatic launch into Bitcoin.Continually making the headlines since its first buy in August, MicroStrategy has now swapped over $400 million of spare capital from USD to BTC.An interview between Saylor and Morgan Creek Digital co-founder, Anthony Pompliano this week underscored his commitment, having previously been highly skeptical of Bitcoin.Now, his belief in the technical fundamentals of the network — and its future — is certain. The problem of scaling to meet demand, for example, is a non-issue for Saylor thanks to off-chain transactions. MicroStrategy’s initial buy-in — 21,454 BTC for $250 million — was a case in point. “We acquired 21,454 BTC via 78,388 off-chain transactions, then secured it in cold storage with 18 on-chain transactions,” he wrote.  “#Bitcoin scales just fine as a store of value.”Continuing, Saylor described a status quo where on-chain transactions for major investors will remain a rarity:“If #Bitcoin is treated as a treasury reserve asset, based on our model, 99.98% of all transactions will be off-chain, and assets-at-risk will be in cold storage 99.92% of the time.”Off-chain transactions via solutions such as the Lightning Network allow Bitcoin transaction volume to increase without adding volume to the blockchain and raising fees to appeal to miners.In his popular book, The Bitcoin Standard, Saifedean Ammous likewise argues that off-chain activity will become the norm once Bitcoin gains a much larger user base.That could happen sooner rather than later. Following the Pompliano interview, statistician Willy Woo picked up on Saylor highlighting the world’s 35,000 publicly traded companies that have spare cash reserves of $5 trillion.“I make out if others follow MicroStrategy's lead and even just 1% of that capital finds its way into BTC, that's enough to blow Bitcoin cap to $2T,” he tweeted.Woo added that given MicroStrategy took six months to approve its shift to Bitcoin, any copycat moves would begin to surface in 2021."

354,"After failing to hold the $11K mark and exposing what some analysts have described as a general apathy to trade BTC at these levels, Bitcoin (BTC) price is once again flirting with $11,000. As suggested by Cointelegraph contributors Marcel Pechman and Micheal van de Poppe, a move above $11K is not a deeply significant milestone as the confluence of multiple factors, including looming overhead resistance and low trading volume decrease the likelihood that the digital asset will breakout once above $11K.Cryptocurrency daily market performance snapshot. Source: Coin360The supposed lack of interest from traders can possibly be attributed to other big developments taking place in crypto. As Cointelegraph reported, decentralized exchange, UniSwap, airdropped 400 UNI tokens to every user who had provided liquidity before the start of September. Many crypto advocates and pundits have pointed out that UniSwap’s helicopter money is bigger than the $1,200 economic stimulus check the U.S. government distributed to citizens at the behest of the Trump Administration. Let’s also add that it didn’t take months for UniSwap users to receive their UNI, whereas today there are Americans who are yet to receive their stimulus check.  Another milestone worth noting is the value of Bitcoin tokenized on Ethereum crossed above $1 billion this week. This highlights the overwhelming interest and demand from Bitcoin holders desiring to interact with DeFi protocols. BTC locked in DeFi. Source: DeFi PulseGiven that Bitcoin price has spent the last 2 months struggling to knock out the $12,000-$12,500 resistance level, clever traders who are long on BTC have wrapped their coins to either become liquidity providers in incredibly lucrative liquidity pools or investors in successful DeFi tokens like YFI, YFL, LEND, REN to name just a few.

Aside from a record number of BTC being wrapped to ERC-20 tokens, Tether’s (USDT) market cap has now risen above $15 billion and those familiar with yield farming will know that utilizing stablecoins to provide funding to liquidity pools is quite lucrative.While the data mentioned above is not substantive enough to conclude that Bitcoin traders are getting their dinner from another table, there are other opportunities out there and with Bitcoin sideways and struggling to find momentum, the data suggest some traders are capitalizing on them. In the short-term the 4-hour chart shows Bitcoin price back above the 20-MA making higher lows and lower highs which is a positive.

355,"As the price of Bitcoin (BTC) soared above $11,000 on Sept. 16, the altcoin market suffered mightily. Some analysts believe that profits from the extended altcoin and decentralized finance (DeFi) rally may have cycled into BTC.After major bull cycles or the so-called “altseason”,the dominance index of Bitcoin tends to recover. When it does, it often leads BTC to outperform many altcoins in the global market.The dominance index of Bitcoin. Source: TradingView.comIn the past two weeks, Bitcoin’s dominance has seen a double bottom, rebounding from 59% to 61%. If BTC’s dominance index continues to recover, it could cause altcoins to underperform against BTC in the near term.Bitcoin dominance strengthened just two weeks after internet entrepreneur and podcaster Adam Curry talked about Bitcoin on the JRE podcast with Joe Rogan. While on air Curry praised BTC as a store of value and highlighted its 10-year track record as the markets’ dominant cryptocurrency.Curry said he sold a lot of Bitcoin when it was valued at around $900. He said:“But let me tell you, the apocalypse is coming and you're going to need a Bitcoin. At least one. I was very anti-Bitcoin until I sold a shit load of them at $900, and I could have [made a lot of money].”Since then, Bitcoin’s price has increased to above $10,000, peaking at $20,000 in late 2017. Given its resilience throughout the past decade, Curry said that BTC is a reliable store of value.During the podcast, Curry and Rogan briefly discussed Bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies that compete against it. According to Curry, he initially denied BTC and its potential as a store of value. Eventually, as ten years passed, he said the resilience and survivability of Bitcoin changed his mind. He told Rogan:“I got them for nothing; people just gave it to me in the beginning. I denied it, and when you look at ten years, f*ck all the altcoins and all that stuff.”In response, Rogan asked if there is any risk in being Bitcoin remaining as the overwhelmingly dominant cryptocurrency. He asked why other cryptocurrencies cannot coexist, which would offset potential risks of manipulation. Rogan noted that all currencies, likely referring to traditional currencies, have seen some sort of manipulation. He stated:“Here's the question about Bitcoin. Is there a risk in having that be the standard. Like why can't there be competing cryptocurrencies? Do we have to get committed to one, and if we do get committed to one, is there a possibility of some sort of manipulation as we see with all currencies.”While Curry did not go in-depth about altcoins, he simply said the Bitcoin’s ten-year track record speaks for itself. There were major cycles where many altcoins failed throughout the past ten years, and BTC remained dominant. Since late 2017, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP have remained the top three cryptocurrencies. Apart from the three, the rest of the top 20 have frequently changed. Curry explained:“10 years of data have shown Bitcoin is really the only one you can trust. The way that I see it, that is really the only one you cannot manipulate.”Historically, the performance of Bitcoin in the fourth quarter has been mixed. In two of the past four years, BTC saw a major correction at the end of the year.Bitcoin quarterly closing prices. Source: SkewGiven that the Bitcoin halving took place in May and historical data shows BTC tends to rally 15 months after a halving, it seems likely that Q4 2020 will be slow.

356,"Traders are usually skeptical as Bitcoin (BTC) approaches key resistances, and there was no exception as the price added 7.7% to attack the $11K level.  Not every rally will shift technical indicators to overbought levels, but there is usually some gain in volume and futures contracts sentiment that may transition from neutral to bullish. Derivatives markets are especially sensitive to trend changes due to leverage.Yesterday, as Bitcoin price closed in on $11K, Cointelegraph cautioned that the move shouldn't raise hopes too high as rejection at this level could be followed by heavy downside.Let's analyze the most recent price movement that culminated with yesterday's $10,960 close.BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewTake notice how there hasn't been much resistance over the past three days during the 8% rally. $11K seems more a psychological barrier than a resistance, but there are currently no signals that traders are confident after the recent price recovery.Considering the price increase over the past three days, derivatives indicators and the top traders net long/short ratio should have shifted accordingly. Thus, the best place to start is by looking at BTC futures activityAny optimism from buyers should be reflected in the futures contracts funding rate. These perpetual futures contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded fee for margin usage.At most exchanges, the funding rates are usually changed every 8 hours. If buyers are using more leverage than sellers, the funding rate will be positive; hence buyers are the ones paying it. The opposite occurs when future contracts sellers (shorts) are demanding more margin.Not every bull run will lead to a positive funding rate. Nevertheless, it is very unusual for positive moves to happen during periods where the funding is negative. Even if there are no additional positions created during bull runs, the liquidation of short-sellers will cause the funding rate to go up. This is caused by decreasing demand for leverage shorts traders, but usually it is also accompanied by buyers adding long positions.Bitcoin perpetual swaps 8-hour funding rate.

357,"Bitcoin (BTC) is getting its best “advertisement” once more as another major central bank floats the idea of charging people to save their money.As Bloomberg reported quoting minutes of a meeting held Thursday, the Bank of England (BoE) has become the latest central bank to discuss negative interest rates.According to the results of the meeting, the BoE will enter discussions with banking regulators over negative rates, which effectively mean lending institutions, and, hence, savers must pay to store cash.The reason is the impact of the coronavirus lockdown on the economy, along with the looming prospect of Brexit, deal or no deal.“The bank is leaving all options on the table, due to elevated uncertainty,” one analyst told the publication in light of the news.The pound slid against major currencies Thursday, as policymakers further confirmed that they had voted to keep interest rates at 0.1% for the time being. Bank of England balance sheet chart (GBP). Source: TradingEconomics/ Bank of EnglandBitcoin proponents immediately seized on the BoE’s troubles, arguing that such a policy simply undermined both fiat currency’s reputation and its own position.“Wow, the Bank of England discussing negative interest rates. If they adopt this, they would be paying you to borrow,” Tyler Winklevoss wrote on Twitter. “You couldn’t buy a better advertisement for Bitcoin but u can take their money and go long bitcoin.”Veteran trader Tone Vays had similar thoughts. “I don't think any Bank would pay you to borrow but they will charge you to store/save your money at the Bank, what more can a Bitcoin Hodler as for!” he said, responding to Winklevoss. “Thanks Bank of England, you will help drive $BTC adoption.”Others took aim at the interim interest rate decision.“One of the most important prices in our society is determined by vote,” Christopher Bendiksen, head of research at digital asset investment strategist Coinshares, tweeted. “You read that right. In 2020, 8 middle-aged men and one woman literally come together several times a year to determine the price of credit. This will seem unbelievably archaic to our descendants.”As Cointelegraph reported, the BoE is particularly infamous in Bitcoin circles, the United Kingdom government bailing out the banking sector en masse on the eve of Bitcoin’s birth in 2009. An article from the national newspaper, The Times, was even included in the Bitcoin genesis block.More recently, central banks’ reactions to coronavirus have fuelled the idea that Bitcoin will increasingly function as a hedge against fiat.This week, the United States Federal Reserve fielded queries about its plans to overshoot inflation targets, a process that would weaken the U.S. dollar and provide a likely further boost to safe havens such as gold and Bitcoin.For its part, the BoE had said that negative interest rates would be “damaging” to the U.K. economy as recently as last month.The European Central Bank, or ECB, has administered negative rates since 2016, but such a move would be a historical first for the U.K."
358,"Peer-to-peer cryptocurrency marketplace Paxful announced Sept. 17 that it had broken ground on a new school in Nigeria. This is the fourth school of 100 planned as part of its #BuiltWithBitcoin initiative to bring quality education to emerging countries.The school, located in the Ankara Nandu community of Sanga Local, will serve an estimated 100–120 children between the ages of three and six years old, and double as an adult education center in the evenings.The city is home to 4,000 people, and currently has just one school providing both primary and secondary education. Paxful CEO and co-founder Ray Youssef explained:""We chose this particular community because of the lack of necessary resources and limited school infrastructure. They are in dire need of quality learning spaces and this school is an honest representation of the impact bitcoin can have on societies as a whole, and more specifically, how it can enhance education.”As with all schools built as part of the initiative, the new facility will come with a state of the art solar power and water well and filtration system.This cuts electricity expenses and ensures the school is not affected by the regular power outages in the region. It also allows locals to sell the filtered water to their community at a very reasonable price.Paxful’s #BuiltWithBitcoin initiative began in 2017 through a partnership with humanitarian organization Zam Zam Water. The first two schools were built in Rwanda, and completed in 2017 and 2018 respectively, while the third was built in Kenya in 2020.Paxful covers all of the fees associated with running the schools, including teacher and support staff salaries, bills, school supplies and uniforms for the pupils.It will also cover personal protective equipment for teachers and students. As Cointelegraph reported, Paxful expanded its #BuiltWithBitcoin initiative earlier this year to include fundraising for relief against COVID-19 in Africa.Donations are accepted on a rolling basis on the builtwithbitcoin.org website, and have been kicked off with $35,000 from Paxful itself."

Similarly, in the same period, Tesla stock (TSLA) surged from $330.21 to $449.76, by 36.2%.Tesla stock and the Bitcoin price have seen an uncanny correlation in recent weeks.

Then, with the massive arrival of Peruvian avocados, prices dropped, as the Andean country shipped smaller volumes to the United States due to it being well supplied by California and Mexico. The drop in prices gave a boost to the demand, which has been higher than in the same period of previous years.”In the short term, traders expect either another test of $10,110 or a breakdown to $10,200. The Tesla stock price has dropped 2.55% in pre-market trading and it remains to be seen if it would coincide with a BTC price movement once again.As TSLA stock dipped overnight, the price of Bitcoin dropped from $11,000 to $10,800, recording a 2.5% pullback. Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said BTC is at a crucial resistance. He said:“The levels I'm watching on $BTC are structured here. The short term still trending upwards, but on a crucial resistance to break. If $10,750 fails to hold, $10,600 is next, and most likely the area around $10,200.

Source: Grayscale/ Coin MetricsAs Cointelegraph reported, analysts have already argued that the current state of Bitcoin echoes 2016, roughly 18 months before its all-time highs of $20,000.With a raft of technical indicators all flashing green, the bullish potential has not gone unnoticed by many. “Percent of Bitcoin ‘Holders’ peaking and ‘Speculators’ bottoming, another great indicator that the Bull run is just beginning,” Charles Edwards, founder of fellow asset manager Capriole, added on Twitter about HSI.The Grayscale report meanwhile delivers further insights into the strength of Bitcoin investor resolve in 2020. Despite highly varied price action over the past twelve months, there is a keen desire to keep BTC as an investment and not trade or sell it at any price up to the current yearly high of $12,000.“It’s also worth noting that the Bitcoin blockchain reveals that there has never been a higher level of Bitcoin owned for more than one year,” Bonello notes. “This metric indicates a strong conviction in Bitcoin by its current investor base. While this is a supply-side metric, it also demonstrates the demand for Bitcoin’s use case as a store of value — rather than trading, it appears investors are interested in holding Bitcoin despite its volatility.”Bitcoin 1-year dormant supply historical chart.

361,"A number of metrics indicate that social and trading sentiment for Bitcoin is still low despite its price breaking above $11,000 a couple of hours ago.On-chain analytics provider Santiment has revealed that weighted social sentiment for Bitcoin is at its lowest level for two years. The metric takes into account the overall volume of Bitcoin mentions on Twitter and compares the ratio of positive vs. negative commentary on the platform.Social sentiment surged a few months ago when Bitcoin started its strong recovery following the pandemic-induced market crash in mid-March. However, for most of May, June and July, when the asset was consolidating in the low $9,000 range, it fell into negative territory again.The analytics provider noted that, counterintuitively, negative sentiment at extremely low levels correlates with price rises, whereas extreme highs correlate with price retracements.Bitcoin reached a 2020 high of $12,400 in mid-August, but has failed to top 2019’s peak of $13,800 leading a number of analysts to assert that the lower high on the longtime frame indicates that we are not in a bull market just yet.Another market sentiment gauge is the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index, which is currently showing a neutral reading of 48 at the time of writing. This metric is derived from a combination of factors such as volatility, market momentum and volume, social media interaction, market dominance, and current trend.For most of August, the index was in the “extreme greed” zone at around 80 as Bitcoin traded in the high $11,000 range. Its lowest levels unsurprisingly were in March and April when “extreme fear” gripped global markets.Popular charting platform Tradingview also has its own sentiment indicators for the asset derived from a number of technical indicators. On the daily and weekly views, they are flashing buy signals, whereas things are more neutral on the shorter time frames.Bitcoin has been largely correlated to stock market movements for much of this year; however, the “September effect” is a term that has come about because it is a historically weak month for stock market and cryptocurrency price returns (as Kraken pointed out in its most recent update). This could be reflected in social sentiment as reported by Santiment.At the time of writing, Bitcoin was still trading just above $11,000, a gain of 2.8% on the day and almost 8% on the week."

Let’s analyze the charts to find out. Bitcoin broke above the 20-day exponential moving average ($10,759) on Sep. 15 and is now attempting to sustain above the $11,000 resistance. This is encouraging as the further the price moves away from the recent lows at $9,835 the harder it will be for the bears to resume the correction. BTC/USD daily chart.

363,"The U.S. Federal Reserve's game plan going forward includes short-term interest levels between 0% and 0.25%, as decided by Fed brass in a Sept. 15 and 16 gathering. The independent body plans to maintain low interest rates in order to increase inflation, based on a Sept. 16 report from CNBC. Such news shines a light on Bitcoin as a store of value. The blockchain-based currency is largely immune to such actions, as it is protected against inflation by its permanent cap of 21 million coins. A majority of the Fed's committee members expect interest rates to remain close to 0% for the next  three years, CNBC said. The governing body said that they aim for inflation higher than 2%. These actions could result in the dollar losing value amid the central bank's attempts to right the country's sinking economic ship — tossed by the waves of the ongoing pandemic.Over the last few years, Bitcoin has solidified its position as a store of value, theoretically removed from traditional market prices and government control. Mainstream giants, such as MicroStrategies and Paul Tudor Jones, have recently added to the coin's credibility by joining the ecosystem, although the technology has yet to see full mainstream approval.

364,"Mike McGlone, Senior Commodity Strategist at Bloomberg, is convinced Bitcoin will continue to appreciate thanks to its fixed supply coupled with increasing demand. “I don't see what [could] make it stop doing what [it’s] been doing for the last 10 years. And that's going up”, he told Cointelegraph in a recent interview. McGlone sees Bitcoin’s capped supply as the main feature. He said that this potentially makes it a better store of value than gold, the total amount of which is unknown. Given the fixed supply, Bitcoin is going to appreciate as demand for it increases. McGlone points at the growing number of active Bitcoin addresses and the increasing flow of Bitcoin into regulated exchanges as two main factors proving the increasing demand for Bitcoin. Lastly, Bitcoin’s decreasing volatility compared to the Nasdaq index is another indicator pointing at the growing maturity of Bitcoin as an asset class. When asked about Pantera Capital price prediction, according to which Bitcoin may reach $115,000 in one year from now, McGlone remains skeptical. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is too mature for this kind of massive rally to happen in such a short time. “Bitcoin 10x? Maybe over 10 years, that makes a lot of sense”, he said.

365,"A company that provides Bitcoin payments says it aims to usher Africa into a new digital age and deliver a compelling alternative to fiat currencies.Patricia, a financial solutions business based in Lagos, Nigeria began as a straightforward e-commerce startup. Now, the platform has gone global, and the company estimates that more than 300,000 people use its services to meet their everyday needs. The company also has offices in Ghana, the United Kingdom and the United States.The team behind Patricia uses the power of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to create alternative solutions to existing financial infrastructure, enabling consumers to buy and sell BTC at what they claim are the best rates in Africa, with no hidden charges. Digital assets can then be stored in Patricia’s “safe, secure and flexible wallet,” and users have the freedom to make conversions between Bitcoin and fiat currency the Nigerian Naira whenever they wish.Founder Fejiro Hanu Agbodje recently told The Guardian: “I had an uncle who visited Nigeria, who used to give me an iTunes gift card. I didn’t own an iPhone, so I literally had no use for it, so I tried to find where I could exchange this for real money. I couldn’t find any local company doing that and I ended up getting scammed of the card. At that point, I realized I had stumbled on something special.”Now, Patricia is thriving — and it has evolved into something even bigger than Agbodje first envisaged.Although many see Bitcoin as a speculative asset or a store of value, Patricia believes that this misses the point: Sizeable numbers of people want to use the world’s biggest cryptocurrency to make everyday purchases, pay their bills, renew subscriptions and so much more.One of the company’s flagship products is a customizable debit card that allows Bitcoin holders to withdraw cash at any ATM machine. Purchases can also be made at countless merchants around the world.In a push for financial inclusion, an instant bank account can be opened within minutes, and Patricia says it delivers some of the lowest transfer fees on the market. All of this helps to protect a customer’s cash, meaning high rates won’t eat into people’s hard-earned money.Other features include the ability to buy and sell gift cards anywhere in the world, with top brands including Google Play, Amazon and iTunes available. Those who successfully sell their gift cards can then access their cash quickly.Then there’s Patricia Refill, which allows customers to purchase airtime for major mobile phone networks directly from Bitcoin wallets, as well as data subscriptions. Better still, excess airtime can be converted back into cash — a novel feature that’s rarely seen elsewhere.At the beating heart of this fintech company’s offering is an app where all of these services are just a tap away. The software is available on Apple’s App Store and on the Google Play platform.For some consumers, the world of cryptocurrencies can be a steep learning curve. That’s why Patricia has created an in-depth learning portal that educates users on how all of its features work. Straightforward guides are also provided that explain what a crypto wallet is, and set out the benefits of Bitcoin.Patricia is well-positioned to capitalize on the ever-growing demand for mobile payments in Nigeria and around the world. According to figures released by the country’s Inter-Bank Settlement Scheme, such transactions have surged by 391% since May 2019, and the volumes of money being transferred have risen, too.The company has received plenty of publicity, including from some of Africa’s biggest publications. For example, The Guardian newspaper of Nigeria has regularly been keeping tabs on Patricia’s progress, marking how Fejiro Hanu Agbodje has developed the brand into a multibillion-naira company in the span of just three years.Disclaimer.

366,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) broke above $11,000 at last, after 13 days within a tight range. But this time, the market dynamic is different because Ether (ETH) and most decentralized finance tokens are declining. As Bitcoin rose to as high as $11,024 on Coinbase on Sept. 16, Ether, DeFi tokens and the majority of altcoins stayed stagnant. The contrasting performances between Bitcoin and the rest of the market make the ongoing BTC rally unique.Some traders suggest that profits from Ether and DeFi tokens are being cycled into Bitcoin. Others have hinted that MicroStrategy’s bulk purchase of BTC led the spot prices of the dominant cryptocurrency to increase. MicroStrategy purchased an additional $175 million worth of BTC, which would add $7 billion to BTC’s market capitalization, as on-chain analyst Willy Woo noted. In the spot market, an order that exceeds $100 million could trigger a slippage of over 3%. Denis Vinokourov, head of research for digital asset exchange and brokerage firm Bequant, told Cointelegraph:“Any immediate concerns over the sustainability of certain DeFi-based offerings are likely to provide a degree of support for Bitcoin. Thus, ETH and BTC may remain on a downward trend. However, that market appears to be overly fixated on DeFi and is ignoring positive developments that have come out of Ethereum over the last few days, which indicate the transition to 2.0 is very much on-track.”Nonetheless, after the breakout of Bitcoin above $10,500, a level that has acted as a strong resistance, the sentiment of traders is mixed. Some traders believe that BTC will face rejection at the $11,000 level. Others foresee a continuous rally past the $11,000 mark, due to optimistic on-chain indicators.The bullish case for Bitcoin in the short term is a retest of the $11,000 resistance level without a steep rejection. Traders generally expect BTC to enter the $11,000–$11,300 resistance range. But given its historical relevance, technical analysts anticipate a strong pullback after achieving that price point.If the price of Bitcoin remains relatively stable after rising above $11,000, that would amplify the bullish case for Bitcoin. In the medium term, there are two key levels for BTC: $13,000 and $16,000. The $13,000 level is a resistance area that Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood previously discussed. The $16,000 level is one of the two currently open CME gaps, with the other being at $9,650.During a podcast hosted by Ark Invest back in August, Wood said that getting through $13,000 would mean “very little” resistance to a new high. As there is low resistance between $13,000 and $20,000, the probability of a strong extended rally increases. But on the way to $13,000 stands two crucial resistance levels at $11,000 and $12,000.According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, long-term on-chain indicators look healthy for Bitcoin. Citing the data, he said “It’s time, gents,” suggesting that a prolonged uptrend could spark. The on-chain indicators show that various fundamental data points hint at “buy” or “strong buy.”Stablecoin and miner-related indicators, especially, signal an optimistic long-term trend for Bitcoin. It shows there is an abundance of capital on the sidelines stored in major stablecoins. Because stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT), account for a large portion of BTC’s daily volume, it shows that large amounts of capital are ready to enter the crypto market.On Sept. 8, before the current Bitcoin price rally commenced, a crypto trader known as “Edward Morra” said there are two short-term CME gaps of $10,620 and $9,600 left, but which one will get filled first is uncertain. He hinted that the higher gap would likely fill first, and the other might follow:“CME chart has a fresh gap 10620, usually most of the gaps (~90%) are filled within few days max, with exceptions (10%) that take a long time (like your $9,6 gap from July). So, it makes sense to assume higher gap at 10620 gets filled first here and then we see how it goes.”In a follow-up analysis, Morra said: “Now let’s see if lower one gonna be filled.” Technically, a move up to the $11,000 resistance level and a drop back down to the $9,600 support level is a healthy minor correction for BTC.Data from market analysis firm CryptoCompare shows that the average transaction value of Bitcoin has stabilized. Throughout August and September, active addresses have increased but have since stagnated. Active addresses directly reflect user activity on the Bitcoin blockchain network. The stagnation of the metric could increase the chances of a pullback in the near term. CryptoCompare analysts stated:“Is this a sign that bigger, perhaps institutional, players are getting more involved in the space? Active addresses for #Bitcoin are stable at the moment, while #Ethereum’s momentum is dropping, possibly reflecting the recent pull back from the #DeFi space, following a very active period.”There are two variables that could have a direct effect on the price of Bitcoin. First, cryptocurrency trader Cantering Clark said profits from Ether and DeFi are likely moving back into Bitcoin. Whether that would redistribute to altcoins after a potential BTC rejection remains unclear. Clark clarified that BTC would likely move back down to the $10,100 area in the near term. When it does, there is a chance that the profits that initially moved back into BTC could be redistributed to higher-risk assets, which include DeFi tokens. For now, Clark emphasized that both ETH and DeFi seem weak:“Considering it looks like there is a rotation taking place at this point between assets, I think that regardless of where we move up to, that we end up coming back down to around 10.1 area. Just keeping it real. ETH and Defi seem a little cooked.”Second, Liesl Eichholz, an analyst at Glassnode, said that the fundamentals of BTC are starting to drop off after the strong rally. Network growth, network activity, liquidity and market sentiment have all slightly declined. The four on-chain data points suggest that a pullback following a steep 4.5% rally within a seven-day period is likely. Despite the weakening fundamentals, Eichholz noted that the accumulation of BTC by HODLers continues to increase."
367,"Back in 2013, Michael Saylor, CEO of business intelligence giant MicroStrategy, posted a tweet against Bitcoin (BTC), forecasting a grim future for the asset. Fast-forward to 2020, during which Saylor's company now holds a major bullish position in BTC.""I literally forgot I ever said that,"" Saylor told Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano during a podcast interview posted on Wednesday. Recent weeks have seen MicroStrategy turn bullish on Bitcoin, buying 21,454 BTC, worth $250 million at the time of purchase. Subsequent developments saw the company evaluating even more capital allocation to the asset. Following the company's move into BTC, Twitter posts began surfacing showing a 2013 tweet from Saylor in which he compared Bitcoin to the allegedly dying online gambling fad. It may be worth noting that online gambling has not died either in the time since the tweet.Once Saylor tipped MicroStrategy's hand regarding the BTC acquisition this year, the crypto industry responded to the evolution of his mindset with what Saylor called ""kind ribbing."" ""I'm really ashamed to say — I didn't know I tweeted it until the day that I tweeted that I bought $250 million worth of Bitcoin,"" Saylor said of his 2013 anti-Bitcoin tweet.Saylor remembers he loved hopping on Twitter around the 2013 time frame, saying he would often tweet out his opinions on whatever was relevant at the time. In the years following, he decided to tweet more strategically, mostly about aspects pertaining to MicroStrategy, although the 2013 Bitcoin doom-and-gloom tweet remains as an example of his early years on Twitter. Fresh news shows MicroStrategy upping its Bitcoin holdings even further, now holding 38,250 BTC. The company's stock (MSTR) posted a 9% rally in tandem with the recent Bitcoin purchase. "
368,"Within the last hour, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed $11,000 across major exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance. This comes after nearly two weeks of low volatility as the cryptocurrency market remained stagnant and Bitcoin price was pinned below multiple resistance levels.BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView.comUnlike the previous rallies which saw Ether (ETH) lead the Bitcoin upsurge, only BTC has moved higher whereas other major cryptocurrencies are still in the red. Decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, which outperformed BTC throughout August, have been underperforming in the past several days.The recent uptrend of Bitcoin has many irregular patterns compared with previous uptrends. BTC has been rallying on its own in the past three days, accompanied by negative funding rates.Funding is a mechanism used by Bitcoin futures exchanges to ensure balance in the market. If the majority of traders in the market are betting against an asset’s price by shorting, then short contract holders have to compensate long holders. The inverse of this process applies when traders are long on an asset.Bitcoin funding rates on Skew show that the funding rates still remain mostly negative across major exchanges and this indicates that traders are continuing to short BTC despite its upward movement.The data suggests three possible trends: shorts are being squeezed, the spot market leading the rally, or futures are having a minimal effect on BTC price.According to TradeLayer founder Patrick Dugan, BitMEX is falling behind in liquidity compared to the levels seen in March. The open interest of futures exchanges has declined in recent weeks, suggesting that futures activity has declined.Various data points also hint at the spot market leading the current rally. If the demand from the spot market is behind the rally it is considered an optimistic trend.When the futures market causes BTC to increase, it often causes the market to become vulnerable to long squeezes. But if the spot market is pushing BTC up, the chances of a big long squeeze causing a massive correction is low.Still, it is premature to expect an extended rally from $11,000. Traders have pinpointed the $11,000-$11,300 area as a major resistance range. There is a high probability that a rejection could happen, and $10,100 and $10,500 remain as key support levels.On Sept. 15, Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said that breaking $10,900 would likely result in $11,300. He said:“Levels to watch on $BTC. Breaking $10,900 -> $11,300 next. Losing $10,600 -> $10,300 next.”But, a major BTC rally above $11,300 is difficult to project based on its recent performance. After its steep fall from $12,500, the $11,300 level solidified as a resistance level.The Bitcoin upsurge also coincided with the recovery of gold and the intraday rally of the U.S. stock market. The simultaneous uptrend comes as the Federal Reserve hosts a meeting to decide interest rates."
369,"Bitcoin (BTC) is a firm “buy” according to a range of on-chain indicators that are flashing bullish this week.Collected by on-chain monitoring resource CryptoQuant, a total of ten indicators are currently telling investors to enter the market now.Of the eleven items that form CryptoQuant’s market overview, eight are classified as “buy” and two as “strong buy” for Bitcoin. Only one is “neutral,” while none are “sell.”“Long-term $BTC on-chain indicators look healthy,” CryptoQuant summarized on Twitter.The two strongest buy signals come from the so-called stablecoin supply ratio (SSR) and exchange stablecoin reserves.As Cointelegraph recently reported, both indicators have already given bullish hints about trader sentiment, and continue despite mixed price activity.SSR refers to the purchasing power of stablecoin holders relative to the Bitcoin price. Even at $11,400 late last month, buyer support was strong, and conditions remain ideal at current price levels.Bitcoin stablecoin supply ratio historical chart.

In terms of network fundamentals, hash rate and difficulty are both either at or shortly set to hit all-time highs, underscoring miners’ long-term optimism.This week, statistician Willy Woo pointed to several other aspects showing that price action should now be upwards rather than downwards.PlanB, the creator of the stock-to-flow Bitcoin price models, meanwhile called for BTC/USD to begin its next long-term leg up from $10,000 towards $100,000, pointing to the latest incarnation of his metric.The only cautious words have come from those concerned about non-technical factors, such as global macro markets. Robert Kiyosaki, the author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” warned on Tuesday that the discovery of a successful coronavirus vaccine alone would be enough to “crash” Bitcoin and other safe havens, at least in the near term."

MicroStrategy first announced the firm is purchasing Bitcoin on Aug. 11, after which its stock price surged by over 10%. Now, MSTR price has once again risen in a similar fashion after confirming yesterday that it doubled down on adopting a “Bitcoin standard,” buying over 38,000 BTC worth $425 million at an average price of $11,111. “We just had the awful realization that we were sitting on top of a $500 million ice cube that’s melting,"" CEO Michael Saylor told Coindesk. “This is not a speculation, nor is it a hedge.

Source: Joe WeisenthalThe company needed new ways to vamp up and gaining exposure to Bitcoin and making BTC its primary treasury asset is quickly becoming one of its major strategies.Typically, safe-haven assets like gold and real estate are perceived as a hedge against inflation. They are like insurance rather than investment, providing balance to the portfolio.Bitcoin has the potential to achieve both; it could act as a hedge against inflation and potentially outperform many asset classes over time.Barry Silbert, the CEO of Grayscale, said the purchase might become the worst or the smartest CEO decision of all time.There is an enormous amount of risk MicroStrategy is taking to secure such a large holding of BTC. But if BTC explosively grows over the long term, it could be a significant catalyst for the stock. Silbert said:“This will go down in history as one of the smartest or worst CEO decisions of all time. Case studies and books will be written about it. Either way, it took enormous guts for a public company CEO and I commend him for the courage.”One problematic sentiment around MSTR stock is that some celebrate it as a loophole for an exchange-traded fund (ETF). While the company has a large exposure to Bitcoin, Compound Finance’s general counsel Jake Chervinskey said such a loophole is non-existent. He also noted that if the firm continues to buy more BTC, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could begin inquiring about it. He said:“No, there isn't a loophole in the federal securities laws allowing a publicly traded company to convert itself into a bitcoin ETF without SEC approval. The more bitcoin $MSTR buys, the more likely the SEC is to start asking questions that @Nasdaq doesn't want to answer.”"

Gold silver Bitcoin will CRASH. Buying opportunity,” he wrote. Continuing, Kiyosaki argued that the virus was masking the “real” issues at stake for the United States economy in particular.

Warren Buffett has a huge cash position, he’s recently moved into gold stock, which is a very different kind of investment than he’s used to making over the past decades, and as of this week he’s now got a big position in Japanese stocks,” RT host Max Keiser, who often presents similar conclusions about the economy, continued in an interview this weekend.“He’s getting out of the dollar; I think that’s pretty clear. That should be a red flag to folks out there — that one of the world’s most successful investors is getting out of the dollar.”Also in August, Keiser forecast that Bitcoin would hit a new all-time high in the near future as the current economic situation plays out."

However, the steady increase in volume recently enjoyed by the platform suggests that institutions are now warming to it.A point of difference for Bakkt’s contracts is they are supposedly “physically settled” in Bitcoin rather than cash. However, analysts have highlighted that most contracts traded on Bakkt are rolled over, with only a minority of traders opting to receive Bitcoin when the contracts expire.Despite the new all-time high, Bakkt’s volumes pale in comparison to the trade activity on the largest cryptocurrency exchanges.

Most claimed that cryptocurrencies were ponzi schemes, scams, or unsustainable, but this narrative began to shift in April 2019 when the digital asset recovered from lows in the sub-$4k range.Most investors view safe-haven assets like gold as the go-to hedge against inflation, but they do not invest in these assets expecting immense returns.Speaking with Pompliano, Cramer said he is drawn to Bitcoin by its demonstrated ability to rise in value while also acting as an inflation hedge. He said:“I mean people talk about like crypto gets hacked or whatever, you know what's really bad? It's when your kids can't find your gold. And that is, by the way, not unusual. So this is why I am fixated on needing to own crypto, because I fear a massive amount of inflation, and I don't have [any]. Gold will do okay, the houses will do okay, those will keep me running in place.

According to him, gold is dangerous for kids to hold, which makes Bitcoin more attractive. Cramer said:“They [my kids] will never understand gold.

381,"The team behind Arbistar, a crypto trading bot developer, announced that it would be shutting down a popular trading tool known as Community Bot.According to a press release published by Arbicorp, the company that runs Arbistar, the platform is not currently allowing deposits. All funds have been frozen, preventing users from withdrawing their money. Users are not even able to access crypto from funds that trade with other bots. This has led financial forensic firm, Tulip Research, to warn users that Arbicorp is actually a billion-dollar crypto Ponzi scheme — a claim they say they have made “many times”:“Arbistar has used BTCPayServer for the last year taking advantage of the PayJoin functionality to hide the money trail. Before its implementation, it was possible to trace without problem the different movements that the company made with the incoming capital. By applying heuristic methods, different addresses can be related to a single organization.”By checking the address pool before preceding the BTCPayServer, and taking into account that they have linked the final addresses with the old ones, Tulip Research stated that they were able to check the amount of Bitcoin (BTC) that entered Airbistar’s accounts.Cointelegraph Spanish reported that the “Community Bot” had been paying a 28% excess over the actual profits for 46 weeks. This has generated, according to the directors, a ""hole"" in the bot's accounts. Arbistar stated:“At that time, an error in the configuration of the profits made the figure obtained in the markets (exchanges) with the Arbitration Bot (community bot) WAY LOWER than what is actually detailed on the platform. Therefore, we have been producing higher profits on the platform for almost one year than was actually achieved in the markets.”In a video published on YouTube, Arbistar CEO Santi Fuentes said that the company intends to return the funds to customers via daily payments starting on Sept. 15.Arbistar warned, however, that if users decide to take legal action against the company, they “will block the funds” pending a judicial resolution."
382,"Since Sep. 5, many trades in the Bitcoin (BTC) futures market have been seemingly net short. As the majority of placed bets against BTC, the funding rate of BTC futures contracts turned negative.But in the last 30 hours, the price of Bitcoin increased from $10,211 to as high as $10,878 on Coinbase. The large amounts of shorts in the market are fueling the recovery of BTC for three reasons.The three factors are low funding rates, the likelihood of a short squeeze, and the implications of defending the $10,000 support level.The Bitcoin futures market implements a mechanism called “funding.” In a nutshell, funding incentivizes traders longing BTC or betting on it to increase in price if the market is majority short, and vice versa.As such, when most of the market is actively shorting Bitcoin, then short contract holders have to compensate long holders. The problem occurs when funding rates remain negative for an extended period of time.Bitcoin futures market funding rates. Source: Skew.comIf BTC doesn’t drop but funding rates remain low, short contract holders don’t have an incentive to hold onto shorts. Eventually, short holders adjust their positions, which requires them to market buy BTC. The whole process causes the demand for BTC to increase in the short term.A pseudonymous trader known as “Byzantine General” pointed out the low funding rates as a potential catalyst for BTC. He explained:“We almost have more people selling at a loss than for profit. This is bullish in case you didn't know.”Mohit Sorout, the founding partner of Bitazu Capital, similarly said that shorts paid longs on Binance in the last 24 hours.As Cointelegraph previously reported, the futures market open interest has been low throughout the past month. Consequently, the market saw little volatility for a prolonged period.The term open interest refers to the total amount of long and short contracts open in the market. It is an effective gauge to measure trading activity in the futures market at a given time.Since open interest was low, a major short squeeze was unlikely to occur. In the past two days, however, BTC surged by over 6%, establishing strong newfound momentum. The upsurge indicates that a minor short squeeze is currently occurring, neutralizing the futures market.The 4-hour price chart of Bitcoin. Source: TradingView.comTraders have frequently talked about the significance of the $10,000 support level throughout August and September. Bitcoin has resiliently defended $10,000 despite recent selling pressure from miners only to quickly recover above this important psychological level for traders. The presence of a long-time CME gap at $9,650 raised the probability of a deeper drop below $10,000, though that is becoming increasingly unlikely.The stability above $10,000 and the ongoing attempt to retest the $11,000 resistance level is an optimistic trend.Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and Cointelegraph Markets contributor, explained that the crucial resistance to break was $10,700. BTC has surpassed that resistance level on lower time frames and the next hurdle is for high-time frame charts to establish $10,700 as a new level of support. He said:“In resistance zone. Crucial area to hold at $10,350. Crucial resistance to break is $10,700. Breakout up and we'll target $11,000-11,200.”"

Monday saw a bounce higher toward $10,800 — a price point that analysts have already said forms a crucial pivot for further bullish momentum.Bitcoin on-chain activity vs. BTC price 6-month chart. Source: Willy Woo/ TwitterCountering their optimism is the chance that Bitcoin will still drop to fill the lower of two gaps in CME Group’s Bitcoin futures market at $9,600. Woo likewise noted that there was a desire for this to happen, with significant buyer support around that level.“I’m still cautious of another short term dump to fill the gap but so far it’s looking like it’s been front-run for liquidity which is strongly bullish if we break resistance here,” he continued. “There’s a lot of bids in the spot order books wanting to snap up the gap in the mid-high 9000s.”As Cointelegraph reported, various sources are demanding a fresh shake-up in BTC price action after the rejection at $12,000.For PlanB, the quant analyst behind the stock-to-flow family of price forecasting models, the time is right for Bitcoin to follow historical precedent and launch toward $100,000.That level represents an order of magnitude change, similar to how BTC/USD transformed from $100 to $1,000 and then from $1,000 to $10,000 in 2017.Network fundamentals support long-term strength continuing, with the hash rate reaching all-time highs and difficulty set to follow this week. Woo agrees, noting that Bitcoin’s difficulty behavior is decidedly on the bullish rather than the bearish side.Bitcoin difficulty ribbon vs. price historical chart.

384,"More than $1 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) has now been tokenized to access decentralized finance protocols on the Ethereum network. That’s equivalent to the entire total value locked, or TVL, in DeFi less than four months ago.According to DeFi Pulse, roughly 98,300 BTC (worth $1.05 billion) has been tokenized using protocols other than Blockstream’s Lightning Network — equating to more than 12% of the DeFi’s sector’s $8.57 billion combined capitalization.The milestone illustrates the increasing popularity of ETH-based protocols for generating passive returns among Bitcoin holders, with the entire DeFi sector having been valued at just $1.05 billion TVL as of the start of June — of which $47.5 million or 4.7% was Bitcoin, indicating that the share of DeFi’s capitalization represented by BTC has increased by 150% over three and a half months. By contrast, the Lightning Network has only attracted 1,100 Bitcoin worth $11.5 million since launching in March 2018.In June, the vast majority of BTC in the DeFi sector took the form of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), However, the launch of Ren’s more decentralized Virtual Machine and RenBTC in addition to grassroots tokenization protocols such as PieDAO’s BTC++ this year have boosted Bitcoin’s expansion into DeFi.Bitcoin tokenization protocols let users lock up their Bitcoin and mint a corresponding ERC-20 token, allowing the value represented by a user’s Bitcoin holding to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum network.While WBTC is still the top-ranked tokenization protocol by total BTC locked after attracting 56,800 Bitcoin worth nearly $605.5 million since late November 2018, Ren’s Virtual Machine has tokenized 21,500 Bitcoin worth $230 million since launching in May of this year.While both protocols have more than doubled in the number of locked Bitcoin over 30 days, WBTC continues to attract a larger volume of BTC than Ren, growing from roughly 28,360 BTC to 56,850 BTC, while RenBTC expanded from 10,000 BTC to 21,510 over one month.Over the past 90 days, both projects have grown by more than 850%. On June 19, WBTC represented only 5,839 BTC and Ren had tokenized just 155 BTC.Curve Finance is the top-ranked yield generating protocol by tokenized BTC, with 27,600 Bitcoin (worth $295 million), followed by Aave with 17,800 BTC (worth $190.5 million) and Balancer with 9,500 BTC (worth $101.6 million). Collectively, the three protocols have attracted more than half of all tokenized Bitcoin.However, with only 0.47% of Bitcoin’s supply tokenized, there is still significant value that will likely migrate from Bitcoin into DeFi over the coming months and years."

""I have to start recognizing that maybe I am using a typewriter,"" he said of his possibly outdated gold storage practices.Cramer's comment came in the middle of a lengthy interview, which saw the mainstream markets expert asking Pompliano a number of questions about crypto.

""When I go to my inflation handbook, what it says is buy gold, buy masterpieces and buy mansions,"" Cramer said referring to hedges for folks of his generation. He also subsequently included reference to him and his wife's choice of real estate as a hedge. ""What we didn't have in that menu, was crypto,"" Cramer said. Cramer put crypto and gold in the same category, saying: ""You have to have one or the other."" ""We're on a collision course, which makes me feel great about the gold I own, but I do feel that it's perfectly logical to add crypto to the menu,"" Cramer said, in light of current economic uncertainties. Several days ago, Pompliano previewed the conversation with Cramer, saying he convinced the CNBC host to pick up some Bitcoin. During the show, Cramer appeared ok with allocating 1% of his wealth storage to crypto. "

Mozaffari told local media outlets that the issue of car imports has been a “sad story,” because of the expensive costs involved:“Our next suggestion was that we would provide the required currency through digital currency mined in free zones, the origin and amount of which are known, and would not put any pressure on the country's currency.”Mozaffari is meeting with the head of the Central Bank next week, and hopes the outcome will be fruitful. The organization appears to have already begun working with companies in the private sector to set up a framework for crypto transactions, in the event that the central bank does indeed greenlight the proposal.In August, Taras Kulyk, Senior Vice President of Blockchain Business Development at Core Scientific, told Cointelegraph that governments – like Iran – are looking to make their policies more favorable to mining in order to gain competitive advantages over other countries.The Iranian government recently took down over a thousand crypto mining farms that were operating without a license."

392,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) increased by 3% in the last 24 hours from $10,322 to $10,680. But BTC still faces a significant resistance level around $11,000 and has seen low volatility since Sep. 3.The declining open interest of the futures market and the stagnant spot market volume raise the probability of low volatility.Technically, Bitcoin is in a position where it has risen above a crucial level at $10,570, which has previously acted as a resistance area. However, the resistance range from $11,000 to $11,288 serves as a roadblock for an explosive rally.The daily chart of Bitcoin. Source: TradingView.comThe confluence of the lackluster open interest and volume, combined with the major $11,000 resistance level, could cause BTC’s volatility to remain low for an extended period.The aggregated open interest of the Bitcoin futures market declined from $5.7 billion to $3.8 billion in the past month. The data from Skew shows open interest, which refers to all long and short positions in the market, has stayed stagnant.The spot volume of Bitcoin shows a similar trend. The spot volume of Bitcoin remained below $500 million for most of the past month.Bitcoin futures aggregated open interest. Source: Skew.comBitcoin saw a minor breakout of Bitcoin above $10,500, which traders are generally optimistic about. Yet, predicting a major price movement in the near term could be premature for now due to the resistance above.If BTC reclaims the $10,500 to $10,600 range as a support, the probability of a new range between $10,500 and $11,000 increases.Historically, BTC saw extended periods of accumulation and consolidation following a large rally. A consolidation phase allows futures and options markets to neutralize, strengthening the basis for the next rally.Meanwhile, a pseudonymous trader known as “The Crypto Monk” said the weekly chart of Bitcoin shows a neutral trend.The weekly chart of Bitcoin with key macro levels. Source: The Crypto Monk, TradingView.comThe trader outlined Bitcoin’s resilience above $10,000 and the $11,000 resistance in the near term. He wrote:“BTC closing the week with a ‘neutral’ candle. But still not the best spot to start shorting and becoming a bear. Expecting a retest of $11k.”Cryptocurrency derivatives trader Cantering Clark said BTC has successfully reclaimed a historically important area as a support. Clark noted:“Kick yourself if you were selling after a 20% pullback from the highs into the first test of one of the most significant support and resistance flips we have had in years. Context is everything.”However, one variable that could inject volatility in the near term is the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting. Strategists do not expect any hawkish reaction even with positive economic data and its recently announced Adjusted Inflation Targeting of at least 2%.The market tends to drop after optimistic jobs report because investors fear that the Fed would tighten financial conditions. This time, the Fed would likely retain a relaxed financial environment, which would most likely benefit both stocks and Bitcoin.PlanB, the pseudonymous creator of the stock-to-flow (S2F) indicator also believes Bitcoin is on the verge of a major rally if the S2F model keeps following its historic pattern."
393,"It’s high time for Bitcoin (BTC) to begin its next significant price rise, the creator of one of the best-known BTC price models says.In a tweet on Sep. 14, quantitative analyst PlanB highlighted increasing signs that BTC/USD is due to repeat historical gains.Referring to the original incarnation of his stock-to-flow (S2F) model, PlanB said that the time was right to begin an order of magnitude step up.“This is the 2019 time series model on historical BTC data only (no gold, silver, diamonds, real estate data used),” he wrote alongside a new chart.“You see the jump in model value at the halving (white line) and corresponding drop in S2F multiple / model error (white dots). Time to go up.”Bitcoin stock-to-flow model as of Sep. 14. Source: PlanB/ TwitterThe original S2F chart differs from the more recent stock-to-flow cross-asset (S2FX) model, which incorporates macro factors and introduces “phases” in Bitcoin’s metamorphosis as an asset. It calls for an average BTC price of $288,000 before 2024.Since the May halving, Bitcoin has put in “red dots” on the model, which have run to expectations, if not in a similar fashion to what happened after the 2016 halving.Interestingly, Cointelegraph market analyst Michael van de Poppe is also seeing the same pattern emerge from a technical analysis perspective.“If you’d like to compare periods and market cycles, the current state of the market is comparable to 2016,” he tweeted on Sept. 14.“Slow upwards grind, with long sideways consolidation periods. In 2016, several were seen. In 2020, 2021, it's likely we’ll see that too.”When asked where the source of funds will come from in order to propel BTC/USD toward $100,000, PlanB highlighted a blog post about S2F and confirmed that his hypothesis remained valid.It would be “silver, gold, countries with negative interest rates [..], countries with predatory governments [..], billionaires and millionaires hedging against quantitative easing (QE), and institutional investors.”Optimism on safe havens continues this week beyond Bitcoin. As Cointelegraph reported, hopes are high that gold will react positively to Wednesday’s policy update from the U.S. Federal Reserve.Continuing, Mike McGlone, chief strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, highlighted strength in gold.“Rising gold prices, despite declining managed-money net-longs hedge funds and an advancing dollar, are a sign of the strengthening foundation under the metal,” he summarized on Monday.“Less speculation vs. more organic demand forces are at play for the store of value, which indicates a healthy bull market.”XAU/USD currently lingers at just under $1,950, having hit all-time highs of $2,075 in August."
394,"As in most technical domains, evolution in the crypto industry moves in waves. The first wave was the building of layer-one blockchain solutions and infrastructures like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). The second wave was the ICO boom. As this draws to an end, there have been multiple speculations on what the next wave in crypto will be. Some predicted that security token offerings and initial exchange offerings would be the next big thing, but this did not come to pass. Others believe in layer-two scaling solutions like Plasma and the Lightning Network, which, lately, have proved to be critical solutions due to high network congestion and Ethereum’s gas fees hitting a new all-time high each day. Those solutions, unfortunately, are still several years away.On the other hand, we also have layer zero solutions like Cosmos and Polkadot, which fall in pretty much the same category: They are visionary in the sense that they would allow the free flow of liquidity between networks and address congestion issues as well.And then we have decentralized finance. It emerged at just the right time to fill the gap between the (let’s be honest) overall disappointment from initial coin offerings — with over 80% scams and the majority of the remaining projects failing to provide any substation value — and the purely technical L0 and L2 solutions that are due in a few years.DeFi offers a unique solution: synthetic products that allow conservative investors to receive interest on their stablecoins and enable traders and crypto optimists to leverage their current positions. The true brilliance of DeFi, however, is the issuance of governance tokens. Those tokens really hit the nail on the head by allowing truly exponential returns on invested capital, while, at the same time, radically democratizing protocol governance and promoting true decentralization. This has enabled DeFi to become the purest form of a decentralized autonomous organization, which we have at the moment.DeFi originally came in two flavors: collateralized lending/synthetic products (like Compound) and infrastructure to support the former (e.g., oracles, decentralized exchanges, bonding curve contracts and automated market makers like Balancer).Compound is one of the most well-known names in DeFi. Its lending solution was one of the first (along with MakerDAO, although there are notable differences) to offer governance tokens to its users. Since it started distributing COMP tokens to its lenders and borrowers earlier this June, the platform has exploded, increasing its liquidity sixfold and becoming the largest DeFi application — only recently it was overtaken by Aave and Maker.Meanwhile, the COMP token increased in value from around $66 in early June to almost $220 in mid-August. Compound distributes 2,890 COMP tokens on a daily basis to all users who either provide liquidity or borrow from the protocol. The exact distribution ratios are determined by the interest in the individual currency pairs. The governance token model has already proved to be beneficial for decentralization, as COMP holders have already had an impact on the protocol policies.Related: Compound’s COMP token takes DeFi by storm, now has to hold top spotThen there is Balancer (BAL) where, even though BAL tokens have not yet been minted and distributed, and after some volatility due to price discovery early on, the BAL token increased from around $8 in mid-July to over $34 by the end of August.What is interesting here is that a governance token was not in the original design of Balancer but rather introduced later, following this trend in digital assets. In any case, it surely paid off. It is worth noting that this is in spite of the fact that the Balancer team even kept a huge proportion of the tokens for themselves.Those projects have two things in common: They offer solid returns via interest or fees and have the potential for exponential returns via their governance tokens.For the second step in DeFi’s evolution, we have a different approach — what I would call meta-DeFi solutions. These are projects and protocols that enable game-changing features, such as optimized automated yield farming (like Yearn.finance) or cross-blockchain operability (like Equilibrium), which allows for both tapping into a liquidity pool way larger than just Ethereum, while also solving congestion issues.Yearn.finance is a case where, even though the developers have stated that the underlying governance token is mostly valueless, its value increased from around $700 to $15,000 in less than a month. It has even been hailed as the fastest DeFi growth story in the brief history of cryptocurrencies.While the token merely provides its owners with voting rights, the developers behind it have decided to distribute all YFI to the community, keeping none for themselves, and thereby earning the approval of their users who value decentralization.After all, that is what DeFi is all about. The initial supply of 30,000 YFI was distributed equally into three different pools with differing mechanisms, each targeting a different goal (liquidity, governance and protocol usage). The assets which the protocol is managing experienced some of the most exponential growth to be seen in crypto, from under $10 million in mid-July to nearly $1 billion by the end of August.Equilibrium has an innovative value proposition, aiming to be the first true cross-platform DeFi solution (deployed on the Polkadot substrate), and thereby accessing much larger liquidity than any other DeFi solution out there. It is bringing DeFi to all the main protocols which do not support it natively but can integrate with Polkadot — Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Tezos (XTZ), EOS, etc. The protocol follows industry best practices by offering its own governance token for liquidity farming and a full set of DeFi functionalities like stablecoins, derivative products, lending and liquidity pools.Taking this a step further, the protocol adds additional investor protection with the novel concept of “Bailsman” in its lending layer. It is through its risk assessment algorithm that Equilibrium solves DeFi’s liquidity problem. The algorithm monitors both the liquidity of its individual users’ cross-chain assets in real time and their aggregate value, correcting and maintaining overall solvency as necessary by incentivizing Bailsmen to add liquidity to the system via attractive earning opportunities. It thus solves bad debt proactively and avoids the forced auctions that can be catastrophic in adverse markets, as MakerDAO experienced this spring.DeFi is here to stay and is evolving rapidly. It is the purest form of a DAO which we have to date. The original projects have pioneered the approach and given us basic collateralized lending and the infrastructure including oracles and AMA, which are at the core of DeFi.The next step was the central role of governance, tokens and their potential for exponential returns. This is where the limitations of the Ethereum blockchain became very obvious.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
395,"Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week in uncertain territory as $10,000 stays in place but fundamentals shift to bullish.Cointelegraph highlights five things that could shape BTC price action in the coming days.In what will likely become a frequently-quoted announcement, oil giant BP said this weekend that the world has hit peak demand for the black gold. In a report quoted by Bloomberg, BP said that demand for oil would stay “broadly flat” for the next twenty years, with pressure coming from alternative fuels and coronavirus.“It subsequently recovers but never back to pre-Covid levels,” Spencer Dale, the firm’s chief economist said. “It brings forward the point at which oil demand peaks to 2019.”Macro asset year-to-date returns. Source: SkewThe startling admission is yet another surprise to come out of the global economy, at the same time as central banks admit that unconventional monetary policy has become the norm in 2020. With coronavirus at the helm and lockdown returning to at least one country on Monday, Bitcoin looks poised to benefit from oil and fiat currency weakness, as before.As Cointelegraph reported, previous extreme volatility in the price of certain oil assets allowed BTC to shine as a hedge against losses.Another week, another meeting for the United States Federal Reserve — and a chance for safe havens to capitalize on its policy shifts.On Wednesday, the Fed will outline how it plans to implement economic measures which will impact inflation — something which previously sparked dollar weakness.“Maintaining a policy status quo in this context would be akin to throwing in a towel, which would undermine the credibility of the new framework right out of the gate,” Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies told MarketWatch on Monday.Any actions from the Fed could weigh on the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY) once again, something to which Bitcoin has shown significant inverse correlation since July.Gold markets are already considering the likelihood of a shake-up, analysts say, betting on the Fed putting itself in an increasingly difficult position. The precious metal has formed a “golden triangle” and is ripe for a breakout.For Bitcoin, it’s all about DXY — a reversal of recent strength at the beginning of September would be a clear bull signal. Conversely, continued gains would likely keep selling pressure at $10,500 intact.DXY 2-month chart. Source: TradingView“The coronavirus crisis is many times more destructive than the financial crisis of 2008,” Steve Barrow, head of forex strategy at Standard Bank, meanwhile summarized to Bloomberg. “There’s every reason to believe that the move to tighter monetary policy will take as long –- and probably much longer -- than the post-financial-crisis period.”In terms of central bank policy specifically, this year is seeing a seismic change similar to oil demand. With Bitcoin as an antidote to central bank meddling with the money supply, any further devaluation in fiat is only to be welcomed by BTC proponents looking for a safety net.“Global central bankers are discovering that monetary policies they once viewed as unconventional and temporary are now proving to be conventional and long-lasting,” Bloomberg summarized about the situation worldwide.According to data from the publication, major central banks are employing crisis policies in 2020 that they have never used before. As RT host Max Keiser often comments on his show, The Keiser Report, nothing is as permanent as temporary fiscal policy from a central bank.Within Bitcoin, however, the future looks decidedly rosy. Hash rate — a measure of how much computing power miners have decided to dedicate to validating transactions — has broken out to hit yet another all-time high.On Monday, data from Blockchain shows, the seven-day average hash rate stood at 135 exahashes per second (EH/s).Bitcoin 7-day average hash rate 2-month chart. Source: BlockchainHash rate strength underscores miners’ continued faith in Bitcoin’s long-term profitability. Difficulty, perhaps the most essential measure of blockchain health, is set for a 5.4% increase this week — something which will send it, too, to record highs.Commenting on the general situation, Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe suggested that zooming out was all that was needed for a bullish take on Bitcoin.“If you'd like to compare periods and market cycles, the current state of the market is comparable to 2016,” he tweeted on Monday. “Slow upwards grind, with long sideways consolidation periods. In 2016, several were seen. In 2020, 2021, it's likely we'll see that too. Bullish.”Cryptocurrency commentators are also eyeing moves by stablecoin Tether (USDT) as a pointer for BTC price trajectory.Specifically, Tether’s burgeoning market cap, passing $15 billion in recent days, has historically spurred Bitcoin gains. “Bitcoin tether printer divergence. This story always seems to end the same way,” analyst Cole Garner tweeted, highlighting how previous increases in the USDT supply positively impacted Bitcoin.As Cointelegraph previously reported, stablecoin holders, including those of USDT, appeared keen to snap up “cheap” BTC at prices around $10,000."
396,"Jameson Lopp, co-founder and CTO of Casa, a crypto custody firm has released a test result report on Bitcoin multi-signature hardware signing performance on the Casa blog on Sep. 13. The result shows that hardware crypto wallet devices can handle small, simple transactions well. However, they have trouble performing once the transaction becomes complicated. Casa is said to be built upon geographically distributed multisig, dedicated hardware devices to secure keys, designed user experience, and client services.Lopp pointed out that while the company has no control over the hardware devices, the goal is to support any device at the end of the day. Thus, he decided to conduct research and hoped to draw some conclusions and help multisig software providers better understand the limits of hardware and customize wallet software for better performance.Casa is currently compatible with six hardware including Trezor, Ledger, Coinkite and Coldcard  The test was done on all the supported hardware devices and also BitBox.Lopp set up the test by leveraging  Electrum's 4.0.2 appimage on Debian Linux and created a variety of P2WSH (native segwit) multisig wallets that use Bitcoin’s testnet and with the hardware devices plugged in via USB. In each wallet, there was a deposit of 100 UTXOs.Lopp created a series of tests to determine these hardware wallet capabilities when signing multi-signature transactions of varying complexity. He repeated these tests and concluded that it’s better and more secure if hardware devices can show progress indicators for loading and signing. He added that: “I came to really dislike hardware devices that don't show progress indicators for loading and signing. As such, I highly prefer Coldcard and Trezor in this respect. BitBox and Ledger are anxiety-inducing because you have no idea if anything is actually happening.”When it comes to overcoming transaction size limitation and delay of transaction processing time, Lopp suggested that hardware wallets could try to break up a send into multiple smaller transactions that are below its limits. When the transaction process takes too long, some devices will lock itself from inactivity. Lopp suggests that the least device manufacturers could do to avoid such inconvenience is to disable the screen lock timeout while the device is still working on the transaction. According to Lopp, hardware devices should also support Partially signed Bitcoin transactions (PSBT) and all possible valid multisig transactions. He added that: “I believe it's time for hardware manufacturers to start acting like platform providers and ensure that they are providing robust platforms that can be used to build a wide variety of solutions.”There are two steps for hardware devices to follow when signing a Bitcoin transaction, according to Lopp:“First, The transaction gets loaded onto the device, it parses the details and displays them on the screen for user confirmation. These details are generally the address(es) to which funds are being sent, the amount(s) being sent, and the fee being paid. Then, Upon user confirmation, the device signs each transaction input and then returns the signed transaction to the wallet software.”"

However, this buying dries up when the price tries to move up above the $10,500 level.Due to this, the pair is currently stuck in the $9,835–$10,625 range. After the bears failed to sink the price below the range on Sep. 8, the bulls today attempted to push the price above the overhead resistance but failed.The 20-day exponential moving average ($10,719) is just above the resistance of the range, hence, the bears are likely to defend it aggressively. However, if the bulls can propel the pair above the 20-day EMA and sustain the higher levels for three days, it will suggest that the correction is over. That could result in a retest of $12,460 and if this resistance is crossed, the uptrend is likely to resume.This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair breaks and sustains below the $9,835 support.

398,"As the COVID-19 pandemic began, retail and institutional Bitcoin investors took very different approaches, new research from OKEx Insights and Catallact showed. The research, which looked at on-chain BTC transaction data from January to the beginning of August 2020, found retail investors largely pulled back and took a wait and see strategy with Bitcoin. Larger, possibly more institutional investors, on the other hand, accumulated BTC. The report does not take into account transactions in the bulk of August and September when prices fell. Retail transactions, those representing less than one-tenth of a coin, make up the bulk of BTC movement and more closely track price fluctuations. These investors tend to be more easily “‘shaken out’ of the market in times of high volatility and dramatic price declines,” the report noted, which is exactly what the researchers found.The number of daily small BTC transactions decreased and took a wait-and-see approach once the price of BTC hit $10,000 in May. Source: CatallactBased on the data, retail transactions “decreased and deviated away from the price’s trend—suggesting that retail investors took a wait-and-see approach as BTC a season-long, post-crash accumulation period” around May. Medium transactions, attributed to miners and larger retail players, were more cautious at the pandemic’s onset. But it seemed this behavior lasted only until June when activity picked up again. It’s when the data moves to track transactions over 1,000 BTC that becomes interesting. As BTC approach $10,000, the number of transactions between 1,000 and 5,000 BTC continued to go up since the end of June even as the price began to consolidate. “This upward trend suggests the possibility that institutions and/or large players got busy accumulating BTC as economic stimulus measures from central banks spurred on the purchase of hard assets. However, because we cannot cleanly differentiate what actual activity took place from the number of transactions alone, this only remains a speculative possibility,” the report noted.Transactions of 5,000 BTC and upwards also saw spikes from mid-May to mid-July, which led the researchers to two potential conclusions: cryptocurrency exchanges may have been shifting coins in various wallets for different reasons, most likely security, or large institutional investors entered the market and accumulated BTC in anticipation of prices increasing or decreasing. The report noted COVID-19’s impact on global markets might have caused big investors to turn to BTC as a hedge against fiat inflation. The number of transactions of between 5,000 and 10,000 BTC saw dramatic increases throughout the summer of Bitcoin's price consolidation.

399,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropped from $10,580 to as low as $10,258 on Coinbase on Sep. 13. The 3% fall within nine hours comes after on-chain data hinted at a potential miner sell-off.Throughout the past week, on-chain analysts have said that miners have been selling relatively larger amounts of BTC.Miners are one of the two unmatched sources of selling pressure in the cryptocurrency market besides exchanges. Consequently, when miners move their mined BTC, it can cause immense selling pressure to build. Cointelegraph reported on Sept. 3 about the transfer of BTC funds from major mining pools. Ki Young-Ju, the CEO of the analysis firm, said:“As I know, some Chinese miners already realize their mining profitability (return on investment), and they might not want new mining competitors joining the industry because of the bull market.”Meanwhile, according to Glassnode, a metric that shows the inflow of capital from miners to exchanges just hit a five-month high. The previous spike was seen in mid-August when BTC price hit its 2020 high of over $12,000, which was immediately followed by a correction toward $10,000. Bitcoin miners to exchange flow.

Glassnode said:“Bitcoin $BTC Miners to Exchange Flow (1d MA) just reached a 5-month high of 50.351 BTC Previous 5-month high of 44.479 BTC was observed on 14 August 2020.”If BTC recovers swiftly from pullbacks led by miners, it would indicate sufficient demand from retail investors on exchanges. But if the price of BTC continues to drop, it would suggest that there is not enough demand to absorb the selling pressure.In the short term, traders are generally cautiously optimistic despite the rejection of BTC at the $10,500 area. Traders say that such a major resistance level is unlikely to get breached at a first attempt. A minor rejection at the resistance was also likely given its historical importance.

In the near term, the trader said he expects a rebound or a minor drop to $10,100, explaining:“As usual, liquidity levels are where it's at. Liqs get taken, price dumps. We just took some liqs again.

Source: Byzantine GeneralScott Melker, another popular cryptocurrency trader, said that the $10,500 region was a major resistance for Bitcoin. Considering the significance of the resistance level, the trader said it is not likely to result in a major pullback. Melker said:“Don’t expect a major resistance to be broken on the first test. Also, don’t expect the first rejection to lead to an epic dump.”Meanwhile, in his latest Bitcoin price technical analysis, trader Michael van de Poppe also pointed out this level as an important barrier to break in the short term. But for the bullish trend to continue previous resistance levels must be tested and confirmed as new support before moving higher, he explains.    “On the upside, if the price of Bitcoin breaks through the $10,450 level, the potential and crucial pivot is structured between $10,900-11,000,” adds Van de Poppe."
400,"Altcoin Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is plumbing new lows against Bitcoin (BTC) after crashing through fresh support.Data from price tickers including Cointelegraph Markets and CoinMarketCap confirm that BCH/BTC is now at its worst levels in Bitcoin Cash’s three-year history.At press time, 1 BCH bought just 0.022 BTC, 92.2% less than at its peak of 0.285 BTC in December 2017.BCH launched as an off-shoot from BTC in August the same year, at the time enjoying support from various industry figures and businesses. This subsequently began to wane as the altcoin’s popularity failed to compete with Bitcoin’s, leaving a dedicated but vocal group of supporters as its main users. A subsequent hard fork saw the emergence of Bitcoin SV (BSV) in 2018, accompanied by high-profile infighting characterized by spats between BCH proponent Roger Ver and media mogul Calvin Ayre.BCH began its most recent downward spiral against BTC in February 2020, after hitting year-to-date highs of 0.44 BTC.For entrepreneur and commentator Alistair Milne, the outlook for the pair looked bleak, with no discernable buy levels left intact.“Bcash vs. Bitcoin now in downward price discovery,” he pointed out on Saturday. “No support levels left having hit new ATL's last week.” BCH/BTC historical weekly chart. Source: TradingViewBitcoin meanwhile remains locked in a battle for market dominance with a surging altcoin scene. On the back of the DeFi movement’s success, BTC now accounts for 55.8% of the total cryptocurrency market cap — its lowest since April 2019. Despite fluctuations in market presence, however, opinion has long coalesced around Bitcoin over its hard forks, leaving BCH and BSV with little attention.“To be honest, it looks like a big bubble,” Narek Gevorgyan, CEO of crypto portfolio tracker CoinStats summarized in an online debate. He added that how BCH remained one of the ten largest cryptocurrencies by market cap was a mystery. “Literally nobody cares about bcash but it's still in top 10,” he wrote.BCH even failed to capitalize on an endorsement from billionaire Tim Draper this month, the latter having tweeted praise of both its properties and Ver himself.In the event, Draper tagged an account impersonating Ver in his complimentary tweet but confirmed in a subsequent interview that he authored it.BTC vs. BCH vs. BSV proof-of-work since Bitcoin Cash fork. Source: coin.dance“I talked to Roger Ver and he did create a token… I didn’t realize that it had a security problem, but… he did create a token that was easily moved,” he said.“So yeah I did put that tweet in, then I did a little more research and I pulled it off… I admire people who try new things, who do new things, and I’m less religious about one token or another.”BTC proof-of-work has vastly outpaced BCH and BSV combined since their launch, with the accompanying lack of activity leaving both open to security vulnerabilities, which Draper mentioned.According to online resource Crypto51, the theoretical current cost of launching a 51% attack for one hour is around 50 times as much in U.S. dollar terms against BCH than BTC — $9,914 versus $554,672. Another “version” of Bitcoin formerly popular, Bitcoin Gold (BTG), can now be compromised for just $312."
401,"When most people hear about buying Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies, they immediately think of the largest exchanges, most of which are located in Asia. Today, countries such as China and South Korea have become epicenters of blockchain innovation. However, in many countries, it’s still unclear whether cryptocurrencies are allowed, and if they are, what their status is. So, here’s how the regulation of the cryptocurrency market in Asia is shaping up and what should be expected from governments in the near future.Today, China is home to many cryptocurrency projects and exchanges, and yet, crypto has actually been banned for several years now. In 2017, the People’s Bank of China, the nation’s central bank, banned initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency exchanges. Then the Shanghai branch of the PBoC announced its intention to root out the crypto industry in the country, equating the token sales to the illegal placement of securities or fundraising. Soon, the biggest crypto exchanges in the country, Huobi and OKCoin, announced they had stopped local trading.The turning point came in July 2019 when a Chinese court ruled that Bitcoin was digital property. The court’s decision marked a shift in cryptocurrency adoption, and in October 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for an increase in blockchain development efforts. Furthermore, the PBoC has said it’s prioritizing the launch of a central bank digital currency. However, the Chinese government is still quite cautious in its approach to both its own cryptocurrency and digital assets in general and has yet to issue regulations.Konstantin Anissimov, executive director of exchange CEX.IO, believes that recent events in the world, such as the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent economic downturn, could push the Chinese government toward the legal adoption of cryptocurrencies:But so far the government has not introduced a national digital currency, apparently due to the fact that it wants not only to introduce a digital cash replacement but also to create a universal payment system, such as Alipay, that will be used all over the world. At the moment, the PBoC is conducting pilot projects in the field of cryptocurrencies in several regions of the country and has registered at least a few patents related to digital currency.In early August, it also became known that some of the country’s commercial banks are conducting tests with digital yuan wallets. At the end of the month, China’s Communist Party once again announced that it is betting on blockchain as a key tool for innovating nationwide social services.Also noteworthy is that at the end of July 2019, a national project known as the Blockchain Service Network, or BSN, was launched to support medium-sized businesses in the development of blockchain projects by creating public blockchains that will comply with Chinese law and operate internationally. It was also announced that the BSN will integrate support for stablecoins, albeit no earlier than 2021, and will be able to become the infrastructure for the digital yuan.Despite all of these positive signs of blockchain “acceptance,” some Chinese businesses still don’t believe that the government will legalize cryptocurrencies because digital money does not act as currency. Yifan He, CEO of Red Date Technology — a tech company involved in the BSN — told Cointelegraph:The city-state of Singapore treats cryptocurrencies positively and doesn’t ignore them, and its financial regulators were among the first in 2020 to issue relevant laws within the framework under which the country’s crypto businesses operate.In January, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the nation’s central bank, issued the Payment Services Act, regulating the circulation of cryptocurrencies and the activities of related companies, which must comply with Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism rules. Crypto companies must first register and then apply for a license to operate in Singapore. To clarify how to get a license, the Association of Cryptocurrency Enterprises and Startups Singapore has introduced a ""Code of Practice"" to assist companies in their applications.Related: Singapore’s National Payments System Can Guide Global Crypto AdoptionThe government did not stop at just issuing laws; it also began developing national blockchain projects. Earlier this summer, the Monetary Authority of Singapore announced that it was ready to test Project Ubin, its multicurrency blockchain payments project designed for commercial use and intended to facilitate more efficient cross-border payments. Moreover, in June, the central bank announced its readiness to cooperate with China in the creation of a CBDC.At the moment, Singapore has clear legislation regarding cryptocurrencies, and no laws prohibit their possession, use or exchange for fiat currency. Registering a Singapore cryptocurrency company is also a legal matter.South Korea also has a clean-cut vision of cryptocurrencies; however, it approaches the regulation of digital assets in a very tough manner, viewing digital assets as legal tender. Its local exchanges are tightly controlled by government agencies, including the Financial Services Commission. In addition, the country’s Ministry of Economy and Finance can conduct comprehensive checks of Bitcoin exchanges. Since September 2017, ICOs and margin trading have been banned.In March, the South Korean government passed a bill to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. The National Assembly adopted a revised bill on reporting and conducting certain types of financial transactions, including crypto. The government has until March 2021 to implement the law. Once in effect, blockchain startups will be given a six-month grace period to bring their activities in line with the new rules.The bill will affect crypto exchanges, funds and crypto wallets; companies conducting ICOs; and other market participants. They will be required to comply with all financial reporting requirements, use only bank accounts with real names, conduct user identification such as Know Your Customer, and certify their information security management systems. In July, the government suggested introducing a tax on income from crypto trading and even set a rate of 20%, but so far, the law has not been adopted.As for the use of blockchain in private business, the government contributes to the development of this sector in several ways, including through the use of a blockchain-based payment program in the city of Seongnam and crypto storage by four of the nation’s largest banks.The relationship between the Indian government and cryptocurrencies can be confusing to understand. The Reserve Bank of India’s 2018 ban on accounting organizations serving firms that work with crypto drove some companies out of business. The government planned to go even further, and in July 2019, it proposed a draft bill that would slap anyone dealing with crypto with a big fine or a 10-year prison sentence.At the end of March, the Supreme Court of India unexpectedly heeded petitions from crypto businesses and overturned the central bank’s ban, declaring it unconstitutional. Some exchanges immediately seized the opportunity to start trading again. However, the situation has remained ambiguous ever since, as it’s still not clear whether the Indian government will push to create a regulatory framework for the development of the industry.So far, it seems that the authorities may, and want to, regulate this area, but they are hesitant, so another ban looks like an easier way. For example, just five months after the first ban was lifted, Indian officials reiterated the possibility of banning cryptocurrency trading through legislative changes.Related: Indian Banks Act Slow to Accept Crypto Industry Despite RBI’s ApprovalSumit Gupta, CEO and co-founder of CoinDCX — an Indian cryptocurrency exchange — told Cointelegraph that in countries such as India where the adoption and legalization of cryptocurrencies have not been as fast as in South Korea or Singapore, it will take time for businesses to get used to a new financial instrument:"
402,"Crypto exchange Gemini will begin accepting deposits in PAX Gold (PAXG), Amp (AMP) and Compound (COMP) with trading to start Sept. 15.Gemini will offer US dollar trading pairs for PAXG, AMP, and COMP via its ActiveTrader platform and API connections. The exchange will also offer trading and custody support for 12 cryptos and custody for 13 cryptos.Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss tweeted the addition of PAXG, COMP and AMP shows the exchange’s commitment to DeFi.The #DeFi revolution is upon us. @Gemini is now accepting deposits for $AMP @amptoken, $PAXG @PaxosStandard, and $COMP @compoundfinance.

Coinbase, Houbi, Poloniex, OKEx and Binance have all listed different DeFi projects. Even as Gemini lists DeFi tokens, Winklevoss is still bullish on Bitcoin. He predicted Bitcoin would reach $500,000."
403,"It’s been a tough week for Bitcoin. The price has fallen more than 8 percent and dipped below $10,000 on three consecutive days. Analyst Willy Woo, though, thinks it’s all looking good. He believes that on-chain indicators, such as the NVT ratio, suggest a bullish outlook, while Su Zhu of Three Arrows Capital believes that a surge to $100,000 is more likely than a fall to $5,000.The son of gold investor and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff is convinced. The 18-year-old college freshman just bought some more Bitcoin, against his father’s advice. Asked whether they want to follow the student who’s never had a job or the 30-year investment professional, Twitter picked the Bitcoin fan. At least the young Schiff will be set for the end of the world. Podcaster Adam Curry has told comedian Joe Rogan that the apocalypse is coming, and as you hide in your bunker and battle the zombies, you’re going to need a Bitcoin. It’s no wonder that Bitcoin is now the world’s sixth-largest currency. And that’s despite dying again. As the cryptocurrency lost value this week, the Bitcoin Obituary got to add another eulogy to its list. As you’re mourning the 382nd death of Bitcoin, you might want to hold off on loading up on Bitcoin Cash, though. It turns out that Tim Draper didn’t recently buy some or thank Roger Ver. It looks like his Twitter account was hacked or a paid ad went wrong. But if the apocalypse does come, maybe the GoodDollar will save us. The eToro token will set aside a daily amount as a basic income for the platform’s participants. Andrew Yang would like it. Or alternatively, you could just hack a wallet. Crypto Twitter user Alon Gal has declared that he has a wallet containing 69,000 Bitcoins. He just doesn’t have the password. Hackers have been trying to crack it for two years with no luck. Did they try “password123”?The number of active decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, has jumped over the last year. It’s up 660 percent, from ten a year ago to 76 now. At the same time, the first phase of the MakerDAO debt auction is reaching its final stages. Bidders have already committed to buying $2 million worth of Maker tokens using Dai.It’s not only DAOs that are on the up, though. Starbucks is now getting ready to deploy a blockchain to trace its coffee beans and enable greater product transparency. China’s Hainan Wenchang International Aerospace City will use a blockchain to support its Smart Brain Planning and Design Institute. And Bangladesh is about to get its first blockchain-powered remittance service. The service will let Bangladeshi expats in Malaysia send their money home.There have been a few setbacks too this week. The Texas State Securities Board has detected some more cryptocurrency scams. Texas Securities Commissioner Travis J. Iles named Kumar Babu Bondesi and Darwin Eric Balusek as the alleged operators of the Forex Birds and PEK Universe scams. They could face up to ten years in jail. Balusek is also known as “Bitcoin Pope.”And YouTube pulled the plug on Sunny Decree’s crypto livestream. The platform said the video violated its policy against “harmful and dangerous” content.Finally, Jay Cassano, Cointelegraph’s editor-in-chief, has been promoted to CEO. His position will be taken by Jon Rice, previously the managing editor of Cointelegraph Magazine. Congratulations to them both.Check out the audio version here:Joel Comm is an internet pioneer, New York Times best-selling author, futurist speaker and co-host of The Bad Crypto Podcast.

404,"According to Whalemap, an on-chain analysis firm that focuses on Bitcoin (BTC) whale activity, short-term clusters are present at $10,570.Whale clusters are shown at $10,570 and $11,288 for Bitcoin. Source: WhalemapWhale clusters form when whales accumulate Bitcoin and do not move the BTC. Areas that have large amounts of unspent BTC become an area of interest, typically a resistance level. Analysts at Whalemap explain:“Bubbles show locations where unspent bitcoins were accumulated. The larger the bubble, the more unspent bitcoins are located there. P.s. Unspent means these bitcoins have not been moved since they were ‘inflowed’ to a whale wallet.”Whales, or individuals holding large amounts of BTC, like to sell either at breakeven or at profit, depending on the market trend. If whales deem the current trend to be bearish, the $10,570 level could serve as an area where whales breakeven.The two biggest whale clusters in the short term are found at $10,570 and $11,800. Unsurprisingly, the two levels are also key resistance areas for BTC in the immediate term.Based on the recovery of Bitcoin above $10,000, some traders foresee BTC retesting the $11,000-$11,300 resistance range. According to the cryptocurrency trader Edward Morra, Coinbase’s order book has consistently shown decent buying demand at the $10,000 area. He said on Sept. 11:“In case bitcoin dips, coinbase has some fat orders below. Coinbase added bids, from 10200 to 10000, there are ~2500 BTC in bids now.”The strength of the $10,000 support level could allow BTC to retest $10,570, and potentially surpass it. For now, many traders appear to be cautiously optimistic, at least until the mid-$10,000.Most short-term bullish and bearish cases also center around the $10,570 to $11,000 resistance range. A rejection from the range raises the probability of downside in the near future.For now, several on-chain metrics are supporting the near-term bearish case for Bitcoin. Data from Glassnode, for example, shows BTC miner fee deposits to exchanges have increased to levels unseen since 2017. The researchers said:“Currently, almost 10% of all #Bitcoin miner fees are spent on transactions that deposit $BTC to centralized exchanges. This is a 2x increase since the beginning of the year, and levels we haven't seen since late 2017.”However, the rise in miner fees and the record-high hash rate of the Bitcoin blockchain network indicate an overall rise in network activity. But if miners sell the fees, then it could impose additional selling pressure on the BTC/USD pair.Bitcoin fees are being sold on exchanges. Source: GlassnodeHistorically, many analysts have used various network activity metrics to measure the short to medium-term trend of Bitcoin. CNBC’s Brian Kelly, as an example, has consistently utilized the unique address activity of Bitcoin to assess the BTC price trend."
405,"In recent weeks, talk of hotdogs, sushi and yams has infiltrated the crypto industry. Such references, however, are not as they seem and actually relate to assets in the decentralized finance sector of crypto. Over the course of 2020, DeFi has seen bubble-esque speculative levels based on projects that may or may not hold long-term promise or stability. Opinions on the new hype surrounding food-themed tokens vary.“It’s just a fad,” Tone Vays, a YouTube content creator and derivatives trader, told Cointelegraph, adding: “They’re all literally Ponzi schemes.” Meanwhile, Philip Salter, the head of mining operations for cloud Bitcoin mining outfit Genesis Mining, holds an opposing view. “I believe that DeFi is an extremely important development,” he told Cointelegraph, noting the influence of decentralized trading in the digital asset space:DeFi, as a sector of the crypto industry, focuses on providing crypto participants ways to borrow and loan digital assets, as well as earn interest on their holdings. As a result, new projects such as Sushi, Yam and others have popped up all over the place, with speculators chasing the highest interest returns and coin pumps. One project’s asset, YFI, even jumped from less than $1,000 all the way up past $38,000 in a matter of weeks.The concepts around these DeFi assets can be difficult to understand. Essentially, DeFi products allow crypto holders to lock up their digital assets and earn interest. In exchange for locking up these assets, they receive stablecoins as collateral to use while their digital assets sit while earning interest.After receiving the collateral, users then might lock up that collateral on a new exchange, such as Uniswap. (Uniswap lets participants trade from person to person directly on the blockchain.) Locking up those stablecoins then results in the liquidity provider making those tokens usable for further interest-seeking activities.All this activity works with various tokens, which have also surged in price. At its simplest form, DeFi currently lets participants borrow sizable amounts of capital, earn interest and benefit from rising token prices. DeFi has quickly become a sector worth more than $7 billion in value. Numerous DeFi assets, or assets related to DeFi, have grown drastically in price in 2020 — some of which are based largely on speculation.With many new opportunities, unfortunately, comes the presence of scams and deception, with less-than-honest parties looking to capitalize on innovation. SushiSwap serves as a recent example. SushiSwap launched as a fork of Uniswap in late August 2020, amassing more than $1 billion of attention in a matter of days.The project’s head, an anonymous character going by the name “Chef Nomi,” solely held the keys to a reported $27-million developer fund. Normally, this kind of fund sits under the control of certain checks and balances, such as blockchain voting requirements (a parameter preventing a single person from holding all the power).Nomi left the role as SushiSwap’s leader shortly after its inception, taking approximately $13 million of the fund as payment for the work before leaving the project in the hands of FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. The project completed its migration from Uniswap over to its own platform on Sept. 9, under the watch of Bankman-Fried. Additionally, surprising the public, Nomi returned the funds on Sept. 11, offering multiple apologies.Although SushiSwap does not appear to be an outright scam at this point, other projects have shown signs of being fraudulent. Yfdexf.Finance disappeared on Sept. 10, stealing $20 million from participants after a multi-day run of deceptive and false social media promotion. Such cases back Vays’ arguments of rampant Ponzi schemes. “There’s nothing there on the backend,” Vays said of the DeFi meme coin sector as a whole and projects’ lack of potential. “It’s worse than the ICOs.”DeFi has reached peak bubble status, similar to the initial coin offering scene in 2017, which saw millions of dollars pumped into projects on pure speculation. “The DeFi bubble will pop sooner than people expect,” Ryan Selkis, the founder of crypto data company Messari, said in a tweet, mentioning the presence of Ponzi schemes and other antics.Some parties, such as Salter, however, do see promise held within the DeFi hype movement. “We are also seeing lending platforms, which allow anyone to lend out money with close-to-zero risk of the borrower defaulting on his loan,” Salter said, adding to his stance on the DeFi movement’s importance.“On the other side, there is the opportunity for trading bots to simply borrow the money they need in order to execute a profitable trade, instantly paying back the loan after completion of the trade,” Salter noted. Such an automated and self-governing framework means efficiency, creating profit potential via arbitrage and other DeFi activities. Due to his focus on the mining sector of crypto and blockchain, Salter has only recently begun pursuing the DeFi space and the opportunity held within, stating:The DeFi bubble can likely only grow so large before projects and platforms start dropping out of the game. This will, in turn, shrink the available avenues for profit, causing hype to fade, although decentralized exchanges will continue as a part of crypto going forward, Salter posited.As seen in the past, from the dot-com boom in the late 1990s to the ICO mania in 2017, bubbles usher in some form of new technology or give current technology further notoriety. Although many projects, ideas and companies fail during such periods, the world is often left with some form of lasting innovation or benefit in the end."
406,"Decentralized finance, in a nutshell, promises transparency and offers beneficial terms for borrowers. DeFi platforms are supposed to build an alternative financial system for offering/receiving loans, exchanging currencies, making payments, etc. There are no banks, brokers or trusted third parties, governments are not involved, and finally, notorious middlemen are eliminated. There is just secure, transparent software.DeFi allows borrowers to take hassle-free loans: You don’t have to worry about bank account creation, lengthy application reviews or paperwork. For crypto holders, DeFi offers an opportunity to lend their assets to other users, thus earning a profit of about 20%. Decentralized exchanges often act as custodians of funds, thus eliminating that annoying middleman again. This is how DeFi should work and probably will work someday. And what follows is the actual current situation.Decentralization is a very lucrative word. The philosophy behind it is rather romantic, or in more honest terms, utopian: a world without vertical order and rules imposed by archaic governments, organizations and banks. Everything is managed by a community of enthusiasts who religiously worship transparency. Nothing is bad with this one.The problem is that such thinking can result in anarchy, which many consider a desirable backdrop to the “new world” — but not when it comes to personal finance and savings. Here, we still crave at least some order and rules of play.And that’s when the tricky part of DeFi emerges: the disregard of regulations and Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering procedures. This leads to a high risk of money laundering via liquidity pools. And make no mistake, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission will notice such activities pretty soon. There are too many DeFi projects that scream “bubble,” but for general users, it’s really hard to crack down on such frauds. So, serious sums of money could be lost.We don’t believe in DeFi in its current state. In the beginning, when we were a peer-to-peer platform, things looked different. But we quickly understood that prospects are blurred for the current version of DeFi. Only centralized lending platforms have a promising future, and they have proved their credibility already. They offer greater functionality and speed, they’re easy to understand and use, and rates are fixed for borrowers, while lenders can earn fixed interest on their deposits.DeFi operates in a highly volatile, unpredictable market. It’s not user-friendly, despite all those claims we keep hearing. Smart contracts, self-managed crypto wallets — how familiar are general users with these terms? And I don’t even have to mention the number of bugs and glitches on decentralized platforms.What’s happening now is a perfect example of good old hype — the publicity machine with “maximum power” mode on. There is lots of noise and unfounded praise, but if you scratch the surface a bit, you’ll see that only up to 30% of assets are working within DeFi. Non-DeFi, or centralized finance, projects have up to 80% of assets working. That’s some difference, right?To be more precise, though, transaction fees are ridiculous, and they alone almost nullify all existing DeFi benefits. The cost of executing an operation in DeFi could be as high as $100. It doesn’t make any sense to utilize unless you’re playing with crazy big money.Why is it happening? Well, because that’s exactly how a boom or hype works! DeFi exploded recently, resulting in Ethereum network overload. Hence, transaction costs have gone through the roof, and suddenly, what claimed to be available for everyone is actually not!The main risk is a smart contract vulnerability. One “glitch” can lead to the blocking of all assets, or even to the loss of funds. There are lots of examples, from The DAO to the recent hacking of DeFi platforms. In the latter case, oracles, which supervise prices, were responsible for cheating and fund withdrawals from smart contracts.Another risk is an inevitable human error. Developers can claim their codes are invincible, but they can’t oversee how each user interacts with applications and platforms. We’ve all heard stories of funds being lost due to a mistake in an address.The market is still very unpredictable, and there is almost no insurance available for investors. So, the risk of losing significant funds is very high.And of course, there is another buzzword, “yield farming,” which actually stands behind the sudden explosion of DeFi. In simple terms, yield farming means the creation of tokens to reward users who provide liquidity to a project. The trick here is that users have to invest their tokens into the project, and therefore, they’re unable to trade or sell those tokens. More and more tokens are involved in DeFi because high yields are offered and people want quick profits, but this inevitably leads to reducing the supply available for trading. Yield farming feeds the bubble.As I mentioned earlier, at the moment, it looks like the hype created by initial coin offerings in 2017. Lots of people were tempted by ready-to-grab “opportunities” and lost their money in the end. With DeFi, though, the risk is bigger: You can lose all savings, not just some free bucks.Herd instinct is behind it, nothing more. It’s very strong in the crypto community, I should say. A mass hysteria happens every time a tweet from some “evangelist” is posted. So, there are no surprises here. Also, DeFi tokens have a low capitalization rate compared with Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), and it’s very easy to increase prices on them.Recently, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin commented on DeFi tokenomics:But once the hype is over, look out for the downfall of DeFi tokens — it’ll be rather dramatic. Craving quick, high profits, people will lose money, sadly. Greed is a dangerous “driver.”This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

408,"It is a question that many in the crypto community must have asked themselves at least once. The news of Wladimir van der Laan taking a temporary hiatus, prompted us to explore what some might consider to be an improbable, yet highly impactful situation.A Bitcoin Core developer that is also a maintainer of the project's GitHub account (i.e., someone who can “merge code into the master branch”) is a rare commodity. To put this in perspective, if a Bitcoin Core developer is a black belt, then someone like van der Laan is a third-degree black belt.To set the record straight we interviewed the well-known sensei and master of the Blockstream dojo, Adam Back. He said that neither Laan’s departure, nor the disappearance of all the maintainers in the event of a potential catastrophe, would present a challenge to Bitcoin (BTC):Back also opined that most in the crypto community do not truly understand the role of Core developers in the ecosystem and tend to overestimate their importance. In his view, the changes that Bitcoin Core developers can introduce are bound by being backward compatible and should not change the key properties of the protocol like finality, censorship resistance, or rate of inflation. He also noted that changes should preserve or improve privacy. Back believes if the developers tried to introduce ideals outside of this paradigm, they would be rejected by the ecosystem:Back is also against any sort of on-chain governance as he believes that this would lead to the “centralized lobbying groups” taking control of Bitcoin, noting that this is a problem inherent to proof-of-stake protocols. We parried that with the current system, some believe that organizations like Back’s Blockstream, Lightning Labs, Chaincode Labs and others that support Bitcoin Core developers, have a disproportional amount of influence in the ecosystem.

At the same time, Core developers under the company’s employ can quit Blockstream if they believe they are being pressured to do something bad for Bitcoin and the company would have to pay their salary for another year.We asked the Hashcash inventor why, if the decision-making process within the Bitcoin ecosystem is so harmonious, do debates sometimes become so heated? It is well known that some have even lead to schisms, like in the case of the block size debate. In his view, this happened because some participants were trying to force their way to a change:"
409,"Following the news of Fidelity Investments' Bitcoin (BTC) fund filing, Mike Alfred, CEO of analytics outfit Digital Assets Data, described continued hesitancy in mainstream finance when it comes to Bitcoin. ""Many in the traditional financial services/asset management/wealth management verticals remain deeply skeptical of Bitcoin and the ecosystem,"" Alfred told Cointelegraph on Sept. 10. ""One commenter on my LinkedIn yesterday even called Fidelity's move 'Abby's folly,'"" he said, which takes a shot at Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson in reference to her activities and position as an early Bitcoin adopter. A mainstream financial services entity, Fidelity, with its daughter company, Fidelity Digital Assets, has made a name for itself in the crypto space in the arena of crypto custody. On Aug. 26, 2020, Fidelity filed for a Bitcoin trading product —  the Wise Origin Bitcoin Index Fund — under a Regulation D exemption with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. ""From a contrarian standpoint, I think this skepticism and disbelief will serve as fuel for Bitcoin's adoption and price increases in the future,"" Alfred said. ""As these traditional folks capitulate, they will be forced by their clients and partners to get involved at significantly higher prices,"" he added. ""I think BTC has a very long runway ahead.""A few months back, Alfred mentioned evidence of growing mainstream financial interest in Bitcoin.  Fidelity's Bitcoin fund, as well as the entity's work in the crypto space, furthers this point, he explained. Other indications of growing mainstream Bitcoin interest have also surfaced in 2020, such as participation from big players such as hedge funder Paul Tudor Jones. "
410,"Dan Morehead, CEO and founder at investment firm Pantera Capital, is convinced that DeFi will outperform Bitcoin in the next five years. In a recent interview with Cointelegraph, Morehead pointed out that despite the poor performance of Pantera’s altcoin funds in 2019, the situation has flipped in the last few months due to the explosive growth of decentralized finance protocols and tokens. At the end of August, Pantera’s digital assets fund was up 123% year to date. ""The world has woken up to DeFi and capital has flowed into the space"", he said. According to the fund manager, Bitcoin has already established itself as digital gold and an effective store of wealth. Therefore, he believes its upside potential is relatively limited. “It maybe could go to a million (...) but that's really the edge of possibility because you're getting into a number that's $20 trillion in all money on Earth is only $100 trillion”. On the other hand, DeFi is still at its infancy and largely undervalued considering its potential to disrupt the traditional financial sector –  hence its huge potential for appreciation. He said:“It's much more likely that the entire DeFi space goes up a 100x over the next five years than Bitcoin.”Watch the full interview on our Youtube channel and don’t forget to subscribe!"

Bloomberg’s crypto newsletter shows that the correlation between gold and Bitcoin (BTC), when calculated on a monthly basis has hit a 10-year high. This indicates that several investors are viewing Bitcoin as a safe haven asset similar to gold.However, every asset goes through periodic corrections. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to ascertain whether the correction is over or not.The bulls are currently attempting to push Bitcoin to the top of the $9,835–$10,625 range. The price action inside a range is usually random and it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout with certainty. BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewIt is generally assumed that the breakout will happen in the direction of the trend that was prevailing before the range formed. In this case, the BTC/USD pair had dipped from the recent highs of $12,460, which shows that the bears had the upper hand.The downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($10,798) and the relative strength index in the negative zone also indicate that the advantage is with the sellers.If the bears can sink the pair below $9,835, a drop to $9,000 and then to $8,000 is likely. Such a move will be a huge negative.However, if the bears fail to capitalize on this advantage, the aggressive bulls are likely to start accumulating and they will try to push the price above $10,625. If they succeed, a move to $11,000 and then to $12,460 is likely. Ether (ETH) rose above the $366 resistance on Sep. 10 but the bulls are facing resistance at the 20-day EMA ($379), which is close to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the most recent fall. ETH/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewHowever, if the bulls do not give up much ground, it will increase the possibility of a break above the 20-day EMA. If the ETH/USD pair sustains above this resistance, a move to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $419.473 is likely.The bears will once again attempt to defend this level but if the bulls can overcome their challenge, a retest of $488.134 will be on the cards.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair turns down from the current levels and dips back below $350, the bears will try to sink the price to $308.392. The selling is likely to intensify on a break below $288.The bulls attempted to start a relief rally on Sep. 10 but could not sustain above $0.245, which shows that demand dries up at higher levels.

412,"The Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, a major local alliance promoting crypto awareness and education, is launching the “Bitcoin Tram” ad campaign in Hong Kong; one of the world’s main global financial centres.According to a Sept. 11 announcement, the new ad campaign composes three double-decker trams fully covered with Bitcoin logos and ads alongside 20 similarly-designed billboards across the city.Hong Kong’s Bitcoin Association said in the announcement that the “educational campaign” was initiated by the Hong Kong Bitcoin community and is coordinated by the association. The campaign is financed with donations from the community, the non-profit added. A spokesperson at the association told Cointelegraph that all donations were made in Bitcoin.According to the public statement, the “Bitcoin Tram” campaign is scheduled to run between Sept. 11 and Oct. 8, while billboards in the city are due Oct. 1.The ad campaign is expected to contribute to the global adoption of digitized economy, as the announcement reads:“We hope the campaign will give us the opportunity to discuss how Bitcoin fits into a quickly digitizing global economy, the opportunities and dangers of drastic technological advancements and the implications of digital, verifiable scarcity.”Alongside Bitcoin logos, the “Bitcoin Tram” ad campaign also includes some statements and quotes promoting Bitcoin usage. Some of the quotes belong to American writer Stewart Brand and famous United States Navy officer T.A.M. Craven. “More U.S. Dollars have been printed in 2020 than were in existence in 2009. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin,” one of the statements reads.According to a Sept. 11 tweet by OKEx CEO Jay Hao, there are Bitcoin ads right in front of HSBC headquarters. The attached photograph shows that the ads urge Hong Kong citizens to “be their own bank.”#Bitcoin ads are right in front of #HSBC headquarters in #HongKong - is this a challenge or another step forward for finanical inclusiveness? pic.twitter.com/ywPXY3x7wVAs reported by Cointelegraph, HSBC was allegedly among a number of global banks scrutinizing their Hong Kong clients amid the protests over China-backed national security law.According to the spokesperson, there are about 100 individual members and 10 corporate members in the association so far.

413,"Julian Bridgen, the co-founder of the macroeconomic research firm MI2 Partners, believes Tesla stock (TSLA) shows signs of a bubble. He compared the stock Bitcoin (BTC) in 2017 when it hit $20,000 and dropped 58% in two months.From the yearly high to the month’s bottom, TSLA price dropped by 33.74%. The stock has recovered in the past 48 hours, posting a considerable recovery of 12.46%.Bridgen shared a chart of Tesla stock with a fractal of Bitcoin’s weekly chart from 2016 to 2019. He demonstrated some of the technical similarities between the two charts and explained:“What defines a bubble? A great story is essential. In fact, the better the story the bigger the bubble. Then lots of liquidity and finally a classic bubble chart. For example, #bitcoin in 2017. In TSLA we have all three.”The Tesla stock price chart with Bitcoin weekly chart. Source: Julian BridgenWhile the similarities between the Tesla and Bitcoin charts exist, there are several key differences. First, the chart compares the daily chart of Tesla stock to the weekly chart of BTC. Second, Tesla, as a public company, is fundamentally different from Bitcoin, a digital peer-to-peer network.Moreover, Bitcoin is becoming increasingly seen as a store of value, often referred to as “digital gold.” Investors, both institutions and individuals, utilize BTC as a means to store and transfer value. For instance, MicroStrategy purchased $250 million worth of Bitcoin on Aug. 11, adopting it as the firm’s primary treasury asset.In contrast, Tesla is the world’s most valuable carmaker whose stock price massively depends on the company’s performance.But while there may be technical similarities between the Bitcoin and Tesla charts — especially since the correlation between BTC and stocks hit new highs this summer — fundamental factors likely affect the TSLA stock more than technicals. In the near term, analysts say Tesla has three main catalysts that could aid the stock’s recovery. Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy outlined the three factors as S&P 500 inclusion, battery technology day and stock split.On Sept. 22, Tesla is expected to host Battery Technology Day. Analysts expect Tesla to announce a long-lasting and better performance battery technology.Variables such as the release of new technologies and an S&P 500 inclusion of the Tesla stock in the medium term could lead to the stock’s recovery.At the same time, some analysts have predicted inclusion in the S&P 500 may see significant challenges solely due to the size of Tesla. Levy said on Sept. 2: “Of course, there is no guarantee Tesla will be included in the next add given challenges in adding a company of Tesla’s size.”As such, an argument could be made that the Tesla stock’s pullback was expected, and was largely intensified by the Nasdaq’s recent slump. The chart of Bitcoin in late 2017 is often used to compare with other charts portraying vertical rallies.Since the initial run-up to $20,000, BTC has mostly consolidated between $6,000 and $10,000 on higher time frames. Recently, it briefly surpassed the $12,000 resistance level and is now showing strength in the ability to remain above $10,000. Some investors, including Three Arrows Capital CEO Su Zhu, said he was surprised by the stability of BTC above $10,000, expressing optimism towards its macro price trend."
414,"Russia’s new cryptocurrency-related law, “On Digital Financial Assets,” or DFA, seems to have had little impact on the local cryptocurrency industry so far.In its current form, the DFA law essentially provides legal status to digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), but prohibits their use for payments in Russia.As the DFA law is poised to be officially adopted in less than four months, Cointelegraph talked to major crypto firms operating in Russia to get their take on how the new law can impact their business. Based on comments from executives at companies like Binance, Waves, Paxful, LocalBitcoins, and Wirex, companies aren't exactly scrambling to adapt to the new law, largely due to its ambiguous language.Anton Kozlov, head of the Russian market at Paxful, said that the DFA law has caused a lot of confusion. “Unfortunately, we could not say with certainty that the new law is clear to the industry,” Kozlov said. The executive added that the full impact of the new legislation “is not entirely understood by the industry players.”Despite the apparent regulatory uncertainty associated with the law, Paxful does not expect it to affect its business because payments is not the core service on the platform:“Most of the people on the Paxful platform are exchanging cryptocurrency and looking for arbitrage opportunities in the market.”As reported, Paxful saw a massive spike of interest from Russian users this year. According to Paxful data, the platform’s crypto peer-to-peer (P2P) trading in Russia surged as high as 350% on a year-over-year basis. According to Kozlov, the main reason for the surge is the weak status of Russia’s national currency, the Russian ruble, which “is not a very attractive savings option.” “Crypto and P2P markets especially, can help solve these personal finance problems and offer people alternative ways to financial freedom, which is why we are seeing a spike in Russian interest on our platform,” he said.Alexander Ivanov, founder and director of Waves Platform, said that the law has essentially no impact on the industry due to the lack of regulatory clarity:Ivanov also noted that regulatory uncertainty is a major impediment to the development of the fast-growing industry of decentralized finance, or DeFi. “Against the backdrop of overall growth in the DeFi segment, an absence of a clear status or rules of the game for cryptocurrencies can be seen as an obstacle to the development of this industry and the Russian economy at large,” Ivanov said.Dominique Simon, global general counsel at British crypto payment processor Wirex said that the firm does not anticipate any big changes in its business. “Facilitating crypto payments is only one part of the services we provide at Wirex and disabling this feature will not discourage us from providing services to Russian customers,” Simon stated.Simon also stressed that at least some regulation is better than nothing, claiming that the DFA law is a “big step towards business certainty and security for our customers.” He said, “We remain optimistic about providing our services to Russian customers, and once there is more clarity about the licensing regime, we will do our best to navigate the new framework and continue to establish a strong presence in the Russian market.”On May 19, Wirex launched crypto purchases with fiat credit and debit cards in Russia, allowing users to buy Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) through Visa and MasterCard.Jukka Blomberg, CMO at Finland-based P2P crypto trading platform LocalBitcoins, is confident about the new law, stating, “We welcome the new legislation and see it as positive for Bitcoin and the whole cryptocurrency industry in general.” According to Blomberg, LocalBitcoins has not seen significant changes on its platform since the law was passed. “Yet the official endorsement to allow people to buy and sell cryptos certainly excites us and definitely creates new opportunities for us as well as the other players in the industry,” he said. As reported, Russia was the top market for LocalBitcoins this year as of June 2020.Despite Russia being poised to officially ban cryptocurrency payments in 2021, Binance is still planning to launch its Binance Card in the country. Gleb Kostarev, Binance’s head of operations for Russia and the CIS, announced the plans to Cointelegraph on Sept. 7.However, Kostarev said that Binance is not ready to either announce the anticipated launch date or provide any legal comment on the issue so far.Binance’s plans to launch its card amid the upcoming crypto payment ban is probably the best example of the industry’s feedback to the country’s crypto legislation in its current form. The world’s largest crypto exchange is not going to give up its plans despite the law stipulating the following:According to Kostarev, the current version of the law is “fairly neutral” and does not fully cover all aspects of cryptocurrency regulation. The adopted version of the law also “did not affect Binance's business in any way,” he said.As reported, Russia is preparing to pass another law called “On Digital Currency,” or DC, in late 2020. In contrast to the DFA law, the DC bill will purportedly provide an actual regulatory framework for using crypto in Russia. On Sept. 3, Russia’s Ministry of Finance proposed to amend the DFA law to ban all crypto transactions except through inheritance, bankruptcy and enforcement proceedings."
415,"The United States Senate rejected the new stimulus proposal on Sep.10, which did not include a new round of $1,200 checks. However, this boosts the chances of a new proposal with individual checks getting approved, and could serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin (BTC).The new proposal, dubbed a “skinny” stimulus bill, was rejected with a 52-47 Senate vote. Republican Senator Rand Paul, along with Senate Democrats, blocked the new package that did not include $300 billion for stimulus checks.Both Republicans and Democrats rallied for a new round of direct stimulus checks in recent months. When a bill without small business support and individual checks was presented, the Senate rejected it.There is a high probability that the Senate would approve a bill that includes direct payments by the month’s end. If the bill had gone through with no direct payments, it would have not had much impact on stocks, with which Bitcoin has shown a tight correlation since the March crash.In May, the data aggregation company Envestnet Yodlee found that many Americans used their stimulus checks to invest in stocks. At the time, Yodlee president Bill Parsons stated:“There’s clearly a correlation between Covid and people being reengaged with their money.”Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, similarly shared data suggesting individuals were buying Bitcoin with their checks.The percentage of Bitcoin deposits on Coinbase worth $1,200. Source: Brian ArmstrongThe percentage of deposits equal to $1,200 significantly spiked after April from 0.1% to 0.4%, by nearly four-fold.But if a revised package gets through in the future with individual checks, it could once again put buying pressure on the stock market and the price of Bitcoin.Bipartisan Policy Center executive Bill Hoagland said the Senate might consider a new proposal by the end of September. He said:“If the FEMA money is gone, you’re going to cut off even the $300 that’s being made available now. That may be the only spark I see that would energize both Republicans and Democrats to do something, maybe before the end of the month.”Economists are pushing the government to introduce another round of direct payments due to its effectiveness. Natalie Foster, the co-chair of the Economic Security Project, said direct payments are the fastest way to provide financial support. Foster told CNBC: “Direct checks are the most effective, fastest way to support American families. In the last six months, we received one $1,200 payment, which is not enough.”The Senate is unlikely to pass a proposal unless it includes individual checks and a package for small businesses. For tech stocks and the price of Bitcoin, the Senate pushing for additional direct payments could become a bullish catalyst."
416,"The amount of BTC locked in decentralized finance projects increased by more than 30% in the past week, despite falls in the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).USD’s total value locked, or TVL, can go up and down with markets, even in the absence of a change in the number of tokens locked. In the past week, the TVL dropped from its all-time high of $9.6 billion on Sept. 2 to $6.1 billion on Sept. 10 before climbing back to $7.8 billion.According to DeFi tracking platform DefiPulse, the amount of locked BTC increased from 67,038 BTC ($694 million) on Sept. 2 to the current all-time high of 87,752 BTC ($904 million), representing an increase of 30.9%. That’s an increase equivalent to 20 times the BTC locked in the Lightning Network.More than 50% (51,295 BTC) of the locked Bitcoin sits on Ethereum in WBTC, which accounted for 63% of the BTC growth since Sept. 2, locking an additional 13,000 WBTC on the network.RenVM, which also allows users to tokenize their BTC on Ethereum, holds 17,630 BTC locked, growing by more than 2,500 BTC since the start of the month.In contrast, Bitcoin’s Lightning Network accounts for only 1.2% (1,061 BTC) of the total BTC locked in DeFi. The BTC locked on the Lightning Network grew by just 4 BTC, or less than 0.02% of BTC’s total growth, so far in September.The 198 BTC added to the Lightning Network since the start of the year represents a growth of 23% and is dwarfed by WBTC’s addition of over 50,000 BTC this year, representing growth of over 8600%.Despite 600,000 Ether being removed from DeFi protocols, Bitcoin is still in a distant second place. It accounts for less than half the $2 billion USD value of Ethereum’s 5.6 million locked coins. In total, almost 5% of Ethereum’s circulating supply is now locked in DeFi."
417,"Since dropping 17.5% to a monthly low at $9,817 last week, Bitcoin (BTC) price has bounced around in what appears to be a tightening range between $9,800-$10,600. The digital asset has yet to establish a clear pattern of daily higher lows and lower highs but as mentioned by Cointelegraph contributor Rakesh Upadhyay: “The long tail on the candlesticks of the past five days shows that the bulls have been buying at lower levels but they have not been able to push the price above the top of the range at $10,625, which suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.”  Despite Bitcoin price finding soft support around $10,100, the price has been unable to hold above $10,500 and a number of analysts remain cautious as the CME gap at $9,900-$9,650 remains a threat. Earlier in the day, on-chain analyst Willy Woo shared an opposing point of view, suggesting that the CME gap will not be filled this time. BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewWoo tweeted the above chart and said: “I'd say there's a fair chance this CME gap may not get filled, so far it's been front-run for liquidity. Every dip snapped up. If so it'll be the first CME gap on daily candles that remains unfilled.”While the accuracy of the CME gap being used as a technical analysis indicator often comes under some scrutiny Bitcoin’s inability to flip the $10,500 level to support does raise concern. BTC/USDT daily chart.

BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe daily and 4-hour timeframe shows the RSI bouncing from oversold territory and pushing into the 50s but the declining purchasing volume on the 4-hour chart shows there’s still plenty of work to be done. An encouraging first step would be to see a 4-hour or daily candle close above $10,500 alongside a sustained increase in buy volume. There’s also a VPVR gap from $10,500 - $11,300 so things could heat up quickly if bulls manage to catalyze a high volume surge through $10,500.

418,"Trader and head of proprietary trading firm Factor LLC, Peter Brandt, said Bitcoin's (BTC) recent run up past $12,000 did not excite him as much as it did the rest of the market. ""I never got super super excited about the advance in Bitcoin,"" Brandt told Cointelegraph in a Sept. 9 interview. ""I thought it was constructive — the advance we had in Bitcoin starting in late July"" he said, noting the chart looked good.On July 27, Bitcoin definitively broke $10,500, a level which previously stood as a wall against the asset's attempts at rising further, based on TradingView data. By Aug. 17, the asset found itself up near $12,500 before falling back down to the $10,000 range. ""I thought that was definitely promising,"" Brandt said. ""It could have fueled something more,"" he noted, adding: When Bitcoin kept rising higher after surpassing its $10,500 resistance, much of the crypto space felt a sense of great optimism. Brandt, however, said he remained skeptical, referring Bitcoin's position near the top limit of a symmetrical triangle chart pattern as his guide.""Piercing the boundary of a symmetrical triangle really doesn't mean anything,"" he said, referencing the asset's subsequent price fall into support after failing to break out of the pattern. ""I just have a really hard time getting excited about crypto here,"" Brandt said.Although Bitcoin may not be on a rocket path toward all-time highs, Bitcoin stock-to-flow model creator, PlanB, an anonymous analyst on Twitter, recently forecasted interesting days ahead for the asset, based on his model.

419,"According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young-Ju, over-the-counter (OTC) Bitcoin (BTC) deals might be occurring in a way that is similar to the pattern seen in February 2019. According to the on-chain analyst, this is historically a bullish sign but Ki Young-Ju cautious that the pattern is not ‘absolute’ and should not be relied on in isolation.Bitcoin transferred on the blockchain network hits a yearly high. Source: CryptoQuantKi also noted that the number of Bitcoin transfers achieved a new yearly high and that these transactions didn’t come from exchanges. Based on two on-chain metrics, he explained it could be a resurgence of OTC volume. He said:“The number of BTC transferred hits the year-high, and those TXs are not from exchanges. Fund Flow Ratio of all exchanges hits the year-low. Something's happening. Possibly OTC deals. This also happened in Feb 2019, when OTC volume was skyrocketed. I think this is a strong bullish signal.”High net-worth individual buyers and miners often buy or sell Bitcoin in the OTC market. This allows BTC to exchange hands without placing significant pressure on the exchange market.Rafael Schultze-Kraft, the CTO of Glassnode, said the increase in volume is not BTC changing hands. Instead, the analyst said that the volume is flat and it represents “change BTC.” He wrote:“Bitcoin on-chain volume is NOT increasing or hitting any highs. Even by applying the most basic change-adjustments uncovers that the increase in volume is just ""obvious change"" moving back to the sender. This is not $BTC changing hands, and not real economic throughput… Just wanted to point out that this is not the case, volume is in fact flat – these are just huge amounts of change BTC.”Rather than OTC deals, it could represent internal transfers or other types of internal wallet movements. In that case, it would not necessarily be a bullish trend for Bitcoin in the near term.Change-adjusted daily transfer volume shows flat volume. Source: GlassnodeIn response, Ki explained that the trends still seem like OTC deals. He referred to the spikes in transaction volume in February 2019. After the two peaks in volume, Bitcoin eventually recovered strongly from the $4,000 area. Ki added:“The point is just the non-exchange / non-miner entities are moving their funds by evoking multiple transactions, OTC tx is just one of the possibilities.”If the spikes in Bitcoin volume are OTC deals, then it is an optimistic trend that indicates the possible start of an accumulation phase.Since miners tend to sell BTC in the OTC market, many OTC deals involve miners selling BTC and whales buying the mined BTC. Such a cycle reduces the amount of BTC that would otherwise be sold on exchanges and also decreases selling pressure.But if the rising transaction activity does not pertain to OTC deals, then it is most likely a non-event for Bitcoin."
420,"Blockchain Center has compiled data for some of the biggest Bitcoin (BTC) hodlers — from the Winklevoss twins to various scammers and hackers, and even “zombie coins”. Allegedly, the twins own 150,000 BTC, which places them between the Bitfinex hackers, who own 120,000 BTC, and the Mt. Gox trustees who lay claim to 166,000 BTC. One spot above the latter is occupied by another notable scam — the Plus Token scammers, who allegedly hold 200,000 BTC. Tim Draper supposedly holds a paltry 30,000 BTC, which he acquired in a government auction of coins seized from Silk Road.""Zombie coins” are not Bitcoins held by the undead, but rather the 1.5 million coins that are assumed to be lost forever. The approximately 1.1 million Bitcoins allegedly mined by Satoshi Nakamoto are also included in this segment.Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust is the biggest institutional Bitcoin investment vehicle and it currently holds a bit over 400,000 BTC. The Lightning Network has secured only a thousand BTC, while Ethereum (ETH) has locked up another 80,000.With another 2.5 million Bitcoin expected to be released into circulation, who knows who else could join this list in the coming decades."
421,"Bitcoin’s on-chain transfer volume grew considerably over the past month, ultimately hitting a 1-year high of 3.2 million BTC on September 9. At the same time, visible on-chain exchange activity has been dropping; only 3.6% or 115,000 BTC were transacted via trading platforms on the day.Bitcoin on-chain transfer volume.

Source: Kaiko.Most on-chain activity is registered on centralized exchanges when users deposit or withdraw funds. Thus, this trend may actually indicate that users are choosing to move their assets back and forth less often.Since the growth of Bitcoin's on-chain transfer volume is likely not caused by exchange activity, it is possible that it stems from greater adoption of the asset in the economy. The last time this metric was higher was August 21, 2020, when it appeared to spike to almost 25 million BTC. This seems to have been anomalous though, as we have no way of knowing exactly what caused it."
422,"Bitcoin bull Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano may have just persuaded Jim Cramer, the outspoken host of CNBC’s Mad Money, to invest in crypto.In a Sept. 10 tweet, Pomp claimed to have converted the man who once stated that Bitcoin (BTC) was like “Monopoly money” in a recording of his podcast, scheduled to be released on Sept. 14. His statement appears to have been confirmed by Cramer, who retweeted Pompliano immediately.Source: TwitterAnthony Pompliano is well known for a podcast in which he educates laymen and outright skeptics regarding cryptocurrency and Bitcoin. In a July appearance on the Bill Bert Podcast, he successfully convinced comedian Bill Burr to buy Bitcoin and his co-host Bert Kreischer to consider mining. On Cramer, Pomp stated that “he understands the benefit of Bitcoin better than most.”“You can always rely on Pomp to dumb it down enough for the finance guys to get it,” said Reddit user Leading_Zeros.Cramer at one point stated that the BTC price could eventually reach $1 million. However, the CNBC host was also an outspoken Bitcoin critic prior to the 2017 boom, saying that “short selling is just going to annihilate people when you can start trading it.”"
423,"The world of cryptocurrency moves at a whirlwind pace but Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey remains committed to its earliest lodestone, Bitcoin (BTC).In an interview with Reuters on Sept. 10, Dorsey, who also founded the mobile-payment platform Square, said he believes the coin’s potential still outshines later developments:“I think the internet warrants a [...] native currency and [...] Bitcoin is probably the best manifestation of that thus far. I can’t see that changing given all the people who want the same thing and build it for that potential.”Dorsey connected Bitcoin’s founding principles with the cooperative and decentralized ethos that he considers to be the driving spirit behind the web:“The internet is something that is consensus-driven and is built by everyone, and anyone can change the course of it. Bitcoin has the same patterns, it was built on the internet.”Dorsey lauded the fact that “anyone with a great idea” who wants to be part of Bitcoin can join the community — they “don’t have to be part of a company,” he said.Dorsey appeared committed to both Bitcoin and the internet in an idealized form — free from the specters of oligopoly, the excesses of corporate and government surveillance, and the stubborn asymmetries of power and capital that the advocates of decentralization must necessarily wrestle with.Consistent with this belief in the possibility for grassroots control over the cryptocurrency’s — and the internet’s — future direction, Dorsey told reporters that it’s important to focus on improving users’ experience of Bitcoin in order to foster its widespread adoption.The cryptocurrency needs to evolve to become as “intuitive” to use and as convenient as existing digital payments infrastructure, he said.  Cost- and time-efficiency, particularly when it comes to transaction processing, are another crucial hurdle to overcome, he added.Dorsey’s commitment to an ideal ethos of the internet and cryptocurrency does not imply he is blind to the gulf between ideal and reality, however.Last winter, Twitter funded a dedicated team of open source architects, engineers, and designers tasked with developing a decentralized standard for social media. Dorsey said that the goal was for Twitter to ultimately be a client of the fruits of their efforts.Outlining the challenges that Twitter faces as a centralized platform, Dorsey identified blockchain, the technology that underpins Bitcoin, as a key technological development that points to the real possibility of a viable, decentralized future.“Much work to be done, but the fundamentals are there,” he wrote."
424,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has been ranging between $9,800 and $10,500 for nearly a week after a short fall from almost $12,100 seen on Sept. 1. As BTC struggles to show any distinctive price movement, traders are generally cautious.Over the medium to long term, traders expect Bitcoin to recover and perceive the ongoing consolidation phase as a healthy pullback. From July 16 to Aug. 17, Bitcoin rose from $9,005 to $12,486 on Coinbase, with a pullback arguably necessary to neutralize the futures market.A large portion of Bitcoin’s daily volume comes from the futures market. Cryptocurrency futures exchanges use a mechanism called “funding” to achieve a balance in the Bitcoin market. The mechanism forces long contract holders to compensate short-sellers for a portion of their positions if the market is majority long, and vice versa.Typically, when the rally of Bitcoin becomes overextended, it causes the futures market to get overcrowded and funding rates to soar. In the event of a pullback, it allows funding rates to stabilize, reducing the probability of a long or short squeeze.Speaking to Cointelegraph, Dennis Vinokourov, the head of research at crypto exchange and institutional brokerage provider BeQuant, and Guy Hirsch, managing director of eToro trading and brokerage platform, revealed that Bitcoin’s medium-term outlook is positive due to various fundamental and technical factors.Following the rejection of Bitcoin at $12,000, analysts attributed many factors to the decline of BTC. As Vinokourov pointed out: “The aggressive unwind of crowded positioning related to DeFi assets” could have contributed to the decline. However, other factors like whales taking profit, miners selling off their stashes, and a major South Korean exchange Bithumb reportedly being raided by police all might have applied selling pressure on Bitcoin. Hirsch emphasized that in periods of low volatility, price drops can be intensified when fewer traders are in the market:Vinokuorov stated that the pullback could benefit Bitcoin in the months ahead, as price rejection is not a negative occurrence if the market were to calm down as a result. He also noted that the leveraged and speculative flow of traders would align after a consolidation period:Heading into the fourth quarter of 2020, analysts remain neutral or bullish on the price trend of Bitcoin, and an abundance of technical and fundamental factors could buoy the sentiment around BTC from November to December. Historically, BTC performed strongly in the last two months of the year. Most notably, BTC surged to a new all-time high in December 2017.Potential technical catalysts include the closure of Bitcoin’s monthly candle above $11,600 for the first time since 2017, and reaching the $12,000 resistance level. Albeit briefly, it marked an important breakout after dropping to as low as $3,596 on BitMEX in March 2020.Fundamental factors that could contribute to the uptrend of Bitcoin are strengthening infrastructure, rising inflation and the near-zero interest rates. A low-interest rate environment boosts the bull case of gold and potentially Bitcoin because it could lower the value of the U.S. dollar. Hirsch said:He also added that a Bitcoin breakout is possible in the near term if the perception of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation improves. Throughout the past month, public companies and institutional investors have purchased billions of dollars in Bitcoin. MicroStrategy, a company listed in the U.S. stock market, invested $250 million in BTC as the firm’s primary treasury asset.Based on the increasing demand for Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation as well as the tone around BTC set by Wall Street giants like Paul Tudor Jones, Hirsch believes another major upsurge is a possibility: “Federal Reserve’s attempt to prop up the economy might fuel investors to look more closely at Bitcoin for a number of reasons, resulting in a positive uptick for the largest digital asset.”But in the short term, technical analysts remain divided on the Bitcoin price trend, although agreeing that Bitcoin price action will slow down. A pseudonymous trader known as “Bitcoin Jack” said Bitcoin could be in a descending wedge that has a 50% chance of breaking out or down: “BTC testing the 128 DMA — historically often a level of support/resistance on trending price. Also testing HTF support — the LTF doesn’t have me convinced yet. If LTF can show strength I want more longs.”The bullish scenario for Bitcoin in the short-term would lead to a retest of the $11,000 resistance level, based on the chart above. A bearish scenario would cause another drop to the $9,000s, potentially leading BTC to the $9,650 CME gap that has not filled yet. Since Bitcoin whales often mark tops and bottoms for BTC, there is a strong possibility that BTC may drop to as low as $8,800, which was identified as a buy area by them. A pseudonymous trader recognized as “Salsa Tekila” said: “If BTC does retrace 30–45% from top like 2017 (past performance doesn’t predict future), it would take us somewhere between $6,850–$8,650.”But Hirsch said that in previous market cycles, Bitcoin rallied in early November, ahead of key holidays in Asia: “We’ve seen these rallies happen a number of times, and so I wouldn’t be surprised if a Bitcoin rally would happen this year too.” Furthermore, Vinokourov believes that Bitcoin may retest the $12,000 mark soon, since “the number of Bitcoins locked on Ethereum continued to rise even as the total amount locked across the ecosystem declined.”"
425,"Ahead of its initial public offering (IPO), Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway invested in tech-cloud company Snowflake. Buffett has largely avoided tech companies for many years, investing heavily in banks. That trend is starting to change, and it might benefit Bitcoin (BTC) in the long term.Buffett has steered away from tech due to his core philosophy of value investing. Buffett likes to evaluate businesses based on cash flow, competitive advantage, and overall stability. He previously said:“The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage. The products or services that have wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors.”Many fast-growing tech companies lack stable cash flow and a predictable rate of growth over the long term. The landscape of the tech market largely does not complement Berkshire’s investment strategy and portfolio.But in recent years, Buffett has started to invest in the tech market. Berkshire holds $117 billion worth of Apple stock and $1.7 billion of Amazon stock. Both firms are largely profitable and are dominant in their respective markets. Top holdings in Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio. Source: CNBCMost recently, Buffett has made an unprecedented move. Berkshire invested in a tech cloud company called Snowflake ahead of its IPO. Buffett historically stayed out of both tech and IPO markets, and the Snowflake deal suggests a shifting trend.Berkshire’s Snowflake deal does not carry a direct comparison with Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. But it shows that Buffett has started to consider the digitization of many major industries.In June, J Stern & Co chief investment officer Christopher Rossbach said Berkshire has to adapt to the present. He said that Berkshire would have to focus on companies that would generate substantial value in the next 25 years. He said:“If Berkshire is to have the prospects of generating the value it has in the past, it has to adapt by buying these companies that will generate significant value over the next 25 years.”Recent deals of Berkshire, like its investment in Barrick Gold and Snowflake, show the firm is positioning for long-term growth.Over time, widespread digitization of key sectors would benefit the long-term trend of Bitcoin because many investors consider it as digital gold. Cameron Winklevoss, the billionaire investor and co-founder of Gemini, said:“The total amount of above-ground gold on earth fits into an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Physical assets are easier to control, seize, and censor. Bitcoin lives everywhere and nowhere, its digital nature is one of its greatest strengths.”The long-term performance of Bitcoin.

Coincidentally, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) also soared by nearly 5% in the past 24 hours.XBT/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView.comIn the past several days, the correlation between Bitcoin and stocks has increased once again. Data from Skew shows the 1-month correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 surged from 18% to around 55%.The price of Tesla likely declined due to two main reasons. First, many investors anticipated the stock to be included in the latest S&P 500 index release. Second, the entire U.S. stock market corrected after tech stocks plunged.According to Ben Kalio, an analyst at Baird, Tesla stock fell particularly hard because its price reflected expectations of an S&P 500 inclusion. When the listing did not occur, it caused a massive sell-off. Kalio wrote:“We think shares were reflecting expectations for substantial passive inflows. We think the stock could be under pressure following the delay of S&P 500 inclusion, particularly from investors who bought ahead of the announcement expecting an opportunity to sell to passive funds.”But whether the S&P 500 snub was the primary catalyst for the stock’s short-term correction is unclear.The Nasdaq sharply corrected after warnings about a growing gap between tech stocks and fundamentals emerged. The index dropped by over 4% on September 8 when FT and WSJ reported SoftBank was the “Nasdaq whale” that pushed markets upward with a $4 billion options bet.As the U.S. stock market started to fall, Tesla stock slumped in tandem. The correction of Tesla stock was so steep that it crashed CEO Elon Musk’s net worth by $16.3 billion. Welt’s market analyst Holger Zschaepitz said:“Elon Musk’s net worth plunged $16.3bn Tue as Tesla stock crashed 21%, the largest single-day wipeout in history of BBG Billionaires Index. Zhong Shanshan added >$30bn to his fortune after shares of the bottled-water company he founded surged following an IPO.”Bitcoin likely dropped and recovered in tandem with Tesla stock because of an increase in the BTC-to-S&P 500 correlation in recent months.According to data from Skew, the correlation between Bitcoin and U.S. stocks is much higher now than the pre-pandemic era. In the last 24 hours, after the simultaneous correction and recovery of Bitcoin and tech stocks, the correlation rose steeply.The realized correlation between Bitcoin and S&P 500.

427,"Africans are increasingly turning to cryptocurrencies as a means of exchange over local fiat currencies, according to a new report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.Data from the firm shows that many locals individuals and businesses are using cryptocurrencies to avoid high fees, regulatory complications, and currency instability.The number of monthly transfers to and from Africa has passed the 600,000 mark. The total number of transfers under $10,000 jumped by 55% in the year to June to reach $316 million. Nigeria, which is the continent’s largest economy, South Africa, and Kenya lead the region in cryptocurrency transfers.Abolaji Odunjo, who runs a mobile phone retail store in Lagos, Nigeria’s largest city, started using Bitcoin to pay his Chinese suppliers. He told Reuters that he shifted to crypto for speed and convenience:Odunjo added that payment method helped him avoid high fees and was an alternative to purchasing increasingly expensive U.S. dollars. Many African countries struggle with currency devaluation and instability, which increases demand for, and consequently the cost of buying U.S. dollars. Some currencies, like South African’s Rand, have lost over 50% of their value against the U.S. dollar in the last decade.Other interviewees told Reuters that Bitcoin payments also help those who have family members living overseas in countries like the U.S. and the U.K. to send money back home.According to a post by the World Bank, fees for fiat remittance in Sub-Saharan Africa costs 8.9% on average — with South Africa recording the highest costs of up to 20% per transaction. Bitcoin fees sit drastically lower, typically sitting below 3%.The value of cryptocurrencies sent to Africa in 2020 is set to surpass the previous year’s total sent of $8 billion with almost $1 billion sent in June alone. By contrast, the World Bank reported that only $48 billion worth of fiat was sent to Sub-Saharan Africa in 2019, with the total expected to fall to $37 billion this year."
428,"Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports, is coming back to Bitcoin (BTC) after abruptly abandoning trading digital currencies when his Chainlink (LINK) investment went belly up. In a recent video, Portnoy said his “heart is crypto” and would make a return to the cryptocurrency market soon.The internet personality, who became a popular day trader after the coronavirus pandemic, entered the Bitcoin market on Aug. 14 after meeting with avid billionaire Bitcoin investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. After receiving a quick refresher on what crypto is and how to trade it, Portnoy reportedly bought a significant amount of Bitcoin and Chainlink (LINK).XBT/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView.comUnbeknownst to Portnoy, his LINK purchase was near the top of a more than 1000% rally and he was far from pleased when his position registered a loss as LINK price retraced sharply. Shortly thereafter, Portnoy announced that he was leaving the cryptocurrency market. On Aug. 22, he said, “I’m out on crypto because coins don’t always go up.” Funny enough, after a strong crypto market correction, he is now hinting at a comeback.According to Portnoy, he feels many investors in the cryptocurrency market share the same personality as himself.The outgoing entrepreneur and investor said his “heart is crypto” and will soon be back. He said:“The crypto people, just about the most enjoyable group of people I've ever met. They are f*cking crazy. They are crazy on social media, they are crazy on Twitter, they have the same f*cking personality I do, they are gamblers at heart, they slant, they laugh at themselves, they just want to make money. I will be in crypto. My heart is crypto. But I just gotta figure it out.”Since Portnoy said he is exiting the cryptocurrency market, the price of Bitcoin dropped by around 12%. Major altcoins, including Ether (ETH) and LINK, recorded even steeper falls against the U.S. dollar.LINK, which Portnoy remains enthusiastic about, declined by 21% since Aug. 22. But altcoins have seen bigger pullbacks than Bitcoin due to their strong rallies throughout the second half of 2020. LINK rose from $4.74 on Jul. 6 to as high as $19.99 on Aug. 16, recording a 325% rally.The timing of Portnoy’s message to the cryptocurrency community is intriguing because it comes after the Nasdaq saw the fastest 10% drop in history.The problem with the current landscape of the U.S. stock market is that many strategists saw the pullback coming. Tech stocks, especially, started to fall after reports that SoftBank was likely the “Nasdaq whale” that drove prices up with a gargantuan $4 billion options bet on U.S. equities.Alexis Gray, a Vanguard investment strategist, said the bull run was difficult to sustain due to the gap in market performance and global economic trends. He said:“Equities were priced to perfection. That was always going to be difficult to sustain when you have a disconnect between how markets are performing and what global economies are doing.”Nonetheless, Portnoy is soon heading back to Bitcoin and he had a few words for the cryptocurrency community. He stated:“I love you crypto, I love the LINK marines."""
429,"Peter Brandt, long-time trader and CEO of proprietary trading firm Factor LLC, recently gave his thoughts on the current crypto market, describing the price action stuck between two difficult giants. ""Bitcoin and Ethereum — those really, for me, is where the game is played,"" Brandt told Cointelegraph in a Sept. 9 interview when asked about his thoughts on Bitcoin for the days and months ahead. As the two largest market cap assets in the crypto space, BTC and ETH each hold a large following, with their actions indicative of market health and likely subsequent ripple effects, depending on their activity. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) both posted topping chart patterns prior to declining prices, Brandt described. BTC topped out near $12,500 on Aug. 17, while ETH hit its local high near $490 on Sept. 1, based on TradingView.com data. Since then, Bitcoin dropped near $9,800 before bouncing slightly, while ETH dropped down to $310, before also yielding a subsequent bounce.""Both markets have backed into very heavy support on the weekly chart,"" Brandt explained. ""What I see are markets that are kind of in between a rock and a hard place,"" Brandt said, noting various significant support and resistance levels on the charts of both assets. ""It's not surprising the market now is just kind of drifting without direction.""Ethereum's price will likely surf between $250 and $500, according to Brandt, which he acknowledged is a large range. Similarly, Bitcoin's price is likely caught between $8,900 and $12,500, he added. Other opinions on the industry's top assets vary.

430,"In an effort to increase the country's legal overwatch, Germany now says Bitcoin (BTC) ATMs require regulatory approval before they are allowed to operate.ATMs that offer assets such as Litecoin and Bitcoin now requires a license from Germany's financial regulator, BaFin, a Sept. 8 statement from the entity said. This does not appear so much as a new ruling as it does a clarification of current legal requirements. ""Those who set up such crypto machines that do not have permission from BaFin are acting illegally,"" the statement read.Cointelegraph reached out to BaFin for additional details, but received no response as of press time. This article will be updated accordingly should a response come in.The regulator also explained that property owners, businesses, etc., may be liable for Bitcoin ATM machines set up on their property if those ATMs are unlicensed, regardless of who actually owns the machines.Many nations have tightened their watch in recent months regarding cryptocurrencies, including the European Union, with its 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, also known as 5AMLD."
431,"Bitcoin (BTC) dominance has always been one of the first pieces of information displayed on cryptocurrency ranking websites like Coin360 and CoinMarketCap. Although it seems a consolidated and straightforward metric, there's an argument that the market share indicator makes less sense as time goes by.One point to note is the staggering growth of the stablecoin industry. As Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) have seen their market capitalization explode over the past year, should they also be aggregated on the same 'dominance' rankings?Regardless of the answer, crypto investors need to understand that merely looking at BTC dominance to decide whether or not to change altcoin allocations within a portfolio has become less effective.Simplicity is probably the primary reason for the popularity of the reason behind the market capitalization metric. Even investors new to the game can understand that multiplying the last trade price by the number of outstanding coins allows one to view the total market capitalization. The same rationale works for stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, and most tradable assets.The problem occurs when the amount regularly being traded is very little compared to the outstanding capital. Some of the most relevant stock indexes worldwide are based on the free float concept. This adjustment is made to avoid the distortion caused by inflated market capitalization, and it works by disregarding shares that aren't allowed to move freely. The shares or coins which cannot move freely are typically the result of lock-up periods or a shareholders agreement.In traditional markets, free float is used by the S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, CAC 40, DAX, HSI, and the FTSE-100. Therefore, each companies' market capitalization is adjusted by the percentage of shares freely available for trading.Although the information on public stock availability might be readily available due to the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, there is no similar rule for cryptocurrencies. One might easily verify how many Bitcoin has been sent to its Genesis addresses. Those coins are unspendable, but this is not the case of every cryptocurrency. As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin holdings under Grayscale investment funds are also under lock-up. GBTC and similar funds currently have no set redemption programs, meaning there is no way for an investor to take hold of the underlying BTC asset.Apart from those most straightforward cases, one can only infer how many BTC has been lost over the years. Studies have shown that up to four million Bitcoin are gone forever, including the one million attributed to Satoshi's mining.The free-float problem is even larger on forked cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Cash (BCH), for example, has one-third of its supply that has never been touched.One can argue that there hasn't been much change in untouched and lost cryptocurrencies when referring to Bitcoin and its forks. Therefore it shouldn't impact more recent BTC dominance data. Although this is true, it does not take into account the equivalent inflation of those coins.According to Messari data, in 2020 alone, there will be 20% more Ripple (XRP) in circulation. Such an increase is followed by Compound (COMP) 40%, Stellar (XLM) 17.4%, ZCash (ZEC) 15.6%, Polkadot (DOT) 13.8%, and Cosmos (ATOM) 10% growths.It is important to note that a cryptocurrency supply increase will not necessarily increase market capitalization. This effect will depend on the unitary price change for each cryptocurrency. Nevertheless, this inflationary pressure looms larger on altcoins and exerts negative pressure on Bitcoin’s dominance rateFor every DAI issued, there is a basket of other cryptocurrencies backing it. The same can be said of the ERC-20 token Wrapped BTC (WBTC), backed on a 1-to-1 basis with Bitcoin. These are a few examples of double counting that may inflate cryptocurrencies market capitalization.Reflecting on the 2017 bull run, the Bitcoin  1,318% rally might seem unthinkable, but the truth is, it didn't even make the top 10 by performance that year, led by XRP (36,018%), NEM (XEM) (29,842%), Ardor (ARDR) (16,809%), and XLM (14,441%).This initial 1,318% move may have created the myth that BTC dominance must go down during cryptocurrency rallies, and the term altcoin season was coined to reflect the perceived rally that takes place when Bitcoin’s dominance rate drops.Bitcoin USD price (blue) and dominance (red). Source: TradingViewTake notice of how BTC dominance plunged from 95% to 37% in early-2018. Back then, new ICOs were placed every month, and some exceeded valuations of $5 billion. Thereby, these newcomers inflated the altcoin market capitalization by a large sum, regardless of Bitcoin's price increase.Fast-forward two years to the recovery mid-2019 and its subsequent accumulation period, and the exact opposite trend is set. BTC dominance grew while Bitcoin price was increasing, and flattened or adjusted when the leading cryptocurrency failed to surpass the $12,000 level.BTC/USD (blue) and BTC dominance (red). Source: TradingViewBTC dominance has ceded from 70% to 60% throughout 2020, while Bitcoin rallied from $7,100 to the current $10,200 level. As mentioned earlier, countless factors are affecting the indicator.Some investors and analysts point to the whole emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) token movement as a leading factor behind the current shift in Bitcoin dominance. Stablecoin issuance has also grown immensely, reaching the $17 billion mark in 2020.Regardless of the rationale behind the recent BTC dominance drop, it is incorrect to infer a direct relationship between the indicator and bull or bear market trends. What should be noted is that the current 60% dominance rate cannot be compared side-by-side with previous years.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Source: Coin Metrics.If you look at the chart above or find other charts online that track correlations between the two assets, you will likely see something that will contradict Bloomberg’s assertion. Yet according to Bloomberg, it stands at 0.80. The caveat here, however, is that Bloomberg calculates this metric differently from many other data providers:Bloomberg analyst and author of the newsletter, Mike McGlone, further explicated the firm’s calculus:Instead of determining the correlation daily, Bloomberg calculates the interrelation of this data on a monthly basis, hence the difference.McGlone believes that the recent plunge in Bitcoin’s price was driven by the Nasdaq’s dip, concluding that if gold maintains the price level above $1,900, he expects Bitcoin to stay above $10,000.The record-high correlation between the two hedge assets can likely be explained by the fact that we are experiencing unprecedented economic upheaval in Bitcoin’s short history. The injection of trillions of fiat currencies into the global economy may be prompting investors to seek shelter in alternative assets."
434,"Celebrity and podcaster Adam Curry described the importance of Bitcoin (BTC) to podcaster and comedian Joe Rogan. He posited the asset's importance amid an internet-based world which thrives on personal data sales, banking activities, and centralized control. ""The apocalypse is coming, and you're gonna need a Bitcoin — at least one,"" Curry said in a Sept. 8 interview with Rogan. ""Are you a Bitcoin salesman, Adam Curry?"" Rogan responded, put off at first by the comment. ""I was very anti-Bitcoin, until I sold a s***load of them at like $900,"" Curry said, noting he acquired a stack of the asset in its early days. ""I got them for nothing,"" he said, adding: ""People just gave them to me in the beginning and I denied it."" He then referenced the industry's progress over the last decade, including mention of altcoins. Rogan responded, opening an age-old can-of worms. He asked Curry why BTC remains in the number one go-to position among thousands of other crypto assets, wondering if another asset will overtake the asset's spotlight. ""Ten years of data have shown that Bitcoin really is the only one that you can trust,"" Curry said, referring to the asset's resistance against manipulation and its trail-blazing technical makeup. Much talk of a flippening — a digital asset overtaking Bitcoin's market cap — has come and gone over the years, but no asset has yet achieved such a feat. "
435,"The U.S. Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, recently announced that the Fed will now shift its focus from targeting inflation to closing “unemployment shortfalls.” The Fed, in essence, is doubling-down on the same inflationary policies with which it experimented during the 2008 global financial crisis.Speaking at a virtual Jackson Hole event recently, Powell said the Fed would not raise rates anytime soon. He also said that the Fed would tolerate higher inflation, departing from the historical norm of a 2% inflation target. This cheap money and higher inflation policy take quantitative easing to an entirely new level.Related: Jerome Powell throws US dollar under a bus in Jackson HoleA Federal Reserve study on Bank of Japan practices during its 2013 economic crisis warned that higher inflation targets could result in “never-ending monetary accommodation, even when real economic activity is strong or when financial stability risks accumulate.” The Bank of Japan had introduced in March 2013 quantitative and qualitative monetary easing to stimulate the Japanese economy and increase the inflation rate.On the heels of Powell’s Jackson Hole speech, the dollar’s value fell against the euro, while gold rallied back to its 1950 highs. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) has plateaued; Ether (ETH) stabilized; and stocks have yet again rallied. The Fed won’t be able to reverse the course from its new policy so easily, however.As governments print infinite amounts of money through bailouts and quantitative easing, inflation will likely send core prices higher. Clearly, the fiat system is imperfect. The crypto media uses the threat of inflation to proclaim the benefits of cryptocurrencies. Against a backdrop of shrinking gross domestic products, economic slowdown, government bailouts and fiscal stimulus, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have been touted as an inflation-resistant hedge. The claim? You should buy Bitcoin because crypto serves as a hedge to the broken fiat system.Bitcoin, however, remains a nascent technology. In times of economic uncertainty, investors still prefer to flock to gold and stocks as safe-haven assets. In the case of gold, according to Morningstar data, the S&P GSCI Gold Index gained 7.2% in the last three months of 2018, while the stock market declined nearly 14%. Even during the most recent bear market when equities dropped by 33%, the gold index declined by only 2%. The price of gold then shot up over the next few months to record levels. Gold volatility, however, can go both ways. Almost a third of fund managers polled in the August 2020 Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey stated that they believed that gold was overvalued.From the Fidelity president filing for a new Bitcoin fund to multi-billion-dollar Bitcoin and crypto asset manager Grayscale reporting its biggest-ever quarterly inflows of almost $1 billion, institutional demand for Bitcoin has been rising amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This institutional attention showcases the seriousness with which major players have been considering Bitcoin as an investable asset.Institutional money, however, is only just beginning to enter the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and so the market is still relatively immature and fragmented. Crypto needs more time to grow before it is widely considered a safe-haven asset.Investors today use Bitcoin as a store of value because they think the prices will increase in fiat terms. Be warned: This shouldn’t be the sole intention of investing in the crypto market. If people are investing in this space because the financial system is collapsing, then we will see an unhealthy price increase followed by a collapse in the crypto index.In such a scenario, investors will flock to the industry not because of crypto technology or the deflationary nature of Bitcoin but because of fear of missing out. Those who suffer from FOMO believe that since everyone else is investing, they should be too. We saw this happen during the ICO mania of 2017 when investors primarily wanted to make money — and not invest in innovative technology.Investors and crypto enthusiasts often speak of crypto in relation to fiat currency, but it was not the intention of cryptocurrencies to be correlated in such a way. The intention was to create an alternative to fiat.Crypto enthusiasts are the new hippies of the 21st century. We are not protesting in the streets. We are building an alternative. In order to build it, we need to return to our roots and stop correlating crypto with fiat.We don’t want the crypto market to grow because the traditional monetary system failed. We want to see this market grow because investors demand choice and financial freedom.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

436,"A major suspect in a high-profile theft case related to Bitcoin (BTC) trading has pleaded guilty in a Singaporean court.Syed Mokhtar Syed Yusope, an accomplice in a $360,000 robbery, pleaded guilty in a district court to a robbery charge on Sept. 9, Singeporean news agency The Straits Times reports.Mokhtar, alongside his two accomplices, Jaromel Gee Ming Li and Mohd Abdul Rahman Mohamad, stole hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash from a Malaysian man in Singapore. Pretending to represent a Bitcoin broker, the group duped the victim into believing that they wanted to sell him Bitcoin for cash. Eventually, the criminals assaulted the Malaysian man, fleeing with a backpack with $365,000 instead of providing the promised Bitcoins.Mokhtar and Abdul were subsequently arrested by Singaporean police in early April 2018. The man reportedly spent about $80,000 on luxury goods, including a Rolex watch worth $45,800.As reported by The Straits Times, the cases involving Mokhtar’s accomplices are still pending. The man is now out on $30,000 bail and will be sentenced on Friday. Court documents reportedly did not mention whether the authorities have managed to recover the remaining part of stolen money.Cryptocurrency-related theft and fraud has been massively surging in recent years, up from $1.7 billion in 2018 to $4.4 billion in 2019. According to data from blockchain tracking and analytics platform, Whale Alert, scammers stole over $38 million worth of Bitcoin over the past four years.While global authorities are trying to combat Bitcoin-related crimes, new offences keep coming in. In early September, the United States government issued a cease and decease order against an operator of two alleged crypto scam schemes. In August 2020, authorities in Hong Kong arrested three men accused of stealing 226,000 Hong Kong dollars from Bitcoin ATMs."

438,"Recent data published by Chainalysis revealed a surprising first place for Ukraine in the Global Crypto Adoption Index 2020, followed by Russia and Venezuela.The index looks at three on-chain metrics: the total value of on-chain crypto transactions weighted by purchasing power per capita, or PPP, the value of on-chain retail transfers weighted by PPP, and the number of on-chain crypto deposits weighted by the number of internet users.The index also factors in the volume of trades made on peer-to-peer crypto exchanges weighted by both the number of internet users and PPP.The report shows uneven levels of development across the crypto sectors of many nations, with the index’s per capita weighting ranking China poorly by number of on-chain deposits and P2P trade due to its large population — dragging the country down to fourth overall despite China dominating on-chain rankings by both retail and total value.By contrast, the two top-performing nations by P2P exchange volume, Kenya and Venezuela, both rank in the top five overall despite failing to rank in the top ten by any other metric.However, the emphasis on P2P volume may overlook the establishment of local regulated exchanges as an indicator of cryptocurrency adoption and skew the results in favor of developing countries that lack a robust financial sector, likely contributing to the United States ranking below Kenya despite outperforming the African nation in three of the four criteria.Chainalysis describes Venezuela as an “excellent example” of the forces that drive cryptocurrency adoption within emerging countries, highlighting its use among ordinary Venezuelans as a means to mitigate economic instability:The report offers some unexpected insights, with Vietnam ranking second for the value of both retail and all on-chain transactions despite the local government’s early attempts to crack down on cryptocurrency.No western European nations rank among Chainalysis’ list of the top ten countries by crypto adoption."
439,"In its August 2020 volatility report, U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has predicted that September will bring excessively negative returns for Bitcoin (BTC).The report notes that historically, September is Bitcoin’s worst-performing month, with an average return of -7%. It points out that as Bitcoin has underperformed its average returns for most months of 2020, this month’s performance was likely to be even worse than usual.Despite the bearish outlook for the short-term, the report identifies some glimmers of hope, including that a record share of Bitcoin’s supply has not moved in more than 12 months — with Kraken noting that “historically, this dynamic has foreshadowed a new bull market.”The report adds that Bitcoin is likely to see aggressive fluctuations as the markets move further away from July’s local low or “suppressed pocket” for volatility:“So, history indicates that we may have ample room for higher volatility and gains in the months ahead,” the report explains.Kraken also notes that September has historically produced the weakest volatility on average, suggesting BTC may not see accelerated volatility until at least the fourth-quarter of 2020.However, Kraken’s crystal ball is not necessarily a reliable guide to future events, with the exchange recently predicting that a BTC rally of between 50% and 200% was imminent on August 10 — when Bitcoin was trading for between $11,500 and $12,000, just $500 from the local top that precipitated the recent 20% retracement.The report notes that August also saw Bitcoin’s correlation with gold push into a new all-time high of 0.97, before sharply falling back to 0.25.Bitcoin similarly produced high correlation with the S&P 500 throughout most of August. After posting a local top of 0.84, correlation between BTC and the S&P 500 crashed down to minus 0.02, suggesting that Bitcoin may be breaking away from the meta-trend of the legacy markets."

Responding to the Barstool founder's Bitcoin exit, one Twitter member said: ""How do you hold pizza with those weak hands?""To be fair, however, the trader expressed contentment in his stock trading, exiting BTC due to his lack of knowledge on the asset, paired with the lack of time he wanted to spend learning crypto trading.

441,"Bitcoin’s price decreased by $2,000 in the past few days, yet the network’s hashrate has set a new all-time high, breaking the 150 TH/s plateau for the first time in its history. Bitcoin hashrate. Source: Glassnode.Hashrate is a key indicator when determining the health of the Bitcoin (BTC) network. It represents the amount of global hashpower dedicated to mining the coin, and can also be interpreted as the amount of energy that protects the network from potential 51% attacks.Miners are some of the most important players in the Bitcoin ecosystem, and their continued allocation of resources despite the recent gyrations in price may be a positive long-term indicator. Though it should be noted that when it comes to industrial mining, business planning involves medium to long-term time horizons and typically does not get impacted by short-term price volatility.The overall economic uncertainty may be another factor that is forcing more companies and individuals to allocate resources to Bitcoin mining; an activity that is often viewed as a hedge against traditional markets."
442,"LedgerX, a regulated futures exchange in the U.S., has introduced physically-settled Bitcoin (BTC) futures contracts. This allows investors to receive physical delivery of BTC and some analysts believe this will amplify the impact on the price of BTC.XBT/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView.comWhen Bakkt first launched with the backing of its NYSE parent company ICE, it received significant hype. Most of the interest around the platform surrounded its physical delivery of BTC, meaning, if institutions desired, they could actually hold BTC via Bakkt’s custodial security service.At the time, Compound general counsel Jake Chervinsky emphasized that it could potentially affect the price of Bitcoin. He said:“Also noteworthy is the fact that Bakkt will custody & deliver real bitcoin. That means institutional inflows would reduce supply and thus (maybe) increase price too. This is different from other regulated futures markets like CME and CBOE, which only deal in cash-settled futures.”Physically-settled Bitcoin contracts could affect the BTC price because it has an actual impact on its supply. When investors trade cash-settled futures contracts, they are not buying real BTC to long the asset. This reduces the potential effect on the supply of the cryptocurrency.On LedgerX’s futures exchange, investors opening long positions in BTC can take physical delivery of the digital asset. The order book of the exchange has full transparency on market depth, enabling institutions to evaluate the market. LedgerX explained:“Investors can trade out of their position or hold to maturity and, if long, take delivery of BTC. All orders are executed on our central limit order book, with full price transparency on market depth. Negotiated block trades are also printed on the central limit order book.”An increase in the number of futures exchanges providing physically-settled Bitcoin contracts could benefit the market’s overall liquidity. Zach Dexter, the CEO of LedgerX, said:“Futures have always been a part of the company’s roadmap, and we are excited about today’s launch. Futures and options are a big part of the trading landscape and we believe it is important to have a complete suite of listed products to enhance platform liquidity and the ability to effectively hedge risk.”In recent weeks, especially after Bitcoin’s steep rejection from $12,000, the futures market has slumped. Trading volumes have declined and open interest also saw a noticeable drop, especially on retail investor-oriented platforms. Despite the short-term decline in the momentum of Bitcoin, institutional activity has steadily soared.On Sept. 2, Grayscale CEO Barry Silbert said that the firm’s assets under management had hit a record high. Of the $6.3 billion of crypto assets under management, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust accounts for $5.054 billion.As the institutional activity within the Bitcoin market grows, a diversified suite of products from various regulated firms should further strengthen the infrastructure of the market."
443,"PlanB, the man behind the widely-referenced stock-to-flow Bitcoin (BTC) value charts, described exciting times ahead for the asset.  ""We're four months after the halving, and it's about to get very interesting,"" anonymous Twitter analyst PlanB said in a Sept. 4 podcast interview with Peter McCormack. PlanB's stock-to-flow, or S2F, model has tracked Bitcoin's price activity in line with its halving events, finding rising prices following such events based on Bitcoin's decreasing inflation rate via mining. The model predicts Bitcoin hitting near $288,000 per coin by the time its next halving arrives. Although PlanB said he is tied to his S2F data, his personal opinion on the asset itself also remains very bullish. ""This is the solution, the hedge, against all this crazy debasement and quantitative easing,"" he said, referencing inflation and the current monetary actions seen by governments across the globe in response to the problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.   PlanB also described the high demand for the asset among big players. The analyst mentioned that clients of his company, which are large publicly listed businesses, have been expressing an interest in Bitcoin as of late. Bitcoin has gained noticeable attention from mainstream institutional participants looking to enter the industry following the economic turbulence caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Some parties, such as gold expert Peter Schiff, however, remain firmly against BTC."
444,"On September 7, Bitcoin Core developer Wladimir van der Laan tweeted that he may be ""done with coins"" all together. He later confirmed to Cointelegraph that he was indeed taking a break from his duties as a Core developer and one of the custodians of the project’s Github repository. One of the factors that led him to this decision was a Twitter storm that lasted for days and was caused by the renaming of a variable that specifies a list of characters that cannot appear in filenames due to operating system restrictions.Source: Bitcoin Github repository.How could something this seemingly innocuous lead to a Twitter storm, which in turn, led to a temporary departure of a developer who has been working on Bitcoin since 2014?The variable in question is a parameter which was originally named ‘FILE_CHAR_BLACKLIST’. On June 9, Github user TrentZ proposed that this should be changed it to a name which was, in his opinion, more appropriate — FILE_CHAR_BLOCKLIST. The noted motivation was that some developers could be offended by the use of ""black"" in the original filename as a way to denote a negative result, while the alternative use of ""white"" would reference a positive conclusion. There was no consensus at the time about this change, but after a while, the discussion petered out.The conversation around the use of ""Black"" and ""White"" in-reference to ""Bad"" and ""Good"" variables respectively is not unique to the blockchain community. In April 2020, the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre announced that they would begin using ""Allow"" and ""Deny"" in place of what some see as divisive language rooted in colorism. Likewise, IT giant Cisco Systems too announced that their security division would use the new naming scheme in their code.Two days ago, another Bitcoin contributor named Verretor proposed another change to this variable's name, this time changing ‘FILE_CHAR_BLOCKLIST’ to ‘FILE_CHARS_DISALLOWED’. It appears that his proposal was not motivated by positive or negative connotations, instead, he believed that the current name was ambiguous:That is when all hell broke loose as the debate that started on Github migrated over to Twitter. One side of the debate was stressing the need for the Bitcoin community to be more inclusive starting with the code, while the other side believed that this was a case of politicizing issues that are not political in nature. Another Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr explained why all previous proposals were ambiguous, and submitted his own:Blockstream CEO Adam Back told Cointelegraph that he finds the situation ironic, considering that the battle arose over a variable that appears in test code:It now seems as though a reasonable compromise has been reached. Dashjr’s proposal was never formalized, leaving us with FILE_CHARS_DISALLOWED at time of publication."
445,"If you ask people what they know about cryptocurrency, chances are you’ll hear the words Bitcoin (BTC) or blockchain — or even both. However, what many individuals aren’t aware of is that over 5,000 cryptocurrencies exist in the market today. This huge number makes things a little confusing for investors.With so many options to choose from, the task of choosing one to invest in can be challenging. At the same time, though, there are several potential opportunities for people to get scammed in the crypto space.You see, some bad actors have designed tokens in a bid to scam people out of their hard-earned money. Whether you choose to move funds transparently or privately, your first priority should be to find authentic crypto assets to invest in.In this article, we’ve compiled a list of a few precautionary techniques that can help you analyze crypto tokens — whether a utility token or asset token — properly to make a safe choice.A cryptocurrency or initial coin offering’s white paper mentions the background, strategy, goals, concerns and timeline of the blockchain-related project for successful implementation.Since white papers are supposed to be detailed, they can be very revealing. The biggest advantage here is that you can find out whether or not a company has a carefully conceived implementation plan of a company in place — something that can be very helpful for a token analysis. Hence, going through white papers can be very useful.Here’s what a white paper should answer:Start any crypto or blockchain investment decision by reading the white paper thoroughly, and check if it has any complimentary resources. This can include financial models, SWOT analysis, legal concerns as well as a roadmap for implementation. You’ll also be able to determine the suitability for mass-standardized trading of the tokens.If a company doesn’t offer a white paper, treat it as a red flag and move on to another one. At the same time, keep in mind that white papers shouldn’t be taken as the holy grail of authenticity either — it’s wholly possible for a fraudulent company to create a convincing white paper. For instance, PlexCoin managed to raise over $15 million with the help of its noteworthy white paper before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shut it down.The developers and administrative team are a crucial part of the success of any tokens project, which is why you should have an idea about the people who are backing the project. Find out whether anyone has worked on reputable projects before, or are notable members of the blockchain landscape. In addition to this, their qualifications and experience should also be important considerations.Make sure the token is backed by people who know what they are doing. This will help you move away from companies that prioritize personal profit over ethics.Seeing this loophole, scammers have started inventing fake founders and biographies for their projects. Sometimes, they may even exploit the personal identities of unaware victims for their benefit as well.Hence, the best protection against this fraudulent tactic is to do your research, and do it well. Skip tokens whose developers or founders you’re unable to find information about.Even if you do find profiles, check to see whether the activities match up with the number of followers and likes, and be attentive to other similar nuances.Finding a great token’s ICO for investment isn’t enough. Sometimes, you may not be allowed to participate because of your jurisdiction. If you do decide to go ahead in such cases, you might end up breaking the law.To avoid this, you need to make sure that regulators in your country haven’t restricted participation in such tokens. Despite the fact that ICOs are still unregulated, the good news here is that regulators are working on making friendlier rules that can lift most of these restrictions in a good number of regions.Ask yourself this question before investing in a token: What problem is this token solving, and how is it unique? Verification is crucial when it comes to token analysis, especially if you want to safeguard the security of your investment. People are becoming more aware of the looming online threats in cybersecurity, with the average cost of a data breach currently sitting at around $3.92 million. It’s the same caution that needs to be practiced when determining the utility of a token’s market value.Plus, investing in blockchain projects that solve a unique problem will also see a higher demand surge, which, in turn, will boost the tradable value of its token. So, if you invest in the ICO of such projects, you’ll be more likely to score a more secure and profitable investment.All ICOs are dependent on a token or currency system when it comes to crowdfunding facilitation. You should always take a look for token sales figures while the ICO is on, keeping a watch on its progress over time.In fact, companies and other endeavors consciously make it easy for potential investors to take a look at their system and token sale progress to establish legitimacy. Nowadays, with the growing popularity of cloud-based infrastructure business models, blockchain-as-a-service is also becoming prevalent, which should make transparency even easier.In other words, there is no reason why a company shouldn’t show you its token sales progress. A company that makes it difficult for anyone to view the progress of its ICO is highly likely to be a scam. Try to avoid such companies at all costs.Cryptocurrency has shown considerable maturity in terms of providing resilient custodial and noncustodial wallet solutions, but security is still a concern in the space. This is why we recommend working with trusted people whenever possible.You see, it isn’t possible to scrutinize every project thoroughly. So when you work with and follow trusted people in the cryptocurrency landscape, you can have greater peace of mind. These industry professionals have good knowledge about the blockchain ecosystem and can deliver sound advice as well.Cryptocurrency and ICO spaces can offer multiple opportunities for investment. The only catch is to have the ability to make sound investment decisions and have done their homework. At the same time, these spaces also have their own share of pitfalls, exposing people to scams and fraud, while even legitimate businesses with poor implementation strategies can cause severe financial loss. Try to stay away from low-liquidity instruments too.There is, of course, no guarantee that a cryptocurrency or blockchain-related startup will be successful or legitimate, but following our above guidelines can certainly help you reduce the likelihood of getting scammed.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

446,"Last week's Bitcoin (BTC) 11.4% drop might have seemed unexpected or entirely out of the norm. The truth is, the lack of a more substantial correction since the 50% drop that occurred on March 12 was the unusual part.Some analysts and investors have said that the current DeFi boom was an unmistakable sign of excessive optimism, as some newly launched tokens quickly reached $1 billion market capitalization. Yet, unlike the 2017 ICO frenzy where most projects weren't even able to launch their mainnet, most current DeFi tokens already have a working product.Regardless of each project's strengths and weaknesses, it's important to focus on broader market indicators to seek predictive signs of a potential crash.Bitcoin's realized volatility measures how large daily price fluctuations are, and a higher volatility indicates that the price can drastically change over time in either direction.This indicator might sound counterintuitive, but lower volatility periods represent a more significant risk of explosive moves. This is partially due to realized volatility being a backward-looking indicator. During quieter periods, traders tend to over-leverage, causing larger liquidations during sudden price moves.Bitcoin 3-months realized volatility. Source: SkewSkew data shows that Bitcoin's 90-day volatility was 42% on September 1, near its lowest levels since 2017. By itself, a quiet volatility period is not an indicator of an upcoming dump.Volatility does not differentiate bull and bear markets, as it exclusively gauges absolute daily oscillations. One should then focus on recent Bitcoin performance to understand current market behavior.Regardless of the market being analyzed, even 1,900% bull runs, such as the one Bitcoin pulled off in 2017, had weeks facing 5% or larger drops. There were 13 of those negative weeks during that incredible year, some early as March 5.Before last week's 11.4% downturn, Bitcoin was up 146% since March 11. Below are the top and bottom eight weeks during such a period.Bitcoin top and bottom weeks since March 11. Source: InvestingNotice how there hasn't been a single week of 5% or more downturn. That's unprecedented in Bitcoin history. This move clearly could be marked as unusual and was probably a telling sign of irrational exuberance.As an absolute figure, BTC dominance usually doesn't mean much. Some critics dislike the indicator as it weights every altcoin the same regardless of its volume. There have been bull markets during moments of BTC's dominance decreasing, whereas sometimes a rally led the Bitcoin price to move higher.Bitcoin dominance (% terms). Source: TradingViewAs per the above chart, BTC dominance dropped from 69% to 59% in less than four months. The last time Bitcoin lost so much ground to altcoins was April 2018, a full two years earlier.Take notice how the absolute 59% level could not be deemed something out of the ordinary. Despite being its lowest level in 14 months, the indicator held below 60% for most of 2018 and mid-2019.Options markets are divided into two different markets. Firstly, call (buy) options allow its buyer to buy BTC for a fixed price later. Those derivatives can either be used on neutral or bullish strategies.On the other hand, put (sell) options provide its buyer the ability to sell BTC for a fixed price, regardless of future market moves. This instrument is often used for protection strategies, signaling either neutral or bearish sentiment.Bitcoin options put/call ratio. Source: SkewThe put-call indicator will shift higher when more put options are being used, indicating bearishness. The above chart shows put (sell) options open interest near its highest level against call (buy) options.The 78% ratio seen on Sept.1 means put (sell) options open interest was 22% shy to call (buy) options. Although far from bearish terrain, the put/call indicator was nearing its highest peak levels in 12 months.Take notice how both realized volatility and BTC dominance hit their 1-year low ahead of the 11.4% downturn. These indicators’ absolute numbers weren't bearish by themselves, so investors should take pains to compare them to historical data.Calling a local top is hard, but when multiple indicators reach 1-year highs and lows, one should be prepared for significant volatility. The options put-call ratio is another example of an absolute figure sitting at a neutral or bullish position, although it was indeed alarming. As the put/call ratio neared its 1-year peak, investors should have interpreted it as a bearish signal.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

447,"Market data from Skew shows investors in the Bitcoin (BTC) options market are cautiously bearish in the short term as of Sep. 8. The shift in sentiment comes after BTC’s abrupt 17% drop in seven days.The daily chart of Bitcoin. Source: TradingView.comBitcoin fell below the $10,000 support level for the fourth consecutive day. Some analysts say that the repeated test of the same level is a bearish sign. Others say that BTC is showing resilience at an important support area.Throughout the recent pullbacks, BitMEX rarely saw long contract liquidations total above $50 million.Typically, when the price of Bitcoin falls by 5% to 15%, BitMEX tends to see liquidations above $80 to $100 million.The lackluster liquidations on major futures exchanges come from a relatively low open interest. The term open interest refers to the total amount of short and long contracts open at a certain time.The futures market data indicates that the majority of the selling pressure did not come from cascading liquidations. Rather, miners or whales taking profit on their holdings likely triggered the sharp pullback since early September.The options data could become more relevant in the short term because the futures market has been stagnating. Traders in the cryptocurrency market generally use two types of derivatives to trade Bitcoin: options and futures.Total Bitcoin option open interest.

A fair representation of consensus?”In the near term, traders are exploring three main areas: Bitcoin whale buy orders at $8,800, the $9,650 CME gap, and the $10,620 CME gap. Edward Morra, a cryptocurrency trader, explained:“CME chart has a fresh gap 10620, usually most of the gaps (~90%) are filled within few days max, with exceptions (10%) that take a long time (like your $9,6 gap from July). So, it makes sense to assume higher gap at 10620 gets filled first here and then we see how it goes.”If BTC sees a relief rally, it could achieve both CME gaps, hitting the higher gap first. But a pseudonymous trader known as “Byzantine General” says there might not be enough shorts to trigger a squeeze. He said:“People keep talking about a ""squeeze"".

Just Eat users will now be able to order food from across 15,000 restaurants in France by paying in either of these cryptocurrencies, Decrypt first reported on Sept. 7.Seemingly, the addition of crypto payments comes after the acquisition of Just Eat France by Takeaway.com, which has been accepting Bitcoin payments since 2017 for other platforms it acquired.The Just Eat France website details the payment process saying its users will have to “create a digital wallet by downloading special software or an app.” Once they have linked it to the Just Eat application, they can choose the Bitcoin payment option upon checkout that will redirect the users to the Bitpay payment portal.The price of Bitcoin will be calculated depending on its current price on Bitpay and the delivery platform will not charge any transaction fee for the cryptocurrency payments.If a user cancels an order paid for in Bitcoin, the platform will make a refund of the paid amount in euros in the user’s bank account rather than in BTC. The refund amount will not depend on the real-time price of Bitcoin, according to the website."
449,"More and more people are buying Bitcoin (BTC) since the 2020 coronavirus crash — and it doesn’t matter how rich they are, data shows.Part of a series of bullish charts circulating this week, statistician Willy Woo highlighted the growth in both high and low-value wallets.According to the data, compiled by on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode, Bitcoin whale entities — wallets controlled by a single high-worth individual — keep growing in terms of how much BTC they control.Whale numbers themselves have already hit all-time highs.“Many look at the BTC price and doubt it's a hedge. High net worth individuals and funds certainly consider it to be true and betting on that with real money,” Woo commented. “Since this latest round of USD money supply expansion, whales entities have increased their holdings of BTC markedly.”Bitcoin whale holdings vs. USD supply.

Its fixed, unalterable supply — just one of its fundamental attributes — has formed a particular point of discussion as the U.S. M2 money supply keeps growing, but velocity decreases.It’s not just whales feeling the need to bet on BTC. Smaller wallets, or “plankton” by comparison, are also showing clear growth.“Bitcoin is a fast growing country in cyberspace with a population of sovereign individuals who prefer to use BTC for storing wealth and doing transactions,” stock-to-flow price model creator PlanB summarized.He noted that Bitcoin has approximately 3 million users, making it the 134th largest country in the world, with a “monetary base” — market cap — of roughly $200 billion, ranking 21st globally.Bitcoin “plankton” holdings.

450,"A new Bitcoin (BTC) metric says that investors are still much more interested in buying than selling at $10,000.In a tweet on Sep. 7, Ki Young Ju, founder of on-chain analytics resource CryptoQuant, unveiled his latest tool for tracking Bitcoin investor sentiment.Dubbed “Potential BUY/ SELL Pressure,” the tool takes exchanges’ total BTC reserves and divides them by stablecoin reserves.The resulting number provides a rough impression of trader appetite, and it is currently skewed to the bullish side.“BTC still has intense buy pressure. Exchanges are holding more stablecoins and fewer BTC compared to the beginning of this year,” Ki tweeted. “I think we still have room for BTC bullish trend.”Ki added one proviso to the data — that exchange traders could use stablecoins to purchase cryptocurrencies other than BTC as well as hold Tether (USDT) to buy at lower prices later.Bitcoin potential buy/ sell pressure chart. Source: CryptoQuant/ TwitterThe environment on exchanges is decidedly in a state of flux with Bitcoin’s latest price action. Tether, the largest stablecoin, has passed a total market cap of $14 billion, while other recent data also suggested that buyers were looking to use stablecoin assets to snap up BTC at lower prices.That came in the form of Glassnode’s stablecoin supply ratio (SSR), which recorded a level three times stronger in late August than in June 2019, when BTC/USD traded at an identical price point — $11,400. At the same time, as Ki confirms, exchanges’ BTC reserves continue to decrease, evidence of a continued desire among investors to save, not trade or spend BTC."
451,"The recent crypto market slump has driven massive trade volumes on centralized exchanges, but peer-to-peer (P2P) trading platforms actually saw a sharp decline in activity.Latin-America was the only region to buck the trend.The top region for P2P trade, the United States, posted a 42% slump in peer-to-peer volume this week — plummeting from $23.4 million to nearly $13.6 million.Sub-Saharan African has been the second-largest region for P2P trade after North America for much of 2020. It saw P2P volume fall 32%, from roughly $12.9 million to $8.7 million — driven by a 38% crash in Nigerian activity.Trade in the Asia-Pacific also crashed by 25% this week.Latin America was the only region to post a significant increase in P2P trade volume this past week, gaining 11% to $13.2 million.43% of Latin trade took place in Venezuela this week, with the country representing two-thirds of the volume increase produced by the region. Colombia, Peru, and Chile also posted volume increases of between 10% and 20%, while Mexico and Brazil saw notable slumps in trade.Curiously, nearly all of the drop in volume was attributable to the top P2P platform Paxful, with every region on Localbitcoins (except for Sub-Saharan Africa which retraced 2%) actually seeing a weekly increase in trading.Roughly $42 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) changed hands on Localbitcoins this past week, while Paxful hosted less than $20 million in trade — down from roughly $38 million last week.By contrast, top spot exchange Coinbase hosted roughly $1.7 billion in trade over the past seven days, while Bitstamp’s weekly volume was $1.1 billion."
452,"The vast majority of Twitter users trust 18-year-old Spencer Schiff’s investment advice over that of his father, Peter Schiff — a renowned gold bug and Bitcoin (BTC) critic.“Against my advice my son just bought even more Bitcoin,” said Schiff, “Whose advice do you want to follow?”Against my advice my son @SchiffSpencer just bought even more #Bitcoin. Whose advice do you want to follow? A 57-year-old experienced investor/business owner who’s been an investment professional for over 30 years or an 18-year-old college freshman who’s never even had a job.According to a Sept. 7 tweet from Peter Schiff, 81% of over 46,000 Twitter users who replied to the poll would prefer the advice of an “18-year-old college freshman who’s never even had a job” over that of a man with more than 30 years’ experience as an investment professional. The younger Schiff was quick to respond to his father’s remarks and the survey results, stating that Crypto Twitter appeared to be backing him. Others enthusiastically showed their support for Spencer on social media.“Your son will be a multi-millionaire at least by the time he’s 57 if he keeps buying Bitcoin,” said Quantum Labs CEO Usman Majeed. However, a few thought that a father and son favoring different assets was more of an investment strategy.“Using your son to hedge your gold bet is a great idea,” said Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano. “Gold goes up, you benefit. Bitcoin goes up, your son benefits. Clever way to be long [on] both assets without publicly capitulating on gold.”Pompliano wasn’t the only commentator who reached this conclusion. “Sounds like Peter is making sure he can have it both ways depending on Bitcoin’s success or failure,” said Reddit user u/Spl00ky. “If Bitcoin fails, he’ll say: ‘See, my son should have listened to me.’ If Bitcoin succeeds, he’ll say: ‘Look how smart my son is, the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.’”The survey comes just two weeks after Schiff solicited Bitcoin donations from Twitter for his son’s 18th birthday. Although the wallet connected to Spencer Schiff currently holds no Bitcoin, it has seen transactions worth 0.11 BTC since Aug. 27."
453,"The rapid popularity and investment growth observed in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector has reflected heavily on the price charts with DeFi and yield-related tokens like Yearn.finance (YFI), Aave (LEND), and others rallying to their all-time highs in 2020. YFI alone has surged 10x since listing.In fact, most high-profile DeFi-related tokens have outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) and other altcoins by a long stretch. Even governance and infrastructure projects like Chainlink (LINK) and UMA, the latter of which became one of the largest DeFi protocols in September, were eclipsed by DeFi tokens.As so, with all eyes set on DeFi projects and smart contract platforms like Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA), a few sectors in the cryptocurrency world appear to have been left behind. Most noticeably, coss-payment platforms like XRP and Stellar (XLM). Comparison of profits and losses since December 2018. Source: CaneIsland Digital ResearchAlthough smart contract platforms like EOS have made modest gains, it has failed to keep up with competitors like Ether, which has been the epicenter of the 2020 DeFi craze (as most DeFi-related tokens are Ethereum ERC20 tokens).Among the top-10 coins by market cap XRP has been one of the worst performers in 2020, having recently lost its position as the third biggest altcoin to Tether (USDT). Ripple is currently the fourth biggest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of roughly $10.6 billion. While XRP has risen 20% since the start of 2020 it lags far behind Bitcoin and many other altcoins. In Binance’s Q2 report, the exchange revealed that XRP is the fifth worst-performing crypto on the platform.There have also been multiple public issues with the project such as the long-lasting class-action lawsuit regarding the marketing and sale of the XRP token. Ripple is also facing a copyright-related lawsuit over the use of the “PayID” brand. Most recently, Santander, one of Ripple’s key bank partners, expressed concerns when it comes to adopting One Pay FX, Ripple’s international payment network.While things look grim for XRP, there are a few positive signs for the project, such as the growth of On-Demand Liquidity which has processed over $2 billion in transactions since launch and has seen an 11x growth in the first half of 2020, when compared to the first half of 2019. There are also plans to move closer to the DeFi space with XRP partner Flare Networks announcing a project that aims to bridge the Ripple and Ethereum blockchains.Cross-border payments do not seem to be a hot topic in crypto at the moment, given the speculation around DeFi and the growth in stablecoin use. However, there are other pockets that have also failed to perform as well as DeFi or even as well as Bitcoin, including privacy coins.According to data from Messari, a digital asset data company, Bitcoin has outperformed many of the privacy coins in the market, although popular coins like Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) have seen modest gains in comparison to Bitcoin in the last 12 months, roughly 5% and 20% respectively. While DeFi-related tokens have generated accentuated gains for holders in 2020, the craze has also generated a host of clone and meme projects that are capitalizing on the hype. Some tokens in the DeFi sector have taken massive hits to their value, including the SUSHI token, whose main developer market sold a significant number of tokens in what some people believe was an exit scam. Another DeFi meme-token which made media waves recently was Hotdog. The food-themed token lost 99% of its value in the span of 5 minutes, leaving many investors holding worthless bags of hotdogs.While DeFi has been leaving other sectors in the cryptosphere behind, users should be aware that many of these new projects have very little to offer, being reminiscent of the ICO space in 2017. As so, the DeFi sector may soon follow the same footsteps, especially as the Ethereum blockchain continues to be overwhelmed. If this happens, it is likely that profits will go back to Bitcoin to fiat/stablecoins or to other sectors of crypto that have been left out of the current hype.On the other hand, DeFi has shown few signs of slowing down anytime soon, especially as high-yield automated strategies continue to be developed. In the future, it’s possible that a portion of these profits will trickle back into Bitcoin and altcoins as investors look for ‘safer’ assets to earn interest in. Thus, it might not be necessary for non-DeFi coins and networks to develop new use cases to entice investors."
454,"A decentralized exchange built on the Liquid network is opening for early access on Monday.Called TDEX, the project has announced its entry into an Open Alpha stage. It’s being built by Sevenlabs — a firm that provides consulting and white-labeling services in addition to its current work.The exchange provides a fairly unique twist to the Automated Market Makers currently dominating on-chain exchange volume. The TSWAP protocol used by the exchange focuses on ad-hoc atomic swaps, a way of conducting a trade between two counterparties without intermediaries. Unlike AMMs, there are no mathematical formulas involved that would force a particular exchange price. As Claudio Levrini, CEO of Sevenlabs, told Cointelegraph, “TDEX leaves to the liquidity provider full control on using a fixed price strategy or add external price feeds and custom trading logic.” The flipside of this is that providing liquidity on the platform is likely to be more involved than on platforms like Uniswap.Atomic swaps are often proposed as a decentralized method for exchanging assets on Bitcoin and other UTXO blockchains. While adoption has been limited so far, the Taproot and Schnorr proposals could allow simpler mechanisms through Adaptor signatures. Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, said that “TDEX is an exciting example of the increasing number of DeFi solutions emerging on Liquid — or as we like to call it, LiFi.”But the relative level of centralization on Liquid has been the subject of criticism in the past, especially in the context of introducing concepts traditionally associated with Ethereum like non-fungible tokens.Liquid is a Bitcoin sidechain that relies on a federation of “functionaries” to both ensure a peg to Bitcoin and validate the network. These functionaries are business entities tied to Bitcoin, primarily exchanges. The federation and design of the peg system present a significant point of trust in the network, as an incident in June briefly made Blockstream the sole controller of 870 BTC in network reserves.Some in the Bitcoin community often push for creating “Bitcoin DeFi” that could open the network to the world of decentralized trading and lending which, until now, has primarily been seen on Ethereum.Atomic Loans is currently among the only projects that uses native Bitcoin as collateral for borrowing, though it uses Ethereum for the rest of its logic. Other “Bitcoin DeFi” projects include MoneyOnChain, a MakerDAO analog on RSK, and now, TDEX. None of these projects are built natively on Bitcoin, primarily due to smart contract limitations. These same limitations make it difficult to create trustless bridges to the blockchain, forcing sidechains to adopt federated peg mechanisms. But demand for Bitcoin in DeFi is clearly strong, as evidenced by the success of WBTC. There is more Bitcoin locked on Ethereum than in Liquid and the Lightning Network combined. It remains to be seen if demand for DeFi on Liquid will be as strong."

456,"Last weekend was incredibly rough for most cryptocurrency investors as massive sell-offs occurred. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $10,000 several times but seems to have found short-term support at this level.The primary question for the markets is whether a relief rally is around the corner or further downside movement is expected. Let’s take a look at the charts to determine what might happen next. Crypto market daily performance snapshot. Source: Coin360BTC/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe psychological barrier at $10,000 is currently acting as support, indicating that a short-term relief bounce could be on the horizon. A clear breakdown of the $11,200 area triggered a massive sell-off across the markets.This drop led toward the primary support levels around the CME gap, where $10,000 is a significant support level as well as $9,600. As the recent market movements were volatile, multiple CME gaps can be seen on the daily chart.BTC/USD CME 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe daily chart of the CME futures on Bitcoin is now showing two CME gaps. The obvious one, between $9,650 and $9,950, is still unfilled. However, as the markets have been volatile during the weekend, a new CME gap was created above the current price. This one is between $10,450 and $10,600 and will likely also be filled in the near term.These Bitcoin futures gaps are significant because the majority of the traders are looking at them as an indicator. Since many traders eye these levels, these gaps tend to get filled most of the time.As such, they are an additional tool to define support and resistance levels, though they shouldn’t be used as the only factor when trading.

The blue box indicates a new lower low, which was needed to confirm a bullish divergence.However, the market has not shown massive strength since the bounce from below $10,000, reaching only $10,300. This bounce came back toward the support region (around the green box), where a potential higher low can now be established.The next step for a potential reversal would be a new higher high above $10,300, which will be further described in the next section.BTC/USDT 2-hour scenario chart. Source: TradingViewA very likely scenario would be a short-term relief rally. There are two possible cases in which this can occur.The first one can be seen in the chart, where the $10,000 area must hold as support, forming a bottom construction. The next step after holding the $10,000 area would then be to test $10,600 and $10,800–$11,000. However, an apparent breakthrough of $10,800–$11,000 in one go is very unlikely upon the first attempt. Crucial areas rarely break in one try. Therefore, a rejection should then be expected. The second case for forming a local bottom involves the $10,000 level failing to hold. However, the price would then only drop to the CME gap at $9,600, the second level of support. If the price of BTC bounces from the $9,600 area and then regains $10,000, an identical scenario to the one above can then be played out.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

457,"A trading venue’s liquidity represents how easily a trader can use the platform to exchange one asset for another. If a trader sends a market order to buy or sell an asset and the venue can’t find enough buy or sell orders to complete the transaction at a reasonable price, the venue is likely struggling with low liquidity — and the trader is likely to take their future business elsewhere. Venues that provide adequate liquidity and competitive market pricing tend to experience a rewarding cycle, with traders who find their liquidity needs met, returning for more transactions, which provides liquidity to other traders acting as counterparties. Liquidity can also help lessen the effects of individual transactions on an asset’s marketplace conditions. A venue struggling with low liquidity for a given asset will see a large portion of its order book eaten up by a single transaction. This means that the order will crawl higher up the order book and incur a higher average price (or a lower one for traders trying to sell).The orders left standing are less likely to accurately represent the asset’s price averaged across many venues. A venue with high liquidity, however, can withstand a flurry of quick transactions before consuming a large portion of its order book, leading to better fills and happier customers.Liquidity is essential for success, both in crypto exchanges and in far older and traditional financial markets. That’s why institutional venues such as the New York Stock Exchange often partner with in-house liquidity providers. Those providers act as market makers, playing a major role in defining an asset’s short term market value by readily providing liquidity when the buy/sell orders that traders send to them are executed.Liquidity can be a little harder to come by for venue builders in the much younger world of crypto — but that doesn’t mean venue operators are out of options. As crypto finance becomes more and more sophisticated, venue operators are finding ways to provide traders with the liquidity they crave. Three promising options are third-party market makers, cross-exchange market making and liquidity mining. Different liquidity solutions can tie up different amounts of capital and operational capacity, so there is no one-size-fits-all strategy.Related: Can a liquidity marketplace advance the crypto industry?Crypto market maker agreements essentially replicate the in-house liquidity solutions that are popular in institutional finance venues. A venue makes the agreement with an outside liquidity provider — most commonly a hedge fund. These providers usually trade in many different venues at once and can source the liquidity they need for one venue by executing trades at other venues.Unlike market takers, who are willing to pay more than they’d prefer to obtain an asset because they value holding the asset itself, market makers are willing to buy or sell any asset as long as they can capture a marginal profit by hedging their trade on another venue and maintain their desired inventory levels. To stabilize a long-term partnership, market makers and trading venues will often agree on a certain profit level that makers can expect to generate each month. If the maker’s profit falls below that amount, the venue agrees to pay the difference.Venues may add extra incentives in the agreement. For example, some makers will agree to provide loss leader pricing, which quotes the lowest price found across multiple exchanges in order to attract traders from other venues. Trading platforms also sometimes offer makers increased margin levels. Venues regularly review their market makers’ balance sheets to ensure the maker’s creditworthiness. This review process helps venues decide which accounts will be allowed to temporarily trade to negative account balances.Approved market makers can settle their obligations daily and, under some circumstances, weekly, which may mean that the trading venues’ short term liabilities will temporarily exceed the assets under their management until settlement occurs. Market makers with increased margin levels can lend out inventory and/or arbitrage for other opportunities within settlement windows to increase their returns.Market makers or exchanges that enter a formal liquidity environment may also have specific requirements when it comes to technical integration between the venue and the liquidity provider. Makers who represent a financial institution often prefer to interact with exchanges via Financial Information Exchange, or FIX API, a standardized communication protocol for financial data. This protocol is fast, efficient and optimal for co-located servers. Some less institutional traders may prefer to use a WebSocket protocol, which is mostly targeted at retail investors. This method is still viable for high-frequency trading but is often slower than FIX and can handle fewer requests per minute due to rate limit restrictions.In this strategy, traders can still turn to a market maker — but the maker is the venue operator rather than a third party. Thanks to cross-exchange transactions, the venue can source liquidity without risking significant losses.Venue operators serve as market makers at their own venues — the “maker exchange” — and simultaneously act as market takers at one or more other venues — the “taker exchange.” Those external taker exchanges — also known as source exchanges — have their own liquidity providers, who set bid and offer prices for other market participants to take. Operators on the maker exchange use those bid and offer prices to set market-making conditions at their own venue, oftentimes with a markup to the source exchange.In the example above, the venue operator will buy an asset sold on the maker exchange for $98, the lowest price available, while simultaneously selling that asset on the taker exchange for $99. Their inventory levels remain the same, and they not only haven’t lost capital but have actually made a small profit of $1. Likewise, the operator can sell an asset for the best offer they encounter on the maker exchange — $101 — while simultaneously recovering that inventory without losing any capital by repurchasing it on the taker exchange for $100. The exchange operator can continue this process repeatedly to generate revenue.Cross-exchange market making lets venue operators source liquidity without paying a third party to do it for them, but this strategy comes with capital efficiency issues. The market maker service providers we discussed in the prior section often have lines of credit at multiple venues, letting them trade on margin rather than collateralizing the full amount of asset inventory they post for each trade. A venue operator practicing cross-exchange market making without access to credit has to keep significant inventory in their taker exchanges, making it difficult to use that capital for any other profit-generating purpose or for frequently necessary rebalancing across trading venues.Market making was an important service in traditional financial venues before crypto even existed, and cross-exchange market making between different crypto venues is a logical extension of this traditional finance concept. Liquidity mining, however, is a strategy with much closer ties to crypto itself as an asset class.Cryptocurrency has gained (and continues to gain) traction because of its uniquely decentralized structure. That decentralization is deeply tied to community participation. Many blockchain protocols, for example, reward individual participants for staking coins or running nodes. When structured properly, these rewards incentivize the distribution of computing power across a wide network of independent participants, which, in turn, makes the protocol itself more decentralized and thus more resilient.Liquidity mining extends the blockchain tradition of turning to the community for decentralized support of important crypto functions. Venues that turn to liquidity mining eschew any singular market-making source whether it’s a partnership with a professional market-making firm or their own cross-exchange market-making algorithm. Instead, they distribute open-source software to any participant who wants to download it.These newly enlisted liquidity miners connect their crypto wallets and set parameters for the software to automatically execute market-making trades on participating exchanges. A pool of rewards is algorithmically generated and distributed among miners, with miners who tolerate more risk receiving greater rewards.There is no one-size-fits-all liquidity solution, and every strategy features drawbacks and inefficiencies. Liquidity mining is a theoretically promising strategy that’s now being implemented on-the-ground in a handful of crypto venues, but it still has a long way to go before it’s proven scalable for mainstream trading.Cross-exchange market making not only creates capital inefficiencies but can also drive traders away due to the venue’s conflicted interests: Though venue operators execute the strategy to provide liquidity, they do so by trading against and sometimes profiting off of exchange clients. Market-making agreements have put off some crypto enthusiasts who prefer a decentralized approach and a definitive movement away from the world of traditional finance, but for many exchange operators, these agreements are realistically by far the most effective liquidity solution, providing access to credit lines and highly liquid non-crypto venues.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Source: Coin360After a mixed performance over the weekend, $10,000 looked increasingly shaky as support, something that analysts warn could be pivotal in the short term.Discussing the current market, Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe said that the outlook hinged on two gaps in CME Group’s Bitcoin futures markets.As Cointelegraph reported, the two gaps are at $9,700 and $10,600. Van de Poppe has outlined two likely scenarios for price action, and the question is which gap Bitcoin will fill first. Press-time levels were at $9,950.“Couldn't really hold the $10,000 level (or it's dipping beneath). The second scenario would be a closing of the CME gap, after which closing of the upper CME gap is next,” he tweeted.“$9,600-9,800 could be bottom level for now.”The second scenario involves a break upwards toward $11,000 followed by a retest of levels around the lower CME gap.Bears had gained the upper hand through last week, with $12,000 swiftly giving way to 15% losses as macro changes took their toll.

Despite the weakness in BTC’s short-term trend, an on-chain analyst says mid-term bullishness is intact.The weekly chart of Bitcoin. Source: TradingView.comWithin five days, the price of Bitcoin slipped from $11,462 to $10,000, recording a 12.6% drop. Gold has also struggled to rebound from fading momentum, which coincides with the recovering U.S. dollar.According to Willy Woo, an on-chain market analyst, local on-chain indicators are turning bullish.On-chain indicators include the likes of “HODLing” activity, active addresses, network activity, and NVT ratio. The Bitcoin NVT signal, for instance, attempts to spot market peaks by evaluating the price against daily transaction value. On-chain data points likely hint at a bullish mid-term trend because of Bitcoin’s steep drop since $12,000. While the price of BTC plummeted by nearly 20% since its yearly high, network activity remains relatively stable. Woo said on Sep. 6:“Local on-chain switching bullish (looking at the next few weeks out), not calling this has bottomed, even though it may have. Playing the big swings it's not a bad time to buy back in.”Bitcoin network activity is relatively stable. Source: Blockchain.comThe level many traders are observing is the $9,650 CME gap. A gap between the CME Bitcoin futures market and other exchanges form when CME closes during the weekend. The $9,650 gap has been present since July.Regarding questions on the gap and the likelihood of BTC dropping to it, Woo said it might get front ran. He noted:“I also wonder about the gap being front run, to fill longs with solid liquidity. Whales on derivative exchanges have enough dominance to make that so.”One concern in the near term is that the NVT ratio is still hovering at 81.5. When the NVT ratio stayed above 70, in previous market cycles, it marked a local top. The Bitcoin NVT Ratio. Source: Woobull.comMany on-chain indicators show an optimistic mid-term trend, but some suggest shaky short-term momentum.As Cointelegraph previously reported, traders do not expect a March-like 50% drop in the price of Bitcoin.Su Zhu, the CEO of Three Arrows Capital, emphasized that the probability of Bitcoin declining to $5,000 is now less likely than BTC surging to $100,00. He wrote:“I am actually flabbergasted by the strength shown at 10k and prob means 100k is more likely than 5k at this stage.”There is an abundance of whale buy-orders at $8,800 on Bitfinex. Since whales tend to bid the lowest support levels to ensure liquidity, a drop to the high-$8,000 levels is a possibility. But a black swan market plunge at this period, where BTC was able to defend $10,000 for a long time, is unlikely."
460,"Bitcoin (BTC) continues to test $10,000 support after a weekend in which it consolidated after a major drop — what next?Cointelegraph takes a look at the major factors set to influence BTC price action in the coming week. The end of last week saw big changes for BTC/USD, with the pair shedding over 15% from $12,050 to bounce at $9,900.The weekend failed to trigger a significant bounce, with $9,900 seeing several more tests before Bitcoin drifted back into five figures.What changed on Friday was one macro factor — the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY), which began rising after hitting two-year lows. DXY measures USD against a basket of U.S. trading partner currencies. A week previously, an inflation announcement from the Federal Reserve had a bearish impact on the index, but last week saw a reversal in its fortunes — at the expense of safe havens.At publication time on Sep. 7, DXY was at 92.95, having risen as high as 93.25 over the weekend. For RT host Max Keiser, fresh losses need to appear for Bitcoin to gain — the inverse correlation between the cryptocurrency and DXY should continue.“We need the DXY to drop through 80 to get the real fireworks going in #Bitcoin and Gold,” he tweeted. Keiser added that developments in the ongoing Brexit saga could also prove a positive influence for BTC next month. Should the European Union adopt a hardline stance with the United Kingdom, the euro could benefit and pressure DXY.“Hopefully the EU cuts (the U.K.) off in October, freeing the Euro to trade higher. This will help Bitcoin a lot,” he wrote.U.S. dollar currency index 5-day chart. Source: TradingViewOn the topic of geopolitics, multiple events this week may serve to steer markets, with Bitcoin reacting in step. In addition to preparations for Brexit talks failing, the EU will eye economic policy as the European Central Bank (ECB) meets to discuss its options.As Cointelegraph noted, deflation has returned to the ECB’s sphere of influence for the first time since 2016. Now, the focus will turn to whether copying the U.S. approach is suitable for the eurozone.As Bloomberg reported on Monday, the overall global recovery from the March coronavirus crash, once robust, is now fizzling.“High-frequency data paints a picture of a rapid rebound in the second quarter, and a stall - with activity still well short of pre-virus levels - in the third,” the publication’s chief economist, Tom Orlik, commented.To return to “pre-virus normality,” he added, all that would work is a coronavirus vaccine.This weekend delivered on a classic Bitcoin price trigger which could see short-term upside reenter the picture.On Friday, CME Group’s Bitcoin futures closed trading at $10,615 but reopened again at $10,430. The resulting “gap” in the market provides likely room for an uptick from current levels of $10,100 — if Bitcoin follows historical behavioral patterns, the void should not last long.The original dip below $10,000 gave rise to hopes that the only gap disobeying the rule — at $9,700 — would get filled. For Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe, $10,000 must disintegrate to make that possible.“Holding $10,000 should warrant a short-term relief bounce towards the $10,800-10,900 area,” he told Twitter followers on Sunday. “Breaking $10,000 and the market goes for the CME gap in one-go and we'll see mid $9K's.”CME Bitcoin futures chart showing the latest gap.

If they can propel the price above the downtrend line, it will increase the possibility that the bottom might be in place.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

462,"Not unlike many other jurisdictions around the world, Russia has come to recognize the potential benefits and risks flowing from cryptocurrencies by taking its first step to define and codify digital assets.The new Russian legislation dubbed “On Digital Financial Assets” sets a clear direction for the treatment of cryptocurrencies by authorities and how both individuals and businesses can handle them in everyday practice.Nevertheless, the new legislation may give pause to payments companies and fintech companies keen on expanding into the Russian market. While the approach of the Russian legislature toward cryptocurrencies — or digital assets, as they are defined under the new law — bears many similarities to the approach taken by United Kingdom regulators toward crypto assets, the clear prohibition of the use of digital assets as a means of payment draws a strong distinction between the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, and the Russian Duma.First and foremost, the long-awaited new bill on digital financial assets, or DFAs, defines the term “digital assets” and their use. According to a translation by TASS, a major Russian news agency, the bill defines them as: digital rights, an aggregate of electronic data comprising money claims, negotiable securities, and rights to participate in the equity of a non-public company with shares.The bill also provides a non-exhaustive list of permissible use cases for DFAs, clarifying that they can be bought and sold, inherited, or exchanged for other digital rights. But the possibilities are not endless; it has been made very clear that digital currency cannot be used or advertised as a means of payment for goods or services, nor does it constitute any form of Russian currency or any other foreign currency.Even though limited, the new legislation legitimizes digital asset trading and exchange and sets out a skeleton of a regulatory framework for digital asset issuers and exchanges, both included in the bill under the umbrella term of “digital asset operators,” while traders and holders fall into a separate category of “investors.”Regardless of the scope of permitted use for DFAs, the new law represents a giant leap toward crypto adoption in Russia, as the State Duma, in previous iterations of the bill, had contemplated a much less crypto-friendly tone and even criminalization of crypto activity.The new legislation brings Russia in line with the position of U.K. tax authorities on crypto taxation matters, taking the view that digital assets are considered property in the eyes of the law and are thus taxable on an individual and commercial level.A similar approach was taken by the English courts in the case of AA v. Persons Unknown, where it was held that crypto assets, such as Bitcoin (BTC), are categorized as property for the purposes of the law. Additionally, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs collects capital gains taxes on personal crypto investments and income tax in the case of crypto trading in a commercial context.For the time being, it is unclear whether the Russian legislature will follow the same model.While the two regulators agree on the approach to taxation and treatment of digital assets as property, when taking a closer look at the FCA’s definition of crypto assets, the two perspectives begin to diverge.The FCA defines “cryptoassets” as:This definition is further narrowed down to a threefold classification of e-money tokens, security tokens and unregulated tokens.The last category, unregulated tokens, encompasses all cryptocurrencies used as a medium of exchange, something that Russia has now expressly prohibited. The FCA refers to this category as unregulated, and it remains true to this terminology, as it does not lay down a regulatory framework, licensing scheme or other regime of compliance for a business or individual to engage in the exchange of cryptocurrency for goods or services. Even though the FCA previously issued warnings about notorious unregulated token OneCoin, it has since removed its warning, citing a lack of authority to regulate crypto assets as influencing the decision to remove it.That said, the Bank of England, the U.K.’s central bank, makes it abundantly clear that crypto assets (unregulated exchange tokens) are not currency. This is also evident by the departure in the FCA’s terminology from “cryptocurrency” to the now commonly used “cryptoassets.”This approach calls for a clear distinction between the classification of digital assets as currency and allowing their circulation as a means of exchange for goods and services. While payment is a function traditionally reserved for, and associated with, national traditional currencies, such as the Russian ruble or British pound, it should not be assumed that allowing cryptocurrency to fulfill such a function automatically equates it to a traditional currency, nor does it automatically endanger traditional currency.This is a crucial distinction, as traditional currency has many other characteristics and performs macroeconomic functions reaching far beyond a means of exchange. Traditional currencies impact the ebb and flow of our entire economic system, with any change or addition to the system sure to cause unpredictable disruption. The FCA and other U.K. institutions carefully navigate this line. While they do not limit the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of exchange and payment, they refrain from equating crypto to traditional currency.Consequently, it is worth examining why regulators are so reluctant to consider digital assets a currency. Aside from the ideological and cultural aspects against such a classification, the economics behind defining cryptocurrencies as legal currency leaves much to be desired.The current design of most cryptocurrencies accounts for a fixed eventual total supply, which in the macroeconomic sense carries a danger of deflation in wages and in goods and services. In turn, the lack of ability to manipulate money supply in response to market demand could lead to price volatility more problematic than that of an unregulated currency itself.The role of the central bank in adjusting monetary policy has proven especially important in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, with direct government financing to fund stimulus packages and government expenditure in response to the health crisis. Great examples are seen with direct monetary injections, such as in the case of the United States Federal Reserve, or through quantitative easing, such as in the case of the Bank of England.However, the printing of money has often been criticized for its potential to result in inflation or hyperinflation. In simple terms, this means the devaluation of money in response to an increased monetary supply. However, in the case of COVID-19, it seems that in combination with relevant safeguards, it has proven to be a very valuable tool in times of crisis, even if the long-term repercussions are still unclear.The distinction between traditional currencies and crypto also lies in the fundamental concepts they represent. In contrast to traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies do not function on the basis of a liability of the state toward the individual, but their meaning can be boiled down to a consensus between participants more akin to a barter system.The economics of crypto as a currency are definitely far from “figured out,” which in itself justifies caution before declaring it a type of currency and equating it to traditional money. Nevertheless, economic analysis does not suggest complete elimination of the circulation of cryptocurrencies as a means of exchange.Despite the (much more than expected) crypto-friendly tone, the new Russian crypto bill remains very cautious toward many of the original ideals behind cryptocurrency. One of the key features of cryptocurrency is the removal of a central monetary authority, replacing it with a distributed ledger to achieve the system’s own checks and balances. Since the emergence of cryptocurrency, this concept has culminated in the decentralized finance movement.DeFi is a movement aimed at creating financial networks and providing traditional financial instruments without the involvement of a central authority. It achieves this by using a decentralized, open-source network to account for the functions traditionally ensured by a central bank. While many DeFi protocols have emerged since the popularization of cryptocurrencies, they have a universal aim of removing intermediaries from everyday banking and financial instruments while ensuring trust and security on the network.While the new Russian bill takes a big step toward crypto adoption, it makes it clear that those engaging in digital asset investments will be subject to close control and scrutiny by the Central Bank of Russia as the central authority. Digital asset operators, as defined in the bill, will be approved and registered by the Bank of Russia and all DFA transactions within their control will be carried out on a framework of “special information systems” that are also subject to central bank approval and verification.Both the operators and investors will only be allowed to handle crypto operations subject to declaring their possession, acquisition and transfer. The Bank of Russia will also reserve the right to qualify central DFAs as accessible only to certain qualified categories of investors.The key distinction between the Russian and U.K. approaches does not lie in whether cryptocurrencies can or will become a replacement for traditional currencies but in the fact that the U.K. recognizes their potential function as a complementary, improved feature of our monetary systems. As reported by the U.K.’s Cryptoassets Taskforce in its 2018 final report, small scale FCA testing proved that as a means of exchange, cryptocurrencies can offer improvements in speed and cost of monetary transfers, especially in the cross-border context. The Russian legislature fails to recognize such potential and entirely rejects one of cryptocurrencies’ key and original functions.For U.K.-based crypto businesses, or crypto operators, seeking to provide services on the Russian market, this means significant expenditure on legal opinion to navigate what is shaping up to be a complex regulatory framework, as well as uncertainty on acquiring requisite approvals from the Bank of Russia.Further, they will face the task of tailoring their services to ensure they remain within the definition of legalized crypto activity, whether this means disabling certain features or more creative technical solutions to ensure the limited use in line with the new Russian legislation. The more evolved businesses could even consider the development of liability protections from investors who use their platforms and fail to conform to the new limitations.As far as the regulatory framework goes, the current bill merely serves as an indication of what is to come in terms of practical regulatory challenges. In its autumn session, the State Duma is due to release another piece of legislation, dubbed “On Digital Currency,” with more details regarding the regulation of DFA operators, investors and systems, and their relationship with the central bank, providing further clarity for crypto enthusiasts in Russia.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
463,"The markets are bleeding out. Ether (ETH) dropped from $500 to $300 in a matter of days, people are screaming that the DeFi bubble has burst already, and are crying about their favorite “[insert food name] coin” crashing in value after a one-month-old Twitter account rug pulled 38K ETH from investors.Yes, it’s just another week in crypto, but did anyone else notice that Tron (TRX) was pumping amidst all this?Might just be a coincidence, but the last time this happened so quickly the entire crypto market bled out in the long, cold crypto winter.Daily cryptocurrency market snapshot, Sep. 4. Source: Coin360.comBTC/USD 4-HOUR chart. Source: TradingViewBitcoin has shed 21% of its dollar value after dropping from $12,500 to sub $10K levels in just two weeks, leaving the popularized “Bart” pattern staring us in the face.But when the leading digital cryptocurrency by market capitalization makes such a dramatic move, it pulls (for the most part) every other crypto asset down with it.The top of this particular chapter in the history of Bitcoin was about $12,500, with many now questioning where the bottom could lie. So in this week’s analysis, I will look at three potential scenarios of how to identify the bottom.BTC1! CME 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewMost seasoned Bitcoin traders are aware of the CME gap, for those yet to be exposed to this sorcery let me explain. Bitcoin is a 24/7 tradable asset. The CME, however, is only actually open 23 hours per day, beginning Sunday evening at 5∶00 pm Central Time and ending at 4∶00 pm CT Friday afternoon.This means there are windows where gaps can occur, typically these occur on weekends when the market closes on a Friday and reopens on a Sunday evening. However, traders can still trade the asset 24/7 using what the CME refers to on their website as the following:“Rule 526, and EFRPs (Exchange for Related Position), pursuant to Rule 538, may be negotiated/executed 24/7 and must be submitted for clearing during the appropriate clearing session.”This means that orders can still be placed when the market is closed as far as the charts are concerned, which means orders can get left unfilled, and this is where the gap comes in.The most recent gap occurred on Aug.13. This was a Thursday, so when the CME closed for one hour when Bitcoin was trading at $11,715, it reopened at a price of $11,765. This $50 move is what created the gap. So as Bitcoin rose to $12,635 on the CME chart, there may have been orders left unfilled from $11,715.As the price fell past the gap price on Aug. 19, 2020, the gap is then considered “filled” and one can only assume that orders left behind at this level were then filled.However, the price of Bitcoin has continued to bleed out, and we have printed a new local bottom of $9,905 on the CME chart, which is now just $240 shy of filling a gap left on July 24.This is where it gets rather opaque. The gap range on July 24 is between $9,665 and $9,925, leaving the question of whether the gap must still be filled? Or whether the gap partially filled.As the wick entered the gap range, it did not reach $9,965, thus not closing the gap entirely. Does this mean there are still orders waiting to be filled at $9,665?We don’t know, and this leaves some speculators believing the gap has been filled, and another camp believing it is yet to be filled.BTC/USD 1-week chart Source: TradingViewMoving aside from the CME magic, technical traders are already eyeing up $7K areas as support. One analyst @officiallykeith (*ahem* that’s me btw) tweeted on Sep. 4: “Losing the .618 on the weekly of $7033 I will maybe realize my dream of owning nothing.”Shortly after the same levels were echoed by popular trader Scott Melker (@scottmelker), who said:“Point to remember - from here, a retrace to the low $7000s would still be considered ""healthy,"" hitting a 61.8% golden pocket retracement before heading to new highs. That would actually be considered ""normal"" after the move from the March lows. Would scare everyone.”Whilst the prospect of hitting the 0.618 Fibonacci level might frighten many people, the more seasoned Bitcoin hodlers amongst us such as @Davincij15 were quick to assure crypto twitter that this is all part of the game. He noted:“9 1/2 years ago...I got #bitcoin at $1 and kept buying up to $32, then watched it drop to $2! Also watched bounce between $5 and $7 for 2 years.Still held, still bought, still here, still strong!”A reminder to us all that neither hodling nor trading Bitcoin is going to be easy, but to date, it has seldom been wise to bet against Bitcoin. As such we now have two potential bottoms in sight, $9,665 or around $7,100.However, there is a third less-conventional indicator that might hold the answer...TRX/ETH 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewSo let's talk about Tron for a second. My last 10x trade of the 2017 bull market actually happened at the beginning of 2018, and that was on TRX.We all know what happened after January 2018. The crypto bear market was thrust upon us, and altcoins started heading toward zero. But what is interesting about Tron and, in particular, its chart history, is that whenever Tron prints a candle with a wick near enough the same size as the candle itself, strange things happen to the crypto space as a whole.This isn’t immediately noticeable on TRX/USDT charts, as Tron started life as an ETH pairing. So when you look at the TRX/ETH chart on the weekly, you start to see a pattern clearer than the Bart we are looking at on today's BTC chart.The first time we saw this type of longtail pump candle, the bear market started. The second time it happened was the week commencing Jan. 7, 2019, followed by a longtail dump candle on Feb. 4, 2019 — the exact period that Bitcoin found its bottom around $3,300.So here we are again, the Aug. 30 weekly candle is a green long-tail candle on Tron and the markets are all going to pot. So maybe, just maybe, the bottom will be signaled when Tron prints another candle with a wick equal to the size of its body again.If Bitcoin fails to hold the CME gap support of $9,665, I’ll be looking at the weekly Fibonacci levels for support. These lie at the following levels: the 0.382 at $9,190, followed by the 0.5 fib at $8,168, with the absolute safe correction level being 0.618 around $7,146.Losing the 0.618 would pretty much signal that we’ve had our bull market, now it’s time to keep an eye on the Trondicator.The CME gap effect is very real. I have witnessed first hand an immediate price correction after the CME gap has filled. As such, since the gap has partially filled, we may have already seen the bottom. The first bullish sign would be closing above the 0.236, which is around $10,454. Should BTC hold this level, then I expect the bull market to resume.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of @officiallykeith and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

464,"Two Electrum software wallet users have recently reported the loss of large sums of Bitcoin (BTC). One victim described the disappearance of 1,400 BTC, totaling $14,595,000 at press time, while another claimed 36.5 BTC, worth $380,512, as stolen. The events appear connected to a long-standing phishing scam affecting Electrum users since 2018. “Users need to be careful when dealing with their own keys, particularly when they are holding the keys to a wallet with a large amount of cryptocurrency as it makes them attractive to hackers,” Jason Lau, the chief operating officer of crypto exchange OKCoin, told Cointelegraph in response to the 1,400-BTC hack, adding:Initial news of a phishing scam impacting the Electrum wallet first hit headlines on Dec. 27, 2018, with nearly $1 million reported stolen. “The hacker setup a whole bunch of malicious servers,” said a Reddit user publicizing the hack.Essentially, the hacker led users to a malicious webpage via the servers, prompting them to input private data, which, in turn, submitted control of their assets to the nefarious party behind the scheme. The scam also involved a fake wallet update that downloaded malware onto the victims’ devices, a separate Reddit post detailed.At the time of Cointelegraph reporting in December 2018, the wallet address associated with the scam held 243 BTC. Viewing the address today reveals that 637.44 BTC visited and exited the now-empty wallet.In the months after the Electrum phishing effort went public, wallet difficulties have continued, including a separate denial-of-service attack that looked very similar to the mentioned 2018 phishing con, also leading victims astray with phony software updates.In recent weeks, two additional Electrum wallet users have reported their Bitcoin holdings as stolen. One of the wallet users reportedly suffered a 1,400 BTC loss. “I had 1,400 BTC in a wallet that I had not accessed since 2017,” the victim said in an Aug. 30, 2020, post on GitHub, adding:Blockchain tracking by Cointelegraph staff showed a likely link between the 1,400 BTC thief, or thieves, and a Binance exchange account, according to a specific transaction ID. The transaction ID, however, involved more than 75 different wallet addresses, a Binance representative told Cointelegraph.The representative also stated difficulties and gray areas associated with tracking and pegging transactions to foul play due to the nature of crypto and the many parties transacting on a daily basis. “It should not be assumed that flows into a malicious cluster are from an individual/group associated with the campaign, especially if it is a cluster used for receiving funds directly from victims,” the representative added.Referring to Cointelegraph’s initial reporting on the stolen 1,400 BTC, the representative said: “The account that is the centerpiece for this article was reviewed and no suspicious indicators were found.” Previous Cointelegraph reporting also tracked some of the stolen BTC to Russia, although potential VPN usage voided any definitive conclusion.“Binance address is upstream of scammer, probably just another victim,” Electrum’s Twitter account posted on Sept. 1 in response to Cointelegraph’s reporting. The tweet also posited the attack as correlated to the 2018 phishing con, adding: “No need to involve Russian Hackers.”Shortly after the 1,400-BTC robbery went public, another GitHubber responded to the discussion thread with a similar case they suffered two months prior, as a malicious actor reportedly looted 36.5 BTC from the wallet. Known as Cryptbtcaly on GitHub, the victim tracked the stolen funds to five separate addresses after the heist. “Some of the stolen Bitcoin went to Binance, but they ignore my appeals and do not return,” Cryptbtcaly said on GitHub.One controversial point in the recent Electrum hacks was that victims were storing large amounts of funds on a software wallet. A guide from online educational source BitDegree noted software wallets carry the risk of malware and keylogging attacks: “They aren’t as secure as hardware wallets, but they are more convenient to use. This makes them perfect for day to day spending but not ideal for storing large sums of money for a long period of time.”Related: Ledger CTO discusses wallet’s safety after multiple security setbacksGeneral industry best practices often steer users toward hardware wallets, such as those provided by Ledger or Trezor. Both companies recently also faced various challenges, although hardware wallets still seemingly appear as the preferred method of crypto storage, all things considered."

The Winklevoss Brothers say that the coin will reach $500,000 and maybe even $600,000 if governments start to include it in their currency reserves.

466,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to sub-$10,000 across major exchanges again on Sep. 5, marking two consecutive days of testing the crucial level. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum’s Ether (ETH), fell by nearly 10%.The daily chart of Bitcoin. Source: TradingView.comThree factors likely contributed to the abrupt drop of Bitcoin include miners, a strong dollar and whales taking profits. When the price of Bitcoin suddenly dropped by 5% to $9,975 on Binance, BitMEX liquidations were below $40 million. Typically, when a massive price movement occurs, it causes over $100 million worth of futures contracts to get wiped out.The futures data suggests that the selling pressure came from the spot market. While possible, there is a low probability that retail investors began to dump aggressively at above $10,500. Whales taking profit at $10,500, which has historically served as a multi-year resistance level for Bitcoin, is more likely. But whales have been taking profit since Bitcoin achieved $12,000. As Cointelegraph previously reported, a whale sold at $12,000 after “HODLing” BTC for over two years. Throughout the week, on-chain data provider CryptoQuant said that mining pools had been taking profits. Ki Young-Ju, the firm’s CEO, said:“Miners send a certain amount of BTC to exchanges periodically, so they already have a large amount of BTC in the exchange. Whenever they decided to sell, it seems they move a relatively significant amount of BTCs to other wallets, and some of them are going to exchanges.”The gradual sell-off of BTC by miners since mid-August could have built significant selling pressure on Bitcoin. However, Poolin vice president Alejandro De La Torre emphasized that it is challenging to accurately track miner outflows. He noted:“I can reassure you that CryptoQuant does NOT know which wallets are owned by Poolin. perhaps it's a handful of (big) miners they are tracking... even still, many assumptions.”A common theme throughout the past two weeks — as Bitcoin consolidated — was the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The USD began to show signs of recovery after four months of downside while the euro began to slump.Since both Bitcoin and gold are valued mostly by the U.S. dollar, and many BTC traders are based in the United States, the increasing value of the dollar contributed to BTC’s weakening momentum.Important technical levels for ETH/USD. Source: TradingView.comFurthermore, the substantial decline in the price of ETH could have amplified the downtrend. On Sep. 5, ETH dropped below $360, to as low as sub-$340. A well-known trader known as “Byzantine General” said if ETH falls below $360, $290 is the next likely target. He said:“I've learned that this is an ‘ascending, right angled, broadening formation.’ Very typical after an uptrend, and a pretty neutral pattern: 55% of the times breaks out upwards. But man, 360 better hold or otherwise we go straight to 290, possibly 250.”Ether front-ran the Bitcoin rally since early April and the weakness in ETH could have intensified the short-term drop of BTC. But Bitcoin has since recovered, stabilizing above $10,200. The trend demonstrates decent buying demand above $10,000, which could result in longer consolidation.Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said the move could be bullish for BTC, noting:“Finally, liquidity at the lows taken. Reclaim of $10,000 would mean a S/R flip and a very probable chance we'll look for liquidity above the range highs. That would suit a bounce towards $10,750-10,900 and majority of the markets bounce 25-40%.”"
467,"With online payments company Wirecard undergoing insolvency proceedings this month, mainstream financial services like VISA, PayPal, and Mastercard are rushing to fill the digital payments void, and be one of the first to offer crypto payment cards, stated experts in the crypto industry.During an interview with Cointelegraph, Jerry Chan, CEO of blockchain service provider TAAL, and Rod Hsu, President & Co-Founder of virtual currency platform Coincurve, both agreed that the competition could be just what the industry needs to shift the way that digital currencies are being used as a method of payment or technology.But Chan goes beyond the need for mainstream crypto awareness and points out blockchain can make payment services even more efficient:“Payment technology is actually already quite efficient. (…) The cost of credit cards is on fraud prevention and insurance, and this cost is borne by the merchants and their banks.  Blockchain platforms that are transparent, immutable, and do not support coin mixing or hiding technologies like Bitcoin SV can largely eliminate fraud, thereby reducing this cost to merchants.”CoinCurve’s Hsu said that the current payment ecosystem involves various roles in the process. This includes clearinghouses, banks, or intermediary payment service providers and it increases the fees and efficiency of settlement:“Blockchain is a ubiquitous and global public ledger. Therefore, sending digital currencies across the table or around the world, settlements go directly onto the chain with no intermediaries keeping fees low with an almost real-time settlement visible on this public ledger.”Whether the use of Bitcoin (BTC) can be considered as a method of payment or technology, rather than a store of value to its survival or not, Hsu says that store of value can only go as far as being speculative without the property of serving as a medium of exchange. He also adds:“This means if we are to see Bitcoin as a global currency, adoption of Bitcoin as a payment instrument is vital as it must fundamentally serve the purpose as a medium of exchange.”TAAL's CEO thinks that the lesson from Wirecard's case for the crypto industry is that financial regulations ""are in place to protect the public from exactly these sorts of massive frauds and public consumer losses.""On the other hand, Hsu summarizes that the crypto sector should learn about “transparency” after the Wirecard’s case, and adds that blockchain is, again, an immutable and open technology to fully audit the flow of funds “at any point in time.”"
468,"Two-sided marketplaces are more than a smart business model. These platforms can democratize access and promote widespread economic inclusion in previously inaccessible markets. They have worked wonders in myriad verticals already — e.g., stock exchanges — and the world of digital asset liquidity may now be fertile ground for this business model.Successful new platforms bring together buyers and sellers who would otherwise be unable to connect, creating entirely new value streams for sellers who capture more revenue. Meanwhile, buyers gain access to new capabilities, creating a win-win for everyone involved. A CoreSight research indicated that revenue of two-sided markets such as Airbnb, Fiverr, eBay and Uber could exceed $40 billion by 2022.Google’s AdSense is a great example of how a two-sided marketplace can create an entirely new source of value for buyers and sellers. Its solution benefiting both publishers and advertisers has helped accelerate the growth of a new business category and built an industry-leading business. The Google Ads advertising service collected $134.8 billion in 2019 (including AdSense as well as Google’s other advertising products). Over 11 million websites have become AdSense users (sellers). Google has generated new sources of demand for advertising inventory on high-traffic websites by making ad space accessible to legions of smaller advertisers (buyers), leading to higher bids, more ads and higher ad sales.AdSense made it possible for websites of all sizes to monetize their audiences by easily selling ad space. On top of that, AdWords helped small businesses needing an easy way to advertise to gain fast access to a previously inaccessible world. What had once required a team of media buyers and big budgets for TV, radio or print promotion was suddenly achievable via a few clicks and affordable pricing.The creators of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) founded their creations in large part on a philosophy of financial empowerment. Bitcoin’s genesis as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system was designed to enable consumers to pay each other directly, accurately and securely via a blockchain’s immutable audit trail.Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, probably didn’t foresee that in a little more than a decade, Bitcoin would achieve over a $200-billion market cap. Satoshi probably also wouldn’t have predicted the appearance of countless new cryptocurrencies, which have been accompanied by hundreds of digital asset exchanges worldwide where investors could trade digital assets.As new exchanges have sprouted up around the globe — each built in a disconnected silo — market fragmentation has increased exponentially. Ironically, this market fragmentation has prevented liquidity aggregation even as the overall market capitalization has grown. As a result, exchanges today face deep challenges in guaranteeing price/time priority of orders, reasonable spreads and transaction speed. This liquidity bottleneck is a drag on digital asset trading growth.Markets must necessarily mature and reach critical mass before a two-sided platform can arrive on the scene. Crypto trading today has arrived at this juncture: With more exchanges and more traders, the demand for liquidity has continued to grow.I believe that a two-sided market-making platform will be the solution to this problem. Crypto exchanges depend on market makers to commit to buying and selling at pre-chosen prices. These orders add liquidity to the exchange, benefiting an exchange’s clients. Meanwhile, the liquidity providers (aka market makers) must have the means to commit the required trading volume and capital. Their reward can be high, as market makers have the opportunity to capture the difference, or the spread, between their lower-priced buy and higher-priced sell orders.Market makers not only require capital but also need technology and trading expertise to inform automated trading algorithms. While market making could potentially be an attractive use of capital for smaller players, they are shut out because they either lack the capital, trading volume, or expertise to participate.Just like AdSense, a two-sided market-making marketplace platform would enable traders, big and small, to commit digital assets to specific exchanges and trading pairs (like publishers in the AdSense model dedicating ad inventory). Meanwhile, exchanges “bid” on this trading volume with fees paid to market makers (like advertisers in Adsense). While market making has traditionally been the domain of full-time, well-capitalized professional traders, an AdSense-like two-sided marketplace can expand that domain to include skilled traders of virtually all shapes and sizes.What if a platform could enable savvy retail investors to serve as crypto market makers by connecting them with digital asset exchanges and/or asset pairs that need more liquidity? A well-designed two-sided platform can empower retail investors to diversify and participate in a vital market function previously unavailable to them.In the future, a two-sided platform could enable exchanges and asset issuers to list their market-making opportunities on the platform, along with the corresponding maker rewards. Retail investors could place funds into a market-making account, allocate it to a participating digital asset exchange, and select their preferred trading pairs, such as BTC/USD.As each exchange’s liquidity increases, their clients will enjoy better price discovery, trade execution and higher fill rates. Better execution may even help exchanges attract more institutional investors, creating a virtuous cycle of market growth.Turning an investor or a trader into a market maker may seem like a tall order, but a well-designed, two-sided marketplace makes it quite feasible. It isn’t far-fetched to suggest that such an efficient platform can spark one giant leap forward for the digital asset ecosystem.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
469,"Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway substantially cut their position on Wells Fargo, selling 100 million shares. The Oracle of Omaha is continuing to trim his position in bank stocks, buoying the bull case for gold and Bitcoin (BTC).Berkshire reportedly held $32 billion in equity in Wells Fargo at one point, Fox Business reported on Sep. 5. The investment conglomerate now owns 3.3% in equity of the lender, worth just $3.36 billion.Throughout his career, Buffett emphasized the importance of value investing and cash flow. The investor typically prefers businesses with predictable and stable operations that result in consistent profitability.In July, Wells Fargo posted a $2.4 billion loss, recording its first loss since the 2008 housing crisis. Following the disappointing quarterly report, the company said it would cut its dividend to 10 cents per share.This month, Moody’s cut its rating from stable to negative, citing the slow process to overhaul its governance. Allen Tischler, a Moody’s analyst said:“The outlook change reflects Wells Fargo’s slower-than-anticipated pace in resolving its legacy governance, oversight, compliance, and operational risk management deficiencies. The slow pace weighs on its expense base, further undermining its earnings potential against the backdrop of challenging operating conditions.”The confluence of the quarterly loss, the dividend cut, and the downgraded outlook likely led Buffett to trim his position.But the persistent theme in Berkshire’s portfolio reshuffle in recent months is its investment in Barrick Gold. While decreasing its exposure to the U.S. banking sector, Buffett invested in gold and Japanese trading companies.The decision shows that Buffett is seeking safety in terms of cash flow and a hedge against inflation. The Barrick Gold investment fuels the bull case of Bitcoin because the perception of BTC as a store of value is improving, especially given the tight correlation between the two since the March 2020 crash.Bitcoin vs gold price. Source: SkewOther notable investors, including the Winklevoss twins, believe Bitcoin as “digital gold” would compete against gold over the long term. Specifically, its immense upside potential makes it an attractive investment since BTC market capitalization is still roughly only 1.5% of gold. Cameron Winkelvoss, the co-founder of Gemini, said Bitcoin already made significant ground on gold. He said:“Bitcoin has made significant ground on gold — going from white paper to over $200 billion in market capitalization in under a decade. It will continue to cannibalize gold dramatically over the next decade.”As Cointelegraph Markets reported last Monday, Wall Street veteran and host of the Keiser Report, Max Keiser, believes Buffett exiting the dollar is a bullish signal for the price of gold and Bitcoin. “Buffett’s move into Japan, along with his gold investment, confirms he’s getting out of USD bigly,” he said. “Bitcoin - Gold - Silver Will all make new ATH in the near term.”"
470,"Digital asset markets were on a parabolic surge until investor confidence took a major hit to close out the week with a bearish tilt due to a perfect storm of negativity.Before reading the rundown, catch up on the most-read stories centered around the price of Bitcoin, the macroeconomic picture and the DeFi phenomenon gaining traction.

As this occurred, many tokens tied to DeFi platforms corrected sharply, most notably, SushiSwap (SUSHI) which lost nearly 40 percent of its value.  Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source: Coin360The correction in traditional markets appears to have influenced Bitcoin’s (BTC) more than 10 percent drop before a small bounce back to the $10.3-$10.4K range. Technology stocks that led US equities to record highs this summer reversed sharply this week, sending the Nasdaq Composite index tumbling almost five percent in its biggest fall since June. Apple’s shares lost eight percent — wiping more than $150 billion from the iPhone maker’s value — while Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft all fell more than four percent. As a result, the VIX index jumped above the 30-point mark for the first time since mid-July, and the equivalent volatility index for the Nasdaq shot up to more than 40 points — nearly double its mid-August low.Historically, the VIX has only surged into the 30s a handful of times in the past and almost always leads to a significant retracement.It is a reminder that crowded trades bring a lot of volatility when someone begins to unwind their positions. Digital asset traders are more than aware of such dynamics and while the bulls may be feeling particularly salty about the reversal of fortunes, the pull-back offers an opportunity to rebuild.The futures curve also flattened aggressively as leverage buyers were the first ones to look for cover, and there are plenty of opportunities in the options market to take advantage of market mispricing.Ethereum transactions soared to multiple new all-time highs for the second time in three weeks and Uniswap V2: Router 2 is now the lead contributor to gas usage, according to Etherscan.

Source: Defi PulseThe fact that it was toppled by none other than a DeFi platform speaks a lot for the recent growth of the industry and, as it stands, over $9.34 billion is locked across various platforms. Currently, Aave, Maker and Uniswap constitute about $1.5 billion TVL each. On the one hand, DeFi is a high risk, high reward market, but so is trading small-cap (pink sheet) stocks. Both clearly have a market, and always will among those with an appetite for risk.The ongoing focus on DeFi and the recent hyperactivity on Ethereum has resulted in sky-high congestion and gas fees. This led Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin to point out several solutions through rollups and sharding.ZK-Rollups are a zero-knowledge proof technique that helps rollup or batch many transactions into a single transaction, and therefore, helps reduce congestion on the Ethereum blockchain. Less congestion means lower fees.Optimistic and ZK roll ups can increase capacity from ~15 tx/sec to ~3000 tx/sec by doing most of the transaction processing on layer 2. Sharding, on the other hand, increases the capacity of the base layer by ~100x. This could lead to a 100x decrease in fees, though realistically in the long term it would not decrease quite as much because the demand for Ethereum is also likely to increase.The only solution to high transaction fees is scaling and Tether, Gitcoin and other apps are doing the right thing by migrating to ZK rollups. A positive development is that Tether is now planning to add support for another Layer-2 scaling solution (ZK-Rollups).Disclaimer.

Yesterday's 11% drop move caused more liquidations than May 9 when BTC plunged 12.5% to $8,600.BTC futures open interest in USD terms. Source: SkewSkew data shows total open interest down by $653 million, reaching $4 billion on Sept. 3. That figure includes perpetual (inverse swaps) and futures with set expiry on OKEx, CME, Binance, and remaining derivatives exchanges.Yesterday’s move was the largest daily drop since the horrendous $1 billion cascading liquidation on March 13 caused a 50% drop in Bitcoin price. That same day marked the worst sell-off of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1987, a 10% drop.The drastic correction might not have been such a record negative for stock markets, but the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 5%, led by Apple (AAPL -8%), Salesforce (CRM -7.8%), and Microsoft (MSF -6.2%).Apple (AAPL) shares slid 8% on Sept. 3, causing its market capitalization to recede by $180 billion. This was the most extensive daily loss for a single company. By comparison, currently Bitcoin’s market capitalization stands at $194 billion.The iPhone maker is currently valued at slightly over $2 trillion. Such an impressive figure could acquire the entire altcoin market, paying a 1.300% premium to the current $140 billion altcoin market capitalization.Futures markets tend to trade at a slight premium to regular spot exchanges. This is not something exclusive of cryptocurrencies markets, but rather a derivatives effect. By postponing the financial settlement for a trade, sellers usually demand more money.This futures contracts premium indicator is known as basis and it usually ranges between a 5% to 15% annualized rate. Whenever the premium is positive, the market is characterized as in contango. On the other hand, a zero to negative future contracts premium is unusual and indicates bearish sentiment.BTC 3-month futures annualized basis. Source: SkewThe above chart shows how significant yesterday's brief sub-$10K drop was on futures markets. Such a negative premium situation, known as backwardation, was last seen four months ago on May 10. Back then, Bitcoin (BTC) quickly recovered over the following three days, causing the basis indicator to regain positive territory.The current 4% annualized basis can't be deemed bearish, although undeniably not bullish as the 10% level from three days ago.Bitcoin option markets are also susceptible to significant price changes. Similar to the futures market, the recent BTC dip caused major risk aversion movements. Market makers often increase spreads during periods of volatility, thus, what happens on the following day is most telling.The 25% delta skew indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options side-by-side. The indicator will turn negative when put options premium is higher than similar-risk call options. Such negative skew translates to a higher cost of downside protection, indicating bullishness.The opposite holds when market makers are bearish, causing the 25% delta skew indicator to gain positive ground.BTC options 25% delta skew. Source: SkewAlthough numbers are different depending on how far those options expiry is, short-term ones usually display a more considerable impact. Yesterday's sharp Bitcoin (BTC) drop caused the 1-month 25% delta skew to rise above 10%. As the above chart shows, ranges from -10% (slightly bullish) to +10% (somewhat bearish) are usual.It seems premature to conclude that options markets are displaying bearish sentiment, especially when analyzing longer-term options. Nevertheless, large traders and market makers seem to be risk-averse right now, at least for pricing downside protection options.Despite the Bitcoin futures open interest drop, it's aggregate notional value of $4 billion remains higher than two or three months ago. The same can be said by the current futures 4% premium (basis), which is far from bearish backwardation levels.One should keep in mind that cryptocurrencies markets are incredibly volatile, and negative stock market swings also impact investors. No further evidence is needed after the two most largest BTC futures liquidation events happening on the exact same day of historical stock market crashes.Those events prove that even uncorrelated markets may eventually reach peaks and valleys at similar times regardless of their different drivers. The current global macroeconomic scenario seems to be the most dominant force driving risk assets, including Bitcoin.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

472,"In his college-aged days, Chris Maurice, the CEO of African crypto exchange Yellow Card, said he put his life savings into Bitcoin (BTC), finding it stolen shortly after. ""Bitcoin was about $200 at the time, and I decided basically I was just going to dump my entire savings account into into it,"" Maurice told Cointelegraph in an interview. Maurice said he had approximately $5,000 in his savings back then, with which he bought roughly 21 BTC.""I was holding it all on LocalBitcoins, because that was the wallet that I used at the time and I didn't really know any better,"" Maurice said, mentioning a popular platform used for over-the-counter, or OTC, Bitcoin transactions. ""You would think I would have done a little bit more research before just dumping my life savings into something,"" he added jokingly.Common industry practice warns users against holding much of their crypto storage on custodial exchanges and online wallets, as those options pose greater security risks while giving users less control over their assets. Using two-factor authentication, or 2FA, on these types of accounts is likewise seen as a must for personal security, though Maurice admitted he failed to do this as well.""Somebody got in and took all of it, except for 0.8 [BTC],"" Maurice said. ""That 0.8 Bitcoin I held on to until it started spiking and then sold it 16 days before it spiked up from like $1,700 to like $6,000 or whatever,"" he added, referencing Bitcoin's historic year when the asset ultimately rose from less than $1,000, all the way up to almost $20,000.

Following the dip, the sentiment around the cryptocurrency market has become noticeably cautious with the Cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index flashing “fear” for the first time since July.A massive Bitcoin buy order at $8,800 on Bitfinex. Source: Cole GarnerHowever, market data shows that whales are preparing to purchase Bitcoin at $8,800 support level. It indicates that a March 13-like drop is unlikely to happen, when BTC dropped to as low as $3,600.Analysts primarily attribute the correction of Bitcoin to the sell-off from miners. Prior to the drop, analytics firm CryptoQuant pointed out that mining pools were moving to sell BTC. After tracking the outflows from major pools, data showed that miners moved unusually large amounts of Bitcoin to exchanges. Shortly thereafter, the price of Bitcoin began to drop, eventually declining to sub-$10,000. The researchers said:“Miners are moving unusually large amounts of #BTC since yesterday. #Poolin, #Slush, #HaoBTC have taken the bitcoins out of the mining wallets and sent some to the exchange.”When the trend of Bitcoin initially shifts, it tends to extend to the furthest support or resistance level. On March 13, as an example, BTC flash-crashed to as low as $3,600 before a significant bounce. From April to September, Bitcoin recovered from $3,600 to over $12,000.As such, whales might be expecting Bitcoin to drop to lower support levels, which include $8,800.“Nice to see you again Bitfinex whale,” on-chain analyst Cole Garner commented today. “Smart money has their bids sitting at $8800. I expect the bottom will likely be around there.” The data could indicate that whales anticipate a larger pullback to come in the near future. But it also shows that whales do not anticipate a massive correction relative to Bitcoin’s previous pullbacks.Since March, the price of Bitcoin has rallied 247%, therefore, a correction was likely not a surprise to many traders. As reported earlier today, Raoul Pal, the CEO of Global Macro Investor, said 25%-40% pullbacks in a bull market are typical for Bitcoin. He noted:“In the post-Halving bull cycles, bitcoin can often correct 25% (even 40% + in 2017), throwing off the short-term traders (or giving swing traders a shot at the short side). Each of those was a buying opportunity.  DCA opportunity ahead?”Whale data provider Whalemap said many so-called “HODLers” panic sold Bitcoin as it dropped. The rapid pullback of BTC might have caught investors off guard, given the intensity of the drop. Whalemap said:“A lot of panic selling yesterday from HODLers who were quite successful in buying tops. Their strategy seems to be - buy high sell low.”Yesterday’s correction was a combination of whales taking profit and investors panic-selling, and that could increase the chances of lower volatility in the near term.A map of whales selling and buying BTC.

Expecting a period of consolidation, Van de Poppe said that this drop in the markets may not be the end of the current “altseason.” He said:“In my opinion, we're close to a bottom formation on $BTC in these regions confluent with the CME gap. Trade the bounces actively as a HL has to construct for confirmation of support. Crazy altseason continues coming months.”"

478,"British multinational security company BAE Systems and the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, have published a report revealing how cybercriminals launder cryptocurrency. According to the study Follow the Money money laundering cases via crypto are still relatively small compared to the huge volumes of cash laundered through traditional methods like wire transfers.But there are some notable examples and the report goes in-depth into the money laundering methods employed by Lazarus Group, a well-known hacking gang sponsored by the North Korean regime.Lazarus typically steals the crypto funds from an exchange and then starts to pass transactions through different multiple exchanges using something called a “layering technique.”The hackers employ East Asian facilitators who receive a portion of the stolen funds for helping launder the funds. These facilitators transfer crypto across numerous addresses they own to “obfuscate the origin of the funds,” said the study.“Facilitators move a portion of the received funds through newly added bank accounts that are linked to their exchange account – this enables the conversion from cryptocurrency into fiat currency. Other stolen funds might be transferred in Bitcoin into prepaid gift cards, which can be used at other exchanges to purchase additional Bitcoin.”Cointelegraph recently reported that Lazarus was reportedly attacking crypto and blockchain talent through major professional social network, LinkedIn."
479,"An aggressive week of selling has seen the price Bitcoin (BTC) fall below $10,000 for the first time since late-July, triggering fear in the markets.After posting a local top of roughly $12,500 on August 17, BTC consolidated between $11,250 and $12,100. However, the last three days have seen sellers reject $12,000 and take over the market. Roughly four hours ago, Bitcoin briefly changed hands for $9,990 after seven weeks of price action above $10,000.BTC/USDT on Binance, 1-hour chart : TradingViewDespite buyers quickly pushing prices back into five-figures, many traders are anticipating that prices will drop further to tag the most recent ‘CME gap’ at $9,700.The fabled ‘CME gap’ occurs when the markets make an aggressive move outside of the trading hours that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s Bitcoin futures markets are trading, resulting in a price gap on the charts — with the most recent gap appearing after Bitcoin’s sudden spike above $10,000 in mid-August.CME’s BTC futures, 4-hour chart : TradingViewThe gap is then ‘filled’ if the charts retrace to retest the price area that is missing from the CME’s chart, fuelling predictions that the markets are destined to retest the $9,700 zone.However, not all are convinced that the CME gap is behind the latest crypto crash, with some analysts attributing the dip to high correlation between Bitcoin and the legacy markets — with the tech sector having led a 4% crash in the S&P 500 earlier today:i hate how correlated crypto is to stonks these days

that's one of the reasons why i left stonks in the first place! https://t.co/uXmBCoyxTtOthers speculate that Ethereum’s (ETH) eye watering gas fees have popped the DeFi bubble, resulting in the retracement.

480,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC), the S&P 500 index and gold all fell simultaneously on Sept. 3. Sentiment around the markets remains cautiously negative after the drop.Two factors likely triggered the abrupt decline of Bitcoin by over 8% on the day. First, miners sold off unusually large amounts of BTC in a short period. Second, the U.S. dollar index has started to recover from a key multi-year support area.BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView.comAnalysts also attribute the fall of gold to the rising U.S. dollar. The European Central Bank’s warning against the surging euro caused investors to become cautious about the euro. The change in investor confidence further fueled the dollar, contributing to gold’s slump.The decline of the S&P 500 could have been coincidental, as the drop comes after a strong sell-off from big tech companies.The sentiment around Bitcoin after the big fall remains mixed. Some investors say that BTC will likely stabilize above $10,500 and see a bullish continuation.Others hinted at the possibility of a medium-term top, considering the intensity of the pullback at a key area. A pseudonymous trader known as “DonAlt” said:“There is a real possibility we’re putting in a mid-term top here. Reclaim mid $11,500 until week-end and I’ll call that idea void but until then I think this structure would make a splendid looking top.”The sharp drop of Bitcoin from $12,000 to sub-$10,500 shows that $12,000 to $12,500 is a strong resistance range and that BTC is at risk of a head-and-shoulders pattern on higher time frames.Technically, the drop of Bitcoin from $11,462 to $10,460 within a single 24-hour span raises the chances of a deeper pullback. This is because BTC retraced 31 days of gain with a single daily candle.Speaking to Cointelegraph, eToro crypto asset analyst Simon Peters said that the bullish market structure remains intact. Thus, until BTC declines below $10,000, technicals suggest a massive correction is unlikely. Peters said:“Held as a support throughout August, the $11,300 level has now been broken, and bitcoin may still have a long way to fall. We can now expect a retest of $10,000 as a new bottom, which might also coincide with the 200 Daily EMA (Exponential Moving Average). From a technical point of view, that could bolster price action and prevent the price from falling further.”The recent months have been the longest period Bitcoin has stayed above $10,000 since 2017. Another variable that could prevent a further downtrend is buyers from the sidelines entering the market in the $10,000 area.According to Peters, one silver lining is that the recent pullback could tempt buyers in the near term. There is a substantial amount of capital on the sidelines, especially in the stablecoin market.“There are a number of potential causes for the sell-off – chief amongst which is a dump from miners. If there is a silver lining, it is this – that a drop back down to $10,000 could very well tempt some bulls who have been sitting on the sidelines to at last invest in bitcoin.”"
481,"""I’m begging my crypto friends to get involved in the stock market,"" Portnoy, also known as Davey Day Trader, said in a Sept. 2 tweet. ""Bitcoin is stuck in the mud,"" he explained, adding:Included in the tweet, Portnoy posted a scene from the movie ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" — the scene in which the main character, Steve Rogers, outsmarts his military team, pulling the pin on a flag pole to reach the flag instead of climbing the large pole.In true comedic Portnoy fashion, the sports media founder edited his smirking face onto the main character from the scene while also labeling the failing teammates as Link Marines, a group known for their fanfare around Chainlink's popular asset.Portnoy's tune toward crypto has been quite temperamental in recent weeks. He first said he knew little of Bitcoin and its related asset class. An educational meeting with crypto exchange co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss followed, leading to Portnoy allocating hundreds of thousands of dollars to crypto trading. He subsequently exited the industry after losing a small portion of his money. "
482,"A judge in the Seoul Central District Court dismissed two claims filed by individuals against the controversial crypto exchange, Bithumb. The individuals were seeking $126,000 and $38,000 respectively for damages related to a data breach incident back in 2017.According to Fn News, plaintiffs Hong and Seo (both named only by their surname) stated that they had lost money due to a phishing attack using private data that was extracted in a hack of Bithumb. The third claimant, Jang, was granted $5,000 to cover his total loss. This amount reflects a much lower dollar value than his initial $27,200 claim.In all three cases, the court said that the exchange was guilty of negligence, as they could have allocated more resources in terms of security to prevent the massive data breach incident.The judge, however, found both Bithumb and Jang partially responsible, noting that the victim provided details that were not originally included in the data which was exfiltrated from the exchange.In order to enact the attack, the cybercriminal impersonated a Bithumb customer center agent, providing Jang information that he believed only a Bithumb employee would have.The hacker then told Jang that he had a suspicious login attempt on his account and needed a verification code sent to his phone number to help block the suspicious access. Once access was given, the threat actor proceeded to convert XRP and ETH held by Jang into fiat.The court resolution comes shortly after South Korean police raided Bithumb’s offices on September 2.The raid was conducted by the intelligence crime unit at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency. It was purportedly connected with an ongoing police investigation involving Lee Jung Hoon, chairman of the board at Bithumb Korea and Bithumb Holdings."
483,"In September’s crypto outlook newsletter, Bloomberg’s analyst Mike McGlone observed that the price of Bitcoin (BTC) could either be heading to the $500,000 mark, or it could fail. McGlone has continued to reiterate that in his view, Bitcoin is set to become digital gold. He emphasized once again how Bitcoin’s limited supply and increasing demand were key adoption indicators, and drew comparisons to the 2017 bull run:The estimates that the analyst refers to are likely based on assumptions that Bitcoin’s market capitalization will eventually reach parity with gold’s $9 trillion. Dividing that number by the maximum supply of Bitcoin of 21 million produces $428,571. A similar sentiment was recently voiced by The Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano.Zero to five hundred thousand provide a pretty good margin of error, unlikely Bloomberg will be proven wrong anytime soon."
484,"During a virtual conference hosted by the Brookings Institute, Andrew Bailey, Bank of England’s (BoE) governor, stressed that crypto assets are just “unsuited to the world of payments.” In prepared remarks on the future of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, Bailey qualified Bitcoin (BTC) as an asset that has “no connection at all to money.” Also, he showed reluctant himself to believe crypto assets are a proper investment opportunity, because “their value can fluctuate quite, widely, unsurprisingly.”Bailey provided such comments while talking about the picking up in the pace of innovation in payments. However, on the stablecoins, the governor commented that it could offer some “useful benefits,” such as reducing frictions in payments, but he warned:""If stablecoins are to be widely used as a means of payment, they must have equivalent standards to those that are in place today for other forms of payment types and the forms of money transferred through them.""The speech also highlighted that some stablecoins proposals don’t include a legal claim for crypto holders, as the governor believes stablecoins “need to offer coin-holders a robust claim, with supporting mechanisms and protections to ensure they can be redeemed at any time 1-to-1 into fiat currency.” The governor added that the starting point for the discussion of a global stablecoin should be based on single currencies but he didn’t necessarily rule out that the idea of a multi-currency stablecoin. Bailey said:""A global stablecoin is a cross-border phenomenon. It can be operated in one jurisdiction, denominated in another’s currency, and used by consumers in a third. The regulatory response must match this. […] Global issues require a global response, particularly for multi-currency stablecoins intended for cross-border transactions.""In June, United Kingdom-based blockchain firm L3COS submitted a proposal to the Bank of England, or BoE, for a blockchain-based operating system to power a central bank-issued digital currency, or CBDC.Also, in March, the BoE published an in-depth discussion paper devoted to CBDCs, which analyzed the rapidly changing payments landscape and the potential role for CBDCs to support the bank’s task of managing monetary and financial stability."
485,"The current state of blockchain innovation in the United States is a tale of two asset classes. On one hand, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s reluctance to embrace or endorse blockchain-based securities has ground the innovation in that sector to a crawl. On the other hand, regulators in the banking, money transmission and commodities spaces have demonstrated a willingness to work with blockchain companies to permit the offering of assets and asset classes in those spaces. As a result, non-securities blockchain-based assets and businesses have proliferated in recent years.Years after the initial coin offering craze, the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, continue to be reluctant to embrace these asset classes. FINRA has approved only a few of the many crypto broker-dealer applications it has received. Despite retail demand and myriad bids, the SEC has yet to approve a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, citing concerns about market manipulation while sustaining enforcement efforts to enjoin the distribution of tokens it considers securities, including in the Telegram and Kik cases.As a result, activity in the blockchain-based securities space remains limited. For example, on July 10, 2019, the SEC qualified Blockstack’s offering of Stacks (STX) tokens under Tier 2 of Regulation A. However, for U.S. purchasers, as of August 2020, there is no authorized exchange or alternative trading system, or ATS, where investors can actually buy, sell or trade the tokens. Or consider tZERO, which operates an ATS that facilitates trading of security tokens. While tZERO obtained SEC approval to offer trading of certain assets to non-accredited investors, as of August 2020, tZERO lists very few tokens for trading.In contrast, non-securities blockchain assets and businesses have proliferated in 2020. U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Coinbase and Gemini, have added new assets. The tokens with the largest global market capitalizations and trading volume are non-security tokens. Bitcoin (BTC) alone has a market capitalization of over $200 billion. Following next are Ether (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Tether (USDT), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and others — all non-securities. The relative clarity and flexibility of U.S. regulatory pathways in this space have attracted the bulk of the industry’s innovation.To be sure, the creation, sale and trading of non-security tokens in the U.S. are not without regulatory complexity. Companies working with these digital assets must comply with various Anti-Money Laundering and counter-terrorist financing obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act. Money service businesses, such as exchanges and wallet custodians, must register with not only the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network but also many of the states in which they operate. More than half of the states now have some form of licensing for businesses dealing with digital currencies.In addition, the Uniform Law Commission issued the Uniform Regulation of Virtual-Currency Businesses Act based on the assumption that predictable regulations tailored to virtual-currency businesses will provide them with assurances that states are regulating them like other financial service providers.The international Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, has published its own recommendations on how digital asset issuers and trading platforms should combat money laundering. Thus, blockchain businesses in the non-securities space have their own maze of regulations to navigate, although governing regulatory authorities have demonstrated greater willingness to work toward solutions.Indeed, some of these authorities have even shown enthusiasm for blockchain technology. Of particular note, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or OCC — an independent bureau within the Treasury Department that charters, regulates and supervises national banks — is currently headed by acting comptroller Brian Brooks, the former chief legal officer of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. Many see Brooks as eager to establish the OCC as a leader in cryptocurrency regulation. The OCC recently announced that national banks may provide cryptocurrency services, and in May, Brooks put forward the concept of exploring a national payments charter for crypto firms.Not to be left out, U.S. states have competed to establish themselves as blockchain innovation hubs. For example, the New York Department of Financial Services, or New York DFS, has rapidly responded to innovations by licensing technology-based money transmitters under New York’s money transmitter law and digital currency exchanges under New York’s financial services law. In addition to granting a digital currency license to numerous companies under the New York Bitlicense, Gemini and Paxos (formerly itBit Trust Company) received trust company charters from New York DFS as early as 2015, and last year, Bakkt Trust Company LLC was granted a limited purpose trust charter.Crypto custodians Anchorage and BitGo both registered as trust companies in South Dakota, enticed by the state’s innovation-friendly regulatory climate. Likewise, Wyoming has enacted a state law to establish a special financial institution for holding cryptocurrency, dubbed a special purpose depository institution. In August, the New York DFS greenlit a number of tokens for sale, trade and custody, allowing licensed digital currency businesses to deal in these tokens without prior approval. In contrast, blockchain-friendly securities regulators such as SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce, who floated a safe harbor proposal for token securities, appear to be the exception.Related: US crypto review: Top-5 states with welcoming regulationsOverall, despite some movement from U.S. securities regulators, the blockchain-based securities space continues to move slowly. In contrast, innovation has shifted to the non-securities space, which is exploding with new assets, asset classes and technologies that will likely continue into the foreseeable future.This article was co-authored by Margo Tank and Michael Fluhr.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors’ alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

On BitMEX alone, the sudden drop wiped out nearly $99 million worth of longs.Three key factors likely caused the Bitcoin price to drop: miner outflows, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and major resistance.As reported earlier today, large-scale mining pools are sending higher-than-normal amounts of BTC to exchanges in recent days.Bitcoin outflows across major mining pools. Source: CryptoQuantThe data indicated that miners were preparing to sell their Bitcoin holdings, which added selling pressure to the markets. Ki Young-Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, wrote:“Miners send a certain amount of BTC to exchanges periodically, so they already have a large amount of BTC in the exchange. Whenever they decided to sell, it seems they move a relatively significant amount of BTCs to other wallets, and some of them are going to exchanges.”Miners represent one of the two sources of external selling pressure in the Bitcoin market other than exchanges. When miners begin to sell their holdings, it could cause significant pressure on BTC.Throughout the last three days, the U.S. dollar has rallied against other reserve currencies. The dollar showed particularly strong momentum against the euro.As Cointelegraph reported, the European Central Bank (ECB) warned the euro has become too expensive.

Salsa Tekila, a well-known pseudonymous trader, said it is a major support level at a higher time frame, which suggests that a bounce is likely in the near term.In the near term, traders generally foresee a rebound to $11,200.

Source: Trader XOIn the near term, analysts generally anticipate the dollar’s momentum to strengthen. This week, the ECB said it would look to offset the rising euro by controlling exports and encouraging more monetary stimulus. Currency analysts believe the ECB could continue to “dampen” the strength of the euro. In the short term that could cause the dollar to rally, which might place selling pressure on Bitcoin and gold. MUFG analyst Lee Hardman said:“Overall the comments suggest that an immediate policy response from the ECB to help weaken the euro appears unlikely, and they will rely more on jawboning to dampen euro strength for now.”But FX strategists predicted the euro to slump against the dollar after an initial upsurge. In a note to clients, Arkera global macro strategist Viraj Patel said the euro is nearing the “pain threshold” of policymakers.If the euro rallies further, Patel suggested that a strong reaction from the ECB is likely. Since then, the ECB has warned against the rising euro on multiple occasions.Whether the trend of the recovering dollar and the fading euro would continue remains uncertain. There is a possibility that both the euro and the dollar fall simultaneously.For now, considering the strength of the dollar’s rebound, Bitcoin traders are turning cautiously bearish.

488,"The Swiss canton of Zug is making it easier to imagine a world in which cryptocurrency users are resolutely in the mainstream.The canton — which has earned itself the moniker of ""Crypto Valley"" for its positive stance towards cryptocurrencies — will begin allowing citizens to pay taxes in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).According to Bloomberg on Sept. 3, “tax settlement by means of crypto currency will be available to both companies and private individuals up to an amount of 100,000 Swiss francs ($109,670).”Roughly 127,000 people live in the region, which has previously taken steps to accept Bitcoin payments for select government services.The new, significantly more wide-ranging move to accept taxes in crypto has been enabled by a partnership between the canton and crypto broker Bitcoin Suisse AG, which is based in Zug.Bitcoin Suisse has previously partnered with Swiss authorities in Zermatt to enable taxpayers in that region to use Bitcoin as a means of payments.Bitcoin Suisse founder Niklas Nikolajsen bullishly told reporters that “there’s almost nothing controversial about trading Bitcoin anymore. It’s completely mainstream.”In his view, Bitcoin’s strong rally during the coronavirus pandemic is likely to strengthen the case for the currency’s resilience and longevity amid a rapidly changing economic landscape.Despite this horizon, in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis, local cryptocurrency firms have struggled.

490,"Authorities in Russia continue the game of ping pong in regulating cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) even after passing the country’s first crypto law.Russia’s Ministry of Finance has reportedly proposed a set of amendments to the law “On Digital Financial Assets,” or DFA, which bans many operations with crypto.According to local news agency Izvestia, the proposed amendments envision a “blanket ban on any operations with virtual money for individuals and individual entrepreneurs” except for three scenarios. The ministry reportedly wants to ban all crypto transactions except the obtaining of assets through inheritance, bankruptcy and enforcement proceedings.The amendments reportedly intend to prohibit miners from receiving payment for cryptocurrency mining. “Standalone crypto mining is legal, but it loses its financial value because the payment is usually processed in Bitcoins and Ethers,” Izvestia reports.The latest news brings even more confusion to Russia’s current legal situation with crypto. After Russia finally passed its DFA bill in July 2020, local authorities subsequently said that the regulation will be set out in another law referred to as the bill “On Digital Currency,” or DA. While the DA bill is expected to pass in late 2020, the DFA law is scheduled to be adopted in January 2021, banning crypto-denominated payments in Russia.In late August 2020, Russia’s telecom regulator Roskomnadzor blocked the country’s largest crypto-related website, BestChange.ru. Providing an aggregator of about 400 local crypto exchange websites, the platform was reportedly said to distribute information about buying or selling products with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

However there are some tip offs to the scam.First, the interview is just copy-pasted from another from a year ago by the “CEO” of another scam site, Crypto Genius. Second, the photo used in the blog post belongs to a Youtuber and voice-actor, Pete Accetturo.The fraudsters also added reviews from fake users that have been testing the fake system.One of the users’ photos, named José Ruiz, is in reality a Mexican student, Adán Cortés, who became famous for breaking into the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony for Afghan activist Malala Yousafzai.The same type of scam is also used in several countries by fraudsters. British TV presenter and former X-Factor star, Rylan Clark-Neal, alerted his followers as to “fake interview” claiming that Rylan had made “millions from Bitcoin.”On April 18, the former Celebrity Big Brother star tweeted that a fraudulent interview impersonating U.K. publication, The Daily Mirror, was circulating on Facebook.Also, Hugh Jackman, Gordan Ramsey, and Martin Lewis sued Facebook over being impersonated by Bitcoin scammers on the platform in 2018."

This suggests that there sentiment is to own risky assets. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC), which at times behaves as an uncorrelated asset, remains stuck in a range.However, with the U.S. presidential elections approaching, the volatility in all the markets is likely to pick up. If President Donald Trump is re-elected, then there is unlikely to be a huge change in the current economic policies. If Joe Biden wins the election, then economists, traders and corporations are likely to remain cautious for a few weeks and this could lead to a correction as markets hate uncertainty. Therefore, traders should get ready for a roller-coaster ride for the next few months.Daily cryptocurrency market performance.

If Bitcoin continues to follow the model, then the price is likely to skyrocket within a few months and embark on a long-term bull market, with a target objective of $288,000.While the long-term picture might look bullish, what do the charts project for the short-term? Let’s study them to find out!Bitcoin has once again turned down from the $12,113.50 overhead resistance, which suggests that the bears are aggressively defending this level. BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewCurrently, the 20-day exponential moving average ($11,558) has flattened out and the relative strength index is just below the midpoint, which suggests a balance between the bulls and the bears.However, if the bears sink and sustain the price below the $11,000 support, it will complete a bearish head and shoulders pattern, which has a pattern target of $9,540.It is unlikely to be a straight fall to the target because the bulls will attempt to defend the $10,400–$10,000 zone aggressively.Conversely, if the price rebounds off the $11,000 levels, the BTC/USD pair is likely to remain range-bound for a few days. The trend will shift in favor of the bulls if they can scale the price above the $12,113.50–$12,460 resistance zone. The next few days are critical because the breakout or breakdown from the $11,000–$12,113.50 range could start the next directional move.Ether (ETH) surged above the overhead resistance of $446.479 on Sep. 1 and hit its first target objective of $480.

495,"According to Max Keiser, host of popular RT show the Keiser Report, it is only a matter of time before Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway will invest in Bitcoin (BTC). Not long ago, Buffett sold most of his positions in major banks and bought shares in Barrick Gold — a large gold mining company. For Keiser, this represents a U-turn in Buffett’s investing strategy:“This will be the beginning of a huge transition out of financials, which he dumped recently into gold. And then, therefore, he, or whoever takes his place, will soon be moving into Bitcoin.”After years of bashing both gold and Bitcoin, Keiser says that Buffett realized these are now “the go-to assets for preservation, for protection” against the depreciation of the U.S. dollar. According to Keiser, people shouldn’t spend time trading in the altcoin market, which he equated to gambling. “You may make money over one month, two months. But are you going to make money over five, 10, 15 years gambing? [...] The answer is a big fat no.”Keiser’s rant didn’t spare Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, which has come under fire recently due to allegations around its outstanding supply. “It’s still on beta, it shouldn’t even be trading!” Keiser said. Instead, people should be focusing on hodling Bitcoin. According to Keiser, one of the major causes of global inequality is caused by the uneven way money is distributed throughout the economy by central banks.Keiser pointed out that this phenomenon has been particularly evident since the United States Federal Reserve injected a massive amount of cash into the economy to counter the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Keiser pointed out that most of the money was used to bail out large firms, while end-consumers see little benefits.On the contrary, “Bitcoin goes directly from God to the consumers,” Keiser said.

496,"On Sept. 1, a new Bitcoin monthly candle opened with significant optimism. The August monthly candle closed above $11,500 for the first time since the all-time high in 2017. But in the short term, traders are leaning cautious following a sudden sell-off in the cryptocurrency market.In the last 24 hours, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) declined by more than 6%, while Ether (ETH) price dropped by 10%. The sentiment around the short-term trend in the cryptocurrency market remains mixed after the rejection.Some traders expect the price of Bitcoin to drop to as low as the $11,000 support area. A drop below $10,500 and a consolidation under it would raise the chances of a bearish trend. Traders generally consider $11,000 and $11,700 as the key levels for BTC. Technically, if Bitcoin remains below $11,000 for a prolonged period, it might indicate a bearish pullback. If BTC remains stable above $11,700, traders say it raises the chances of a rally.The daily price chart of Bitcoin with key levels. Source: DonAltDonAlt, a pseudonymous Bitcoin trader, said the trend of BTC remains uncertain, as for either direction to confirm, BTC would first have to close above $11,700 or below $11,000 in order to reveal clear bearish and bullish scenarios:“Nothing lost for the bulls yet, close above $11770 and I’d expect mega moon. Close significantly below and sells into the $11700 area become very attractive. Lose $11k and it’s macro pullback time, as long as it holds assume we’re gonna go further up.”There are three factors that could cause a decline in the price of Bitcoin throughout September. First, the U.S. dollar has started to recover at a key support level. Second, the month of September has historically been a slow month for BTC. Third, a consolidation after a major rally is typical of BTC.Prior to the rapid price decline of Bitcoin on Sept. 2, long-time bulls predicted a sharp pullback. In the past five days, the price of Bitcoin rose by nearly 8% against the U.S. dollar, while Ether, for example, saw an even sharper rally, surging 30%.The primary bearish scenario for Bitcoin is a continuous fall to $11,000, a rejection of the support level, and a drop to the $9,700 CME gap. For that to occur, BTC would first have to breach below the $11,000 support area, which has served as a strong foundation for the recent rally.A crypto trader known as “SalsaTekila” said they see around $10,500 as the key support for the continuation of a bullish trend. Considering that many traders perceive $10,500 to $11,000 as an important support range, losing the support range could trigger a deep pullback.An abundance of potential catalysts could also buoy the momentum of Bitcoin. In recent months, many on-chain indicators have signaled a positive trend for BTC in the medium term. Metrics such as HODLing activity, net unrealized profit/loss, declining exchange reserves and growing institutional demand support the bullish case of BTC in the longer term.The bullish case for Bitcoin in the short to medium term is a continuous increase toward an all-time high. Historically, BTC has been stagnant from September to October. Every single monthly candle for the month of September since 2017 has closed as a red candle.For instance, throughout 2017, the price of Bitcoin continued to increase to $20,000. Bitcoin’s monthly candle in September 2017 closed as red, but the bullish trend continued nonetheless in the fourth quarter of the year. Hence, even if this year’s September monthly candle closes as a red candle, there is a strong possibility that the uptrend will resume.The monthly price chart of Bitcoin. Source: TradingView.comThe trader known as the “Byzantine General” said that the bullish trend of the market is intact. Both Bitcoin and Ether portrayed signs of an overextended rally prior to the pullback. As long as BTC does not break below the $10,500–$11,000 support area, the bullish market structure remains strong. The trader said:“This is how bull markets work. No once can get to a consensus. You got people on both sides of the trade. When seemingly EVERYONE agrees that the market is bullish, THAT’s when it usually tops out. We don’t have that right now.”Despite the short-term correction of Bitcoin, researchers at market analysis firm Glassnode said not many long-term investors sold as BTC dropped below $11,200. The data indicates that it could have been a temporary pullback to flush overleveraged longs in the futures market. The cascade of long contracts possibly caused a rapid price drop.Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) is an indicator for movements of large & old stashes of $BTC.

Currently, it is showing no signs of long-term investors cashing out.

In fact, CDD is less than half compared to last year when #Bitcoin was at the same price level.https://t.co/c5Y5v4iWDU pic.twitter.com/J7vAN1xpFjConsidering that the price of Bitcoin took more than a year and a half to peak following the 2016 halving, the post-halving cycle theory further buoys the sentiment around Bitcoin. As seen throughout 2016, some analysts predict that BTC could gradually climb to a new all-time high without major corrections. That would strengthen Bitcoin’s momentum and decrease the probability of a sudden sell-off to key support areas.Cryptowatch, a cryptocurrency market data provider operated by major U.S. exchange Kraken, suggested in a tweet that one possible forecast for Bitcoin is a new all-time high by November and $27,000 by the year’s end: “#Bitcoin tracking well against @100TrillionUSD’s [PlanB’s] Stock to Flow (S2F) model. Assuming 10% lost coins, $BTC forecasts include new all-time highs by mid-November and ~27K by the end of the year.”The options market is beginning to show signs of accumulation as well, which supplements the long-term bullish case for BTC. Ecoinometrics, a Bitcoin market data firm, said bulls “bought a large bull call spread on Oct’20 two days ago. Yesterday there was a good amount of activity on the Sep’20 calls.” Given the rapid increase of options market volume since early 2020, it could fuel the uptrend of BTC.For both the bullish and bearish cases, the persistent theme that would affect the price of Bitcoin throughout the fourth quarter is the performance of the U.S. dollar index, or DXY. Gold also saw a steep rejection as the DXY began to reverse at an important multiyear level. Gold has dropped by nearly 3% within two days, which is a level of volatility the safe-haven asset typically does not see.Whether the DXY begins to climb and boosts the bearish scenario for Bitcoin until late 2020 or the optimistic on-chain metrics of Bitcoin offset the threat of a rising dollar remains uncertain. For now, many traders seem cautiously optimistic about the short- and medium-term trend of BTC. Until BTC clearly declines below $10,500, traders will likely remain skeptical in predicting a severe pullback in the near term."
497,"There is still an element of the crypto “Wild West” in 2020, as cryptocurrency stolen through hacks and ransomware attacks is still being cashed out on major exchanges around the world. Ransomware attacks have proved to be a lucrative cash cow for cybercriminals over the past few years, with the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation estimating that over $144 million worth of Bitcoin was stolen between October 2013 and November 2019.A press conference held by the FBI in February revealed the huge amount paid out in ransom to attackers by victims that were desperate to regain access to their infected systems and data. Interestingly enough, attackers received the majority of ransoms in Bitcoin (BTC). More recently, researchers took a sample of 63 ransomware-related transactions, accounting for around $5.7 million of stolen funds, and found that over $1 million worth of Bitcoin was cashed out on Binance following a string of transactions across various wallet addresses.There are a number of notorious ransomware variations that are used by different hackers and cybercriminal groups. Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky highlighted the uptick in these types of attacks targeting larger organizations in July, outlining two particular malware threats: VHD and Hakuna MATA.These particular threats seemingly pale in comparison with the amount of cryptocurrency stolen through the use of bigger malware threats such as the Ryuk ransomware. So, here’s why Ryuk has been a preferred method of attack and what can be done to prevent and discourage attackers from cashing out their ill-gotten gains on major exchange platforms.These newer vectors of attack mentioned in Kaspersky’s July report have not quite garnered the same reputation as the Ryuk ransomware. Toward the end of 2019, Kaspersky released another report that highlighted the plight of municipalities and cities that have fallen prey to ransomware attacks. Ryuk was identified by the firm as the favored vehicle of attacks on larger organizations, with governmental and municipal systems being prime targets in 2019.Ryuk first appeared in the second half of 2018 and brought havoc as it spread through computer networks and systems around the world. Named after popular character Ryuk from the manga series Death Note, the malware is a clever take on the “King of Death,” who amuses himself by delivering a “death note” to the human realm that allows the note’s finder to kill anyone by simply knowing their name and appearance.The malware is typically delivered in a two-phase approach that allows the attackers to examine the network first. This usually begins with a large number of machines receiving emails containing a document that users may unwittingly download. The attachment contains an Emotet Trojan malware bot that activates if the file is downloaded.The second stage of the attack sees the Emotet bot communicate with its servers to install another piece of malware known as a Trickbot. This is the piece of software that allows attackers to carry out a probe of the network.If the attackers hit a proverbial honey pot — i.e., a network of a big business, governmental or municipal office — the Ryuk ransomware itself will be deployed across different nodes of the network. This is the vector that actually encrypts system files and holds that data for ransom. Ryuk encrypts local files on individual computers and files shared across a network.Furthermore, Kaspersky explained that Ryuk also has the capability of forcing other computers on the network to switch on if they’re in a sleep mode, which propagates the malware across a larger number of nodes. Files located on computers on a network that are asleep are typically unavailable for access, but if the Ryuk malware is able to wake those PCs up, it will encrypt files on those machines as well.There are two main reasons why hackers look to attack governmental or municipal computer networks: First, many of these systems are protected by insurance, which makes it far more likely that a monetary settlement can be reached. Second, these bigger networks are intrinsically tied together with other large networks, which can lead to a far-reaching, crippling effect. Systems and data powering completely different departments can be affected, which calls for a swift solution, more often than not resulting in a payment to the attackers.The end goal of these ransomware attacks is pretty simple: to demand a large payment, typically made using cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has been the favored payment option for attackers. The use of the preeminent cryptocurrency as the preferred payment method has an unintended consequence for attackers though, as the transparency of the Bitcoin blockchain means that these transactions can be tracked at both a micro and a macro level.Related: Ransomware Attacks Demanding Crypto Are Unfortunately Here to StayThat is exactly what researchers have been doing, and by looking at the endpoint of these transactions, analysts can see attackers making use of some of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges. At the end of August, it was revealed that over $1 million worth of ransomed Bitcoin has been cashed out through Binance.Binance’s security team revealed to Cointelegraph that these transactions were over 18 months old and that the exchange has been actively monitoring the relevant accounts. The team also highlighted the use of its exchange by attackers as being a byproduct of the sheer volume of cryptocurrency traded on the platform, which gives illicit actors more of a chance to blend into the crowd. The spokesperson added:Cointelegraph reached out to Israel-based cybersecurity firm Cymulate to learn what exchanges can do to better prevent cybercriminals from using their platforms to liquidate stolen cryptocurrency. Avihai Ben-Yossef, the company’s co-founder and chief technology officer, contends that companies that provide antivirus protection and endpoint detection and response have a vital role to play in tracking ransomed crypto, given that they know the amounts paid out and the respective wallet addresses receiving the ransomed funds. He added that from there, exchanges can track and trace these payments:There is no doubt that this can be a time-consuming process. Nevertheless, the use of wallet addresses by attackers to receive ransomed funds makes it possible for security teams to keep an eye on the movement of those funds.Overall, 2020 has been a profitable year for cybercriminals who have made use of ransomware attacks, which have been constantly evolving. Ben-Yossef cautioned organizations and companies to ensure they have the best cybersecurity to combat the constantly changing cybercrime environment:"
498,"Bitcoin (BTC) is charting its way directly between the previous two block subsidy halvings that sent its price an order of magnitude higher.In a tweet on Sept. 2, PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow (S2F) BTC price models, told investors to be “patient” when it comes to price appreciation.Despite bouncing near $11,000 support on Wednesday, Bitcoin has performed exactly as expected on monthly timeframes since its last halving event in May.Reluctance to break and secure $12,000 as support has characterized price action since, but progress on the monthly chart is plain to see.“Reminder: we are still early, only 4 months after #bitcoin 2020 halving, nicely between 2012 and 2016 paths,” PlanB commented. “Patience is a virtue.”An accompanying comparative price index chart showed Bitcoin in 2020 adding gains that are between those of 2012 and 2016.As such, BTC/USD remains firmly within the range of possibility for increasing by an order of magnitude once again. According to S2F, this should see a price target of $288,000 in the current halving cycle, which ends in 2024.Bitcoin price post-halving comparison. Source: PlanB/ TwitterOver the weekend, meanwhile, another chart painted an even more bullish outlook for Bitcoin.

499,"Bitcoin has long had to deal with accusations of bubbledom being levelled at it, although it can hardly protest. During the last decade its price has ballooned on multiple occasions, only to come tumbling back down, albeit generally to a slightly higher level than pre-pump.Our old friend, Nouriel Roubini, considers cryptocurrency the “mother and father of all bubbles,” which would be quite an accomplishment for such a relative whippersnapper. Financial bubbles have been around for over 300 years, as the book Boom and Bust by William Quinn and David John Turner explains. Through examining the development of major bubbles through history, it suggests the likely causes and how to potentially predict (and avoid) future bubbles.Some dislike the term “bubble,” believing that it is primarily used to describe episodes for which there is no better explanation, or that there is a collective madness or irrationality involved.Of course, a book analysing the reasons behind bubbles would not have to be very long if “They crazy!” was a suitable conclusion. Instead the authors choose the simple definition of a bubble as a sharp increase in the price of an asset followed by a steep decrease.Some argue that there must also be a disconnection from the asset’s fundamental value, although this definition can make identifying “true” bubbles more difficult and is not used in the book.The book draws an analogy between financial bubbles and fire. Where fire needs oxygen, fuel and heat to burn, so a financial bubble requires the three elements in “The Bubble Triangle”. These being marketability, money/credit and speculation.Marketability considers the ease with which something can be bought and sold. This can depend on factors such as legality, divisibility, portability and the number of potential buyers. Money and credit is analogous to the fuel that the fire/bubble consumes. Easy credit and low yields on safe assets can drive investors to more risky and/or overpriced assets.Finally, speculation is the purchase (or sale) of an asset in the hope of selling (or repurchasing) the asset at a later date in order to make a profit.When these three elements are present, a spark can easily ignite a bubble. This spark, suggests the book, generally comes from either technological innovation or government policy.The rest of the book then looks at individual bubbles and applies this model to them. From the South Seas bubble of 1720, through railway mania, the Wall Street crash and the dot-com bubble, to 2008’s property bubble and recent government-induced bubbles in China.All are examined to identify the presence of marketability, credit and speculation, and the technical or political spark which caused them to initially boom.But, and probably quite importantly to Cointelegraph readers, no mention of cryptocurrency thus far.To be fair, the final chapter, called Predicting Bubbles, says that when starting the book, the authors had identified a financial environment which suggested that another bubble was likely. It then describes the spark of blockchain technology which ignited the crypto bubble (and it was definitely a bubble according to the book’s definition), spurring increased speculation, and the eventual burst.However it quickly moves on to the meat of the chapter, which is, err… predicting bubbles.As an exploration of the bubble phenomenon this is a great book. It is published by Cambridge University Press, and this is reflected in the research, writing, editing and overall production. Information is clearly presented in appropriate language, with a strong narrative flow throughout.It does not patronize the reader yet is readily accessible, although some prior awareness of financial terminology would be beneficial.As a general reference for cryptocurrency enthusiasts it perhaps doesn’t hit the spot, except for those who are particularly interested in the science behind bubbles... and I’m sure there are more than a few of those.Of course, it doesn’t ever purport to, so this is not something we should really criticize it for.So rather than criticize, Cointelegraph asked William Quinn, one of the book’s authors, for his perspective on cryptocurrency and bubbles in 2020.The Bitcoin and cryptocurrency bubble in 2017 does not make the industry immune to further bubbles, according to Quinn:“I think it’s quite commonly believed that the memory of a bubble inoculates investors against the next one, but that doesn’t seem to be the case recently. Bubbles are just happening more and more frequently.”One surprising element that the book highlights is the positive outcome of bubbles, in that they can bring technological and social change.Although Quinn concedes that blockchain technology fits within this framework of this, he personally doesn’t see a valid benefit for the technology, saying, “it’s been around for a while now, and I’ve seen very few convincing use cases. It’s become a bit of a cliché, but to me it still looks like a solution in search of a problem.”When asked whether the financial environment which pre-empted 2017’s crypto bubble was still around, Quinn replied “Definitely!”“All of [the three elements of the bubble triangle] have been in place now for some time, and are going to be in place for the foreseeable future. To come back to my first point – bubbles are just happening more and more frequently.”So Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could easily bubble again, or even be bubbling up at this very moment. Which might seem like great news, but of course steady sustainable growth would be a much better outcome, and with less chance that it will all go pop.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

This can depend on factors such as legality, divisibility, portability and the number of potential buyers. Money and credit is analogous to the fuel that the fire/bubble consumes. Easy credit and low yields on safe assets can drive investors to more risky and/or overpriced assets.Finally, speculation is the purchase (or sale) of an asset in the hope of selling (or repurchasing) the asset at a later date in order to make a profit.When these three elements are present, a spark can easily ignite a bubble. This spark, suggests the book, generally comes from either technological innovation or government policy.The rest of the book then looks at individual bubbles and applies this model to them. From the South Seas bubble of 1720, through railway mania, the Wall Street crash and the dot-com bubble, to 2008’s property bubble and recent government-induced bubbles in China.All are examined to identify the presence of marketability, credit and speculation, and the technical or political spark which caused them to initially boom.But, and probably quite importantly to Cointelegraph readers, no mention of cryptocurrency thus far.To be fair, the final chapter, called Predicting Bubbles, says that when starting the book, the authors had identified a financial environment which suggested that another bubble was likely. It then describes the spark of blockchain technology which ignited the crypto bubble (and it was definitely a bubble according to the book’s definition), spurring increased speculation, and the eventual burst.However it quickly moves on to the meat of the chapter, which is, err… predicting bubbles.As an exploration of the bubble phenomenon this is a great book. It is published by Cambridge University Press, and this is reflected in the research, writing, editing and overall production. Information is clearly presented in appropriate language, with a strong narrative flow throughout.It does not patronize the reader yet is readily accessible, although some prior awareness of financial terminology would be beneficial.As a general reference for cryptocurrency enthusiasts it perhaps doesn’t hit the spot, except for those who are particularly interested in the science behind bubbles... and I’m sure there are more than a few of those.Of course, it doesn’t ever purport to, so this is not something we should really criticize it for.So rather than criticize, Cointelegraph asked William Quinn, one of the book’s authors, for his perspective on cryptocurrency and bubbles in 2020.The Bitcoin and cryptocurrency bubble in 2017 does not make the industry immune to further bubbles, according to Quinn:“I think it’s quite commonly believed that the memory of a bubble inoculates investors against the next one, but that doesn’t seem to be the case recently. Bubbles are just happening more and more frequently.”One surprising element that the book highlights is the positive outcome of bubbles, in that they can bring technological and social change.Although Quinn concedes that blockchain technology fits within this framework of this, he personally doesn’t see a valid benefit for the technology, saying, “it’s been around for a while now, and I’ve seen very few convincing use cases. It’s become a bit of a cliché, but to me it still looks like a solution in search of a problem.”When asked whether the financial environment which pre-empted 2017’s crypto bubble was still around, Quinn replied “Definitely!”“All of [the three elements of the bubble triangle] have been in place now for some time, and are going to be in place for the foreseeable future. To come back to my first point – bubbles are just happening more and more frequently.”So Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could easily bubble again, or even be bubbling up at this very moment. Which might seem like great news, but of course steady sustainable growth would be a much better outcome, and with less chance that it will all go pop.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

502,"There are more U.S. dollars than ever, but the rate at which they move around the economy has never been so low.That was according to the Federal Reserve’s own statistics on Aug. 31, which showed that a collapse in M2 money supply velocity had come despite record money printing.The M2 supply topped $18 trillion in 2020 thanks to coronavirus countermeasures, while velocity fell below 1.125 for the first time since at least the 1940s.This year marks a clear contrast to historical data, with sudden volatility in both metrics worryingly clear to see.As Cointelegraph reported, the record low suggests that there is a huge amount of liquidity, but it is barely touching the economy. One reason for this is that the additional cash remains on the Fed’s balance sheet after its operations, meaning that those closest to the source of the money are those who see almost all of its impact.For RT host Max Keiser, this process, known as the Cantillon Effect, is turning those beneficiaries into a new sector of the elite — the “cantillionaires.”“This is the only chart that gives you the best picture of what’s happening.

Source: Coin360Three factors are leading traders to become more bullish on Bitcoin in the short to medium term: The potential catalysts are the declining U.S. dollar, the strength of the $10,000 support and Ether’s (ETH) strong upsurge.According to cryptocurrency trader Scott Melker, the U.S. dollar is showing slowing momentum, and this is shown by the dollar breaking down from a 10-year long channel and demonstrating a clear rejection. Melker said:“Dollar looks dead, as I have been saying for months. There was a weird euphoria last week that it was bouncing. Now the breakdown from a decade long channel is clear. It should bounce up to retest at some point, but there's nothing bullish. Good for BTC.”Many analysts interpret a declining dollar as a positive for Bitcoin because alternative stores of value are priced by the dollar. In recent months, the dollar has fallen substantially against other reserve currencies. Coincidentally, gold and Bitcoin have recorded steep rallies since April.The strong $10,000 support level of Bitcoin raises the chances of a larger rally, and it’s important to note that this is the longest period Bitcoin has been over $10,000 since the all-time high rally in 2017.XBT/USD 1-week chart. Source: TradingView.comEric Thies, a cryptocurrency technical analyst, hinted that Bitcoin might never drop below $10,000 again. He said:“We may never see #bitcoin below $10,000 USD again. Alts will moon too. Did you get the most you could, while you could?... Or did you let the negativity + skepticism of the crypto bear market block you from an incredible investment?”Based on the recent price trend of Bitcoin, analysts at Cryptowatch expect BTC to achieve multiple new all-time highs by November. The researchers said:“Bitcoin tracking well against PlanB's Stock to Flow (S2F) model. Assuming 10% lost coins, BTC forecasts include new all-time highs by mid-November and ~27K by the end of the year.”Another scenario for Bitcoin in the short term is a period of sideways consolidation similar to those seen in previous years. BTC typically remains stagnant throughout September to early November and has done so since 2016. Based on that historical pattern, there is a possibility that BTC ranges between $10,000 and $14,000.Cathy Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, previously said:“We could stay in a new trading range, just at a little bit of a higher level than the recent 6 to 10. Maybe we’re in the $10,000 to $13,000 range. Nonetheless, a breakout.”A consolidation phase above the $10,000 support would be ideal for Bitcoin, as it would strengthen its basis for the next rally. An even more encouraging outcome would involve BTC flipping the $12,000–$12,400 range to support then consolidating above $12,000, as this would prepare the digital asset for a strong move to $13,000 to $14,000."
507,"A Brexit-inspired plan wants to make California its own nation, separate from the USA. The people behind the plan are now looking to establish cryptocurrencies as the financial backbone of the proposed nation.The movement is called “Yes California,” though it is more commonly known as the “Calexit movement.” The group recently appointed a Blockchain expert named Alastair Caithness to analyze how an economy based on digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC) could be used to guarantee a Universal Basic Income, or UBI, for citizens.Caithness praised the idea of a future crypto-based economy, which he believes could “finance a level of free healthcare, free education, and a form of basic income” at a scale that has never before been seen. He went on to say that Californians “have struggled to achieve economic liberty” under the financial system established by the US federal government.Scottish-national Caithness, who is residing in San Diego, also stated that people investing in land and property through crypto transactions could help boost the proposed implementation of Universal Basic Income.Marcus Ruiz Evans, Yes California’s president, is advocating for these independence measures as well. He claims that California is the “world’s fifth-largest economy,” and praised Caithness’ advice in adopting crypto, stating “people need assistance, especially right now, and the government is struggling to come up with somebody.” He continued:“It is also good to have a Scotsman now living in California involved in our project, as the model for a Sovereign California has been developed from the Scottish Independence Referendum.”According to Yes California, the state government has agreed to hold a public petition into “Calexit” this year.

508,"It has been a bad couple of weeks for pro-Bitcoin / anti-Putin activists in Russia. First, on August 20, opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned, and then on August 31, a prominent blogger Yegor Zhukov was beaten near his home by unknown assailants.Not only are they two of the nation’s most ardent critics of president Putin, but they have also accepted Bitcoin (BTC) donations in the past — though their support of cryptocurrency is probably not the inciting factor behind these attacks. More likely, they are being silenced because they are political activists who oppose the Russian government, and fears over having their donations seized have led to their acceptance of cryptocurrency as a side effect. If true, this would not be dissimilar to WikiLeaks, which chose to accept Bitcoin after the U.S. government coerced PayPal into suspending its accounts.Navalny has been perceived as the biggest (and perhaps only) challenger to Putin for over a decade. He has been subjected to numerous physical attacks and legal incriminations over the years.Zhukov is only 22 and a devout libertarian; he first received public recognition in 2019 for his YouTube videos supporting political protests in Moscow. Soon after, he was arrested for participating in unauthorized protests. Subsequently, he was sentenced to three years’ probation, which was perceived as a victory by the opposition.Many believe that the Kremlin conspired to carry out this recent wave of attacks on political dissidents. The situation may also have been agitated by the situation in neighboring Belarus, where tens of thousands have been protesting against what they perceive to be rigged presidential elections. Belarus’ president Alexander Lukashenko may be in real danger of losing his power for the first time since coming to power 26 years ago.Though both men may have become Bitcoin supporters out of necessity, it just goes to illustrate the powerful, viable alternative to authoritarianism which decentralization provides."
509,"It is customary for government officials around the world to profess their disdain for crypto on the grounds that it is widely used to facilitate crime and finance terrorism. Although (government-backed) cash still remains criminals’ preferred financial tool by a wide margin, it is true that nefarious actors also turn to digital assets. When corrupt plans go sideways, law enforcement and other government agents can find themselves in possession of hefty sums of crypto.It appears that reports of such instances are becoming more common as crypto adoption widens. In August alone, the United States Department of Justice announced the “largest-ever seizure of terrorist organizations’ cryptocurrency accounts” and a Tokyo court ordered Japan’s first-ever seizure of digital assets in a precedent-setting ruling. How do officials go about confiscating crypto, and what implications do their actions have for the contentious relationship between government institutions and the world of decentralized finance?Regardless of how various states define cryptocurrency legally, they are still faced with addressing economic activity that involves borderless digital money. In the most frequently occuring scenario, crypto is seized alongside other property belonging to the exposed criminals.Oftentimes, government institutions do not have the expertise or specific rules for crypto in place, so they have to deal with it ad-hoc. For example, when the Latvian tax authority seized Bitcoin (BTC) from a convict for the first time, reports emerged that officials let it sit in the criminal’s wallet even after having secured access to the funds.Recognizing that cryptocurrency seizure done right could make for a steady flow of revenue, some jurisdictions are amending the rules around property confiscation to accommodate digital assets. In Russia, a somewhat controversial bill is in the works that would equip law enforcement agencies with a mechanism to forfeit crypto. The new rules could come into effect as early as 2021.Other governments are finding creative ways to profit from digital money. A bill currently under consideration by the state of Illinois extends the list of assets that can be considered abandoned property and eventually claimed by the state treasury.In the United States, when law enforcement seizes cryptocurrency involved in illegal activity, it is generally auctioned off in largely the same manner as other seized assets. U.S. crypto lawyer Dean Steinbeck told Cointelegraph, “It is common to see law enforcement agencies like the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) sell cars, boats and crypto to the highest bidder. I believe in February 2020 the USMS auctioned over 4,000 BTC.” Steinbeck added that he was not aware of any specific rules governing liquidation of seized crypto that are distinct from those of other asset types.Jorge Pesok, a counsel in digital assets practice at law firm Crowell & Moring, told Cointelegraph that U.S. Marshals have authority over any property that has been forfeited under laws enforced or administered by the Department of Justice and its investigative agencies. Pesok said that there are experts at USMS who can handle pretty much any kind of confiscated property:Elsa Madrolle, international general manager at blockchain security company CoolBitX, said that the liquidation of digital assets may be quite challenging due to a variety of factors ranging from “delays in prosecution to custody requirements to wildly fluctuating asset values.” Still, Madrolle noted, it’s estimated that well over $1 billion of digital assets have transited through the U.S. Marshals agency.In 2013, when the online black market Silk Road was taken down, the U.S. government even became a top 10 Bitcoin holder. Madrolle added that auctioning off crypto is fairly common outside of the U.S., and some governments rely on well-known consulting companies as intermediaries in the process:Opinions diverge on how consequential the movement of seized crypto funds is for the digital asset market. Dean Steinbeck opined that the amount of digital assets moved around by law enforcement agencies is “typically tiny compared to the global marketplace.” At the same time, he doesn’t believe that government agency activity could have a significant impact on Bitcoin or other liquid cryptocurrencies.In contrast, Madrolle pointed out that U.S. government agencies seem to be concerned with the potential repercussions of releasing extra liquidity into the crypto market. In 2016, the U.S. Marshals Service even signed a memorandum of understanding with the Treasury Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture and has been holding auctions to sell seized Bitcoin at regular intervals to limit impact to the market.Madrolle thinks that the sentiment driving this policy is the most important takeaway here: By reinjecting seized crypto back into the system in a non-disruptive way rather than removing them from the marketplace altogether, law enforcement agencies globally “recognize them as a genuine asset.”Steinbeck largely agreed with this interpretation, saying that government-backed auctioning are sending a “signal to the marketplace that they view cryptocurrency as a legal asset,” which is a small but positive step:Indeed, there is some indication that in rare cases when government agencies oppose digital assets ideologically, such considerations can outweigh the obvious monetary benefits. One example is the Finnish Customs’ refusal to auction off some 15 million euros ($18 million) worth of Bitcoin due to the belief that it would go straight into the money laundering ecosystem."

511,"The Economic Policy Symposium hosted annually by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City — an event attended by finance ministers, central bank managers and academics, among others — was held virtually due to COVID-19 concerns this year, and there was little virtual about the announcement. The U.S. dollar would be fed to the wolves.To be sure, the Fed has persisted with an accommodative monetary policy posture since the Great Recession despite strong years of growth in the middle of the Obama years and sluggish yet consistently positive growth the rest of the time.Before the coronavirus pandemic, the Fed had begun raising interest rates beyond the zero range, as the need to leave something in the tank should another crisis ensue was acknowledged. Those moves were roughly in line with growing central banker concerns globally that accommodative monetary policy had failed to generate robust growth rates and risked making central bankers toothless in case a serious recession occur.What has been little understood through the last two decades is that with Chinese imports raging throughout western markets, deflationary forces were being bought inbound at the same time as labor demand faced unprecedented challenges.The global economic structure was changing.Nevertheless, central banks around the world persisted in their efforts to inflate economies and encourage growth — not that there was no growth. In fact, when Powell took over the reins in 2018, the United States was enjoying the longest period of economic expansion in its history. But the growth was sluggish.The Federal Reserve had raised rates nine times between 2015 and 2018, with prices stagnating every time it did. That change in direction, however, was soon to be turned on its head courtesy of a 100-year pandemic.Since the COVID-19 onslaught, the Fed and its counterpart banks slashed rates back down to zero-bound levels, as economies were brought to a standstill. In March, the Fed announced a policy of being prepared to purchase an unlimited amount of treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to shore up financial markets.Its balance sheet ballooned by over $3 trillion to around $7 trillion with no end in sight. And last week, Powell revealed a much-anticipated stance of “average inflation targeting.” Since 1977, the Fed’s dual mandate has been to maintain maximum employment and stable prices. The latter is considered a 2% inflation rate.All that changed last Thursday. By targeting average inflation, Powell indicated that the Fed would keep interest rates lower than they needed to be, notwithstanding the health of the economy to push prevailing inflation above 2% if inflation had previously run lower than that for too long.In today’s context, the picture is frightening. Inflation has run just significantly shy of 2% since the Great Recession. To drag that average up to the target rate retrospectively, Powell and colleagues may be set to target levels around 3% for a prolonged period of time.If the Fed maintains an accommodative monetary posture well into a broader economic recovery, the results will almost undoubtedly be asset bubbles in stocks and housing. That is exactly what happened following the recovery from the Great Recession. In fact, stocks have already proven buoyant since the coronavirus shutdowns, with investors ensured continued asset price support from regulators.The Wall Street maxim “never bet against the Fed” has never been truer. Wealthy investors, always the first in line for cheap money, stand to gain the most from low-interest rates. The impact of that is bubbles in valued assets like housing that price ordinary homeowners out of the market.Another obvious peril for the economy is the debasement of the currency. Already, investors and corporations have seen the writing on the wall. MicroStrategy, a publicly-traded business intelligence company, recently swapped its U.S. dollar cash reserves for Bitcoin (BTC) to avoid a balance sheet loss that would result from a falling dollar.The Winklevoss twins argue that inflation is inevitable. While gold, oil and the U.S. dollar have long been the go-to safe-haven assets, gold and oil are illiquid and difficult to store, and the U.S. dollar is no longer safe as a store of value. They see Bitcoin benefiting enormously from the Fed’s actions.Don Guo, the CEO of Broctagon Fintech Group, pointed out:If inflation appears inevitable to the Winklevoss twins, the Fed has all but guaranteed it. Grayscale recently released a report, arguing:Fixed supply assets such as Bitcoin appear primed to triumph from Jerome Powell’s latest set of announcements. As the dollar suffers the fate of significant value debasement at the hands of regulatory overkill, Bitcoin is sure to emerge as a winner.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."

On Tuesday, Gemini exchange co-founder and entrepreneur Tyler Winklevoss continued the tone.“The U.S. dollar is becoming a shitcoin faster than ever imagined.

Data from Etherscan shows that the daily transaction volume on Ethereum rose from around 420,000 in January to over 1.2 million transactions per day in August.The explosive demand for Uniswap and small decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens has created a consistent demand for ETH. On the Ethereum blockchain network, users have to utilize ETH to cover transaction fees, which is also called “gas.”The gas costs, as a result of surging daily transactions, led users to purchase ETH to pay for network expenses. Since early June, when the DeFi market began to see exponential growth, it fueled the buying demand for ETH.According to data from on-chain market analysis firm Glassnode, the gas costs are surging so fast it is causing miner revenues to spike. The researchers wrote:“Ethereum miners earned over $500,000 USD in transaction fees in the past hour.

On-chain analysis indicates that the hackers had a Binance account and that some of the transactions used to move the stolen coins may have originated in St. Petersburg, Russia. However, It is important to note that conclusions afforded by on-chain research are generally more probabilistic than deterministic. On-chain analysis of the hack.

516,"Former Trump chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says a Joe Biden presidency would cause an “avalanche” of regulations. Some economists have also voiced concerns that the Biden administration would lead to a stock market pullback. This has led many crypto analysts to ponder what impact a strong stock market correction would have on the price of Bitcoin (BTC).During an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Mulvaney said Biden would push many regulations in a short period. He stated:""If Trump wins you'll see a lot more of the same. He's laid down the markers to what his attitudes are about regs. If Joe Biden wins, you're going to see an absolute avalanche of regs in a very short period of time.”Data from Skew shows Bitcoin has seen more correlation with gold than stocks in recent months. Hence, an argument could be made that a slowing stock market could actually buoy Bitcoin’s sentiment.The correlation between Bitcoin and gold. Source: SkewBut as seen from March to April, a bear market in stocks could lead the momentum of Bitcoin to dwindle. According to the University of Maryland’s finance processor David Kass, increased tax rates under Biden would lead to lower profits. Over time, declining profits could cause share prices to drop, causing the stock market to slip. Kass said:""The increased tax rates will result in lower profits and likely lower share prices. This effect may be more than offset by a larger fiscal stimulus package passed by Congress and better trade relations with countries in Europe as well as with China.""Other studies show that a Biden presidency might have minimal impact on the trend of the stock market. The WSJ says historical data indicates the election of Biden could still allow the stock market to net an average 10% annual return. Ed Finn, an opinion contributor to the WSJ, wrote:“It's even possible that U.S. investors will enjoy annual stock returns of 15% or better during a Biden administration.”However, there are two possible scenarios, in which a drop in stocks is likely to impact Bitcoin as well. First, if it causes the sentiment around safe-haven assets like gold to improve, it might raise the chances of a BTC rally. Secondly, a slump in stocks could take gold and Bitcoin with it as it did in March. If the latter scenario plays out, most assets with the exception of U.S. Treasuries are likely to decline.Since the sentiment around the Biden presidency remains mixed, there is a high probability that it would have no meaningful impact on BTC.When Bitcoin enters 2021, it faces a post-halving cycle as it did in 2017. Back in 2016, it took around 17 months for BTC to achieve a new peak at $20,000.

517,"The Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov shared some harsh comments about cryptocurrencies amid growing interest in the technology amongst Chechnya’s citizens.According to Pravda, Kadyrov claimed that the media is presenting crypto “as the new gold,” provoking what he calls a kind of Bitcoin (BTC) “fever”:""People take loans, save on themselves and their families, invest their last money in digital assets that promise incredible profits.""The head of the Chechen Republic, a federal subject of the Russian Federation, also warned that excess profit is tied with “big risks.” He also claimed that over the past month, “Bitcoin has depreciated in half” — a statement which can be disproven by anyone with a quick Google search.Kadyrov said that people dream of easy money, and this creates a false promise of wealth that crypto does not offer and has never offered. He further added:“I am more worried about the moral side of such investments. A person who invests in cryptocurrencies expects their value to grow many times. But why is that person waiting for this? Did the person work hard to get this profit?”The Chechen leader also pointed out the “greed of people” who have boosted the price of crypto. He claims these people are “trying to attract new investors and profit from their greed,” and ultimately stressed that he won’t support any projects which utilize digital assets.Russia recently passed its first major legislation devoted to cryptocurrencies, though the country’s central bank continues to treat the industry as a criminal area.Taking a similar stance, Sergei Shvetsov, the first deputy governor at the Bank of Russia, compared cryptocurrency to financial pyramid schemes and roulette games."
518,"Cointelegraph reported last week about the latest findings of Sergio Dermain Lerner, who is known for his discovery of the so-called ""Patoshi pattern."" His latest research suggests that Satoshi Nakamoto likely used a single PC to mine approximately 1.1 million Bitcoin (BTC). However, it appears that there was something of even greater importance lost in the excitement about this discovery. If Lerner's latest findings are accurate, it would put an end to seven years worth of speculation concerning the meaning behind the mysterious pattern.Patoshi pattern. Source: Sergio Darmain Lerner's blog.Lerner first wrote about the mysterious Bitcoin mining pattern back in March 2013. Some privacy flaws in the original Bitcoin code allowed him to discover Satoshi's mining idiosyncrasies. The crux of the pattern arises from the fact that Satoshi's mining code incremented the ExtraNonce field differently than the default Bitcoin code. A couple of months ago, Lerner also suggested that Satoshi refrained from mining in the first five minutes of the block. This gave rise to growing speculation about the meaning behind this pattern.Some have suggested that Satoshi was intentionally ""marking"" their Bitcoins. Others say that this was a way for the Satoshi team to demarcate their portions of the fortune. Some speculate that Satoshi optimized their equipment or code, allowing them to mine faster than anyone else. Yet others believed that the pattern originated from the fact that Satoshi was using around 50 machines for mining. This latter theory may have given Craig Wright the idea to claim that he used a Bitcoin farm in Australia to mine his coins.The truth, however, appears to be less exciting but more sound. Satoshi was using a multithreaded PC for mining. (Lerner also suggested to us that possibly Satoshi was using a Field-programmable gate array, which would be consistent with Satoshi apparently ""pre-inventing"" GPU mining and would not affect these conclusions.) In order to avoid redundancy, Satoshi would limit each thread to a distinct, non-overlapping nonce space. During Bitcoin mining, a nonce gets incremented with every unsuccessful attempt to solve a hash puzzle. Thus, the mysterious pattern may not have been created by choice, but rather as a side effect of Satoshi's unique mining setup. Lerner agreed with this conclusion, potentially allowing us to put the speculation over this theory to rest once and for all."

522,"With the COVID-19 crisis showing no signs of abating in the United States, central banks around the world have deployed financial airbags in the form of quantitative easing, and they plan to do a lot more. Modern Monetary Theory has taken center stage, and we are witnessing it in action. It’s a sight that will leave you awestruck: like witnessing the financial version of the first atomic explosion of Los Alamos and the Manhattan Project. What is going on with the world’s economy is unprecedented. We are entering completely new and uncharted territories, and all bets are off with respect to inflation/deflation. How will different asset classes react to the stimulus? Will we see price inflation, price stability or chaos? No one knows. One thing is certain: More absurdity is surely in store, and one should keep their wits about them and pay close attention.In 2008, the QE money printed did not enter circulation — it stayed at the Federal Reserve in a charter account of the member banks in the form of accounting entries on computers. This was just ignorance of how the financial flows worked, even though the net effect was positive: Bitcoin (BTC) was born as a reaction to QE.The QE of today is, however, one of a different animal — it is meant to go to households and small businesses to pay for food and rent, or simply put, prevent famine, mass homelessness, general riots and societal breakdown. What we have been witnessing is the end of 19th-century industrial capitalism and the reign of monetary capitalism. This has been true since the end of the Bretton Woods Agreement some 50 years ago, but not entirely evident for all. The goal is humanistic: to avoid death, misery and social upheaval. This new money has entered circulation all at once — no questions asked — directly into the bank accounts of households and small businesses as deposits pumped by the Fed, and these have inadvertently found their way into the financial markets. The result: a monster rally in the equity markets that has snapped a few necks and caught sociopathic short-sellers by surprise.Do not bet against the Fed. Doing so will give you a quick, unglamorous and leveraged death. While Robinhood traders are typically thought to be behind the market’s rallies, the truth is, operators directly linked to the Fed do the bulk of the “behind-the-scenes” buying, and they buy everything from bonds to index funds and single equities, and soon –– cryptocurrencies.Ironically, crypto heads are uniquely conditioned to understand what is going on with the current monetary system and market-led shenanigans — it’s all in the market-making order books. Cryptos never had a real economy backing them — they have no endogenous cash flows. Their main economic value propositions are (1) speculation; (2) drugs and tax evasion; and (3) alternative stores of value outside the traditional banking system.In short, they are valid financial instruments. Increasingly, stocks are becoming uncorrelated from the underlying economic value and rely solely on the supply and demand dynamics of the financial markets, without economic underpinning. The economy is crashing, yet stocks are going skywards — this is not a paradox, but a feature: This is exactly what is happening with cryptocurrencies.The paradox of zero cash flows and infinite valuations is one of perception. Asset backing is important. Cryptos, in general, have held their own as an investment class even with little asset backing and –– perhaps! –– because of it. Since cryptos are not directly linked to the health of the economy, their movements have been largely independent of economies. They performed well as stores of value by paring March’s losses and seem poised, as of this writing, to break out going forward. This is pure supply and demand logic — the psychology of a numerus clausus financial assets (limited supply of only 21 million BTC) and a seemingly infinite wall of liquidity chasing them. What you are seeing is an inflow of financial and monetary demand, not economic demand on the demand side of the order books of market makers, both in stock and crypto markets.Forget fundamentals, narratives and traditional valuation methodologies. Stocks are now like crypto: a store of value that exists in the traditional economy and purely in exchanges. Something’s value is determined by whatever someone is willing to pay for it. Pay attention to the flow of new money and the technical depth of the order books in front of it. The wall of liquidity is huge, yet the order book pales in comparison.The main way to value a stock is not through its economic value but through the exchanges and the technical arcana of market-making bots. A stock’s worth is determined by whatever someone is willing to pay for it, similar to that of crypto. This layer of indirection among economy, exchanges and stocks/coins allows for a decoupling of price from cash flow and can be a blessing when the economy crashes. This is at the heart of what is generally going on in the financial markets at the moment.When Tesla’s stock rallies to increase twofold in a couple of months while Elon Musk blabs incoherently about weed, predatory Lithium mining and a regime change he instigated, you would think that the company’s stock is the new darling overachieving asset class in an attempt to rationalize the rally.When analysts and your friends cry in disbelief at what is going on in delusional public markets, the crypto cultists should feel smug in their knowledge that ab initio stores of value can and do in fact exist, with BTC as the poster child. You are not witnessing an increase in economic demand for electric Tesla cars, or whatever Musk is tripping about at the moment, you are witnessing an increase in the monetary demand for Tesla’s stock, probably helped by the unhinged rants of Musk himself.These are purely technical financial moves, not economic, and are nothing new. Stocks behave more like cryptos now in how they find valuations, and investors are the main source for demanding cashing financial instruments. This is why trusted brands are so important. What is this economy you speak of?At a time of economic hardship, it is somewhat sociopathic to focus on the narrow and cold-hearted technical details of a speculative financial instrument and the arcana of monetary issuance — but herein may lie the keys to social stability and the future of money. The wall of liquidity that has hit the public markets is now finally finding its way, almost by overspill or trickle-down, to the crypto markets.Money has been looking to take new shapes, for such is the spirit of money. QE will reach more people through these channels. It’s QE that will soon land us on the moon. It is ironic. We actually expected this sooner, but it seems to be underway at the moment. What was seen first as a rally in alt-coins is now a rally in Bitcoin and Ether. Where alt-coins don’t move is a bullish sign for cryptos in general. This may spell the beginning of a monster rally — the pendulum has swung from the crypto winter and the trough of disillusionment.With literally nothing to anchor the valuations, the price of cryptos is technically and psychologically positioned to exponentially blow up. And this price is a direct function of the fiat QE sloshing around the financial markets and a direct function of the monetary levels. It is ironic that QE is actually propping BTC when it was born in antagonism to said QE.What may have delayed the move up is that getting into crypto is still a complicated affair. Liquidity in the crypto markets remains opaque. Most exchanges are vast washing machines that do not serve any social purpose but perpetuate pump-and-dump schemes, which are just proxies for degenerate gambling. Dealing with custody and keys is still a thing and a complicated affair for most people. Wallets are mostly useless, and there are a plethora of them — but they are making progress.We should all pay close attention to the fact that U.S. banks have just been cleared to do crypto custody, thereby removing one of the biggest technical hurdles to retail and institutional growth outside of the crypto ghetto. While we are still a long way from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance on deposits, this is a significant step, and crypto may yet play a central role in the future of money and banking.Bank custody will create unprecedented retail and institutional comfort and, thus, demand. Those who want to live outside the banking system, for whatever reason, ideological or legal, still can, and those who want the security of the traditional banking system (essentially, the vast majority) can do that as well. Having more options is always good, and crypto maximalism and dogmatism are just that — a series of “isms.”Understanding the different schemes of crypto is difficult and time-consuming even for savvy investors. Due diligence is meaningless and almost impossible — you really have to take a deep dive to know whom to trust, what to trust, who knows what they are doing, who is still high on the unicorn powder of blockchain for good, and who will preserve and grow your money as opposed to blow it all on flimsy tech no one needs or has asked for. Similarly, some newfangled financial products have raised eyebrows, prompting people to ask themselves: “How can anyone offer 8% APY on crypto when we are entering an era of negative interest rates on fiat?”These are still the many elephants in the crypto room. All those things that seem to defy (pun intended) logic and financial gravity are enough to deter newbies — for if it seems too good to be true, it is probably too good to be true. We need to shed all linguistic pretense of tech pompousness and grandiose societal schemes. Cryptos work well as stores of value — they are either volatile stores of value, such as BTC or ETH, or stablecoins.In short, we need stable growth coins. We are seeing the rise of stable growth hybrid coins, such as FF1 by TwoPrime or Bitcoin trust by Greyscale, that marry upside potential with downside protection and leverage what the crypto markets do well. Expect more to come as the DeFi wave stabilizes and cashes in.All in all, the crypto markets have been lagging behind the equity markets in terms of feeling the impact of QE. It simply means the critical mass is still not here. It’s easier, safer, more liquid and simply more expedient to buy Tesla stock for twice the return in three months via your 401K than to gamble on an obscure pump-and-dump that promises gains of up to 10 times. But with thinner and lower liquidity, cryptos will also feel the pressure in an exponential way when the QE tsunami hits its shores — it won’t be doubled... It may increase by 40 times. Who knows. We may be in the middle of this movement — the mother of all rallies. It will be swift and brutal. Don’t miss out; don’t short out; don’t hold out; and don’t chicken out.

523,"Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange in terms of market capitalization, is listing another token to support the growth of decentralized finance, or DeFi.Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), a new ERC-20 token pegged to the price of Bitcoin (BTC), is now tradeable on Binance, according to an Aug. 31 blog post by the exchange.As officially announced, Binance users can now start deposit WBTC as well as trade the token against Bitcoin and Ether (ETH).Introduced in 2019, Wrapped Bitcoin is an Ethereum-based token that represents Bitcoin, with one WBTC being equal to one BTC. WBTC is a joint initiative by major DeFi players like BitGo, Ren, Dharma, Kyber Network, Compound, MakerDAO and the Set Protocol. The token is designed to bring more liquidity into the Ethereum network with Bitcoin as well as implement it in the DeFi industry.As part of WBTC’s functionality in DeFi, the token allows Bitcoin holders to keep holding BTC while also using DeFi apps like Compound to borrow or lend money.Opposed to traditional finance, decentralized finance, or DeFi, envisions a brand-new monetary system built on top public blockchains. As DeFi platforms connect borrowers and lenders directly eliminating credit checks, and enable digital assets to be collateralized, DeFi provides decentralized lending as its key benefit.The DeFi industry has been growing exponentially in 2020, with the total value locked in the market hitting $9 billion on Aug. 30. Uniswap, the most widely-used decentralized exchange on Ethereum, surpassed major crypto exchange Coinbase in daily volume on Aug. 30, as Cointelegraph reported earlier today.As DeFi continues to see meteoric rise, the demand for WBTC is also up, hitting $274 million in circulation by mid-August.Binance has been actively embracing the DeFi market this year. In August 2020, Binance launched DeFi staking in partnership with major industry players like Compound Finance and Kava Labs. In April, Binance issued a new DeFi token backed by the crypto asset, Ontology (ONT)."
524,"Craig Wright, a self-proclaimed creator of Bitcoin (BTC), is continuing to file more defamation suits against perceived rivals, despite none of his previous attempts turning out to be successful.On Aug. 25, Wright filed a libel suit against major industry figure, Roger Ver, with the High Court of Antigua and Barbuda, a spokesperson for Wright confirmed to Cointelegraph on Aug. 31. The lawsuit was served on Ver on Aug. 28.According to an official defamation claim obtained by industry publication CoinGeek, Wright is seeking legal action against Ver for publicly stating that Wright is not the true Satoshi Nakamoto -- the anonymous creator of Bitcoin. The court document specifically refers to Ver’s video message to Wright in May 2019, stating, “Craig Wright is a liar and a fraud, so sue me, again.”The new defamation claim seeks an injunction restraining Ver from further stating similar ""defamatory"" allegations on platforms like YouTube and Twitter as well as payment as compensation for the defamation, the document reads. The lawsuit is essentially a revised version of a previous defamation suit against Ver, a spokesperson for Wright noted.As reported, Wright previously served Ver with a libel suit in the High Court of England and Wales for calling him a liar and fraud in a YouTube video in 2019. The video was subsequently stricken for violating YouTube community guidelines, which prompted Wright’s libel suit in May 2019. Despite the video being removed from YouTube, Ver’s message to Wright is still available on his official Twitter account as of press time.The High Court of England subsequently dismissed Wright’s libel suit in July 2019 due to questions of jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales also dropped Wright’s appeal, claiming that the suit is not a U.K.-related issue in May 2020.The new defamation suit will apparently have more chances in terms of jurisdiction as both Wright and Ver are citizens of Antigua and Barbuda, according to the court document.As Cointelegraph reported, Wright is an Australian citizen allegedly residing in London. The Australian scientist reportedly claimed to be a citizen from Antigua and Barbuda and not from Australia in 2019.A citizen of Saint Kitts and Nevis, Ver apparently acquired his Antigua and Barbuda citizenship through the country's Citizenship Investment Program. Ver told Cointelegraph that he was optimistic about the potential outcome:"
525,"Bitcoin (BTC) is heading for a bullish start to another week’s trading after shrugging off lower levels to hit $11,700.Cointelegraph takes a look at five things that could shape price performance in the coming days after BTC/USD saw little impact from both the Fed and futures settlements last week.In a classic continuation of the eerie post-coronavirus setup, stock markets are headed even higher on Monday.Despite the difficulties faced by many after months of sporadic coronavirus lockdowns and associated economic hardship, large-cap stocks around the world are showing no signs of bearishness.The Dow Jones made brisk progress before moving slightly lower towards the end of trading, up 0.5% on the day. In the United States, S&P 500 futures were also up modestly at 0.3% as of press time. The progress comes as geopolitical tensions also fester, with the U.S. and China sparring over issues such as Washington’s planned enforced sale of social media platform TikTok.Speaking to Bloomberg, however, one analyst sounded more like a Bitcoin bull when describing the outlook for equities.“I can’t see what’s going to change people’s perspective on why we should stop buying,” Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at U.S. multinational financial services giant Charles Schwab told the publication on Saturday. “If we continue to buy and we have a few more pullbacks, which I think is likely, people will just continue to jump in and buy those dips.”Bitcoin Vs. S&P 500 3-month chart. Source: SkewAfter most macro assets saw losses on the back of the Fed speech on Thursday, Bitcoin has nonetheless managed a conspicuous turnaround. Since the speech, BTC/USD is up by over 4.2%.The same is true for safe-haven gold, which also recovered over the weekend. Curiously, the U.S. dollar currency index, or DXY, which plumbed two-year lows after Thursday, has also bounced back — analysts continue to eye inverse correlation between the two assets.At publication time, Bitcoin circled $11,600, having reached $11,720 in an early morning rally. Despite the broad push forward post-Fed, the consensus among Bitcoin commentators remains that long-term policy will drive interest in hedges against the dollar.“Powell’s speech is as much about employment as it is inflation. The Fed wants full and healthy employment and are expanding the ways they look at it,” Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz tweeted.   “Inflation will be tolerated to get to these goals. Bullish for gold. Bullish for BTC.”Should DXY action continue to continue its inverse relationship with Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency may get a further boost sooner rather than later.“The dollar has far more room to fall than almost anyone thinks,” gold bug Peter Schiff summarized, pointing to another Bloomberg piece in which investment company Pimco warned that the dollar’s fall was just getting started.U.S. dollar currency index 1-month chart.

Modest in size, the void between the end of last week’s futures trading and the start of this week’s lies between $11,645 and $11,735. That will cause little interest, however, as a more significant interplay with a lower gap remains more of a topic of interest. Located at around $9,700, bets remain that that price will form a short-term price target for BTC/USD.As Cointelegraph reported, futures “gaps” have historically functioned as reliable indicators of market direction, but the time taken to “fill” them can vary significantly.

527,"The vast majority of Japanese crypto traders who started getting into the market in the last year may be investing solely in Bitcoin.According to data published on Aug. 19 from the Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association (JVCEA), Bitcoin’s dominance relative to altcoins in the Japanese market reached more than 87% in April. No other token accounted for more than 6% of monthly volume traded. In the same month, the number of active accounts for spot crypto trading in Japan increased by 13,987, an all-time high at the time.“It seems like Japanese investors’ overall interest in altcoins has been shrinking over time relative to their interests in Bitcoin,” said Yuya Hasegawa, a market analyst at Japan-based crypto exchange bitbank. “Given the growth in the number of active accounts, the vast majority of the newer market participants in Japan, particularly since last summer, are likely to be interested only in Bitcoin.”Dominance chart for crypto monthly traded value in Japan.

528,"Jameson Lopp, co-founder and CTO of Casa, considers himself a Bitcoin Monetary Maximalist and a curious being towards altcoins, so in a post on August 30, he warned the public not to take online interactions on cryptos too literally.Although Lopp sees no other options on the market that can compete with Bitcoin's sound and secure money proposition, he also believes that other cryptocurrencies can bring values that Bitcoin can’t bring, such as digitizing assets and non-financial functionality.In fact, Lopp has been advising a blockchain project built on Ethereum. He sees the project’s potential, bringing cryptocurrency and security token opportunities to institutional and retail investors. However, he also warns there is no guarantee in the company to become profitable. He stressed that:“While INX token holders are guaranteed to receive a portion of cumulative net positive cash flow (also known as ""profit"") there is of course no guarantee that INX Limited will become profitable. People on social media tend to generate controversy in order to gain clout. Anyone considering investment should do their own research!”The same thing goes for Lopp’s other comments on other blockchain projects or cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. He stated that whatever he put out there in social media is not for any investment recommendation. Lopp, and other Bitcoin maximalists, were accused of shilling INX. INX has been cleared by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Lopp pointed out that he believes Bitcoin is the best monetary asset in the world; however, he is still open to using other cryptocurrency platforms when the need or desire arises. He suggested giving a new “label” to people who hold such beliefs as “Bitcoin Pragmatist,” in the hope that there will be less criticism from the public of taking what he says too literally.“It doesn't matter what kind of Bitcoiner you are. You can be a maximalist, a pragmatist, a toximalist, a shitcoiner, or a multi coiner. I'm no stranger to criticism, attacks, and even threats on social media. I have no interest in engaging in self censorship simply to meet purity tests of specific subsets of my followers. I suggest taking online interactions you see with a grain of salt.”"

According to Garlinghouse, this decision is likely to lead “to further diversification of assets which will certainly be good for crypto.”The various stimulus and fiscal measures announced around the world to counter the coronavirus pandemic led economic slowdown are bullish for Bitcoin (BTC). However, Bitcoin’s major bull market cycles show that each successive cycle has been longer than the previous one.Hence, if history were to repeat itself, Bitcoin could consolidate for another 3-12 months before making a decisive move.Crypto market data daily view.

530,"If Bitcoin (BTC) was born in response to the systemic failures laid bare by one global financial crisis, then the subsequent rise of various decentralized networks can be seen as differences in opinion on the best way forward. All are in agreement that the existing financial system is broken, but are slightly at odds in terms of how to fix it. In a sense, each of these networks represents a new, if partial, vision of what could make for a better system. For instance, we’ve seen Celo leverage cryptographic tools and mobile phones to put financial instruments into the hands of the world’s unbanked. We’ve seen Compound reduce friction in financial markets, replacing it with speed, efficiency and openness. And we’ve seen MakerDAO manage to keep something of a stable peg by way of incentives rather than physical backing. In a way, each new project represents a new and different take on what the financial system can be — or even what it should be.Despite their differences, many of these networks share the ethos of decentralization as a foundational principle. According to the theses effectively posited by these networks, finance doesn’t need to be mediated by an oligopoly of entrenched interests and industry gatekeepers. Instead, a better system allows for broad participation, bringing the ideals of open source and decentralization to a new, more fair and more equitable market structure.As early builders of, and participants in, this new system, we have a real shot at creating something wholly better than what has come before. But, as money and influence continue to pour into the digital asset space, the challenge becomes avoiding the centralizing tendencies that have characterized traditional finance since its inception.How do we avoid simply recreating a new version of the same old system? The answer is part learning from the past, and part joining with and supporting the projects and teams who are truly building the financial future today.In traditional banking, centralization is the rule, making it possible for large legacy players to wield an extraordinary level of influence. To correct for this, decentralized networks have evolved myriad models of community governance. Instead of having a dozen people in a boardroom determine a given token’s destiny, these networks put their tokens’ fate in the hands of widespread user participation.In theory, community governance involves aligning incentives around value creation, storage and transfer, now and in the future. In theory, it’s directly democratic, with the share of voice often allocated in proportion to share of stake. In practice, though, it can be a bit more complicated.Even in an intentionally decentralized network, it’s still possible for influence to concentrate in the hands of a few large players, be they investors or service providers.Emerging token projects, in particular, often worry about this centralizing tendency. They’re concerned, perhaps rightfully, that they’ll go through all the trouble of developing a decentralized network and governance structure only for it to be unduly influenced by a few large holders. This problem is amplified when service providers enter the picture, particularly those that only allow clients one option to stake — often together, under one umbrella.The truth is, all of us have a role to play in keeping networks aligned with the spirit of their founding. As service and infrastructure providers, the responsibility is particularly acute. To participate responsibly, and to avoid the tendency toward centralization, we need to support decentralized networks as decentralized networks.Neither users nor token projects want to see networks decentralized in name but centralized de facto. And honestly, as builders of what really could be a better, more prosperous financial future for everyone, neither should we.Infrastructure providers need to ensure a variety of participation measures that preserve decentralization. For large service providers, that means offering holders a wide range of participatory mechanisms. It means making it possible or even easy for users to participate as they wish, either through native staking services, through third party staking providers or on their own.Beyond enabling clients to participate on-chain, securely and as they wish, supporting the broader ecosystem really means supporting each new chain as it was intended to run. Blockchain developers have a certain vision, and service providers should meet them on their own technological terms. To do otherwise — to make new and emerging chains beholden to the technological limitations of slow-moving infrastructure — makes us not much better than the system we’re working to improve.At the end of the day, decentralization is both the means to and the end for a better financial system — a system based on inclusion rather than exclusion, on consensus rather than decree, and on intentional, active participation rather than inertia. We may never have a better chance to fundamentally change finance than we do right now.

532,"Former White House chief of staff under U.S. President Donald Trump Mick Mulvaney is running a hedge fund. Since 2014 Mulvaney has been recognized as a pro-Bitcoin (BTC) official, encouraging practical regulation of cryptocurrencies.The new fund called Exegis Capital was announced during a podcast with S&P Global Market Intelligence. Mulvaney would collaborate with former Sterling Capital Management portfolio manager Andrew Wessel.At the 2014 “Bitcoin Demo Day” conference, Mulvaney said he would like to see the government take its time in regulating Bitcoin. He said the top cryptocurrency has the potential to become a medium of trade and a means of payment. Mulvaney said at the time:“My interest in it is to just try and make sure that government doesn’t act too soon in such a fashion that curbs the potential for Bitcoin. Because I see potential for Bitcoin as a medium of trade and as a transactional tool, and I'd hate to see the government make decisions early that sort of retard its growth.”Since then, he has continuously encouraged the government to efficiently regulate the cryptocurrency market. When Mulvaney was initially appointed as the White House chief of staff, the sentiment among cryptocurrency industry executives was generally positive.It remains to be seen whether Mulvaney’s enthusiastic stance towards Bitcoin would lead the fund to get involved in the cryptocurrency market.In recent weeks, the Bitcoin market has seen a spike in the inflow of institutions. Most recently, Fidelity Investments filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to operate a Bitcoin fund.As Cointelegraph reported on Aug. 26, Fidelity Investments President Peter Jubber filed the Form D for a Bitcoin index product with a $100,000 minimum investment.Previously, Fidelity said in a paper entitled “Bitcoin Investment Thesis: An Aspirational Store of Value” that Bitcoin has the properties of a store of value. The paper reads:“Many investors consider Bitcoin to be an aspirational store of value in that it has the properties of a store of value but has yet to be widely accepted as such.”The growing institutional activity in the Bitcoin market naturally raises the speculation on whether more hedge funds would enter the cryptocurrency space.In the near term, Mulvaney is unlikely to actively consider Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies due to his ties with the administration.While Mulvaney is no longer the White House chief of staff, he still remains a special envoy. Given the Trump administration’s negative stance towards Bitcoin, the probability that Exegis Capital would seek exposure to cryptocurrencies remains low, at least for the foreseeable future."

Although Ledger repaired the issue following the tip, the company discovered that someone had already exploited the weakness on June 25, leading to nearly 1 million leaked email addresses — with 9,500 affected customers seeing other private data leaked, such as their phone numbers and names.Guillemet said Ledger repaired the issue and disabled the troublesome API key that same day. “In addition, no payment information, credentials (passwords) or crypto funds were impacted,” he added. “This data breach has no link nor impact on our hardware wallets and the Ledger Live application,” he explained. “Customer crypto assets have always been safe and are not in peril,” he said, crediting Ledger’s device makeup for its security, as it gives authority over funds back to the users.Jake Yocom-Piatt, the project lead at cryptocurrency Decred, said he was not surprised by the incident, noting companies usually give less attention to their e-commerce database defenses. “When your core product is secure hardware, it is easy to forget that the security of your e-commerce software system is also important,” he told Cointelegraph, adding: “Many larger organizations view software security as a sunk cost because it falls outside their core product offering, so they cannot market it and extract profit.”Shortly following the data breach, Ledger device holders read about another difficulty surrounding their wallet of choice on Aug. 5, as a software vulnerability surfaced. The hole essentially provided a bridge between Bitcoin and its various forks, such as Litecoin (LTC). Harnessing the flaw, attackers could make a transaction seem associated with one asset, while confirming the transaction on the device would approve a separate transaction for a different asset — unbeknownst to the wallet owner.Ledger issued a software update the same day, correcting the issue. On Aug. 26, when asked for additional comments, a Ledger public relations representative pointed toward an explanation of the situation on the company’s blog posted on Aug. 5, which explained that a bounty hunter found the vulnerability, leading to Ledger’s mentioned update in response. “We’d like to assure you that this vulnerability cannot be used to obtain sensitive data like your private keys or recovery phrase,” Ledger clarified in the write-up.Despite the recent difficulties, Ledger wallets remain a popular option for crypto storage. “Ledger and other hardware wallets are a major security upgrade for the average cryptocurrency user because it prevents remote access attacks — e.g., keylogging — from succeeding,” Yocom-Piatt said, adding:Twitter user CryptoGainz tweeted out difficulties he faced when working with his Ledger wallets on Aug. 13, citing unreliable software. Although the comment came shortly after the Aug. 5 vulnerability issue, the situation proved unrelated, with CryptoGainz still expressing faith in the wallet company as a crypto storage option.Related: Uniswap and automated market makers, explained“They’re a safe way to store crypto, they just suck for trading via metamask on Uniswap,” CryptoGainz told Cointelegraph in a Twitter DM chat, citing an online wallet provider/decentralized application avenue and the latest decentralized exchange trading craze, Uniswap.Although Ledger’s wallets provide parameters for enhanced security, users still must know best practices and tactics for the protection of their assets. “We’re most worried about phishing attempts — emails from scammers pretending to be us,” Guillemet explained.A phishing scam occurs when a malicious party sends an email, or another form of communication, disguising itself as a different person or company in an attempt to gain private information from the target. “We’ll never ask our clients for the 24 words of their recovery phrase,” Guillemet said, urging customers to harness two-factor authentication, while also pointing toward educational information on security found on Ledger’s website.Aside from phishing attacks, Ledger holds safeguards against malware. “Ledger devices are designed to protect users’ funds against malware on users’ computers, including fake Ledger Live applications,” Guillemet explained, referencing Ledger’s desktop application for interacting with wallet devices. He specified that users should make sure to get the app from Ledger’s official online site or app store.Yocom-Piatt also spoke on protection against company data breaches, such as the one Ledger suffered. “Since e-commerce systems typically have weak security, I recommend that users ordering these devices have them sent to an address that is not their primary residence,” he said.Using a different physical address shields customers from exposure of their residence, should such a breach occur, helping guard against potential in-person Ledger wallet device theft. “Also, when possible, you should avoid using the wallet software supplied by the hardware wallet vendor to maximize your privacy,” he added.Self-custody over assets is a major selling point in the crypto industry, although it requires knowledge and technical prowess. The complexity involved might explain the push for mainstream crypto trading products, such as exchange-traded funds in which companies custody assets for investors."
534,"Bitcoin was down a bit this week, stopping just above $11,000. That increase in volatility is only to be expected, say some experts, as we approach the end of some BTC futures and options contracts. Other contributors to increased volatility include Bitcoin’s long period of consolidation and a key resistance level.But what happens next? World leaders have been discussing the role of cryptocurrencies during The Great Reset, the time that will follow the end of the pandemic and the reopening of world economies. As some leaders look for a new kind of capitalism, the cryptocurrency industry is hoping for more decentralization and greater personal control.That will require a greater uptake of cryptocurrencies. Investment firm Bitcoin Capital is trying to do its bit. The company is rolling out an exchange-traded product that can allocate funds to up to fifteen digital coins. altFins is trying to help too. The cloud-based platform is releasing an app to enable investing across multiple exchanges. The move should make trading more mature.And even the SEC is trying to help, at least indirectly. The commission has changed its definition of an “accredited investor” to include “professional certifications, designations or credentials, or other credentials issued by an accredited educational institution.” Previously, the designation requires a million dollars in net worth or a stable income of at least $200,000 a year. The new designation might help crypto traders.It’s possible, though, that lots of Americans have already used cryptocurrencies. The new IRS forms should make that clear. The income tax forms for 2020 will ask Americans whether they received, sold, sent, exchanged, or acquired “any financial interest in any virtual currency?” When the IRS takes crypto seriously, you know it’s arrived.The moves to broaden the use of cryptocurrencies might be too late though. Chris Larsen, co-founder and chairman at Ripple, has warned that US regulation is causing it to lose the technological Cold War. China’s digital currency, he says, could replace the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency.Meanwhile, other countries are already moving forward. Canadian restaurant chain Tahini’s has decided to convert all of its cash reserves into Bitcoin. And in India, the crypto peer-to-peer market has tripled since the beginning of the year. No wonder Binance has launched a new hackathon in the country and is setting up an accelerator for the country’s decentralized finance ecosystem.It’s not all good news, though. Inner Mongolian miners are going to have to do without cheap electricity.In better news, Deepak Chopra has been talking about using the blockchain to help fight mental health problems caused by Covid-19. And an interesting simulation has found the Satoshi Nakamoto used a single PC to mine 1.1 million Bitcoins.

535,"Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped by as much as 10% this week and while this might be scary for day traders, the 3-day chart shows the downside move hardly made a dent on the current market structure.This holds especially true when considering that the $12,500 level hasn't been touched in over 13 months. Currently, analysts are making $16,000 price targets partially due to a CME gap and the expectation that U.S. inflation will rise higher.Bitcoin 3-days chart, USD.

This data provides further evidence that whales aren't getting liquidated by the recent 10% negative move.Surely there will be some selling pressure as Bitcoin (BTC) consolidates after the 28% rally that occurred over the last two weeks of July. Even during the massive 240% 3-month bull run that started early April 2019, there were four occasions of 9% or higher short-term corrections.Nonetheless, both on-chain data and top traders sentiment via derivatives remain bullish.

536,"This week’s headlines from Japan included one of country's leaders describing Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto's dream as meaningful, LayerX Labs collaborating with a Japanese university for blockchain research, the FINSUM blockchain conference hosts notable discussion on security tokens offerings, and the head of Monex Group saying Japan is falling behind the U.S. on STOs. Check out some of this week’s crypto and blockchain headlines, originally reported by Cointelegraph Japan.At the end of Tokyo's 2020 Blockchain Global Governance Conference, or BG2C, also called FINSUM, Ryozo Himino, the secretary of Japan's Financial Services Agency, said Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto's dream has aged well. ""I think Satoshi's dream is more meaningful today,"" Himino said on Aug. 25, closing out the two-day summit. The leader touched on a bevy of points during his speech, including the aspect of trust in the move to online meetings instead of in-person ones — the result of COID-19.LayerX Labs, under blockchain company LayerX, has teamed up with the Suto Lab at the Tokyo Institute of Technology to look into blockchain consensus algorithms, an Aug. 28 statement from LayerX said. The move seeks to benefit the public blockchain arena.   ""In this collaborative research, we will utilize the public blockchain simulator 'SimBlock' developed by Suto Laboratory to evaluate the safety and performance of cutting-edge consensus algorithms such as Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake protocol 'Casper,'"" the statement explained. Security Token Offerings, or STOs were a hot topic at the FINSUM fintech conference on Aug. 24 and 25. One segment discussed security tokens' potential in the real estate sector, with authority comments on the ability to spread out property ownership through such tokens, spurring growth in the market.Shunichi Yukawa, the general manager for Mitsui Fudosan Solution Planning Office detailed that security tokens make more properties and buildings available and enticing investments. The event also hosted other comments and discussion on security tokens. Giving a talk at the FINSUM conference, Daisuke Matsumoto, the CEO of Tokyo-based financial services company Monex Group, said Japan needs to pick up its innovative pace when it comes to STOs. ""The United States is moving ahead and Japan is lagging behind,"" he said. Matsumoto attributed the U.S.' progression to adapting regulatory guidelines, as well as the country seeing value in innovation. "
537,"Cryptocurrency was built on the premise that a reimagined financial system could exist. It was brought to life by a community that supported these ideals and worked tirelessly to bring them to fruition.As the blockchain community grows, so does the recognition that cryptocurrency is important. According to Big Four audit firm Deloitte’s “2020 Global Blockchain Survey,” more than half of those surveyed believe that digital assets will be very important, while almost 89% of respondents feel that digital assets will be important to their industries in the next three years.Cryptocurrency remains the priority for the blockchain space within traditional financial hubs, such as Hong Kong SAR and Singapore, as outlined in Deloitte’s report. Such growing acceptance and support for blockchain and digital assets globally have proved to be important to adoption and advancements within the ecosystem.The community has played a pivotal role in developing blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies since their inception. It is now imperative that the industry continues to recognize the important role the community will play in the further development and adoption of the digital asset space. There is still much that the industry as a whole can do to further spur growth within the community.Cryptocurrencies were designed to be decentralized without any connection to a centralized third party. Forming the bedrock for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), decentralization allows users to transact digital assets directly with another user without the need for a third party, like a bank, to be involved.This has led to a decentralized form of finance that enables a more open and transparent financial system supported by decentralized technologies like blockchain. Decentralized finance provides more inclusive access to financial services and credit at a lower cost. This includes smart contracts, protocols, decentralized applications and digital currencies, such as Bitcoin and stablecoins, notably Tether (USDT), whose growing usage in DeFi is indicative of the pivotal role that it plays in the nascent sector.Decentralization also sees projects driven by community ideals, ensuring a free flow of information within the community. Community-driven development has given developers control over the development process, while the resources and decision-making authority are directly in the hands of the community.There have been many examples of projects and exchanges in the industry that have taken a community-first stance to development, product offerings and overall day-to-day operations. For example, the ethos of Bitfinex has always been to remain driven by its community and to be designed for its community. Bitfinex is now one of the most advanced and most liquid exchanges in the world.Polkadot built a community of anticipated followers and is now expected to be the most anticipated project since Bitcoin and Ethereum, which is transitioning to Ethereum 2.0 with the support of its dedicated community.An important sub-community is crypto traders. Understanding the needs and feedback of trading communities, many projects and exchanges are now focused on creating a place for traders to communicate with one another. This has helped the industry flourish while creating a pathway for new tokens, projects and digital assets.This focus on community building has led to the creation of crypto-centric social networks, such as Bitfinex Pulse, and has led to the creation of Reddit communities for nearly every project in the industry. These platforms have opened up a dialogue for the next generation of traders, facilitating a free flow of ideas and providing real-time, high-quality market intelligence for the benefit of the entire trading community.Ultimately, innovation comes from outside and within. Innovation is vital within industries because it gives companies an edge in penetrating markets faster. Innovation can also provide better connectivity to developing markets, possibly leading to bigger opportunities. Listening to the opinions and needs of the community can facilitate and accelerate innovation within an industry.The pressure to innovate, challenge and self-disrupt are intense, especially as the blockchain industry transforms at an exhausting rate.By taking the time and effort to build and listen to the community, companies and industries can tap into a pool of diverse voices and new ideas to drive innovation. The same is true for the blockchain industry as well.Building the blockchain community has led to many new innovations and further adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. This intense focus on community building can only help the digital asset space to fulfill its immense potential.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
538,"Chris Maurice, CEO of Nigeria-based crypto exchange Yellow Card, made his first business venture into the crypto space back in 2015, selling Bitcoin (BTC) on eBay.""We did that for about a week and we did over $40,000 in sales at a 100% markup,"" Maurice told Cointelegraph in an interview. ""We were seeing stars at this point,"" he recounted, describing his euphoria at the time. The CEO first learned about Bitcoin in 2013 through a friend — Justin Poiroux, the co-founder of Yellow Card exchange, although Yellow Card was not formed until later, unrelated to the eBay endeavor. While surfing eBay in 2015, Maurice saw BTC selling on the site for triple its going market rate at the time.Coming up with an idea for profit, Maurice explained,After the mentioned initial success of BTC sales on eBay, however, the situation started unravelling. ""That's when I learned what a credit card chargeback is,"" he explained. ""People were just stealing credit cards online, coming to us on eBay and charging the cards,"" he said. ""When PayPal found out, they pulled the money back from us, and then we had already sent the Bitcoin.""""Of course that was how I also learned just how irreversible Bitcoin is,"" he added. ""Credit cards, not so much.""Credit card chargebacks essentially allow parties to take their funds back after a making transaction. Bitcoin does not host the same feature — both a benefit and a drawback, depending on the situation.""That was my first foray into crypto,"" Maurice said.Although evidently not especially feasible, the eBay endeavor shows a profitable early example of arbitrage, a common trading tactic used to profit on price discrepancies seen across exchanges and other avenues.

539,"As the price of Bitcoin (BTC) showed weakness in the past week, the crucial support zone around $11,200, nevertheless, held. Several arguments were given for the volatility throughout the week with Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole and the expiration of futures and options occurring over the past few days.But more importantly, the crucial support level at $11,200 didn’t break, which means the focus now shifts back toward the resistance level at $12,000.Crypto market daily performance. Source: Coin360The crucial support area has held again as the daily Bitcoin price chart shows.BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe daily chart shows a clear resistance zone between $11,800-12,000 as well as the support zone, found between $11,100-11,300. This level has also been previously confirmed as support as well.The $11,100-11,300 area had to hold once more as a drop below this area would almost certainly guarantee a big drop. That’s because, given the previous near-vertical rally, few support zones are found between $10,100 and $11,000.If the price of Bitcoin drops below the green zone, a heavy drop towards the level of $10,100-10,300 wouldn’t be a surprise. What’s more, the entire upward trend is lost, as well as the range-bound structure, which would likely mean a steep drop.But since the support level is holding again, the next step for Bitcoin would be a breakout above $11,800-12,000 to make a new higher high.BTC/USD 2-hour chart.

Once again, it held and created a double bottom pattern, signaling a potential short-term trend reversal.However, the chart’s upper side shows that the $11,650 area is a strong zone of resistance.

However, to have a short term trend reversal, a new higher high is needed. Such a higher high will be established if the price holds $11,300 as support and breaks $11,700.If that occurs, the price of Bitcoin makes new higher highs and higher lows and that’s classified as an uptrend. An apparent breakthrough in this resistance zone would then put $12,000 in the crosshairs.BTC/USD 2-hour bearish scenario chart. Source: TradingViewThe bearish scenario is the opposite. Since the fake breakout above $12,000, the momentum is still downward, which may see the price of Bitcoin drop further.However, as the U.S. dollar is weakening, further downward momentum becomes increasingly unlikely for Bitcoin. If the price of BTC wants more downside, however, a rejection at the $11,600 will need to happen.If that occurs and a new lower low (a drop below the previous low at $11,100) happens, more downside becomes likely. In that scenario, a rejection at $11,300 would confirm such a scenario.If $11,000 is lost, potential levels of support will then be found between $10,100-10,400  and $9,600-9,800, where the CME futures gap still remains.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

540,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) is approaching the last weekly candle for the month of August. Some traders believe Bitcoin’s performance over the next two weeks could decide whether its price drops below $10,000 again or sees an extended uptrend.The week’s weekly candle close coincides with the expiration of CME’s Bitcoin futures contracts and Deribit’s options contracts. It could potentially set a precedent for September, especially if Bitcoin closes above or below key levels.In the short term, technical analysts generally consider $11,800 as the key level for Bitcoin. A high time frame close below the level would raise the chances of a deeper pullback. A close above it, maintaining a green monthly candle, could cause Bitcoin to see another leg up.Mohit Sorout, a founding partner at Bitazu Capital, said in a tweet that a rally to $11,800 would “put sellers to sleep.” Sorout referred to the daily chart of Bitcoin with Bollinger Bands, showing the area of interest for both sellers and buyers.With just a few days left until the monthly close, the Bitcoin futures market remains cautious. Typically, the number of long contract holders in the futures market outweigh short-sellers. Data from Bybt shows longs represent 53.36% of the market, which shows traders are cautious, heading into September with three major scenarios on the cards. For Bitcoin to maintain its upward momentum in the near term, traders say BTC’s price primarily needs to recover back above the $11,800 support-turned-resistance level. If that happens, traders foresee another potential move to $12,500. However, some other traders believe that the major support trendline of Bitcoin places the next support area at around $10,900. Thus, if BTC stays above the $10,900-to-$11,500 range, it would maintain its short-term bull scenario.A cryptocurrency trader known as “John Wick” believes investors are not considering the higher time frames, as the weekly chart, which uses Bitcoin’s $3,600 bottom in March and $9,130 local bottom in July as basis points, shows a supporting trendline. As long as the trendline does not break intensely in the short term, the trader hinted in a tweet that this could be an optimistic market structure.Cryptocurrency analyst Nunya Bizniz suggested a similar scenario in a higher time frame. If the current monthly candle structure follows previous formations, the analyst said there is a chance it marks the start of a newfound bull run. That would indicate that Bitcoin’s price potentially sees a stable climb over the next six to 12 months, tweeting:“BTC Monthly: VWAP anchored to previous cycle highs. A successful retest of the AVWAP has lead to bull markets. Does the current month satisfy the retest and will it lead to a bull run [this] time? Note: Grey vertical line = halving.”However, one variable in the expectations of a 2017-like rally is that the second halving occurred in mid-2016. If a similar trend were to emerge, the chances of Bitcoin seeing a proper rally are higher in late 2021, rather than during the upcoming winter.In the short term, traders started to show signs of caution following Bitcoin’s drop below $11,500. A trader known as “Mayne” said that the initial decline of Bitcoin to $11,400 is not a trend bulls want to see. Since then, Bitcoin has seen a consecutive lower high pattern, which typically shows slowing momentum. Mayne tweeted: “Price with a false break high and now stair stepping down. Last 2 up moves seem like clear bearish retests. If this is distribution, expect the selling to pick up speed soon. Bulls need to come in and regain $11.7.”A lower high formation refers to when the price peaks at a lower price than the previous high. Bitcoin’s daily candle closed at $11,748 on Aug. 24, while the following three daily candles all closed under $11,500, forming a lower high pattern. Bitcoin would have to break above $11,800 to cancel out the lower high pattern, which makes it a critical short-term level.The slowing momentum of Bitcoin since its peak in mid-August coincides with declining address activity. CNBC’s Brian Kelly have used the daily address activity on the Bitcoin blockchain as a key fundamental metric for some time. Since May, the address activity on the Bitcoin network has noticeably declined, as data by Santiment shows it has dropped by nearly half, clarifying that the decline in address activity is a sign of caution that network activity is seeing a slump. The company tweeted: “The -3.7% price was surely related to this metric’s -19.3% decline since its peak of 1.13M active addresses back on August 6th.”The confluence of lower highs on the daily chart, slowing fundamental metrics and the consolidation of Bitcoin under $11,800 is seemingly swaying the market to become more cautious.As an alternative scenario, some investors believe Bitcoin could see months of low volatility before the next big price movement. Dan Tepiero, a co-founder of 10T Holdings, said that every price cycle in the past took around 800 to 1,100 days to complete. Bitcoin is currently less than 400 days into the cycle, which indicates that BTC could range sideways for the next three to 12 months. If the price of Bitcoin continues to remain stagnant, some foresee an extended altcoin season. The Bitcoin dominance index is a concern for altcoins in the foreseeable future, as it is approaching key technical support levels. But, historically, altcoins have prospered during a Bitcoin consolidation phase.Related: Alt season is here? DeFi tokens taking on Bitcoin for crypto dominanceTepiero urges everyone to be patient with Bitcoin, tweeting: “Each up cycle takes longer to play out and is less extreme as absolute dollar value gets much larger. May or may not be another 6-12 months before price breaks up. Should not matter as end price point obscenely higher. Hodlers rejoice.”Traders remain mixed as Bitcoin enters September, which, historically, has been a slow month. In previous years, BTC often saw an uptrend in August, followed by consolidation until November. The tendency of BTC to stagnate throughout the last quarter of the year is reflected by the lack of decisiveness in the futures market."

The most recent cycle has just surpassed 300 days, which suggests it could last 3-12 more months.If Bitcoin’s price remains stable for several months to potentially a year, it could achieve two things. First, it could strengthen the fundamental ground of the next explosive rally as seen between 2016 and 2017. Second, it could cause other cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, to reach new heights, as some investors predict.The price of Bitcoin was at a mere $3,596 on BitMEX on March 13. Within six months, BTC has recorded a 220% upsurge, outperforming most traditional assets and indices including gold.The weekly price chart of Bitcoin. Source: TradingView.comThe steep vertical rally of Bitcoin could raise the chances of whales — or large individual Bitcoin holders — to take profit. When that happens, the overleveraged nature of the futures market may result in a deep pullback due to cascading liquidations.But if BTC gradually recovers over time and remains above the $10,000 support level, it could lead to a more sustainable and long-lasting bull cycle. 10% Holdings co-founder Dan Tepiero said:“Prepare to be patient in Bitcoin. Each up cycle takes longer to play out and is less extreme as absolute dollar value gets much larger. May or may not be another 6-12 months before price breaks up. Should not matter as end price point obscenely higher. Hodlers rejoice.”As an example, the past two cycles occurred around the Bitcoin block reward halving.

Source: Dan Tepiero, Coin MetricsIf Bitcoin follows a similar trend as the post-2016 halving cycle, it could see a strong uptrend in late 2021. This would also line up perfectly with the popular stock-to-flow model that suggests BTC price may reach six figures sometime next year. In the short term, some traders foresee the price of Bitcoin consolidating for an extended period. A pseudonymous trader known as “BIg Chronis” said higher time frame charts suggest a longer sideways price action.“Holding the daily bull cross is ideal for the bulls, sideways price action can bring these into parallel without crossing, while allowing higher time frame indicators to ebb their decline... ie- I expect relative sideways ranging for a while longer.”Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, similarly said the cycle will likely last longer than the previous one. He said:“The fun part is that this cycle will, probably, take longer than the previous one. However, it will be more insane than the previous one. I like it.”Typically, a prolonged period of stability for Bitcoin has led the altcoin market to perform strongly. Kelvin Koh, a partner at Asia-based cryptocurrency fund Spartan Black, hinted it could buoy the sentiment around the altcoin market."

Nevertheless, this is strikingly opposite from the July expiry when $500 million worth of futures contracts were liquidated.The main reason behind such traders’ indifference to today’s expiry seems to be the failure to establish support levels above $11,200 over the past few weeks.

544,"It's been six years since Hal Finney passed away from the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS. Finney is known as an early supporter of Bitcoin (BTC), and one of the first people to respond to Satoshi Nakamoto's initial post on the cypherpunk mailing list. In Bitcoin's earliest days, he was the only one who fully understood the possibilities of the technology, without being overtly skeptical about its prospects. Finney was one of the better-known cryptographers in the cypherpunk community even prior to his involvement with Bitcoin. Early in his career, he worked for PGP Corporation, which owned Pretty Good Privacy software or PGP. The software allowed users to encrypt their texts, emails and files. In 2004, Finney developed Reusable Proofs of Work software or RPOW. It built on the proof-of-work concept developed by Adam Back in Hashcash by introducing reusability, hence the name. This was one of the stepping stones to Bitcoin; interestingly though, Satoshi did not cite Finney's work in his white paper.Cryptographer Adam Back told Cointelegraph that he had had some email exchanges with Finney over the years, including a request for Back to comment on RPOW. Though they never met in person, Back remembers Finney fondly:Apparently, Finney was the first person outside of Satoshi to start mining Bitcoin, he was also the recipient of the first transaction. In 2009, he was diagnosed with ALS. At first, the disease progression was slow, but last months of his life, Finney spent completely paralyzed. In his farewell post on Bitcointalk.org, he downplayed his involvement in Bitcoin. After he died in 2014, Finney's body was cryopreserved.Prior to his death, Finney and his wife Fran worked to raise awareness and fundraising for ALS. Since his departure, Fran Finney has continued her husband's legacy."
545,"Taras Kulyk, Senior Vice President of Blockchain Business Development at Core Scientific, says that the countries competing to become leaders in the Blockchain space vary greatly in what they can offer to crypto miners.During an interview with Cointelegraph, Kulyk stated that global diversification of hashrate has been increasing as countries around the world vie for control of the crypto mining industry.Kulyk believes that China has been a desirable hub for crypto mining due to specific factors it enjoys, specifically the low cost of labor, access to units, and decreased cost of power during the rainy season, but he clarified:“One key economic concern driving recent crackdowns by authorities is theft of power which local politicians then have to clamp down. Another key economic concern driving regulatory uncertainty is capital control issues. Both of these have made the current regulatory environment in China uncertain for digital mining companies.”Turmoil at the highest level of politics in any country or jurisdiction will likely cause the existing operators to reduce planned capital expenditure or worse, shut down and relocate, says Kulyk.He pointed out that crypto mining “is extremely capital intensive, meaning that operators require stability over long periods of time to ensure their deployed capital recoups and provides an ROI.” He also warned that political unrest “can disrupt this much-needed stability.”Kulyk noted how new regulations have impacted country-specific competitors such as Iran, Ukraine, Canada, and Kazakhstan:“Generally, we’re seeing the regulatory burden for digital mining easing off, as it’s increasingly viewed as a way to reinvigorate sunset industry assets into being useful in the technology 2.0 economy. Governments are turning to their regulatory policy, particularly making their policy more favorable to mining, in order to gain competitive advantages over other players in the mining industry.”As regulatory clarity emerges around crypto mining, Kulyk believes that “we’ll continue to see institutional investors allocate portfolio room to leaders in the space,” and concluded that:“The stronger the leadership team and transparency around ownership and operations, the more likely a company will be a target for investors who are looking to get involved with digital mining.”"
546,"Bitcoin derivatives witnessed a major expiry event with a notional value of over $1 billion. Today, $272 million of Bitcoin futures expired on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while over 65,000 Bitcoin options contracts expired across Deribit, CME and OKEx, having a notional value of over $740 million.Usually, major expiry events bring about a considerable change in volatility and price that can be seen through derivatives volumes, open interest and even put/call ratios. The Bitcoin (BTC) derivatives market, consisting mainly of Bitcoin futures and options, has grown multifold in 2020. This growth has seen the relationship between BTC’s price and the derivatives market deepen.Prior to expiry, around 60% of the options set for expiry were said to be “out of the money,” which means that 60% of these options have a strike price higher than the market price of Bitcoin. This reduces the chances of major volatility of the underlying asset, as it doesn’t make sense for these options to be exercised at higher than market prices. While if these options would mostly be “in the money,” it would entail that their strike price would be lower than the market price, making it lucrative for the investors, thus increasing volatility.Another indicator of expected volatility implications of a major expiry event in the derivatives market would be the concept of the maximum pain theory, which is a calculation methodology that shows the price level at which option buyers would suffer the greatest amount of financial losses. It’s an excellent metric to gauge price implications, as it reflects all the open interest for a particular expiry date and does not reflect any specific investor’s portfolio. Luuk Strijers, the chief commercial officer of Deribit, discussed the expiration with Cointelegraph, stating:“Looking at max pain, it indicates that no big impact is to be expected if BTC expires within a USD 9K–12K range. Some are hypothesizing that the August monthly calls that have flipped to ‘in the money’ from the large upward move in the last month can cause momentary price distortions in the futures, as counterparts hedge their deltas differently during the settlement period.”As expected, Bitcoin was well within that range post expiry of the derivatives, rising from $11,367 at expiry to around $11,500, which is a critical resistance level. This is indicative that the bullish sentiment in the market continues to hold among investors post expiry. Average options volumes were observed on Deribit over the past day, with 17,000 options being tradedOpen interest is the number of outstanding futures/options in the market at the end of each trading day. It’s often indicative of the market sentiment and the significance of the price trends noticed. According to data from Skew, leading up to this major expiry event, open interest for options has a positive trend while that for futures has a negative trend. This trend is noticed in OI for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.Open interest for Bitcoin options hit their all-time high at $2.1 billion on July 31, after which OI declined in August before hitting $2 billion again on Aug. 20, continuing holding this level until the expiry date. While high open interest is usually perceived to be a sign that markets can lean toward being bullish or bearish, Jay Hao, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange OKEx, told Cointelegraph:“A bearish market on Bitcoin will not reduce the amount of OI. On the contrary, the stronger the sentiment of bearishness or bullishness, the stronger the demand for trader transactions, which may increase OI.”A factor that boosted the open interest of BTC options may be the fact that Deribit, the crypto derivatives market leader, slashed its expiry fees for this major expiry event. Strijers confirmed the sentiment by saying: “Deribit has reduced expiry fees by 25% of which the effect will become clearly visible for all holders of OI this Friday.”Since the options market is deeply related to how the futures are priced, it’s undeniable that these markets are correlated. As this end of month expiry was significant in terms of size for both futures and options, it would be interesting to note which one had a larger impact on the price and volatility of BTC. The simplicity of futures, when compared to a complex financial product like options, becomes the main feature of this subject, according to Hao:“At present, the implication of futures expiry is more prominent than options delivery because, in general, users understand futures better than options. At present, the main participants in options are institutional traders. The number of participants, trading volume and liquidity in the options market are far smaller than futures.”Although, this phenomenon is subject to change as the crypto derivatives market grows and the institutional interest piques further. According to Hao: “As the derivatives market matures, we believe that more experienced investors will participate in the options market.”Even though the price implications of this expiry event were not drastic, there are investors who benefited from this expiry. Cointelegraph discussed this further with Shaun Fernando, the head of risk and product strategy at Deribit, who spoke of the positions options that investors held to make profits during this expiry: “Short BTC option holders benefitted, as Bitcoin didn’t cross the 11,250 nor 11,500 strikes.” Fernando elaborated further on the activity in the futures:“Despite low volatility in the index during the settlement period, there was a lot of activity in the futures (including perpetual), as large numbers of deltas had to be traded.”When compared to the traditional futures market, where the delivery of futures contracts requires liquidation and/or shifting of the underlying asset, creating a huge opportunity for arbitrage, for BTC futures, the arbitrage opportunity doesn’t exist due to the digitized nature of the asset. Another big differentiator is the difference in volume between the futures market and the spot market. While the futures market is several times larger than the spot market in traditional markets, for Bitcoin, the size of the futures market is very small in comparison. Hao discussed this reduced impact in Bitcoin futures markets, elaborating: “Although the derivatives market in the crypto space has been relatively prosperous, the number of users who really participate in arbitrage is not very large, so this tidal effect is not very obvious.”However, the size of derivatives markets continues to impact the Bitcoin spot market, as seen in the case of Ether derivatives where Ether (ETH) options have seen phenomenal growth in 2020 on the back of anticipation of the network upgrade to Ethereum 2.0. Hao echoed this analogy:“The spot price affects the price of futures (including futures and options). We can prove this by looking at the ETH options market. The bullish sentiment on ETH in the entire market a while ago was very strong, and this sentiment led to an increase in ETH spot prices.”This expiry event may not have had major immediate price implications, but it increasingly stresses the importance of the growth of the Bitcoin derivatives market and the need for investors to further their understanding of the same in order to benefit from such events."
547,"In his speech on Aug. 27, U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said that the central bank will allow inflation to stay above its 2% target level if the figure has been languishing below that level for a long time. Some analysts believe that this could mean no rate hikes for at least five years.  In response to the speech, the U.S.dollar index (DXY) resumed its downtrend while gold is trading in the black. This shows that traders believe that the central bank’s change in strategy could debase the dollar further, hence, the demand for gold as a store of value remains intact.Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss believes that eventually, Bitcoin (BTC) will overtake gold as the store of value due to its inherent advantages. Bitcoin’s current market capitalization is just above $200 billion while gold’s market cap is roughly $9 trillion. That means Bitcoin will have to rise 45-fold to $500,000 to reach the desired target objective, according to Winklevoss.Daily cryptocurrency market performance.

Even if institutional investors only allocate 1% of their funds into Bitcoin, it could spark a sharp rally.So, is this a good time for retail traders to consider buying, or could the crypto market enter a period of correction? Let’s study the charts to find out.Although Bitcoin had been trading below the 20-day exponential moving average ($11,530) for the past two days, the bears could not sink the price below the $11,000 support, which suggests that bulls are buying on dips.

548,"This week was quite eventful for crypto and traditional markets, and investors will note that as central banks introduce new monetary expansion policy, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins have begun to forge their own path. Before reading the rundown, catch up on the most-read stories centered around the price of Bitcoin, the macroeconomic picture and the DeFi phenomenon gaining traction. Central bank policies first crafted in the wake of the Great Recession, which were then seen as extraordinary, have become ordinary — and concerns are creeping in from all corners of the globe.Quantitative easing, low interest rates for prolonged periods, stimulus payments and other actions have increasingly been used to prop up the economy, jobs and financial markets ailing from government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. This has caused the United States Federal Reserve and Treasury Department to once again rewrite fiscal policy rules to keep the country from sinking under the weight of what seemed to be almost certain financial collapse. The scope of these efforts is a sharp turn from previous measures such as TARP that focused largely on the financial industry — and they’ve led us to a seminal moment for Bitcoin and other digital assets.That chill you feel isn’t the end of summer; it’s a collective shiver after remarks made this week by Fed officials in Jackson Hole.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged the Fed’s new approach this week, explaining that the onus is on bolstering the U.S. labor market with fewer worries about an uptick in inflation.Tellingly, while Powell acknowledged that past declines in unemployment led to concerns about rising inflation and prompted the Fed to raise interest rates, the central bank will no longer take such actions.This is a potentially frightening prospect for anyone interested in the value of money and has seen the disastrous effects of an unrestrained expansion of the money supply in countries such as Venezuela, Russia, Brazil and elsewhere. The reason why it matters for digital assets is two-fold: technology and anti-inflation potential — an ability to tap into unbanked communities and spread the “credit and confidence.” In terms of market reaction, longer-term U.S. Treasury yields climbed to their highest levels in months on Thursday, steepening the yield curve, after Powell announced this new policy framework promoting higher inflation to spur economic recovery and job creation.Cryptocurrency market weekly performance snapshot. Source: Coin360Going forward, it is worth keeping an eye on the broader commodities complex and also how expectations develop. Correlations that may apply now may no longer be true, especially those related to inflation.Not surprisingly, Bitcoin (BTC) and gold traded in lock-step for much of the session, initially spiking higher before reversing and falling to new session lows.Another week brought another wave of capital inflows to DeFi projects. The total amount locked is now at $7.22 billion, and the top three assets — which include the likes of Aave, Maker and Curve — have over $1 billion locked each. Total value locked in DeFi (USD). Source: Defi PulseThe total number of Bitcoin locked in the ecosystem has now risen to 46,086, with Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) accounting for 30,798, followed by renBTC with 8,408. Surprisingly, even though transaction costs on the Ethereum network have fallen from recent highs, it failed to translate into a meaningful rise in trading volumes on decentralized exchanges.This suggests that the market likely pressured out smaller participants and is now dominated by larger funds and token holders. As such, future growth is more of a byproduct of innovation and further development of the underlying infrastructure — capital flows do not seem to be an issue, as evidenced by ongoing growth across just about every known DeFi platform.According to the latest post by the CME Group, the number of unique accounts that have traded Bitcoin futures since launch exceeds 5,400. As new participants enter the market, the number of large open interest holders (LOIHs) continues to grow. And on that note, a record number of 94 holders was established the week of Aug. 18.CME BTC futures open interest and volume. Source: SkewFurthermore, the number of LOIHs has risen sharply since Q4 2019, which indicates growing institutional interest because an LOIH is a holder of at least 25 contracts. A record number of 94 holders was established the week of Aug. 18. In addition to that, along with the rise in LOIHs, average daily open interest has been steadily increasing since March and for the last four months has exceeded average daily volume (ADV).  Open Interest reached a record of 15,406 contracts (77,030 equivalent Bitcoin) on Aug. 17 and is averaging 13,672 contracts for the month, a 40% increase from July. ADV in August is 9,570 contracts (47,850 equivalent Bitcoin), up roughly 30% from July.Disclaimer.

549,"Transaction costs on the Ethereum blockchain are at record highs, and no one will let you forget it. Reports often detail how decentralized finance platforms are the cause of ever-rising gas fees — tokens paid to miners who confirm and enable transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Yes, DeFi does play a role, but the problem is institutional. Some exchanges, custodians and asset managers have been using multisignature platforms to secure their digital assets. Several years ago, multisig was viewed as a respected attempt to prevent private keys from being compromised. Despite initial adoption, numerous shortcomings have made institutions both question and transition from the multisig approach, in many cases replacing it with multiparty computation, or MPC, infrastructure.Among many disadvantages, multisig platforms are not natively supported on the Ethereum blockchain. Instead, institutions are required to execute smart contracts that implement the multisig logic — i.e., a smart contract that accepts deposits and requires multiple signatures to withdraw from it.Creating these multisig smart contracts to secure exchange clients’ funds involves gas fees, which cost millions of dollars. But it’s not just people’s wallets that have been suffering. Because fees are denominated in Ether (ETH), a more congested network may lead to slower development of Ethereum-based projects.Creating a multisig wallet implemented as a smart contract costs over 1 million gas units (approximately $30 at current value). In addition, every deposit or withdrawal costs more than 100,000 gas units. Therefore, multisig institutions end up paying a higher fee, given they have chosen to use a smart contract function.In contrast to the creation of a single signature MPC wallet, there are no wallet creation fees and deposits, and withdrawals cost a standard 21,000 gas units.Given gas deposit fees are paid by end-users, any institution implementing a smart contract may initially think this wallet creation fee is simply a one-time operation. Unfortunately, there is still another major issue with multisig addresses on the Ethereum network that results in another unnecessary fee: attribution.When an institution such as an exchange wants to identify deposits from different users, it creates a unique receive address for each client.Unlike the Bitcoin network and other blockchains, Ethereum does not permit a transaction to include multiple inputs. Therefore, institutions will instead forward all deposits from each client’s unique receive address to a secure address where withdrawals are made.The usual workaround to receive addresses for institutions is to use a forwarding contract or a way to forward any incoming funds to a new location (the omnibus multisig wallet). While this achieves attribution, it’s also one more smart contract that needs to be implemented.Creating a forwarding contract costs around 200,000 gas units; depositing the forwarding contract costs approximately 60,000 gas units. These are all needless costs, further congesting the Ethereum blockchain.Suppose a new crypto exchange is seeking to establish its Ethereum wallet infrastructure with a separate receive address for each client. Based on the above pricing, if the exchange used a multisig infrastructure, it would pay $6 every time it signed up a new client and created a new receive address for them. This is before the client even deposits any funds.The exchange will likely view this as part of its customer acquisition costs or the cost of doing business (if they’re even aware of this incurred cost, to begin with).A recent report states that Coinbase has 35 million customers. At today’s prices, it would cost $245 million to set up a multisig infrastructure to support said clients — whether or not these clients choose to conduct transactions.As with any maturing market, institutions have experienced increased fee compression over time, and firms have been seeking methods to scale their business at a lower cost without compromising on security.If institutions could reassess their underlying infrastructure and consider a solution that is not dependent on an individual blockchain for support, they could easily reduce expenditure and limit infrastructure set-up fees. Gas fee payments to simply mirror multisig infrastructure on Ethereum would become a thing of the past.Using alternative systems would go a long way in reducing the congestion on the second-largest blockchain.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
550,"With Bitcoin dropping below the $12,000 level and pulling back to $11,400 in the last few days, altcoins also seem to have lost their momentum, even after their impressive gains since the start of 2020. However, some believe that “alt season” is alive and well and that cryptocurrencies still have room to grow, even after tokens like Chainlink and others have grown by more than 100%.The rising price of the dollar may have been the major reason for the recent drop in Bitcoin’s (BTC) price, with safe-haven assets such as gold having dropped as well. However, many believe that a pullback for the dollar is likely, especially with the U.S. stock market being so overvalued. As such, it is possible that alt season will resume alongside Bitcoin regaining its momentum.While an alt season is characterized by altcoins outperforming Bitcoin, this usually takes place when the price of Bitcoin itself is rising in value. Most major altcoins are correlated with Bitcoin, and when BTC rises, some altcoins jump even higher, and vice versa. Jonathan Hobbs, author of The Crypto Portfolio and former digital asset fund manager, told Cointelegraph that the boom can be attributed to three factors:So, what is driving the recent surge, and does it affect only specific groups of tokens or assets with certain characteristics? Here’s a deeper look into the apparent alt season as Bitcoin dominance continues to slip to a yearly low.In 2017, as the price of Bitcoin rose to its all-time high, several other digital assets also began to gain traction, many of which related to initial coin offerings or other forms of fundraising. Some of these assets outperformed Bitcoin tremendously and even continued to gain value as BTC began to drop.BTC began to lose market capitalization dominance in February 2017, dropping from 86% at that time to the 50%–60% range by the end of 2017, during the rally. Following its crash in price, Bitcoin’s dominance dropped to less than 35% in January 2018 before recovering throughout 2018 and 2019.While Bitcoin’s dominance has been decreasing since the start of 2020, it’s currently sitting at 58%, far from its lower levels in 2018. The market is also different from what it was in 2017, as exchanges and other venues have raised their standards and regulated options for altcoin investment have proliferated. Ryan Watkins, research analyst at Messari, told Cointelegraph that projects themselves are also showing major improvements:During 2017, hype and greed fueled much of the rally. As ICOs made spectacular returns for investors, more money poured into the altcoin market. Fear of missing out led many to invest during this time, and while many were left holding hefty bags of worthless tokens — most of which was on the Ethereum blockchain — there are still more Ether (ETH) wallets holding a profit than there are Bitcoin wallets with funds. According to Ilya Abugov, open data lead at analytics platform DappRadar, the previous alt season was created by hype and there are some similarities to the current one. He told Cointelegraph:While the 2017 alt season affected digital assets in several subsets of the cryptosphere, current rallies seem to be, in one way or another, related to the decentralized finance space, especially since the advent of yield farming, which saw Compound’s COMP token double its price in the first week of trading.Other governance tokens related to DeFi have also outperformed Bitcoin, including Aave’s LEND, which has risen by almost 5,000% this year, and yEarn Finance’s YFI token, which has surpassed the price of Bitcoin per unit at a market cap of roughly $425 million, rising more than 300% in the past month and over 15,400% in its first week of trading.However, it’s not only governance and reward tokens that are surging. Infrastructure projects such as Chainlink’s LINK, which provides a network of decentralized oracles needed for some DeFi applications like insurance, have also been gaining traction. Waves has also seen growth on the back of its DeFi cross-chain project, Neutrino USD (NUSD), which aims to bring stability and interoperability to the DeFi ecosystem. According to Watkins, the alt season has been mainly driven by the growth of decentralized finance: “DeFi has already triggered an alt season. The excitement is causing everyone to take a second look at every category in crypto, of course with DeFi leading the way.”As such, one could say that DeFi is to the current alt season what ICOs were to 2017’s alt season. However, it’s worth noting that price surges, although impressive, are still considerably small when compared with 2017. It’s also worth noting that while DeFi has been growing exponentially, the amount of funds locked in DeFi is still small compared with the numbers generated by ICOs in late 2017. There is currently over $7 billion worth of tokens locked in DeFi protocols, while the ICO of EOS alone raised a record-breaking $4.1 billion.While DeFi may not be as hyped up as ICOs were, there are still a number of concerns that could signal the demise of DeFi if not dealt with. There are still many security issues within the DeFi ecosystem that have resulted in faulty protocols and malicious attack vectors for several projects, and governance is also a growing concern within the space. There is also the question of Ethereum’s sustainability, as the blockchain continues to be under more pressure.The current hype is also concerning, especially in a market where a cryptocurrency such as Dogecoin (DOGE) can be pumped through a social media challenge and memes take the form of real projects. There is no question that mindless speculation is a huge part of the current alt season, if there is one going on. Ben Zhou, co-founder and CEO of Bybit, a crypto futures trading platform, told Cointelegraph that DeFi tokens are indeed driving the altseason. He added:Institutional interest and investment options for altcoins are also on the rise. With institutional money flowing in, it’s possible that a lasting alt season may be triggered. For example, open interest for Ether options contracts has more than quintupled in the last three months, sitting at around $450 million.Back in July, crypto investment fund Grayscale also announced that the firm’s Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) funds will be available for public over-the-counter trading following approval from the United States Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Then, at the start of August, Grayscale filed a registration statement on Form 10 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its Grayscale Ethereum Trust, designating it a SEC reporting company if validated.Additionally, Grayscale has also revealed a growing demand for alternative cryptocurrencies from institutional investors, which make up almost 90% of its demographic. Investors have been aiming to diversify their positions in crypto by buying into the firm’s Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, which holds multiple altcoins.Further supporting DeFi as a possible catalyst for alt season, Genesis, a digital currency prime broker, has revealed that institutional clients are also showing demand for high-yield options within the cryptosphere, mostly caused by the yield farming phenomenon.However, regulated options are still scarce for altcoins, as more regulation is still needed, especially when it comes to DeFi. Once this happens, it’s possible that the hype will be toned down by the more constricted market, much like it was during the crackdown on ICOs by the SEC.While things may seem promising for altcoins, especially in the DeFi space, others believe that the so-called alt season may be over or is soon to be over. A recent blog post by Santiment, a cryptocurrency analytics firm, claims that Bitcoin will soon regain its falling dominance as altcoins plunge.According to the firm, profits from the alt season may flow back into stablecoins/fiat or Bitcoin, fueling a further rally for the latter: “Alts will enjoy the party, one by one, crazy money will move from one to another, there are still some alts to pump (though their number is getting less and less). [...] After process is over either we all together go down, or Bitcoin will go up alone.” Not only does Santiment believe that alt season is over, but some believe that a strong dollar may keep Bitcoin’s rally from taking place, thus putting a lid on alt season as well."
551,"Bitcoin (BTC) is inches away from getting the same boost that helped it hit $12,500 earlier this month, data shows.On Aug. 28, the U.S. dollar currency index (DXY), fresh from losses caused by a speech from the Federal Reserve, returned to crucial low levels.At press time on Friday, DXY measured 92.28 — its lowest since Aug. 19. At that time, the index had seen years of decline, with 92.17 marking the floor which challenged precious lows from April 2018.Safe havens, including Bitcoin, appeared to benefit throughout the summer as DXY fell — gold hit highs of $2,075, while BTC/USD topped out at $12,500 two weeks ago.As Cointelegraph Markets analyst filbfilb noted on Friday, a repeat performance was now on the cards. Thursday’s speech from Fed chair Jerome Powell sent DXY tumbling after days of gains.The impact on the U.S. dollar may in fact be the only meaningful takeaway from a “non-event” policy shift for Bitcoin which many had already expected.Nonetheless, the implications for the rigidity of the fiat economy thanks to the Fed were much more severe — to the extent even fiat business voices were now plugging Bitcoin.“Jerome Powell’s speech today will be for the history books,” Andy Yee, senior director of public policy at Visa tweeted. “Never in the history of mankind was so much stolen from so many by so few. Opt out with Bitcoin.”US dollar currency index 1-month chart. Source: TradingViewFor Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal, Powell’s words were confirmation that Bitcoin and gold would remain strong in future — but Bitcoin would win out for investors.“I think they both rise over time in inflation or deflation,” he told Twitter followers.“Most people don't understand the latter but is simply put, Powell has shown that there is ZERO tolerance for deflation so they will do ANYTHING to stop it, and that is good for the two hardest assets - Gold and Bitcoin. Powell WANTS inflation.”Even before the speech, Bitcoin supporters were eyeing the long-term consequences of Fed policy. For Saifedean Ammous, author of the popular book, “The Bitcoin Standard,” it was a question of “time will tell” for Bitcoin versus fiat.“The reduction in the new supply of bitcoins clearly reduced the new selling onto the market, so probably has helped keep the price up or keep it from dropping further,” he told the Unchained Podcast on Aug. 25.“The central banks’ quantitative easing and everybody helicopter money policy and giving everybody checks seems to have done the same for the stock market. Now, let’s wait and see for the long-run effects of the two approaches.”"
552,"A young Russian citizen and his co-conspirators came within an inch of carrying out a major ransomware attack against Tesla — unaware that their target had already turned them in.Last week, the United States Federal Bureau Investigation (FBI) unsealed a criminal complaint against a conspirator in a thwarted ransomware plot against the electric car maker Tesla.On Aug. 22, the Bureau arrested 27 year-old Russian citizen Pavel Kriuchkov in Los Angeles, who had allegedly spent much of his month in the U.S. attempting to recruit a Tesla staffer at the firm’s Gigafactory Nevada site to collude on a nefarious “special project.”That “special project” came with a lucrative incentive — a bribe of $500,000, later upped to $1 million. A small advance payment was to have been paid into the staffer’s Bitcoin (BTC) wallet, installed using a Tor browser to evade detection.In return for the bribe, the staffer was asked to assist in the installation of a targeted malware attack against Tesla — a two-stage plot involving a distributed denial of service attack, followed by an exfiltration of sensitive company data. The plan was to hold Tesla to ransom under threat of dumping the information publicly. Kriuchkov’s conspirators had their eye on a $4 million ransom.The hitch was that, soon after Kriuchkov’s first meeting with the staffer, who remains anonymous, the staffer had already alerted Tesla, which, in turn, tipped off the FBI. A series of August meetings between Kriuchov and the staffer were physically surveilled and wire-tapped by FBI agents. They collected intelligence about the operation and other prior exploits while preparations for the cyberattack were being hatched.One of the conspirators was, according to Kriuchkov’s communications with the staffer, a hacker specializing in encryption, who allegedly works as a high level employee of a government bank in Russia. Kriuchkov himself was self-avowedly hazy on the technical aspects of the planned attack, and was ostensibly being paid $250,000 for his recruitment efforts. In one early meeting, Kriuchkov, the staffer and two of the latter’s friends made an excursion to Lake Tahoe in California. Kriuchkov insisted on footing the bill for the group’s expenses, but shied away from posing in group photos, insisting he could “remember the beauty of the sunset” without a memento.On Aug. 21, Kriuchov informed the staffer that the attack was being delayed until a later date, and that he would be leaving Nevada the following day. Following his arrest in Los Angeles on Aug. 22, he is now in detention pending trial.While Tesla is not explicitly named in the FBI’s criminal complaint, Tesla news site Teslarati has confirmed the company was the target. CEO Elon Musk acknowledged the scheme in a tweet:Much appreciated. This was a serious attack."

The platform is accepting new account registrations immediately, the announcement notes.The new trading offering will allow SBI clients to trade crypto CFD contracts against the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar, enabling a total of six new trading pairs.According to the announcement, SBI FX Trade will become the first forex exchange business in Japan to offer CFD trading for cryptocurrencies.A major financial institution in Japan, SBI Holdings has been actively involved in the crypto and blockchain space in recent years.The company is known as a key partner of major blockchain company Ripple, which develops products on top of XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Since 2016, SBI and Ripple have been collaborating on a joint venture known as SBI Ripple Asia, which intends to promote XRP use in Asian financial markets. SBI is also planning to integrate Ripple-powered settlement across Japanese ATMs.SBI’s upcoming crypto CFDs are not new for Japan though. Last year, local crypto firm Liquid launched Bitcoin CFD trading, enabling traders to speculate on the asset’s price movements against the yen and dollar. In July 2020, Monex Securities became the first online securities company in Japan to launch crypto CFD services."
554,"Bitcoin (BTC) can still top $13,000 and higher as a series of non-events still leave bulls in a powerful position.Data from Coin360 and Cointelegraph Markets showed BTC/USD climbing toward $11,500 on Aug. 28 as one analyst said that the level is crucial to reclaim for gains to continue.Cryptocurrency market daily snapshot, Aug. 28. Source: Coin360In an update to subscribers of his Telegram trading channel on Friday, trader Filbfilb said that despite the previous day’s volatility, he remained long on BTC.“In context of the weekly chart, 11,000 appears to be holding as support but a close above the key 11,500 support/resistance level would be the immediate objective to remain relatively comfortable in the overall bullish re-accumulation idea,” he summarized.This concept has some lofty targets — the monthly pivot at around $12,925, as well as monthly resistance from 2019 that saw Bitcoin hit $13,870.Nevertheless, the signs were positive, with Filbfilb dismissing concerns over the Fed’s inflation speech and other pseudo-bearish signals for Bitcoin.“I remained long yesterday for a few main reasons,” he explained. “Negative futures premium, no lower low close, sheer panic on [crypto Twitter] and calls for 9k, no break of overall support and because the price action on gold and silver to which we have been heavily correlated practically tick for tick, reversed ahead of BTC which continued dumping.”He described the speech itself as a “non-event,” which appeared to have been already priced in by the markets. BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: Coin360Looking ahead for the short term, only Friday’s futures settlement could spell a period of volatility to challenge the overall upside.“Today we have August Futures closing which may result in volatility this afternoon so watch out for some action this afternoon,” Filbfilb added.Futures settlement dates have historically added downward pressure to Bitcoin markets, but recent options expiries have conversely failed to move the market, despite much anticipation of volatility.In a tweet, derivatives platform Deribit confirmed that 50,900 BTC ($580 million) and 291,000 Ether ($113.5 million) in open interest was set to expire on Friday. Between $11,000 and $11,500 is “maximum pain” for options traders, as this is the area in which options have the lowest intrinsic value.“This flow is somewhat against that seen recently, suggesting some nervousness comments on options activity.Futures “gaps” meanwhile form the focus for informal price bets among traders and holders this month. A “gap” occurs when one futures trading session begins at a different place to where the previous one left off — Bitcoin tends to move to “fill” the resulting void.As Cointelegraph reported, a lower gap at $9,700 and a smaller one at $16,000, albeit in place for several years, are likely areas of interest for traders."
555,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has declined by more than 6% in the last three days and with the $276 million CME Bitcoin futures expiry approaching on Aug. 28, traders are nervous that additional downside could be in store.Following Bitcoin’s rejection at $12,500, traders foresee two key scenarios playing out over the short term.Some technical analysts believe that Bitcoin is headed to either $16,000 or $9,600 first but the near-term outcome remains uncertain as it’s dependent on certain resistance and support levels being hit.According to the pseudonymous trader Byzantine General, Bitcoin (BTC) could rise to either $16,000 or drop to $9,600.If BTC’s weekly chart closes above $11,500, the trader said the chances of BTC rallying to $16,000 increase. If the price remains below $10,500, the trader said $9,600 is the logical support. He wrote:“Let's keep it simple. 11500 key level. If weekly close above --> 16k. If close below --> 10.5 ‘obvious support.’ Cuz obvious 10.5 might do nothing like 6k in '19. 9600 is the next strong support (CME).”XBT/USD 1-week chart. Source: TradingViewAnother compelling reason traders might expect a brief pullback to the $9,600 to $9,700 area is due to a CME gap. These gaps form on the CME Bitcoin futures market’s chart because the regulated market closes during the weekend.A CME gap typically is closed within a short period of time, and this raises the chances of a pullback. There is also a small CME gap at $16,000, but only on a lower time frame chart where the gap has existed for years.In the short term, another cryptocurrency analyst called Mayne said that Bitcoin bulls would need to reclaim $11,700. Failure to reclaim this higher resistance level could result in an extended consolidation phase. The analyst noted:“Here is what you don't want to see as a bull, price with a false break high and now stair stepping down. Last 2 up moves seem like clear bearish retests. If this is distribution, expect the selling to pick up speed soon. Bulls need to come in and regain $11.7.”Earlier today the price of Bitcoin briefly rose to as high as $11,600 following the Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell’s speech on inflation. During the build-up to the speech many investors expected gold and Bitcoin to benefit from Powell’s speech about controlling the inflation rate.But shortly after the speech finished the BTC price immediately declined from $11,600, dropping to as low as $11,125 on Coinbase. As Cointelegraph reported, it could have been the confluence of the market pricing in the Jackson Hole symposium and the lower-than-expected inflation rate.The sell-the-news drop in the Bitcoin and gold markets further intensified the downtrend, causing Bitcoin to retrace to early August levels.The sharp drop in BTC price over the past three days also broke the short-term bullish market structure, canceling out the higher low and higher high patterns.Whether the altering of this trend will sway BTC into the bearish scenario of a revisit to the $9,600 to $10,500 price range remains to be seen."
556,"Following the theft and repayment of $900,000 in Bitcoin (BTC), Shapeshift is now pursuing damages in court against its former senior software engineer, Azamat Mukhiddinov. ""There was significant time lost and legal costs associated with the clean-up,"" Shapeshift's chief legal officer, Veronica McGregor, told Cointelegraph, noting that customer funds were safe throughout the ordeal. ""ShapeShift is non-custodial, so no customer funds were ever at risk,"" she said. Working in a high level position for Shapeshift, Mukhiddinov allegedly used his access to the exchange's backend to steal roughly 90 BTC, worth nearly $900,000 in May 2020 at the time of the theft, according to a legal complaint filed by Shapeshift on Aug. 26, 2020.""Azamat began stealing bitcoin in November 2019 and continued until his theft was discovered on May 21, 2020,"" the document said. Mukhiddinov started his employment with Shapeshift on Sept. 4, 2018 as a senior software engineer for the company. Shapeshift gave Mukhiddinov access to much of its private and sensitive inner workings, described as ""computer infrastructure"" in the filing, which included aspects such as the company's software and servers.Shapeshift tasked Mukhiddinov with overseeing its services' backend, which included fortifying its defenses against possible threats, the document detailed. Prior to the start of his employment with the company, Mukhiddinov reportedly signed documents, one of which noted that he was not to take advantage of these important private systems. The guidelines also specifically prohibited the employee from adding applications to the system without company consent, according to the filing. Mukhiddinov, however, put his own software in place within the system, disguised to operate unnoticed, in order to steal Bitcoin from Shapeshift.The software allegedly exported roughly 0.5 BTC at a time into Mukhiddinov's possession, taking advantage of a security vulnerability in Shapeshift's backend.Shapeshift's team eventually noticed the missing coins and, after an investigation led back to Mukhiddinov, they spoke with him on May 25, 2020. ""Azamat admitted to installing and running the program that stole the Company’s bitcoin,"" the legal filing stated.""Eventually, Azamat returned, in one form or another, all of the $900,000 in bitcoin he had stolen,"" the legal complaint detailed. ""These payments, however, do not make ShapeShift whole for the damage caused by Azamat’s actions.""Shapeshift's claim against Mukhiddinov seeks damages for the lengthy investigation into the affair, including time and resources spent on the endeavor. The company also reportedly had to delay the release of its mobile application by several months. ""The new ShapeShift mobile app launched in July,"" McGregor said, adding, ""It is a self-custody crypto interface with integrated trading.""This is not the first occurrence of an inside job at Shapeshift. Another incident in 2016 amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars stolen. McGregor noted no correlation between the 2016 incident and this year's affair.                    ""After the incident in 2016, we implemented significant monitoring, operational security, and procedural steps,"" she explained. ""This work helped us catch the culprit, and we were able to retrieve all the directly stolen property.""Shapeshift has been active in the crypto space since 2013. It was founded by Erik Vorhees, who is listed by Cointelegraph as the 37th most important person in crypto and blockchain. "
557,"Peter Schiff, a popular mainstream financial commentator and gold advocate, recently told people to send Bitcoin (BTC) to his 18-year-old son. ""Since so many of you Bitcoin guys are ribbing me because my son [Spencer Schiff] bought Bitcoin, why not really rub it in by gifting him some as a belated birthday present,"" Schiff said in an Aug. 27 tweet. ""He turned 18 yesterday,"" Schiff noted. ""He won't lose his,"" he said, posting his son's wallet address. Schiff's tweet points toward an event from earlier in 2020, when the gold aficionado admittedly lost his Bitcoin storage access. “I knew owning Bitcoin was a bad idea, I just never realized it was this bad,” he said in a Jan. 2020 tweet. As of press time, the Bitcoin address Schiff noted as his son's, holds 0.0627 BTC. Schiff has delivered negative comments against Bitcoin on many occasions, often positing gold as a better alternative. During a podcast interview July, Schiff said Bitcoiners do not seek a wealth storage option, but an avenue for fast riches. On the other side of the table, many BTC proponents, such as Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano, look at the asset as a hedge and store of value. "
558,"Tyler Winklevoss, one of the first reported Bitcoin (BTC) billionaires and the co-founder of Gemini, believes the ultimate bull case for Bitcoin means reaching a target of $500,000.The theory for a $500,000 long-term Bitcoin price is straightforward. Winklevoss believes Bitcoin could overtake gold as the global market’s leading safe-haven asset. Since the market capitalization of gold is estimated to be $9 trillion while Bitcoin is valued at around $200 billion, this could leave a 45-fold upside.Investors have relied on three stores of value for many decades, namely gold, oil and the U.S. dollar. But all three have distinctive weaknesses. The advantages of Bitcoin over gold. Source: Tyler WinklevossGold and oil are difficult to transport and store, but more importantly, neither have a fixed supply.As such, if a large supply of both assets potentially gets discovered — although the probability of it is slim — it might negatively affect their value. Winklevoss explained:“Currently, gold is a reliable store of value and the classic inflation hedge. Supply. The supply of gold is actually unknown. While gold remains scarce or ‘precious’ on planet Earth, the same cannot be said with respect to our galaxy.”The biggest problem of the U.S. dollar is inflation and the stability of its value. As seen in its performance over the past four months, fears of inflation and economic uncertainty could destabilize the dollar for extended periods.If inflation occurs in the long term, Winklevoss noted that gold or Bitcoin could outrun capital stored in banks. He added:“Inflation is coming. Money stored in a bank will get run over. Money invested in assets like real estate or the stock market will keep pace. Money stored in gold or bitcoin will outrun the scourge. And money stored in bitcoin will run the fastest, overtaking gold.”With Bitcoin, inflation is not possible due to its fixed supply of 21 million. Unlike gold and oil, it would always remain scarce and it is easy to transport and store. Given these characteristics of Bitcoin, Winklevoss said he believes Bitcoin is the “only long-term protection against inflation.”In recent months, especially following the pandemic in March, the demand for digital products and currencies has soared. The concerns of inflation may further intensify after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell confirmed the central bank is looking to exceed its average inflation target. In fact, Winklevoss believes that the Fed is the “biggest booster” of Bitcoin’s value. As an example, MicroStrategy, a public company based in the United States, recently purchased $250 million worth of Bitcoin to use it as the firm’s primary treasury asset.Rapid adoption, growing institutionalization, improving infrastructure and rising liquidity could buoy the ultimate bullish case for the valuation of Bitcoin. Winklevoss stated:“If we are right about using a gold framework to value bitcoin, and bitcoin continues on this path, then the bull case scenario for bitcoin is that it is undervalued by a multiple of 45. Said differently, the price of bitcoin could appreciate 45x from where it is today, which means we could see a price of $500,000 U.S. dollars per bitcoin.”"
559,"The Department of Justice has charged Russian citizen Egor Igorevich Kriuchkov with conspiracy to damage a protected computer system after he allegedly bribed an employee of a Nevada company with $1 million in Bitcoin to install malware in that company’s computer system.According to documents from the U.S. District Court of Nevada, Kriuchkov wanted to steal data from the company’s network, then threaten to make that data public unless the company paid a ransom. He first arranged contact with the employee via WhatsApp, then entered the United States on a tourist visa to meet him in person. The District Court of Nevada makes mention of Kriuchkov having “coconspirators,” but they are unidentified as of press time.Investigators learned that Kriuchkov told his would-be malware installer that he was part of a large organization, but didn’t specify anything about that organization in particular. He offered the employee 1 BTC as an upfront payment, plus his assistance in creating a Bitcoin wallet on the Tor network. But the FBI managed to arrest Kruichkov before he left the United States. He stands to serve up to five years in prison and pay a $250,000 fine if found guilty.U.S. authorities arrested a different Russian national in March under allegations of money laundering. They used his Instagram profile, which promoted his rap career, as evidence against him."
560,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has recently shot up after months of stability. In April and May, trading prices came in between the narrow range of $9,000 and $10,000, with realized volatility falling to its lowest in three years by mid-July. The speculation behind the price move has come amid economic uncertainty brought about by the COVID-19 outbreak, coinciding with record low-interest rates and an increasingly volatile stock market. The question is: Will the recent rebound in the cryptocurrency reflect the start of a price spike, which was last seen in 2017?The recent Bitcoin surge has actually coincided with that of gold. This reinforces the point of view of some analysts who have long since suggested that investors should treat both Bitcoin and gold as safe-haven assets during unprecedented market disruption and volatility.Related: Where, oh where has Bitcoin volatility gone? Part 1Nigel Green, the founder and CEO of deVere Group — an independent financial advisory organization — mentioned last month that “investors are flocking to safe-haven assets, in particular those not tied to any specific country such as Bitcoin and gold.” He added:Related: Where, oh where has Bitcoin volatility gone? Part 2While the principle of investing in some of these potential safe-haven assets — Bitcoin, gold or even the property market — is well and good, how can everyday household investors begin to capitalize on this trend?Fortunately, new technology platforms and apps have appeared and gained in popularity over the past few years, providing the opportunity for both fledgling and experienced participants to invest in assets that are not always easily accessible or easy to understand.Some well-known examples of such platforms include:● Robinhood: Perhaps the most well-known out of all the new investor apps, Robinhood allows users to invest in thousands of stocks with as little as $1, using a “fractional shares” method. Investors can customize portfolios with pieces of different companies and funds to help reduce risk, and trades placed during market hours are executed in real time, meaning full transparency on share prices.● Ziglu: This challenger platform makes it easy for interested investors to dip their toe into Bitcoin. With no hidden fees, using Ziglu is a fast and simple way to buy and sell crypto, with cryptocurrency assets up to 50,000 British pounds insured against cyberattacks.● Goldex: The trading technology at Goldex helps you find the best available deals from the world’s first gold marketplace in an easy-to-use app. Market prices can be checked in real time, as well as every aspect of your order including execution price and commission, so you know exactly what you get.● LendInvest: Calling itself the United Kingdom’s leading platform for property finance, LendInvest offers short-term, development and buy-to-let mortgages to intermediaries, landlords and developers across the U.K. by using technology to create a better loan experience.In addition to these popular digital-access solutions, there are also technology platforms that let people invest in even more exotic alternative assets, such as luxury handbags and racehorses.These companies and many more all have the common function of lowering the barriers to entry for the ultimate benefit of the everyday investor. In the case of Bitcoin, for example, our ambition is for people to eventually use cryptocurrencies just like they would with any other fiat currency.I think all currencies, traditional and digital, should be integrated into the financial services sector. Let’s face it, accessing any currency through a bank has never been easy. We think all currencies including digital should be treated equally and be equally accessible.Whatever your passion — whether you have a gut feeling of the next big win, or a simple preference to access so-called safe havens during these uncertain times — modern technologies such as crypto and blockchain provide you with all the needed instruments for investments that have only become possible in recent years.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

561,"Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Bitcoin futures and options markets are set to mature this Friday, leading some traders to fear that the most recent BTC dump is a presage of weakening markets.According to a September 2019 Cointelegraph and Arcane Research report, there is typically a 2.3% drop ahead of each monthly CME expiry. Given the size of the upcoming expiry, it’s worth taking a moment to evaluate new data to evaluate if these ‘CME drop’ ghosts continue to spook the markets.The 2019 study mulls ""deliberate manipulation"" as a culprit but aside from that, it did find that 15 out of 20 months had negative returns for the last 40 hours before CME expiry.By applying the same methodology as the 2019 study, one can promptly determine whether the theory still holds true. The CME expiry takes place at every last trading Friday of each calendar month.The study was done by comparing the average price 40 hours ahead of each event with the previous 40 trading hours. Such a time frame is entirely arbitrary, although it will be kept to provide a comparison basis.Bitcoin 40-hour change ahead of CME expiry. Source: Tradingview & CoinTelegraphThe negative trend observed by the September 2019 analysis persisted throughout the following couple of months. As the chart above indicates, November 2019 was a significant outlier with Bitcoin (BTC) posting a 4.4% gain ahead of expiry.No other month since the beginning of the study in January 2018 yielded such a positive number. The previous high occurred in September 2018 as the cryptocurrency posted a 2.4% gain in the 40 hours ahead of futures contracts last trading hour.Bitcoin's third halving was scheduled for mid-May 2020; therefore, November was six months ahead of the important event. The average 40-hour return for the past ten months is +0.3%, and that includes September’s negative 5% performance.One way of measuring this event's impact on investor expectations is by analyzing the change in the CME Bitcoin futures open interest. This data by itself does not assert whether investors were bullish or bearish at that time, but growth in open interest signals new investors' entry or more significant positions. Either way, this could indicate halving indeed had an impact on such price movements.CME Bitcoin Futures Open Interest, USD terms. Source: SkewCME Bitcoin futures open interest grew by 186% to $390 million over from November 2019 up to its May-11 halving. This indicates that institutional investors' interest started picking up at the same time such a 40-hour change indicator started to revert its negative trend. The latest data shows $658 million CME Bitcoin futures open interest, as per the above chart.Although this week’s $400 negative price swing could be deemed irrelevant considering Bitcoin's staggering 70% 3-month implied volatility, it certainly dampened professional investors' mood.The futures premium, or basis, measures how longer-term contracts are priced relative to current spot (regular markets) levels. Professional traders tend to be more active than retail on such instruments due to the hassle of handling expiry dates.These contracts usually trade at a slight premium, indicating sellers are requesting more money to withhold settlement longer. CME Bitcoin futures basis. Source: Tradingview & CoinTelegraphCME Bitcoin futures basis briefly touched the unfavorable terrain on Aug. 26, which hadn't occurred since May 25. This movement was in stark contrast to late July and early August when the basis reached the 2% level.It seems premature to ascertain whether this was a change of trend or a momentary correction as Bitcoin tested the $11,200 support level.One should keep in mind that investors typically roll over their futures contracts position over the last trading days. To carry a long position, one needs to buy the September contract and sell the August one, thereby reducing short-term contract open interest.If these investors decide not to roll over their positions, this would likely increase the odds of additional volatility during expiry.

563,"Galaxus, the largest online retailer in Switzerland, could start accepting payments in a stablecoin issued by local cryptocurrency bank Sygnum.According to an Aug. 27 tweet by Sygnum, the companies have just completed an electronic commerce payment using Sygnum Bank’s stablecoin known as Digital Swiss Franc (DCHF). As officially announced, the e-commerce transaction was enabled by Denmark-based crypto payment processor Coinify.Launched in March 2020, Sygnum’s DCHF stablecoin is pegged one-to-one to with the Swiss franc, and intends to eliminate the need for card systems, reduce settlement costs and fraud, as well as provide instant transactions.As previously reported, Sygnum Bank claims to be the first licensed bank in Switzerland to issue a stablecoin. The bank holds a digital asset bank license with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or FINMA.By implementing Sygnum’s DCHF stablecoin to e-commerce, the companies intend to tap the $3.5 trillion global e-commerce industry. The new payment method is expected to bring direct connections between consumers and online retailers, eliminating intermediaries and associated fraud, the announcement notes.Galaxus CFO Thomas Fugmann said that the adoption of the new DCHF stablecoin is a major step forward to bringing a better online retail platform. “Enabling our customers in Switzerland and Liechtenstein to make payments on our online store with stable digital currencies like the DCHF further enhances their convenience,” Fugmann said.The executive also emphasized that Galaxus strengthened its position as an e-commerce pioneer by accepting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) as a means of payment in early 2019. As reported, Galaxus’s affiliate firm Digitec Galaxus started accepting payments in a number of cryptocurrencies like BTC, Ether (ETH), XRP, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), and others. The payment method was initially available for purchases worth over 200 francs, or about $200.Cointelegraph reached out to Galaxus for additional queries regarding the development.

564,"A political crisis, mass detention of peaceful citizens and internet blocking in Belarus are hitting the country’s IT sector hard. Amid this social turmoil, some companies are moving their offices and servers abroad, others are using VPN services, while some are advising their customers to buy cryptocurrencies. What is happening in Belarus, a country that just a couple of years ago was considered to be a favorable jurisdiction for IT and cryptocurrency projects? And how is digital technology helping its people regain their social and economic freedom?Belarus is home to numerous IT companies, many of which have become world famous for their applications: Viber, World of Tanks, Prisma, Maps.me and Msqrd, to name but a few. With the full-scale opening of Belarus Hi-Tech Park, or HTP — an offshore space for developers — the country also became one of the world’s most favorable jurisdictions for IT businesses.In 2018, the country’s president, Aleksandr Lukashenko, took an unprecedented step and exempted resident companies from income and value-added taxes until 2049. He signed the decree On Development of Digital Economy, which made cryptocurrency mining and any operations with digital assets not only legal but also tax-free. The new technology-oriented policy bore fruit rather quickly, as by October 2019, the tech sector had already contributed to half of the nation’s GDP growth. Production in the first half of 2019 grew by 166%, and by the end of the year, HTP residents had exported services worth in excess of $2 billion.Foreign companies began to open research and development offices in Belarus, and the demand for the services of local developers abroad grew at a frantic pace due to their low cost and sufficiently high quality. The world media began to call the country the “Silicon Valley of Eastern Europe” and its president the “cryptocurrency king.” It seems Belarus could strongly compete with Malta or Hong Kong if the country was not facing a political crisis. Lukashenko’s stance on IT has been assessed as very positive over the last several years, but the events of recent weeks may negate all these achievements.It all started after the 2020 presidential election in August when some citizens of Belarus and leaders of other countries refused to recognize Lukashenko’s victory as legitimate. As a result, strikes and peaceful demonstrations began, which turned into mass protests and the violent involvement of armed police. The authoritarian regime changed to a totalitarian one as authorities began to block access to the internet and intensified censorship of social media. Armed security forces also began to challenge peaceful protesters and break into the offices of the country’s largest IT companies such as Uber and Russian giant Yandex.Many startups have also reported that their employees are being arrested, and with the internet going down for several days at a time, this is resulting in failures in the operations of some major applications. According to civil society group NetBlocks, the economic damage from the internet shutdown in the country exceeds $56 million per day.The messaging app Viber, one of the most well-known international IT projects and one of the residents of the HTP, faced severe disruptions in operations. In fear of repeating the fate of Uber’s and Yandex’s office, the company closed its workspace and asked employees to work from home. The company also noted that it previously wanted to double the number of staff in the country but now plans to abandon this idea.Belarus, which recently created some of the world’s most favorable conditions for technology development, is now making it hard for IT companies to conduct their business in the country. However, some companies have been able to minimize risks by using decentralized methods such as moving their servers and offices to other countries and using VPNs. Alexander Shuhayeu, co-founder of Rocket DAO — a local venture capital investment marketplace — called the current situation in Belarus ambiguous:Many entrepreneurs are moving their offices abroad, while others have declared their readiness to do so if the situation does not resolve. Max Krupyshev, CEO of CoinsPaid — one of the companies registered in the HTP — told Cointelegraph that the firm is constantly moving its key employees around its various European offices as internet gets cut off:Local crypto exchanges previously reported that they managed to keep their platforms running by using distributed and backup infrastructure. For example, FREE2EX prepositioned system elements and standby instances at different capacities in independent data centers. According to Aleksei Korolenko, chief marketing officer of the exchange, having backup locations in different cities and countries is necessary in post-Soviet countries, Latin America, China and other regions where the actions of authorities and regulators are unpredictable.Dmitry Ogievich, CEO of the Minsk office of exchange Currency.com — which became the first legal crypto exchange in Belarus to trade government bonds — told Cointelegraph that the platform is trying its best to operate as normal:Nevertheless, despite the measures taken, many businesspeople are concerned about the situation of uncertainty and have expressed fears that due to the actions of the current political regime, most foreign investors will refuse to engage with local markets.Speaking to Cointelegraph about the consequences of the political instability in Belarus for the IT sector, Stanislav Basko, executive director of the Belarus Blockchain Association, named three potential problems: brain drain, foreign companies leaving the market and a decrease in the number of foreign investors. Still, it will most likely only be possible to assess the full picture several months later.The case of Belarus shows that in the face of economic and political problems, decentralization is, perhaps, the only way to defend social rights to freedom of speech, internet access and financial independence.And it’s not just about VPNs that can deal with specific websites being blocked; perhaps only fully decentralized solutions can cope with a full internet shutdown in the country. Telegram became the only messenger that was available to Belarusians after the company turned on anti-censorship tools for residents of the country.We enabled our anti-censorship tools in Belarus so that Telegram remained available for most users there. However, the connection is still very unstable as Internet is at times shut off completely in the country. https://t.co/eA4S6Zz36HAnother way for Belarusians to bypass internet censorship is through the Tor network, which saw a ninefold increase of users connecting via bridges — a censorship-resistant way of accessing the network that uses obscured servers.According to Korolenko, the example of Belarus has shown that blocking the internet is both a costly and pointless idea, telling Cointelegraph: However, the stability of the internet in the country still leaves much to be desired. In search of solutions, Belarusians even reached out to Elon Musk on Twitter for help, with some requesting that he start testing SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet in the region. Although Musk responded to the call, experts doubt that this is possible given the current political realities.The case is very similar to previous attempts to transfer voting to a decentralized model using the e-voting platform Golos, which the government of Belarus called illegitimate. Similar problems exist in other countries with similar political regimes where attempts to hold blockchain-based elections, such as in Russia, have been questioned.Cryptocurrency purchases may also become illegal soon as Belarusians have started to flock to online platforms after losing confidence in authorities and the Belarusian ruble. Local media has reported that the country’s authorities are discussing a plan to block deposits in state-owned banks and introduce total control over the financial transactions of citizens. Transactions in foreign currencies and deals with foreign partners may be banned too.The leading political Telegram channel, Nexta Live, called on the residents of Belarus to find alternatives to local banks as soon as possible and pay attention to cash and cryptocurrencies. Against this backdrop, many crypto exchanges have reported a sharp increase in demand for digital money from Belarusian users. According to Sergey Zhdanov, chief operating officer of Exmo — one of the largest exchanges in the CIS region — although user registrations haven’t skyrocketed, the average deposits have almost doubled since Aug. 1. He added:AAX, another crypto exchange — which has never had Belorusian traders among its users — has seen “a moderate, but steady” stream of demand over the past month. Thor Chan, its CEO, shared statistics with Cointelegraph:The situation in Belarus can play out in different scenarios. On the one hand, storm clouds may hang over the future of the HTP in connection with Valery Tsepkalo, the man who created the technology park in the country, exiting the presidential race and subsequently fleeing the country. On the other hand, the joint efforts of people, IT companies and technologies are bearing unprecedented fruits amid the fight against the centralization of power. Rocket DAO’s Shuhayeu opined:The Belarus Blockchain Association’s Basko also expressed his hopes for the resolution of the current situation, telling Cointelegraph that the organization and many other people will do their best to overcome the problems. When speaking with Cointelegraph, he dropped a phrase that has recently become the embodiment of the philosophy of local IT companies: “We do business, not politics.”"
565,"Today, the United States Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell will give a speech on the Fed’s monetary policy. Contrary to expectations, it might not have any major impact on the price of Bitcoin (BTC).The daily price chart of Bitcoin. Source: TradingView.comThe markets are seemingly expecting the Fed to showcase significant changes to its policies. Some strategists said the Fed might allow inflation to run higher than 2% to offset the slowing economy.If that happens, in the medium to long term, it could be a catalyst for safe-haven assets such as gold and potentially Bitcoin, given their tight correlation in recent months.Bitcoin vs. gold price. Source: SkewHowever, Tom Graff, the head of fixed income at Brown Advisory, hinted the market might not show an immense reaction.Investors are somewhat aware of what Powell is expected to say at the Jackson Hole conference. Many analysts anticipate the Fed to maintain low-interest rates for the foreseeable future and possibly let inflation run higher.Theoretically, given that inflation could damage the value of the U.S. dollar, it would subsequently benefit gold and Bitcoin. Yet, both gold and Bitcoin have been stagnant over the past week, while the U.S. stock market has rallied.Graff thinks that the Fed will have to demonstrate its willingness to undergo a major policy rethink through its actions. Until then, the strategist said the market would struggle to believe the Fed. He emphasized that the Fed lacks credibility among investors, which might affect the market’s response to the symposium. Graff explained:“Central bank credibility is crucial. Currently, they don’t have any credibility that they can or are willing to allow inflation to be higher than 2%, and that’s a problem. Actions are going to speak louder than words. The market’s going to have to see them not hike interest rates even as unemployment gets much lower before they’ll believe it.”The market’s skepticism towards Powell’s speech explains the continuous decline of the price of gold. Since achieving a new record high at $2,075 on Aug. 6, gold fell by around 6.5% to $1,940.Over the long term, avid Bitcoin investors and industry executives foresee low interest rates and higher inflation as a catalyst for Bitcoin’s price to move higher.Tyler Winklevoss, a billionaire Bitcoin investor and the co-founder of Gemini, said the Fed has been Bitcoin’s biggest “booster.” He said:“The Fed, under the leadership of Jerome Powell, continues to be Bitcoin's biggest booster. On Thursday, he will deliver a speech about how the Fed will begin targeting higher inflation.”Referring to the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium, Bill Barhydt, the CEO of Abra, said the Fed is fueling the sentiment around Bitcoin. He added: “Bitcoin doesn’t need the Fed to succeed but if they insist on throwing gasoline on the fire then so be it.”"
566,"At $11,400, Bitcoin (BTC) is ripe for a fresh price surge thanks to stablecoin investors buying up cheap coins, data suggests.Highlighting the latest readings from its stablecoin supply ratio (SSR) metric on Aug. 26, on-chain monitoring resource Glassnode forecast upside for BTC/USD.SSR refers to the potential buying power of stablecoins over Bitcoin. A low Bitcoin price allows stablecoin owners, for example, on exchanges, to purchase more of the BTC supply. This demand pushes the price of Bitcoin up, given its predictable, verifiable supply and high stock-to-flow ratio.As the price increases, stablecoins, which remain priced the same in whichever fiat currency they are pegged to, can buy less of the BTC supply.The ability to enter a BTC position is called “buying power.” Currently, that buying power is high, meaning stablecoin owners can purchase a comparatively large amount of the supply.“SSR is 3x stronger than it was when BTC hit these price levels over a year ago,” Glassnode commented.In another tweet, the firm noted that the largest stablecoin, Tether (USDT), was conspicuously primed to enter such positions.“Further support comes from an increase in the $USDT (ERC20) balance on exchanges over the past year — indicating that stablecoins are waiting on the sidelines.”Bitcoin stablecoin supply ratio comparative chart. Source: Glassnode/TwitterAs Cointelegraph reported, Tether’s market cap passed a landmark $10 billion in July. In terms of average daily transfer value, USDT beat both Bitcoin and PayPal this month.Tether market cap vs. Bitcoin price. Source: CryptoQuantOne reason for increasing the supply and, therefore, the market cap of a stablecoin, is to allow investors who purchased other assets to cash out. As Glassnode explained in a blog post about SSR last December, an increase in BTC price, for example, requires more stablecoins.“The resulting lack of liquidity in the stablecoin supply makes it harder for investors in profitable positions to exit,” the post summarizes, concluding:  “In order to compensate for the lack of buying power as Bitcoin’s price increases, new fiat money needs to flow into the market, i.e. the supply of stablecoins needs to increase.”"

According to the data, the websites were “offering to buy electronic currency Bitcoin and certain products using this currency.” As cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are prohibited from being used for payment in Russia, the distribution of information about these services by the websites is illegal, the court records note.A spokesperson for BestChange.ru told Cointelegraph that the website has never provided any information about buying or selling products with Bitcoin. “Our website only provides information on up-to-date exchange rates by exchangers, who, by the way, also do not advertise crypto as a payment method,” they said.BestChange.ru is apparently one of the largest crypto websites in Russia. According to data from website analytics tool SimilarWeb, BestChange has been steadily growing this year to hit 3.3 million users in July 2020. The website delivers a list of crypto exchange services, in addition to providing verification and ratings for each platform. The service has been operating since 2007.BestChange.ru website has been blocked multiple times before. As reported by Russian news agency RBC, the website was first blocked back in 2017. The website remained available through the use of services like VPN, the report notes. Roskomnadzor reportedly blocked BestChange.ru again in 2019, arguing that distribution of information about Bitcoin “contradicts Federal laws and is prohibited on the territory of Russia.”The news comes shortly after Russia finally passed its first legislation related to the cryptocurrency industry. As President Vladimir Putin signed the bill into the law on July 31, payments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are going to become illegal on Russia’s territory starting from January 2021.A representative at BestChange.ru told Cointelegraph that the newly passed law, “On Digital Assets,” has not impacted the platform in terms of visits so far, but could potentially make things more difficult for crypto-related websites in Russia because it prohibits the distribution of information about crypto as a payment method."
568,"Leah McGrath Goodman, the Newsweek journalist who named Japanese-American man Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto as Bitcoin’s founder in 2014, is doubling down on her claim.In an Aug. 25 episode of the Pomp Podcast with Anthony Pompliano, McGrath Goodman revealed details of the research regarding her original Newsweek story including her written correspondence with Dorian Nakamoto.The journalist took Pomp through her investigation, saying that it had been relatively simple to contact some of the “top ten” Bitcoin pioneers over email prior to publication of the March 2014 story.Gavin Andresen and Hal Finney each provided key information that led McGrath Goodman to believe she was looking for a single person, rather than a team —  and that it wasn’t Bitgold inventor Nick Szabo.“[He] was a very prominent candidate for a lot of people but he clearly wasn't free to do what it was that those who spoke with Satoshi said what had to be done to create the code,” said McGrath Goodman.“His itinerary did not match at all — like a very busy person — this whole spending two years very quietly working.”One key piece of evidence in McGrath Goodman’s original story on the 64 year old Californian resident Dorian Nakamoto, was his statement in front of multiple witnesses, saying he was “no longer involved in that,” to which was widely interpreted as referring to Bitcoin.“I cannot discuss it,” Dorian reportedly said. “It’s been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.”McGrath Goodman said that one of the things she found most disappointing was Dorian’s claim “in the aftermath of saying he didn't know [we were talking about Bitcoin].”“He definitely knew that we were talking about it: we had been talking about it for weeks before I actually physically visited him.”McGrath Goodman also cited evidence directly linking Satoshi with Dorian’s location in Los Angeles, as Finney had posted data from a crashed file intended for the Bitcoin founder to fix.“That had an IP address in it that led us to the same neighborhood Dorian lives in, in LA,” the journalist told Pomp.The true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is the holy grail of information for those in the crypto community.The wide variety of candidates include Craig Wright, an Australian man often referred to as ‘Faketoshi’. Others still speculate that Szabo may be Satoshi or Blockstream’s Adam Back. Even Finney’s name carries weight for his early role in the cryptocurrency’s development. Technology pioneer John McAfee hasn’t said he is Satoshi, but is “99% certain” he knows who is."
569,"An investment firm FiCAS that manages Bitcoin Capital Active Exchange Traded Product, or BTCA, hopes it can foster mass adoption with its product that is traded on the Swiss Stock Exchange.  It can discretionarily allocate funds to fifteen different cryptocurrencies and fiat. Daniel Diemers, one of the directors of FiCAS, the company that manages the product, told Cointelegraph that these types of products are essential for the mass adoption of Bitcoin:The fact that the manager can discretionarily allocate funds to both crypto and fiat gives it an advantage over similar products, said Diemers. He clarified that the team relies on four frameworks to optimize their portfolio: technical analysis, fundamentals, sentiment analysis, and what he calls an ""agency model"". The latter comes down to observing the behavior of other major players in the market. The allocation is made publicly available on a monthly basis. According to the latest disclosure, almost 83% was invested in Bitcoin and 12% in Bitcoin Cash (BCH), with only a bit above 1% allocated to Ethereum (ETH).Initially, the BTCA was issued with the collateral value of 100 Swiss francs and has since appreciated 10%. In comparison, Grayscale's Bitcoin (BTC) Trust routinely commands a 20% premium in the over-the-counter market. In the case of Grayscale, the premium can be explained by the fact that it is more convenient for investors as they do not have to deal with wallets or custodians. They are also able to command such a markup due to the limited competition in the space."

572,"A Reddit user operating under the name “seraf1990” warned of a copy & paste crypto scam that replaced a wallet address he copied from Coinbase with one belonging to scammers. According to seraf1990, he lost about $350 worth of Bitcoin (BTC) — money that he notes was meant to go towards his rent for next month.The post explains that seraf1990 was attempting to cash out some BTC by sending it from Binance to his account on Coinbase. After copying the exchange’s Bitcoin wallet address, he pasted it into the appropriate field back on Binance and completed the transaction “without second thought.” It was only later that he realized the address had somehow been swapped.This type of attack is fairly common, except for one crucial difference. When a bad actor swaps out your address for one of their own, the two keys are usually completely different from one another, making the exploit reasonably easy to spot. In seraf1990’s case, however, the first four digits of the two addresses were identical.Compounding this issue was the fact that Coinbase only displayed the first few digits of the wallet on the user’s device. In the post, seraf1990 stated that the device used in the transaction was a Windows-powered PC. Some replies speculated that malware could be behind the crypto scam, though the method was never directly confirmed.A similar incident was reported by Cointelegraph in June. Cybercriminals were reportedly impersonating an encrypted messaging service in order to steal Bitcoin via the copy & paste function."

574,"A trader has managed to secure over 4,000% profit in less than three weeks as part of the World Series of Trading, or WSOT — a competition hosted by leverage crypto trading exchange, Bybit.Using his Twitter name for the competition, SalsaTekila appears on the WSOT troop leaderboard, advancing his team forward with 4,495.95% profit. The trader started the competition trading with just 0.19 Bitcoin (BTC), but has managed to turn that into about 8.76 BTC over the course of the competition.The trader jumped on Tone Vays' YouTube channel on Aug. 25 to talk about the competition, revealing his strategy mostly revolves around short-term trading, known as scalping. He also noted using a riskier money management strategy in the early days of the competition, given the pace at which he needed to build profits. Bybit launched its inaugural WSOT on Aug. 10 with two main categories — team BTC, also known as troop BTC, and individual USDT. On the troop side, the category in which SalsaTekila competes, traders rounded up a posse of team members, competing alongside teammates for the best average overall profit/loss ratio, or P&L, trading Bitcoin USD perpetual swap contracts on Bybit. Awards also exist for the top individual P&L and profit among all traders in the troop division. SalsaTekila's team, Jalapeno, is currently in first place, with SalsaTekila having the best P&L. A team called W.T.C holds second place as of press time. A trader under the tag junki84 leads his team, touting  an additionally impressive 3,591.56% profit. Starting with 0.30 BTC, junki84 has traded his way up to 11.206 BTC since the competition's start. Tweeting about the competition, SalsaTekila has often referenced his rivalry with junki84, as the two traders battle it out for top standings in the three categories.The competition which ends on Aug 31, boasts 135 teams, for a combined total of 10,240 traders.Cointelegraph reached out to SalsaTekila for comment, and will update if we receive a response."

They additionally expect 4.836 billion yuan ($702 million) specifically from crypto mining activities.It is not known whether this ruling will be a short-term measure or if it will continue indefinitely.One of the biggest Bitcoin (BTC) mining facilities, run by Bitmain, is located in the nearby city of Ordos.Recently, asset manager Fidelity and crypto research firm BitOoda released a report claiming that China is responsible for around 50% of all Bitcoin mining. This is contrary to previous figures, which placed China’s involvement in Bitcoin at around 65%."
576,"Even as fears of another blanket ban on India’s digital asset market linger on, peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading within the Asian powerhouse is still surging, hitting all-time highs over the first week of August. This immense growth was initially spurred by the Supreme Court’s unequivocal decision earlier in March 2020 to repeal an unconstitutional circular imposed by the Reserve Bank of India forbidding local banks and various financial institutions from providing services to crypto exchanges and investors.According to data aggregated by peer-to-peer Bitcoin (BTC) marketplaces Paxful and Localbitcoins, weekly trading volumes in India have been gaining ground consistently since April. For example, during the first week of August, BTC’s local trade quota stood at $4.4 million, a sharp increase from the $1.52 million weekly trade volume that was witnessed during the first week of January 2020.Additionally, even during the month of March when the Supreme Court lifted the RBI ban and the sentiment of local crypto traders was at its peak, the highest recorded weekly P2P trade volume for BTC was around the $2.28 million mark.Commenting on the rise of P2P trade in India, Nischal Shetty, CEO of Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, told Cointelegraph that the 2018 restrictions imposed by the RBI made it difficult for Indians to convert rupees to crypto and vice versa. Since the ban was lifted, however, a number of crypto exchanges have been able to create direct banking channels for local currency deposits and withdrawals, thus contributing to the surge in P2P trade. Shetty added:As various P2P trading platforms continue to witness an increasing amount of mainstream usage, P2P trade volumes have also spiked across a number of Indian cryptocurrency exchanges. This increase in volume can be attributed to the overall positive sentiment surrounding the global crypto sector, reinforced by milestones such as United States banks being allowed to offer cryptocurrency custody services to their clients as well as various mainstream corporations entering the relatively nascent space.Expounding his views on the matter, Ashish Singhal, CEO of CoinSwitch, an Indian cryptocurrency exchange, pointed out to Cointelegraph that P2P trade volumes on local Indian exchanges are easily surpassing those currently being witnessed across various other P2P platforms:Lastly, on Aug. 5, prominent cryptocurrency exchange OKEx announced the launch of its peer-to-peer trading platform, which will allow Indian crypto enthusiasts to buy and sell BTC and USDT with zero transaction fees using Indian rupees.While the announcement acknowledges the current uncertainty surrounding the Indian crypto ecosystem, OKEx CEO Jay Hao previously shared with Cointelegraph his firm belief that another blanket ban is unlikely: “We are willing to support our Indian partners and are hopeful that we can work with regulators to clarify their main doubts and issues with cryptocurrencies.”Despite the Supreme Court ruling in favor of crypto earlier this year, Shetty firmly believes that owing to the fact that crypto is still a nascent technology, a number of myths and misinformation continue to surround the market at large. However, he is extremely optimistic that the Indian government will follow in the footsteps of countries like Japan, the U.S., the United Kingdom and Australia in regulating its local digital asset market.Amid the devastation to the Indian economy by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, with many employees laid off across industrial sectors, crypto remains one of the very few sectors that continues to display sustained growth.Thus, it could be in the Indian government’s best interest to help along the industry by creating the right regulatory environment instead of implementing a restrictive proposal titled “Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2019,” which seeks to ban digital assets on the basis perceived negative use cases such as money laundering, terrorism financing and so on. However, Singhal is confident that after having learned about the actual utility of crypto and blockchain tech, the Supreme Court is highly unlikely to reconsider its current stance:Singhal also pointed out that the Indian government has yet to clarify its stance on the legal status of the industry and whether the blanket ban is still possible. Meanwhile, officials have clearly stated several times that crypto is not on the same legal stature as the Indian rupee. However, this is not necessarily an anti-crypto stance, since most countries that regulate crypto also consider it an asset class instead of a currency.As interest in crypto continues to rise, crypto exchange Binance announced on Aug. 24 that it will host a first-of-its-kind decentralized finance-oriented hackathon followed by an accelerator program in the country. Dubbed “Build for Bharat,” a spokesperson for the company stated that the goal is to bridge the gap between the blockchain sector and mass adoption of crypto in India.As part of the hackathon, “special consideration will be given to various DeFi products that are related to mini-tokens, micro-financing applications, blockchain datasets, blockchain-AI solutions,” a company representative recently told Cointelegraph in an interview.Meanwhile, WazirX announced on August 15 that it is devising its first decentralized finance offering in partnership with the Matic network. Shetty revealed that the offering is currently under development and that a testnet version of the product should be available by the second half of September. Speaking with Cointelegraph about the potential of DeFi tech, Shetty added: “After having made it easy for Indians to access crypto, we want to make it easy for billions of Indians to participate in the DeFi ecosystem.”"
577,"Bitcoin (BTC) is getting most of its price support from the Federal Reserve itself, entrepreneur Tyler Winklevoss believes.In a tweet on Aug. 25, the Gemini exchange co-founder argued that Fed policy is and will continue to bolster Bitcoin’s fortunes.The reason, Winklevoss said, is that the fallout from coronavirus containment measures across the United States’ economy will mean that the central bank accidentally makes Bitcoin more appealing and the dollar less so.On Thursday, Fed chairman Jerome Powell will deliver a speech that commentators expect will contain an announcement on letting inflation rise dramatically.This alone makes Bitcoin, which has a fixed unalterable issuance and supply, instantly attractive.“The Fed, under the leadership of Jerome Powell, continues to be Bitcoin's biggest booster,” Winklevoss wrote. “On Thursday, he will deliver a speech about how the Fed will begin targeting higher inflation.”As Cointelegraph reported, anticipation around the Fed inadvertently plugging safe havens such as gold and Bitcoin has been building as both assets see price surges in line with rises in central banks’ balance sheets.Earlier this month, Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, said that heightened inflation targets would be “wildly bullish” for precious metals.Bitcoin price, inflation and stock-to-flow chart.

According to Gas Station, Tether is the second highest source of network fees with a gas usage of $8.6 million over the past thirty days.The ever increasing fees for Ethereum usage has prompted Tether to migrate some of its supply over to faster networks such as the Layer 2 solution OMG Network, and the EOS and Tron blockchains."
579,"The crypto price surge since March has been accompanied by a wave of cryptojacking attacks according to new research published by cybersecurity firm Symantec.According to the company there was a 163% increase in browser-based cryptojacking activity in the second quarter of 2020. Cryptojacking had previously been in a steep decline from March 2019 due to the shutdown of the mining script maker, CoinHive.Symantec points out the increase in the last quarter coincided with a surge in the value of Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XMR), two cryptocurrencies often mined by the threat actors that rely on browser-based cryptojacking malware.Cryptojacking saw a high activity period from September 2017 to March 2019, becoming one of the most prevalent forms of cyber-attacks at that time. But in 2019, the CoinHive project reportedly became economically inviable. Per the announcement, the mining service stopped its operations on March 8, 2019. Among the reasons behind the closure, the developers noted a 50 percent drop in hash rate following the last Monero hard fork.During an interview with Cointelegraph on August 01, Josh Lemos, VP of research and intelligence at BlackBerry, said that crypto miners don’t need to be sophisticated and can be delivered in various ways:""From JavaScript running on a website as a watering hole attack or embedded in a spear-phishing email to supply chain attacks with miners embedded in docker hub images and malicious browser extensions.”However in a recent report ZDNet suggested that the current increase in attacks was unlikely to be sustained.“Most cybercrime groups who experimented with cryptojacking operations in the past usually dropped it weeks later, as they also discovered that browser-based cryptocurrency-mining was both a waste of their time and too noisy, drawing more attention to their respective operations than profits.”"
580,"After exiting the crypto space at a loss last week following his high-profile entry, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy is hinting he’s not completely finished with Bitcoin yet.In an Aug. 25 tweet to his 1.7 million followers, the day-trading king said he would “save” Bitcoin and cryptocurrency — but only if asked nicely.“It looks like I didn’t buy and sell the top in Bitcoin after all since it’s all significantly lower than when I got involved,” said Portnoy. “Should I take a few minutes away from stacking stacks on Wall Street to save the flailing crypto market?”I will save #bitcoin amd #Crypto if they ask me nicely.It’s unclear what the Barstool founder meant by this statement, but it may be related to the price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropping 3.7% in the last 24 hours, from $11,764 to $11,325 as of this writing.Portnoy became more involved in the crypto space after hosting Gemini exchange founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss for a discussion on Bitcoin and other tokens on Aug. 13. Since their meeting, the Barstool founder said he had made nearly $100,000 in profit from Bitcoin before later reporting he sold his coins at a $25,000 loss on Aug. 21.Despite previously calling Chainlink (LINK) advocates frauds in the crypto space, the Barstool founder included LINK in his “bailout” offer. Shortly after his Bitcoin and crypto comments, Portnoy also asked his Twitter followers: “Is it time to save the LINK Marines?”A day earlier, Gemini’s Tyler Winklevoss had foreshadowed Portnoy’s return.""Those who think @stoolpresidente  is out of #Bitcoin and crypto so easily, don’t understand the man. Remember, #DDTG does not play checkers, he plays 3D chess.""Many of the responses from Crypto Twitter seemed to indicate that Bitcoin would be fine without Portnoy’s intervention.“That’s the greatness of Bitcoin,” said Crypto Rand to his 218,000 followers, “It doesn't need you. It doesn’t need anyone.”Gold bug Peter Schiff joined the discussion, stating that Portnoy should also stay out of it, but only because he believed Bitcoin was beyond saving:“If you encourage enough people to buy now, more people who got in early will be able to get out. But you won’t prevent the collapse, just delay it a bit. But why jump on a sinking ship, or encourage others to do so? You did right by cutting your losses.”"
581,"In recent weeks, the number of Bitcoin (BTC) addresses holding over 1,000 BTC — often referred to as “whales” — rapidly increased to around 2,088. This trend started shortly after Bitcoin price crashed to $3,600 in March.The data is relevant because historical data suggests that aggressive accumulation by large investors is typically a sign of a new bull cycle.Throughout the past six years, Bitcoin has seen periods of inverse correlation between whale accumulation phases and BTC price. Whenever the number of addresses holding substantial amounts of BTC dropped off, the price of BTC declined.Whales tend to follow areas that have the most liquidity, as they deal with large amounts of Bitcoin. As such, when whales believe the price of BTC has reached a top, they sell quickly, causing the number of large addresses holding BTC to drop.As an example, in early 2018, after the price of Bitcoin hit $20,000, the number of Bitcoin addresses with 1,000 BTC ($11 million) declined to levels unseen since 2014.Another on-chain metric that is not limited to whales suggests investors are generally accumulating more Bitcoin than before. Glassnode found that addresses that never spent BTC but have been active in the last seven years increased noticeably since 2018. The researchers wrote:“There are over 500,000 #Bitcoin ""accumulation addresses"" holding a total of 2.6M $BTC (~14%) Accumulation addresses: have 2+ incoming txs [transactions], never spent BTC, were active in the past 7 years (accounting for lost coins), exchanges and miners are excluded.”The number of Bitcoin accumulation addresses. Source: GlassnodeWhile both data points are acknowledged as bullish trends, it is also important to note that they have risen consistently over the past ten years.It is difficult to determine whether this data bodes well for the near-term price cycle of BTC. However, it does suggest a healthy long-term growth trend for Bitcoin.In addition to data which suggests an accumulation phase for Bitcoin, various fundamental factors signal stability in various industries.The hash rate of the Bitcoin blockchain network is continuously achieving record highs in spite of the May 11 halving. This indicates that the price point of BTC is high enough for miners to remain profitable.Balance of Bitcoin and Ether on exchanges. Source: GlassnodeTrading activity across top exchanges and regulated futures markets like CME also remains high. But, the reserves of BTC on exchanges have dropped significantly in comparison to previous bull cycles.The trend of high trading activity and a low BTC reserves hint that investors are likely buying BTC on exchanges rather than selling. Rafael Schultze-Kraft, the chief technical officer at Glassnode, said:“Exchange balances YTD change: BTC: -9.6%, ETH: +10.4%.”Since most retail investors use spot cryptocurrency exchanges, while institutions use regulated investment vehicles and some whales use over-the-counter exchanges, data suggests that both retail and whales appear to be accumulating Bitcoin."
582,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) abruptly fell from $11,823 to $11,102 in the last 48 hours. While on a macro level the digital asset remains in an uptrend, there appear to be three key factors behind the pullback.XBT-USD 1 week chart. Source: TradingView.comThe presence of a crucial resistance level at $12,000, several whales taking profit, and a retest of a major support area likely catalyzed the drop.Since the first week of August, Bitcoin has attempted to breach the $11,800 to $12,500 resistance range. Every one of the five attempts to surge past $12,500, $12,000 and $11,800 levels has resulted in steep rejections.One potential reason the $12,000 level has served as a difficult resistance area for buyers is that it has been a historically relevant resistance area. After February 2018 and July 2019, this is the third time in two years that BTC has tested this resistance zone.BTC-USD daily chart showing key support areas. Source: DonAltA pseudonymous trader known as “DonAlt” said while Bitcoin could rebound, bears have an easier invalidation than before. He said:“May find temporary relief here but still looks pretty heavy. Bears have an even easier invalidation now than they had before, if price takes out $11,760 on a closing basis, BTC is probably going higher. Until it does I'll assume it's going lower.”Ever since the price of Bitcoin surpassed $10,000 on July 26, it has remained above the $10,000 to $10,500 support range.Given that the $10,000 level has become a significant support level for Bitcoin, the possibility of a major support retest exists. On-chain analyst Willy Woo also pointed out that a drop below $10,900 could lead to a CME gap fill, which is present at $9,700.Woo said:“The channel we are in is being tested right now. I don't think it will hold. I don't usually do price targets, as on-chain only does directionality. But here's my critical support levels based on TA. BTW, if the 10,900 level fails, the lower 9,700 level would fill the CME gap.”As Cointelegraph previously reported, a Bitcoin whale who purchased 9,000 BTC in early 2018 recently took profit around the $12K level. At the current price of around $11,300, 9,000 BTC is worth nearly $101.7 million.Some whales appear to be taking profit because the $11,500 to $12,000 range is where many are either at breakeven or in profit. On Aug. 16 cryptocurrency analyst David Puell said:“Finally, unspent whale clusters confirm a great battle taking place. Two actors at play: top buyers at 12k-14k reaching their breakeven price, and current buyers active after the first higher high in over a year. If we get a correction, it will most likely result in another major cluster of re-accumulation at the 10k area (as expected from the volume profile before); if we breakout, well... enjoy the ride.”Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that today’s mild correction was the result of Bitcoin’s steep rejection at a key resistance range, some whales taking profit, and the presence of a major CME gap at $9,700."
583,"On August 24, INX launched a tokenized initial public offering or IPO which was cleared by the SEC. The company describes its mission as bringing ""regulated digital asset opportunities to institutions and retail investors"". The following day, several crypto influencers tweeted what appeared to be promotional statements about the company and its token. Stefan Jespers, known as WhalePanda on Twitter, compared the INX token to Binance's BNB:Source: Twitter.A similar sentiment was voiced by Jameson Lopp, the CTO of Casa and a self-proclaimed cypherpunk:Both Jespers and Lopp are considered Bitcoin maximalists — a group that some categorize as holding negative attitudes towards altcoins and token offerings. Their statements left many feeling befuddled, with some surmising that the Twitter accounts in question may have been compromised. In the end, there was a more prosaic explanation for this unusual behavior, however. According to a tweet by CobraBitcoin, the long-time custodian of Bitcoin.org's website, the individuals in question had received INX options at $0.01 per token. He alleged that this would allow them to make a 90x profit during the IPO:Source: Twitter.Other notable members of the Bitcoin maximalist camp appeared as company advisors as well, including Alena Vranova, the founder of SatoshiLabs and Samson Mow, the chief strategy officer at Blockstream. All parties, with the exception of Mow, are listed on the company's website. Neither Vranova or Mow have tweeted about the exchange or its public offering. Company advisors often receive various stock options as payment for their support. However, some may find it hypocritical that the same people who have accused others of selling ""snake oil"" are now promoting a token offering without offering the proper disclosures.Blockstream's CEO Adam Back recently likened many of the biggest altcoin projects to a Ponzi scheme. He does not appear to mind Mow's position at INX, however."
584,"Waterloo, Ontario is the first Canadian city to issue a general warning after 78 residents were duped by crypto scammers in 2020.According to Global News, Waterloo residents have lost more than $430,000 so far this year, with 29 of the 78 falling victim in July alone. As previously reported, fraudsters have been impersonating government officials, asking victims to deposit money in various Bitcoin (BTC) ATMs under the threat of legal ramifications. Scammers told one resident that more than 25 bank accounts had been opened under his name, and then used to launder money. He was instructed to deposit over CAD $10,000 in various BTC cash machines to resolve a fake legal warning related to the supposed allegations.The increasing number of cases encouraged the Waterloo Regional Police Service to launch a “Fraud Awareness” campaign in an effort to prevent people from falling victim to these scams.The Canadian Anti-Fraud Center also released figures related to Bitcoin-related telephone scams, seemingly confirming the authorities findings. In the first seven months of 2020, the center received 23,655 reports of fraudsters calling victims to ask for Bitcoin payments.Jeff Thomson, senior intelligence analyst of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, told Global News:“We did see a dip in these calls through April and May, but as things have come back online, we’ve seen a great increase in scam calls.”However, he clarified that not all the people who reported such scam calls had lost money. Some were prevented from engaging with the scammers by the authorities, though no figures relating to prevention were provided.Thomson also said that the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is working to trace the calls performed by the scammers."
585,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has increased by nearly 30% since late June, from $8,905 to just under $11,500 as of press time. Following the strong rally of the dominant cryptocurrency, three macro factors point at an optimistic medium-term trend. These macro factors hint at a positive medium-term to long-term price cycle but suggest that in the near term, momentum will fade and a consolidation phase will happen.As Cathy Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, discussed on the In the Know podcast, there is technically little resistance between $13,000 and BTC’s all-time high of $20,000. Wood noted that BTC might see a new trading range between $10,000 and $13,000, which would establish a healthy consolidation phase:“That $13,000 [level] is important because if we were to get through that, then in technical terms, there would be very little resistance and we would probably be on our way back to the peaks we saw in late 2017 — so, around $20,000. Now, we’re not sure if that is going to happen. We could stay in a new trading range, just at a little bit of a higher level than the recent six to 10. Maybe we’re in the $10,000 to $13,000 range. Nonetheless, a breakout.”Whether Bitcoin remains in the $10,000–$13,000 range for an extended period remains uncertain. In the past three years, BTC has tended to consolidate throughout September to October and rally during mid-November. Considering the activation of the block reward halving on May 11, the probability of an uptrend in November to December remains high.A persistent narrative around the long-term prosperity of Bitcoin is the decline of the United States dollar. In recent months, primarily due to the pandemic and the U.S. economy struggling to reopen, the dollar’s value has fallen against other reserve currencies.On July 31, Lee Hardman, currency analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, said the sell-off of the dollar was “relentless.” According to Supriya Menon, multiasset strategist at Pictet Asset Management, various macro factors including the soaring number of COVID-19 cases and the uncertainty around the November presidential election were contributing to the dollar’s weakness.Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer of CoinShares, believes that periods of economic uncertainty and dollar weakness would likely benefit Bitcoin, like they do gold:“So where does bitcoin sit in the economic cycle? during periods of economic uncertainty and dollar weakness, #Bitcoin is likely to benefit in the same way as gold. If bitcoin’s financialization continues, it will be unable to remain insulated from the financial system.”Whether the falling momentum of the dollar has already had its full effect on the price of Bitcoin remains unclear. The U.S. dollar has already dropped to a two-year low, and in the near term, analysts anticipate a dollar recovery.But two variables that could cause the dollar to drop further are low interest rates and the European Union’s sizable stimulus package. The euro has outperformed the dollar in recent weeks, as investors found the EU’s 750 billion euro recovery fund compelling. Atop the aggressive fiscal policies of Europe, the U.S. economy’s path to recovery has not been strongly established. Patrik Schowitz, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, noted:“U.S. economic outperformance relative to the euro area and Japan (no longer) seems guaranteed, at least over the next few years, given the faltering virus response. […] The shrinking of its interest rate advantage makes the USD less appealing and pushes investors to consider deposits in other currencies. These cyclical factors won’t turn around in a hurry and the US dollar likely has room to fall further.”The fading trend of the dollar coincides with the expectations of higher inflation rates in the intermediate term. If many perceive Bitcoin as a store of value and a potential hedge against inflation, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s upcoming speech could strengthen the image of BTC for the long term.On Aug. 27, Powell is expected to deliver a speech at a virtual Fed conference and address soft inflation. For now, the markets are not counting on the Fed to lead significant changes on its fiscal policies. As such, even if the Fed says that it might let inflation rates run higher for a while, it might not have a profound effect on BTC.Possibly due to the falling dollar, gold and Bitcoin have seen a more correlated price cycle in recent months. According to data from Skew, Bitcoin and gold have rallied in tandem since mid-July and have similarly pulled back simultaneously since the first week of August.There are several reasons Bitcoin and gold might be seeing similar price movements. First, through growing institutional activity, the public image of BTC as a store of value has strengthened. Investment firms, such as Ark Invest have cited the bulk Bitcoin purchase of $250 million by MicroStrategy as a symbolic strategy that could buoy the sentiment around Bitcoin over the longer term. Second, both Bitcoin and gold have seemingly demonstrated inverse correlation with stocks since the start of August.Related: Bitcoin and Economic Uncertainty: Patience Is the Name of the GameThe similarities in the price cycles of gold and Bitcoin do not necessarily benefit BTC in the immediate future, but they hint that investors might be considering BTC more as a store of value and a safe-haven asset than as a risk-on asset such as single stocks.Various on-chain macro metrics suggest that Bitcoin is seeing an extended accumulation phase, where investors are increasingly purchasing BTC with the intent of holding. Grayscale, a cryptocurrency-focused investment firm with $5.9 billion in assets under management, found that the number of BTC held for over a year has increased substantially.Citing data from Glassnode, crypto market analysis firm Unfolded said that the number of Bitcoin addresses holding more than $11 million hit a new all-time high. The trend shows that more large-scale investors are accumulating BTC, likely with a longer-term investment thesis and the intent to hold.Generally, most on-chain data and macro factors point toward a high probability of a Bitcoin bull market entering 2021. In the short term, there are several risks in market structure that could prevent an early breakout. The most prominent roadblock in the short-term price cycle of BTC is likely the heavy $12,000–$13,000 resistance range, which marked the peak of previous attempts to break out of $14,000.The confluence of the likelihood of Bitcoin to see low volatility in September and October and the repeated rejection of $12,000 could slow the momentum of BTC in the near term. But over the medium term to long term, especially approaching late November to December, there are an abundance of macro factors that could strengthen the case for a Bitcoin price upsurge."
586,"After the May 11 halving, some skeptics speculated that miners would capitulate or that the entire process would enter a death spiral. Fast-forward three months, and the Bitcoin hash rate is at a record high.An all-time high hash rate and a stable Bitcoin (BTC) mining industry are both positive signs for the medium-term to long-term trend of BTC.According to data from Glassnode, the mining difficulty of Bitcoin increased by 3.6% on Aug. 24 and is now at a new high. The data shows that many miners are actively mining BTC, even more so than before the halving occured.Bitcoin mining difficulty alongside BTC price. Source: GlassnodeAlthough the Bitcoin hash rate has continuously hit new record highs over the years, this time is slightly different due to the timing.Three months ago, Bitcoin underwent its third block reward halving in history. Due to the fixed supply of 21 million, the rate at which the remaining supply is mined drops by half every four years through a halving.As such, miners earn 50% less Bitcoin every four years, despite spending an increasing amount of money on electricity and other operational costs.Theoretically, an increasing BTC price should offset the lower number of BTC that miners earn, but the price of BTC would have to double within a short period to make mining more compelling.The rapid recovery of the hash rate since the halving and the all-time high difficulty suggest miners are anticipating a strong medium-term Bitcoin price trend.Another reason behind the surge in hash rate could be the profitability of miners in China. Sichuan province is currently going through its rainy season, and the abundance of hydroelectric power plants in the region allows miners to obtain cheaper electricity, which in turn reduces their overall costs.Mining Store’s CEO, J. P. Baric, said:“Bitcoin mining revenue with the latest generation hardware ranges anywhere from $70/MWh to north of $200/MWh depending on price, global hashrate, and difficulty. Power is currently generated at a price of $17 an MWh at a Natural Gas Plant. Do the math.”The confluence of cheaper electricity in China and the optimistic stance of miners on the price of BTC appears to be catalyzing the hash rate.Sarcastically implying that the mining sector is nowhere close to capitulation, Rafael Schultze-Kraft, chief technical officer of Glassnode, said:“Difficulty has increased 9% since the halving. ‘Miner capitulation.’.”The term miner capitulation refers to a phase wherein the majority of overleveraged and small miners shut down. Capitulation could cause the hash rate of Bitcoin to decline substantially in the near term, but since May, there has been no noticeable decline in Bitcoin’s hash rate.Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst, previously said that miners are one of the two main sources of external selling pressure on Bitcoin price. When miners sell-off BTC, it tends to apply significant pressure on the cryptocurrency market.Based on the trend of the mining difficulty and hash rate, miners are not likely to sell BTC en masse in the near term.Unless the price of BTC drops intensely to the point where miners can no longer sustain operations for a while, the momentum of the mining sector will likely remain strong."
587,"There is “too much money to spend,” and this will help Bitcoin (BTC) reach its next phase of huge price increases, analysts believe.In a blog post on Aug. 25, Jeroen Blokland, portfolio manager at asset manager Robeco, noted that U.S. M2 money velocity had hit historic lows.Velocity measures the speed at which money moves around the economy, and 2020 has seen a crash in the metric.“Theoretically, the velocity of money rises when economic activity increases,” Blokland wrote. “While the sudden economic stop obviously resulted in much lower economic activity, the sharp decline also suggests there is just too much money to spend. A quick look at central bank balance sheets confirms this.”The huge money printing activities by the Federal Reserve alone have characterized the period since March, when coronavirus sparked a cross-asset market crash.U.S. money velocity chart. Source: RobecoAs Cointelegraph reported, rising central bank balance sheets in G4 nations have come in tandem with rises in safe haven assets — Bitcoin, gold and silver.For PlanB, the quant analyst behind Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow price forecasting models, the collapse in money velocity will only serve to speed the largest cryptocurrency on its way to recent predictions — an average of $288,000 by 2024.The stock-to-flow cross-asset model (S2FX) delivers multiple “phases” of Bitcoin as an asset, and the $288,000 price point forms part of phase five.“S2FX: $288k is the cluster center (S2F-marketvalue centroid) of next phase, like $6700 was the cluster center of last/current phase,” PlanB tweeted in March, commenting on an explanatory chart.“We don't know exactly (yet) when phase 5 starts and ends, but looking at past clusters: roughly 6 months after 2020 halving, until 2024 halving+6m.”Meanwhile, Blokland warned about the impact of low velocity on financial policy. This week, the Fed is widely tipped to announce plans to raise its inflation target to up to 4%.“The low velocity of money also means that even more money is needed to create inflation. So far, however, this has only resulted in asset price inflation,” he added."
588,"Major cryptocurrency mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain is making a major sale to Riot Blockchain, a Nasdaq-listed crypto mining company.According to an Aug. 24 announcement, the firms signed a $17.7 million purchase agreement for 8,000 Bitmain Antminer S19 Pros that includes a delivery schedule of 2,000 units on a monthly basis starting in January 2021 until the order is complete.Bitmain launched the Antminer S19 Pro earlier this year, with a hash rate of 110 terahashes per second and a power efficiency of ~29.5 joules per terahash, nearly double the power efficiency per terahash of previous miner models.Irene Gao, Antminer sales director of the NCSA region at Bitmain, stated that the purchase will help Riot expand their position in the market and praised what she believes is an “outstanding power efficiency” offered by Antminer S19 Pro.The company clarified that, once the new S19 Pros are fully deployed, Riot expects its total hash rate capacity to be approximately 1.45 exahash per second.Research firm Hurun published a list of global unicorns, or companies worth more than a billion dollars, in 2020, and showed that Bitmain plummeted significantly in terms of valuation.Last year the company posted a $12 billion valuation, but this has since fallen to $4 billion. According to Hurun, one reason behind Bitmain's drop is the “mediocre post-IPO performance of its rival, Canaan.”On Aug. 6, Bitmain announced that they will be delaying their June and July 2020 Antminer orders by at least two or three months due to “external interference on company operation.”"
589,"Whistleblowers helped Tavanir, Iran’s power company, shut down 1100 crypto mining farms that were allegedly operating without the proper licenses. Although Tavanir says that some of the miners were using “high levels” of subsidized electricity, their report clarified that no significant changes were spotted in terms of electricity consumption. Local authorities said that this is why they had to rely on whistleblowers, noting that Tavanir “cannot detect all illegal farms solely by studying their consumption patterns.”Individuals who provided information leading to the detection of unauthorized miners received 100 million rials ($480) for their cooperation, the Financial Tribune said.Iran recently announced that they will allow industrial-scale power plants to operate as Bitcoin miners — provided they don’t use subsidized fuel.The national law on crypto mining states that miners should disclose their identities and provide detailed information to the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Trade. This information includes the size of their mining farms and the type of hardware they’re using, and is collected in an attempt to prevent smuggling into the country. Miners are defined as both individuals and companies.Illegal crypto miners risk fines that range from $2,000-$5,000 for each piece of hardware used, and an additional fine of $20,000 for anyone caught using a subsidized electricity source.Back in May, Iran’s Ministry of Industry, Mine, and Trade granted iMiner, a cryptocurrency mining company, a license to operate in the country. With 6,000 rigs, iMiner’s setup becomes one of the largest crypto miners in Iran.The Iranian government authorized cryptocurrency mining as an industrial activity in July 2019, and has since issued over 1,000 licenses to crypto mining companies."
590,"As the monthly candle close of Bitcoin (BTC) comes closer, signs of heightened volatility are emerging. With just four days until the highly anticipated expiration of Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures contracts and Deribit options, BTC’s near-term direction remains uncertain.Three reasons to expect a spike in volatility over the next week are BTC’s prolonged consolidation, a key resistance level overhead, and the sizable expirations of BTC futures and options contracts.On Aug. 17, the price of Bitcoin surged to as high as $12,486 on Coinbase, achieving a new yearly high. Since then, the price has consolidated within a tight range and been unable to break above $12,000 again.When Bitcoin consolidates for extended periods without clear price movement to either direction, it tends to see high volatility. Since Aug. 19, the Bitcoin price has stayed within a 4.5% range, which presents a tight range for BTC.BTC/USD nears a crucial support.

Referring to the $11,650 to $11,730 support range, the trader said:“If we can hold the grey, wick into it could be a long entry. I think we’ll push up to $12.1k. Lose the grey, flip short towards $11.1k.”Although the open interest in the Deribit Bitcoin options market is not as high as it was in June, there is $500 million worth of options open for the Aug 28 contract. The simultaneous expiration of August options and futures contracts could cause large Bitcoin price movements. One options trader said:“Not at June levels, but still a little over $0.5 billion of BTC option OI currently sitting in 28AUG20 on Deribit.”Josh Olszewicz, a popular cryptocurrency technical analyst, hinted that CME Bitcoin futures expirations could also lead to intense price action. He said:“CME BTC futs [futures] roll this week. Watch for increased shenanigans.”Bitcoin futures contracts on CME that face expiration. Source: Josh Olszewicz. Since early August, the price of Bitcoin has rejected at the $11,900 level twice, both times seeing a relatively large sell-off shortly thereafter.In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin rejected from the $11,800 to $11,900 resistance range once again. If BTC continues to fall in the short term, it could print a lower high formation on lower time frame charts.According to researchers at Glassnode, on-chain fundamentals slightly dropped off in the past week. They said:“Bitcoin on-chain fundamentals decreased slightly during Week 34. GNI lost 6 points, dropping from 71 to a current level of 65 points. This was due mostly to a decrease in the Sentiment subindex, while Network Health and Liquidity also saw small decreases.”The confluence of a minor decline in fundamentals, prolonged consolidation, options expiration, and a key near-term resistance raises the chances of a major price reaction."
591,"The coronavirus pandemic has forced people to change several social behavioral habits. Along with maintaining social distance from one another, people are also averse to using notes, coins or cards as they might transmit COVID-19. A new report from the Bank for International Settlements suggested that social distancing procedures and the “government-to-person payment schemes” have accelerated the efforts towards launching central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The paper shows that the public interest in CBDCs has exceeded that of Bitcoin (BTC) and Libra in 2020.  However, the CBDCs will only be a digital version of the fiat currencies that will be controlled by the central banks. Hence, the problems that plague the U.S. dollar currently will even affect the digital version of the dollar. Therefore, after people familiarize with CBDCs and realize their ease of use, they are likely to warm up to cryptocurrencies due to their inherent advantages over fiat currencies.Daily cryptocurrency market performance.

592,"BitMex's 100x Group has awarded its last Bitcoin development grant of the year. The company has awarded a grant valued at $40,000 to Calvin Kim for his Bitcoin scalability solution, Utreexo — a project originally created by Tadge Dryja from the MIT Digital Currency Initiative.Bitcoin's protocol checks every proposed transaction to make sure that the sender has enough coins to complete the request. All unspent Bitcoin (BTC) is saved in what is known as UTXO, or Unspent Transaction Outputs. While the entire Bitcoin blockchain is currently around 300 GB, the UTXO is only 4 GB. MIT researchers have claimed that as the network grows, this may one day present a bottleneck of its own.With Utreexo, the person holding the funds specified in a particular transaction maintains the full UTXO data themself, proving that the funds exist. When they want to spend coins from their wallet, they present proof of their validity in the form of a hash, which takes up a lot less space than the original data. This, in turn, makes the protocol more scalable without sacrificing security, according to the project's researchers.This solution is reminiscent of the ""fast catch up"" concept recently proposed by Algorand. It is worth noting, however, that Bitcoin purists tend to be skeptical of any scalability solutions that seek to replace full nodes with hashes or zero-knowledge proofs. "
593,"Although the privacy-focused Bitcoin (BTC) wallet Wasabi Wallet recently dismissed allegations that its anonymity features may be compromised, a third-party expert disagrees.In an Aug. 19 blog post, Wasabi competitor Samourai claimed to have “discovered two potential privacy vulnerabilities in the Wasabi Wallet software.” Per the announcement, the company also found numerous issues with the anonymity of Wasabi Wallet’s CoinJoin Bitcoin mixer.Mário Havel, co-founder of crypto-and-privacy non-profit Paralelni Polis, said that Samourai’s allegations seem credible and can be verified in Wasabi’s code. He explained:“Disclosed vulnerabilities [...] are not affecting the security of the wallet. [Instead they] affect only [the anonymity in] some CoinJoin scenarios in which the user is mixing more [unspent transaction outputs].”Wasabi lead developer Adam Ficsor explained that the issue raised by Samourai is the lack of randomness in unspent transaction output, or UTXO, selection when performing CoinJoin mixing. He claimed that this does not impact anonymity, since only the users themselves know all the UTXOs in their wallet.Havel pointed out that Wasabi users who use its CoinJoin feature should always know how to manage their UTXOs in a way that preserves anonymity:“Doing privacy correctly, especially with tools like coin control requires some learning and attention. In this case, the user has to be aware of possible attack scenarios and avoid them by managing UTXOs correctly.”Wasabi’s Ficsor also said that Samourai has “claimed to ‘deanonymize’ Wasabi numerous times in the past.” This statement is in line with July 2019 reports in which Samourai first raised concerns over Wasabi’s CoinJoin implementation. Ficsor said that “the community knows their claims are inflated.” Mário Havel disagrees:“There were many clashes in the past, more or less reasonable, but generally Samourai research does a good and interesting job for the privacy ecosystem of Bitcoin. Most of the claims against Wasabi are based around [the aforementioned problem, which is that] it requires some knowledge to use it properly privately.”Havel does admit, however, that “Samourai and Wasabi are competition” and that both capitalize on their users’ CoinJoin fees. Both companies also benefit from damaging the reputation of their competition. He concluded:“Personally, I use both wallets since both have different features and perks. [...] Both are great wallets even without the CoinJoin feature and it is only up to the user how he uses it and what features of the wallet he needs.”"
594,"Bitcoin is “at the beginning” of an extended bull run, and there are increasingly clear reasons to accept it.That is the opinion of Dan Held, head of growth at United States cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, who listed the latest evidence for bullish Bitcoin (BTC) on Aug. 24.Many commentators have argued that Bitcoin is just getting started when it comes to price rises. For Held, the contributing factors are both Bitcoin-specific and macro-related.Over 97% of Bitcoin unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) — or parts of a transaction that involve coins returned to the initiator — are in profit.As Cointelegraph reported, this means that less than 3% of transactions occurred at a higher price than the recent high of $12,400. Typically, this occurs at the start of bullish periods.Put another way, almost 98% of all BTC is now worth more than when someone received it, meaning that long-term investors are better off than almost any time in the history of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has now stayed above $10,000 for the second-longest period in its lifespan, tied with July 2019.Bitcoin price periods about $10,000.

Source: Coin Metrics/TwitterHeld referred to 61% of the total BTC supply remaining stationary for over a year, something that Cointelegraph previously identified as a bullish signal — investors are choosing to hold and not to trade or sell. Exchange balances likewise hitting lows contributes to the theory.The above factors occurring in the months after Bitcoin’s third block subsidy halving bolster the bullish argument.Miners have recovered from the loss of revenue, while demand has remained conspicuous, especially from corporate and institutional buyers.At the same time, Bitcoin’s inflation rate has dipped as a result of the halving, making repeated large-scale buy-ins an increasingly expensive business.When MicroStrategy made Bitcoin its new treasury reserve currency, its CEO, Michael Saylor, highlighted monetary policy as a major concern that pushed him away from fiat currency.Held agreed, frequently pointing out the erratic money printing by central banks as a key argument in favor of Bitcoin adoption. This policy, he said, is now in “overdrive,” in the week that the Federal Reserve is tipped to reveal a plan to boost inflation.Lastly, global debt as a percentage of gross domestic product is now higher than at any point outside of wartime. This almost unbridled debt mountain — in excess of $255 trillion, even before coronavirus — shows no signs of slowing. The practice speaks to the classic Keynesian mantra regarding debt and its consequences for those who create it: “In the long run, we are all dead.”"

Our commitment to free and open-source software, or FOSS, has led us to provide three additional grants so far in 2020. Announced on Aug. 6, our most recent grant was awarded to Marco Falke, a Bitcoin Core maintainer and the most active contributor to the Bitcoin code since 2017. This has been preceded by three more: BTCPay, Amiti Uttarwar and Fabian Jahr.It’s been six months since we announced our first developer grant to a Bitcoin Core developer. In those months, we’ve witnessed the fallout from a global COVID-19 pandemic, and the strange and contrasting impact it has had on global communities and markets. While the general public has been pessimistic, experiencing hardship and loss, equity markets have been rising, with the Federal Reserve significantly increasing the money supply. These flaws in the existing economic systems have only served to further solidify the importance of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin (BTC) as an alternative, “sound” currency.We’ve also been inspired to heighten our role in supporting the open-source development of cryptocurrency infrastructure. Collectively, OKCoin has now provided over $500,000 in grants to open-source developers. Having provided these grants, we’ve been pleased to see other organizations get involved in supporting Bitcoin Core developer sponsorship as well.We’re excited to see the level of interest increase among a varied group of organizations, each of which views crypto from a different perspective. Optionality and partnership are very important in maintaining the independence of the developer community. This is why we partnered with BitMEX on our recent grant to Amiti Uttarwar, who has made strides in her work on Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer layer. Uttarwar’s contributions have strengthened Bitcoin Core, making the codebase more secure for everyone sending transactions.Money is the foundation of our society, and OKCoin is committed to building crypto for the long run. Therefore, we think it’s a natural concept for us to support the developers who contribute to making Bitcoin a stronger candidate as “sound” money.We’ve continued to focus on supporting Bitcoin Core with our latest sponsorships because we see great externality in Bitcoin Core. The development of Bitcoin supports the entire industry in the forms of education, validation and adoption.There may be many different versions in the future where crypto is impactful, but one of the most exciting versions may have a distributed and trustless monetary system, for example, Bitcoin, as a fundamental layer. On top of the new monetary system, a distributed and trustless financial system and a distributed and trustless society could emerge. To do that, Bitcoin needs to scale. Fabian Jahr, OKCoin’s first grant recipient, worked on accelerating remote procedure calls in the UTXO set — this is just one example of the direct impact developers have on building essential Bitcoin infrastructure.Bitcoin’s success is our success, so we don’t see developer grants as an obligation or as a donation. We see these grants as an investment in our future. Free and open-source software benefits everyone, and supporting it is particularly critical in crypto.Connecting with and backing Bitcoin developers has been a community effort, with a lot of knowledge shared among sponsors. Chaincode and Square Crypto have been very helpful to our efforts at OKCoin, and in order to strengthen this initiative, we’ve been happy to share what we’ve learned through the process with Kraken and others.While not all grants are done in partnership, sponsoring open-source development is ultimately a collaborative initiative. We’ve been open about what we’ve learned because we believe it’s healthy to build a community sponsorship matrix for FOSS development.The funding model that exists today for open-source work is based on corporate grants and financial backing. While corporate objectives may align with the work that FOSS developers are focused on, the credibility of their contributions to decentralized networks relies on their ability to function autonomously while being financially supported. We believe that allowing developers to do their work without conditions improves the quality of full-time developers committed to open-source development and ensures that the community of developers operates collectively and transparently. It’s on us as an industry to ensure that the right incentives are in place to attract and keep the best talent to help grow Bitcoin and the crypto industry.Just as companies are continuously developing, so too is the Bitcoin codebase. There is still much work to be done, and it’s important that the organizations that rely on the infrastructure support this work. It also matters how financial backing is provided; without strings attached, allowing developers to focus on what they believe is most crucial. We’re proud to have sponsored three independent developers and the BTCPay Server project and look forward to continuing to support the open-source community.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph."
596,"The United States is losing the ""technological cold war"" to China due to its tough regulatory approach to blockchain and cryptocurrency-related companies, a senior executive at Ripple believes.In an opinion article for The Hill on Aug. 21, Chris Larsen, co-founder and chairman at major crypto payments firm Ripple, said that China’s digital currency leadership is a “once-in-a-century opportunity” to replace the U.S. dollar with the digital yuan as the world’s reserve currency. Larsen set out the main reasons for China winning the U.S. in the ongoing technological struggle. Namely, China has “already achieved near universal use of digital payments” via tech giants like Alipay and WeChat. And while China is “on the cusp” of issuing its own central bank digital currency — the digital yuan — the U.S. still does not have an official digital dollar initiative, Larsen noted, adding:“At least 65 percent of cryptocurrency mining is concentrated in China, which means the Chinese government has the majority needed to wield control over those protocols and can effectively block or reverse transactions.”Larsen also mentioned China’s security expansion to Hong Kong, claiming that China is now “the only country in the world that controls two global financial centers.”In order to challenge China’s tech and crypto leadership, the U.S. “must recognize that strong American financial technology companies” are in its own national security interest, Larsen concluded. The exec said that the U.S. has to start the digital dollar initiative immediately to keep up with the digital yuan, with the next step to be establishing Silicon Valley as a global financial technology powerhouse.Larsen’s comments come amid the ongoing regulatory uncertainty around XRP. The third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, XRP is used by Ripple in its cross-border applications like On-Demand Liquidity (formerly xRapid).On Aug. 20, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse highlighted that the biggest challenge faced by Ripple so far is the lack of clarity around the regulatory status of XRP. The cryptocurrency project and Ripple are subject to multiple lawsuits alleging that XRP is an unregistered security."
597,"Micheal O’Leary, the CEO of major budget airline Ryanair, has come out very bearish on Bitcoin (BTC).Recently speaking to The Times, O’Leary likened Bitcoin to a Ponzi scheme and advised investors to avoid it:“I have never, and would never, invest one cent in Bitcoin, which I believe is equivalent to a Ponzi scheme. [...] I would strongly advise everyone with any shred of common sense to ignore this false story and avoid Bitcoin like a plague.”O’Leary was referring to an apparent crypto scam, “Bitcoin Lifestyle,” which claimed to have his approval in a promotional campaign. A bogus article on a fake news outlet claimed that, in an interview on the Late Late Show, O’Leary shocked audiences and the host Ryan Tubridy by showing how much money he was making with the Bitcoin scheme, which advertises itself as an automated trading system.According to the scam’s campaign, the publicity stunt was enough to drive National Ireland Bank to phone the show in an attempt to stop the bit from being aired.One problem is that the National Ireland Bank does not exist.Using the image of wealthy and famous people to promote cryptocurrency scams is a very common tactic to gain credibility among potential “investors.” In early April, a Bitcoin trading scam claimed the involvement of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex Prince Harry Charles Albert David and Meghan Markle.In March, Janet Jackson’s billionaire ex-husband Wissam Al Mana demanded Facebook to reveal who paid for ads featuring his image while promoting a crypto fraud."
598,"Bitcoin (BTC) starts another week in a bullish mood as hurdles line up to shape price trajectory.Cointelegraph presents five factors determining where BTC/USD may go in the coming days, and what traders should look out for.Stocks saw records last week with the S&P 500 hitting all-time highs. Despite a lower overall impact on Bitcoin, moves on macro markets are still more than capable of spilling over into cryptocurrency.Upward momentum continued on Monday, with stocks futures up but a sense of foreboding building about an upcoming speech from the United States Federal Reserve.Markets were waiting to hear news about inflation, which rumors previously suggested could target up to 4%.This would be a perfect storm for buoying safe havens, analysts said, in an environment which has already sent the U.S. dollar index to two-year lows and flooded the market with excess liquidity from quantitative easing. The news will come from Fed Chair Jerome Powell during its annual Economic Policy Symposium, held in Jackson Hole, Wyoming on Thursday.“More clarity will no doubt be sought via this week’s Jackson Hole Symposium,” Ben Emons of macro analysis firm Medley Global Advisors told Bloomberg on Monday.U.S. futures were meanwhile up on the day, while Asia set a bullish tone thanks to Washington reassuring on not blocking Chinese social media network WeChat — shares in owner Tencent rose over 4% as a result.On short timeframes, Bitcoin was pleasing analysts as the week began. For Cointelegraph Markets’ analyst Michaël van de Poppe, a run to lower levels was now less likely after BTC/USD avoided a retest of levels below $11,500 on Sunday night.In a transaction analysis video on Sunday, van de Poppe added that in the event of a breakdown, the “buy the dip” level to look out for would nonetheless fall below $10,000.“The real level I’m watching for buy the dip levels if we do break out is between $9,600 and $9,900,” he summarized.BTC/USD short-term analysis. Source: Michaël van de Poppe/ TwitterConcerns over a break below five figures had become less common among commentators, while Van de Poppe mostly discarded rumors of a pullback to below $8,000.The last time that Bitcoin traded below $10,000 was at the end of July.A mixed bag for Bitcoin fundamentals saw network difficulty adjust upwards 3% to hit new all-time highs, but hash rate trend lower.According to data from monitoring resource BTC.com, difficulty increased by 3.6% on Monday to hit 18.17 trillion.The new record suggests that miner participation in the network is stronger than ever, and competition is being reflected in how taxing it is to solve equations on the blockchain.The difficulty adjusts automatically and is an essential feature of Bitcoin as self-regulating hard money. Issuance remains fixed regardless of how high or low difficulty is.Meanwhile, the hash rate declined around 8% over the past seven days, estimates show, currently circling 119 exahashes per second (EH/s).Bitcoin 7-day average hash rate six-month chart. Source: BlockchainGiven the imprecise nature of hash rate measurements, it is likely that the number will normalize after the difficulty adjustment, continuing a broad uptrend in place since just after May’s block subsidy halving cut miner revenues by 50% overnight.The spotlight could fall once again on crypto derivatives this week as the month draws to a close and settlements near.62,000 BTC ($730 million) worth of Bitcoin options will expire on Aug. 28, reminiscent of the end-of-month action from June.Bitcoin options open interest expiry dates. Source: SkewTraditionally, settlement junctures exert downward pressure on BTC price, but as Cointelegraph reported, June’s near-$1 billion expiry turned out to be a non-event for the market.With every week that passes, however, futures reach a wider audience, evidenced by Grayscale’s record inflows in August. At the same time, on-chain analytics resource Skew reported record short positions for CME Group’s Bitcoin futures, something it described as “most likely” due to the profitability of the so-called “cash & carry” trades.These are performed between the futures price and spot price of Bitcoin as a form of arbitrage. Bitcoin investor sentiment is “extremely greedy” and getting greedier. That was the conclusion from sentiment indicator the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which on Monday remained firmly bearish on the overall market mood.As Cointelegraph reported last week, the Index almost hit record “greed” before a slight retracement, nonetheless rebounding toward its  maximum 100/100 over the weekend.The Index uses a basket of factors to measure whether the market is oversold or conversely due for a correction.

599,"Another ad for cryptocurrency has appeared in print media, this time without promoting a specific business or service.A full-page ad for Bitcoin (BTC) appeared on the front page of the Hong Kong-based tabloid-style newspaper Apple Daily today. Though the text appears to be educating readers about BTC, there is no apparent mention of where or how to buy the coin — only a single reference to Genesis Block, a crypto firm based in the special administrative region.“Bitcoin will never ditch you,” the ad stated in English above the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, while adding in Cantonese: “Banks, you're not ditching me today — I'm ditching you.”""Bitcoin is digital money. It is not issued or controlled by any government or corporation. Nobody can stop you from transacting on the network and it cannot be shut down. Bitcoin is available to anyone regardless of their nationality, gender, or beliefs. Bitcoin began with the Genesis Block during the financial crisis of 2009. Now, its time is coming.”Source: Reddit The Apple Daily is one of the largest print media in Hong Kong, but it has become even more popular since its CEO was arrested two weeks ago.Billionaire and Apple Daily CEO Jimmy Lai was arrested on Aug. 10 for alleged violations of HK’s controversial National Security Law. The newspaper’s offices were also raided by authorities the same day. His detainment was seen by many as part of a crackdown against pro-democracy figures in the special administrative region. In response, Hong Kongers showed support for Lai and the free press by lining up early to buy issues of Apple Daily, and also shares of Next Digital — the parent company responsible for the newspaper. Their efforts caused the price of the company’s stock to surge by more than 1,100%. Lai was released after 40 hours in custody. However, his arrest and the support for the newspaper as one of the independent news outlets in the midst of ongoing protests may partially explain why someone chose the Apple Daily for a prominent Bitcoin ad.The ad’s messages of “nobody can stop you” and not being controlled by any government may very well resonate with young protesters looking for an alternative to traditional finance."
600,"On Sunday Aug. 2 the price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropped by 12% in just 5 minutes. In the same period of time Ether (ETH) dropped by 21% and similar losses were observed with many other altcoins.In retrospect, the general consensus on the cause was an unknown entity unloading roughly $1 billion on the open market during a time of low volume and liquidity.At first thought, one would assume that selling such a huge amount in an illiquid market would be to the detriment of the seller, but given the size of the move, we don’t think the seller was unaware of what would happen.In fact, it's entirely possible that the orchestrated move was 100% intentional. Here is how the crypto market was thrust into a sharp correction with one large sell.This was a well thought out move which involved the buyer beginning to buy coins in the spot market when the price was nearing and obvious kety technical resistance.After the investor built a position, they then put in a large market order to take down all the offers on the order book and push the price sharply below a key resistance level.This maneuver triggered a significant number of buy orders from other investors who had stops to buy above the resistance level. At the same time, a short-squeeze was caused due to traders who were short from this resistance level.The investor who submitted the large market order now enjoys the price appreciation of the coins bought before the breakout, following the ignited momentum.After some time, this trader decides that it’s time to ring-up the register. Thus, he quietly builds a short futures position on various exchanges using different accounts to be as stealth as possible.Using 30x to 50x leverage, the investor is able to maintain the position even if the price of the underlying asset goes up by 2% or 3%.Once he has accumulated a big enough short futures position, he then sells the previously purchased stash of BTC at market rate when the market exhibits low liquidity again.By doing this, all the bids in the order book are taken out, resulting in a price crash which ignites as he had built before a short position with futures. The result is, a nice profit is locked in from the short position.Let’s say BTC is trading at $9.9K and the key resistance is at $10K.A trader builds a stealthy position of 100 BTC with about $1 million of cash at an average price of $9.9K. Then he puts a market order to buy 100 BTC at the time when the market liquidity is low and this pushed the price instantly to $10.4K.This means his average position is 200 BTC at $10,150. The move above the obvious resistance price triggers other traders to buy above $10K, and also catalyzes a short-squeeze that forces short traders to cover their position by buying back the underlying. This results in even more upward pressure on the price of the underlying and phase 1 of the traders plan is complete.Now BTC sits at $11.8K and the trader manipulating the market begins to build a short futures position with 30x to 50x leverage. For simplicity, let’s consider 50x leverage, meaning for $1 invested, $50 of the underlying asset is obtained.The trader again builds a stealth short position in futures markets across several exchanges using multiple accounts. As he is leveraged 50x, in order to cover his long position of 200 BTC worth $2.36 million, he needs to sell shorts for only 200BTC / 50 = 4 BTC.He would then use some of the proceeds from his initial buy to cover the margin of futures contracts worth 4 BTC.Of course he can also sell more futures in order to further magnify the move and his upcoming ill-gotten profit also.The trader completes his witty strategy by selling the 200 BTC he initially bought at market all at once when market liquidity is low.This results in crashing the price of BTC from $11.8K to $10.1K. His long position price was $10,150 so while he takes a little $10K loss on his initial position, he profits significantly from the futures sold short. The result is a net gain of $330K or 16.5% of the initial $2 million invested and all of this was done with minimal risk.Obviously, this is an overly simplified example of how big players manipulate the market and take advantage of weekends when liquidity and trading volumes are lower.This sort of setup requires a significant amount of upfront capital and decent trading infrastructure in order to execute seamlessly. But, given the liquidity and volatility of the crypto market versus traditional markets, just $10 million of capital could lead to decent returns with minimal risk.This is at least feasible until regulators step in.There are ways to perpetrate this maneuver with even more leverage. By using futures to take the initial long position which requires on a fraction of their notional value to trade, and buying put options instead of selling futures to profit even more off the provoked downward move due to the convexity of the options.However, such practice requires specific market conditions (i.e. a well-regarded instrument with price nearing a key technical point) and an easy to manipulate instrument (i.e. an instrument for which derivatives exist). Therefore, this play cannot be conducted all the time.Basically, the entire maneuver is market manipulation and it is completely illegal in traditional markets. However, in the wild west of crypto-land, unscrupulous traders can still act with little worries for now.The hope is that as crypto markets mature, these kinds of price manipulation plays will disappear.As the market grows, the larger amount of cash needed to perpetuate these sorts of acts, and the increased risk that an even larger player could counter the one who initiated the move may deter manipulation.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

602,"This week the S&P 500 made news by notching a new intraday all-time high and recovering 100% of the losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic in mid-March. Despite this, there are signs U.S. stock markets could be overvalued. The Buffett indicator, an analysis tool which divides the Wilshire 5000 Index by the U.S. GDP, currently shows 1.7. This figure is quite near to the dot-com era top at 1.71 which was followed by a strong market correction. However, one major difference between now and the dot-com era is that the current interest rates are at record lows and central banks have been pumping huge amounts of money to support the economy. Although certain pockets could be looking like a bubble, it is unlikely that the stock markets will crash because of this metric alone. Crypto market data daily view.

603,"A Bitcoin (BTC) whale — an individual investor who holds a large amount of BTC — took profit after two years. Data from Whalemap suggests the whale purchased nearly 9,000 BTC in the third quarter of 2018.A pseudonymous trader known as “Byzantine General,” who shared the data, said:“This whale is a legend. See that big bubble around 6k in 2018? That's almost 9k BTC that was accumulated there. He finally took profit, after 2 years and 2 major capitulation events.”The whale held on to the BTC for nearly 22 months, through two major capitulation phases. Bitcoin dropped to sub-$4,000 level twice, first in January 2019 and second in March 2020. The investor waited through both periods, ultimately selling at around $12,000.Number of Bitcoin held by a whale. Source: Byzantine General, WhalemapOn Aug. 16, Cointelegraph reported that large whale clusters are present in the $12,000 to $14,000 range. At the $12,000 level, many whales are either in profit or at breakeven, which arguably could give whales an incentive to sell.Whether it shows whales are cautious that Bitcoin has hit a local peak remains unclear. Whales, due to the sheer size of their holdings, follow liquidity. If they feel that there is sufficient liquidity to sell, possibly as a result of rising retail activity, then they are likely to sell.Hence, a whale’s sell-off does not necessarily show that Bitcoin has peaked. One could argue that it raises the chances of consolidation in the short term. But until BTC drops below key support levels, it is premature to suggest a local top has formed. Also, it is difficult to estimate how much of the 9,000 BTC the whale sold.A reason some whales appear to be taking profit at current levels might be Bitcoin’s relatively high spot volume. According to another pseudonymous trader known as Bitcoin Jack, the market remains “awkwardly” driven by the spot market. He said:“Market remains awkwardly spot driven for now. Market remains relatively high on-chain dominance Price expansion is therefore imminent again—direction unclear but low derivatives vs spot and spot exchange vs onchain dominance indicates we have not seen an irrational top.”When the market is heavily driven by the derivatives market, whales have less liquidity to seek, and minor pullbacks could cause large price movements.In the short term, traders remain mixed on the sentiment around Bitcoin. Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and Cointelegraph Markets analyst, says BTC could drop to as low as $10,000 if it loses $11,450. He said:“Pretty easy going here as there's a rejection at $11,600. If we hold the $11,450-11,500 area I think we'll have a breakout towards $12,000 in the coming week. Losing the green zone and I'm targeting $10,700 or even $10,000.”Following a nearly three-fold increase in price, a consolidation phase in the near term could strengthen the momentum Bitcoin in the longer term."

This occurred as markets turned to safe haven assets amid an uptick in COVID cases, increased government spending, mixed corporate earnings, inflation fears and a weakening US dollar.”Contrarily, when the dollar reverses and begins to rally, the chances of a Bitcoin consolidation phase could rise.In the last 48 hours, as the US Dollar Index climbed, the price of gold also slumped by more than 3.5%. Gold had been rallying strongly in recent weeks, buoyed by the rising uncertainty around the global economy.The US Dollar Index shows signs of a recovery. Source: TradingView.comAs such, Scott Melker, a cryptocurrency trader, said that the inverse relationship between Bitcoin and the dollar is more compelling than its recent correlation with the stock market. He noted:“Bitcoin’s inverse relationship with the dollar is far more compelling than the idea that it is correlated with the stock market.”The dollar has underperformed against major reserve currencies like the Japanese yen since April and analysts anticipate that if it can sustain its strong momentum gold and the U.S. dollar will be negatively impacted.According to Michael Hewson, CMC Markets UK’s chief market analyst, the dollar’s recovery is causing gold’s uptrend to weaken. Hewson said:“The rebound in the US dollar has also sparked a fresh bout of weakness in gold prices which sold off sharply and are now testing support at $1,920 an ounce, and the renewed uncertainty over the pace of further monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve.”Data from Skew also shows that Bitcoin and gold have seen a newfound correlation in recent weeks. If the prices of BTC and the precious metal continue to move in tandem, the likelihood of the strengthening dollar causing a BTC pullback rises.Karl Schamotta, Cambridge Global Payments’ chief market strategist, said the dollar could be seeing a short squeeze. He explained:“You’re seeing a bit of an unwind in the short dollar trade that had gained so much momentum in the last couple months.”The confluence of a dollar short squeeze, the upcoming stimulus deal, and rising economic certainty are contributing to the rebound of the dollar but will this be a short-lived or longer term trend."
605,"Sergio Dermain Lerner, a researcher known for looking at the mining patterns of the original Bitcoin (BTC) miner, has turned his attention on the Bitcoin blocks mined by Satoshi Nakamoto.Lerner made a preview of his latest findings available to Cointelegraph. His research is based on the irregular pattern of the Least-Significant-Byte (LSB) of the nonce field of block.This past June, Lerner published a blog that expanded on his original research from 2013. He suggested that for an unknown reason, Satoshi refrained from mining in the first five minutes of the block interval. Other researchers have also expanded on Lerner's research. TechMiX showed that all the blocks mined by Satoshi could be grouped into five baskets, based on the frequency distribution of the Nonce LSB values. Nonce LSB value. Source: TechMiX.A nonce gets incremented with every new attempt to solve a mining puzzle. Apparently, Satoshi's equipment was not using the entire available nonce space, only focusing on a limited range. Lerner's latest research indicates that Satoshi was decrementing the nonce value instead:This leads to a more interesting conclusion that perhaps will put an end to the discussion about the type of equipment that Satoshi Nakamoto used:If Lerner's conclusions are correct that would lend more credence to the hypothesis that Satoshi Nakamoto was a single person and not a team. This would also put another nail into Craig Wright's claims of being a Bitcoin creator as he has indicated numerous times that he used dozens of computers to mine the early blocks."
606,"It’s back to stability for Bitcoin this week as the currency continues to knock at the $12,000 ceiling. Where will it go next? One analyst sees a Battle Royale as whales try to push towards $14,000. Other investors are more optimistic. They see Berkshire Hathaway’s recent sale of bank stocks and purchase of stock in a gold mining company pushing the price to $50,000. If Warren Buffett is souring on the banking system though, he’s late to the party. Kim Dotcom got there two years ago — and has reminded his followers that he advised them to buy Bitcoin.The Federal Reserve might be catching up though. Governor Lael Brainard has revealed that the Fed is conducting research into a digital dollar. One partner to that research is MIT, which will develop, test, and research a digital currency over two to three years.The Fed isn’t the only one waking up to the power of the blockchain. The United States Postal Service has applied for a patent for a secure voting system. The system uses the blockchain to secure mail-in voting. A start-up in Bulgaria is offering cryptocurrency to travelers whose flights are delayed for at least an hour. In South Korea, a million drivers have already swapped a physical license for a blockchain-backed version used with a smartphone app. The program only launched in May.Senegal, though, might make South Korea look small. Akon, the Senegalese-American star and philanthropist, says his $6 billion Akon City will run on the Stellar-based Akoin cryptocurrency. His real-life Wakanda is already 85 percent complete, he says. Ripple is aiming even bigger. Under new CEO Brad Garlinhouse, the company is trying to become the Amazon of the cryptocurrency world. It’s looking to move beyond cross-border payments and promote the creation of new applications on the Ripple network.Both of those projects lie in the future but at least some of the much-hyped blockchain-based smartphones and smartwatches are already out. Samsung’s Galaxy S10 has support for more than 30 cryptocurrencies in its wallet and the company’s KlaytnPhone rewards users with 2,000 Klay tokens. Blockchain company Sirin Labs’s Finney has built-in cold storage, as well as a DApp ecosystem. Cold storage is also a feature of watchmaker Franck Muller’s Encrypto watch. The dial also has a QR code for receiving Bitcoin payments. And in the world of social media, Ignite, a blockchain-based microblogging platform is trying to offer an alternative to state-censored social media platforms.The development of blockchain usage isn’t all super-cities, smartwatches, and social media though. Asia is looking to the blockchain for protection against online crime during the pandemic. It looks like they’re on the right track. Binance has recently helped Ukraine’s cyber police to identify and arrest criminals involved in a $42 million ransomware and money laundering operation.And finally, while the cryptoworld is generally full of smart people with big brains, someone just paid 40 ETH, around $17,000, for a digital picture of a cat drawn by Paris Hilton. The money will go to charity, so maybe we can just say that the cryptoworld is full of people with big hearts.

607,"Central bank digital currencies are a digital representation of a country’s fiat currency. They are effectively a government-issued cryptocurrency designed to replace the traditional, physical form of fiat currencies.The term CBDC is broad because its implementation involves several critical decisions on the part of an issuing central bank. The primary decision is whether a CBDC should be a general-purpose in that it’s available to be used by the general population. If not, then the issuing authority may decide to make it available for “wholesale” transactions, which means the CBDC is only used for settlements between banks. Finally, a CBDC could also only be used among central banks.In its research paper covering CBDCs in-depth, the Bank for International Settlements, or BIS, defines these categories using a Venn diagram called the “money flower,” shown below. The gray area represents various types of CBDCs, while Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies are deemed to be private digital tokens.According to the BIS, the idea of CBDCs has been around for many years, predating Bitcoin by over two decades. However, the concept has gained prominence over recent years. This has been mainly due to advances in the fintech arena, including developments in blockchain technology, allowing the issuance of digital tokens that represent a store of value. Furthermore, the move toward CBDCs supports the general trend of a more cashless society. In countries such as South Korea, China and Sweden, cash is well on its way to becoming a redundant means of payment.CBDCs offer many comparable benefits to cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. Hours of operation for banks limit the availability of transactions, whereas CBDCs could be available to transact on a 24/7 basis. Banks could decrease their reliance on clearinghouses, which would save costs.Like cryptocurrencies, CBDCs could be available to anyone who has a smartphone, helping to improve financial inclusion, particularly to people in rural areas without access to physical banking infrastructure such as ATMs. Countries such as Kenya have already seen an improvement in financial inclusion due to the popularity of M-Pesa, a cashless payment app based on SMS.There are other benefits in using CBDCs beyond the general advantages of digital currencies. Central banks spend money to print money, with the average cost of minting a one-dollar bill racking up around $0.077 per note. Digital currencies are cheap or sometimes even free to produce once the underlying code is there.Central banks could also implement monetary policy directly using a CBDC. This may mean paying interest on the token itself rather than on bank deposits. Finally, governments could find it easier to distribute cash to citizens, using CBDCs. For example, COVID-19 led to a crisis that prompted the United States government to issue Economic Impact Payments in the form of checks and debit cards, which are prone to theft and fraudulent use. With a CBDC, the government could issue relief funds directly.Along with various benefits, CBDCs also come with some considerable risks on the part of central banks, governments and individual citizens.Perhaps the biggest risk is cybersecurity. China’s efforts in testing a CBDC have already been hijacked by scammers, which is alarming because the full version hasn’t been officially launched yet. The risks of a network attack or creating new loopholes for fraud or money laundering are a real concern for any central bank looking to launch a CBDC. On the flip side of this risk is privacy. The greater visibility a government has into who is using a CBDC, the more the cybersecurity risks can be reduced. However, if citizens believe that using a CBDC may mean the government could overstep the boundaries of privacy rights, it may not gain adoption.Finally, while governments could use a CBDC to implement monetary policy, the new possibilities that this opens could also create some degree of risk. For example, using a CBDC to charge negative interest rates in a time of crisis could fundamentally change economic paradigms, making it too costly for citizens to store their wealth in the new digital cash.Although many central banks use some form of digital money as reserves or settlement account balance, no central bank has yet issued any general CBDC. However, several banks are already in various stages of research and development, including the five major currencies of the world — the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound and the Chinese yuan.In May, a U.S. thinktank published a white paper outlining the aims of the “digital dollar.” Since then, events have been making significant headway. The most recent news from Japan is that the central bank has appointed its leading economist to head up a team researching a yen-based CBDC, while the Bank of England has appointed Accenture for its own CBDC development. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank appears to be leaning toward a retail CBDC, and given the fact it would operate across 19 countries, this makes it the biggest project at the moment. However, China has been undoubtedly leading the pack, having hit several headlines for months with plans for its CBDC launch. The latest is that the government is planning to target the financial dominance of domestic payment firms, Alibaba and Tencent.The Philippines has also confirmed that it has been looking into issuing its own digital currency, while Thailand is already in the test phase.In late July, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a memo giving the green light to all federally charted banks to offer cryptocurrency custodial services. This effectively allows hundreds of OCC-member banks to integrate crypto services. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance for crypto holdings is also now within the realms of possibility.Banks now only need to implement the necessary software, hardware and security policies to be ready to start processing cryptocurrencies, which could also include a CBDC.A week after the memo, Brian Brooks, the acting comptroller of the currency, vocalized his support for a blockchain-based CBDC as an upgrade to the current U.S. banking system. Most recently, Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard confirmed that the Boston Federal Reserve Bank will work with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on CBDC research.The COVID-19 relief effort is acting as a catalyst for the introduction of “digital dollars” as referenced in the Automatic Boost to Communities Act introduced by the U.S. Congress. This came after the introduction of a bill in March dubbed the Cryptocurrency Act 2020, which attempts to clarify the responsibility for regulating digital assets by federal agencies.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Marshall Hayner is the CEO and co-founder of Metal (MetalPay, Proton and MetalX).

608,"As the price of Bitcoin (BTC) couldn’t break through the resistance level of $12,000, a retracement did not come as a surprise. In recent days, BTC/USD pulled back to $11,400, a correction of almost 10%.Crypto market daily performance snapshot. Source: Coin360Meanwhile, gold, silver and other commodities are also correcting due to a slight bounce of the DXY, or the U.S. Dollar Currency Index.What’s more, multiple heavy movers like Chainlink (LINK) and Tezos (XTZ) also showed substantial corrections in recent days. Can this be a moment to buy the dip, or are further revisions imminent? Let’s examine the charts.The price of Bitcoin couldn’t force a breakout above the $12,000 resistance level, which led to a drop back into the range.BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewAs discussed in the previous article, the $12,000 area was crucial to hold for any further upward momentum. It failed to sustain this support, which means that a pullback became likely.Immediately after the breakdown below $12,000, the price of Bitcoin fell towards the support area at $11,600. This $11,600 level resulted in a slight bounce towards $11,800. However, as the chart shows, the $11,800 area was then confirmed as a new level of resistance.Such a support/resistance flip generally means more downside as the buyers aren’t strong enough to force the price above this resistance level. Given the weakness of such a move, more support levels below may get tested.This is indeed what happened as BTC then dropped toward the next support level, which is the green zone, and the final crucial hurdle before a potentially quick drop to $10,000.BTC/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe bearish divergence is calling for a potential trend reversal. However, it’s not a confirmed bearish divergence, unless the market starts to make new lower lows on the daily timeframe.As the recent low is found at $11,200-11,300, the market needs to stay above the green zone and recent low for a chance at more upside in the short term.If the price of Bitcoin drops below the green zone, the next support zone is found at $9,600-10,000, and more pain for the bulls is on the horizon.BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThere are several examples of invalidated bearish divergences found in recent years. One of them is shown in the chart (April 2019) and it’s looking similar to the current price action.The potential bearish divergence was spotted on the charts here as well. However, it was never confirmed as its latest low held as support. Given that the structure remained intact (higher lows, higher highs), the market continued climbing higher as Bitcoin rallied to $13,000.The overall conclusion is that the current price action reminds me of a lot of the price action the market saw in April 2019, and history could repeat as long as $11,200-11,400 holds.BTC/USDT bullish scenario chart. Source: TradingViewThe bullish scenario depends on the $11,200-11,400 support level as mentioned previously.As long as this area sustains support and Bitcoin reclaims the $11,800 area as support instead of resistance, more upside should be expected.Further targets for Bitcoin would then be found at $13,000. However, the main resistance area after $12,000 is $15,500-17,000. In other words, if $12K finally gives, the market will become even more bullish than before.BTC/USDT 12-hour bearish scenario chart. Source: TradingViewSimilarly, the $11,200-11,400 support level is also crucial for the bears. If this level is lost in the coming week, further downward momentum is likely, particularly toward the open CME Bitcoin futures gap at $9,7000, which is also a significant support level.However, before this can happen, a potential retest of the $11,800-12,000 should not come as a surprise. In that regard, there are two crucial zones for the bulls and bears.For the bulls, the $11,200-11,400 area must hold, after which the price of Bitcoin needs to break through $11,800-12,000.For the bears, the $11,800-12,000 must sustain as resistance, and the $11,200-11,400 area needs to fail as a support level.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

610,"In the cryptocurrency and blockchain sphere, it’s difficult to do away with politicians and vice versa. With the presidential election in the United States slated for later this year, interested parties are doing all they can to sell their dreams and vision for America.That said, vying for a political post doesn’t come cheap. In the run-up to the elections scheduled for Nov. 3, there has been an increase in the number of politicians accepting cryptocurrency donations to fund their campaigns, from senators to presidential candidates. This called for an outline of clear guidelines on Bitcoin contributions to candidates. Despite the immense benefits of blockchain and digital currencies, not everyone is willing to make use of them or believe in their potential. The decentralized nature of crypto and blockchain has always been a tough pill to swallow for most governments, and the U.S. is no exception. Let’s take a look at where some of the nation’s top politicians stand regarding cryptocurrencies.The 45th President of the United States is very much aware of Bitcoin, and he doesn’t like it. In July 2019, Trump unleashed a scathing attack on the premier cryptocurrency in a tweet that came days after the launch of Facebook’s Libra crypto project. He categorically stated that he wasn’t a fan of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies aren’t money, and their value is highly volatile.Trump’s administration has failed to create a clear regulatory framework on digital currencies and blockchain. However, in March, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced the appointment of Bitcoin bull Brian Brooks as its chief operating officer. The appointment was viewed as an endorsement of blockchain technology by the Trump administration.The former U.S. Vice President and the only democrat contesting for a presidential seat after Bernie Sanders dropped out is presumed to be a Bitcoin supporter. In one article, Biden was portrayed as “the Bitcoin candidate.” While he hasn’t come out publicly to endorse cryptocurrencies, Biden is a strong supporter of technology and innovation. Back in 2011, he commented about the internet and dubbed it a neutral source: ‘’The Internet itself is not inherently a force for democracy or oppression, for war or peace. Like any public square or any platform for commerce, the Internet is neutral.”Further, the Political Action Committee, which was campaigning for Biden’s presidential bid, started accepting Bitcoin donations in 2016. According to the PAC’s director at the time, the move was in line with Biden’s “support of technology and innovation throughout his career.”The former presidential hopeful and democratic socialist hasn’t taken an outright stand on cryptocurrencies. However, a recent report indicated that tech giants in Silicon Valley feared Sanders. That said, another report by the Guardian showed that Sanders had raked in the highest number of donations from tech companies such as Microsoft and Facebook. By March 2020, he had received about $726,702 from employees working in some of the largest tech companies in the United States.This presidential nominee is the first woman to contest for the highest seat in the land using the Libertarian Party ticket. The vocal political activist is a believer in free markets and unrestricted competition between banks and other deposit-taking institutions. When speaking about her stand on financial aspects of the country, she stated that her first step would be to enact Ron Paul’s Free Competition in Currency Act. On her Reddit page, she stated:‘’Also, I would repeal the Bank Secrecy Act, Know-Your-Customer (KYC), and other laws that violate our right to financial privacy. Many people go to bitcoin because they do want privacy so I would work to repeal those unjust laws.’’On July 4, the famous U.S. rap artist, Kanye West, announced that he was going to run for the presidential seat. Though a late entrant into the race, a win by Kanye is thought to be great for the crypto community. Kanye knows about Bitcoin, and he has made a reference to the cryptocurrency in an interview with TMZ, stating:“When I saw Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill, that’s the moment when I wanted to use bitcoin.”The Senator for Massachusetts, who also dropped out of the presidential race, has always had healthy criticism for cryptocurrencies and blockchain-related products. When speaking to Yahoo Finance, she stated that she was concerned about consumers getting hurt, since crypto has a history of high volatility.She believes that there’s a challenge in nurturing the benefits of crypto while protecting consumers. That said, the democrat is eager to understand the technology behind cryptocurrencies and develop policies that will protect American citizens when it comes to this technology.The billionaire and former mayor of New York has been quite vocal about cryptocurrencies. At the start of the year, before he dropped out of the presidential race, Bloomberg published a financial reform plan where he emphasized the need for a clear regulatory framework around cryptocurrencies.Bloomberg acknowledged that crypto and Bitcoin have become a high net worth investment asset, yet its regulatory framework was severely fragmented. He firmly believes that the financial sector needs to be regulated for it to thrive and remain accountable.One of the youngest presidential hopefuls in the 2020 general elections, Buttigieg isn’t shy to talk about technology. The democrat, who also dropped out of the race, received some hiring advice from Mark Zuckerberg last year that was seen as an endorsement from leading tech companies. While Buttgieg has no precise stance on blockchain, he has appreciated the efforts of Estonia in securing all its citizens’ identity information on a blockchain. Meltem Demirors, the chief strategist of Coinshares, gave her assessment of Buttigieg as he testified before the Congress hearing on Libra:“I don’t think Buttigieg is particularly focused on cryptocurrencies. I think he is very focused on courting Silicon Valley.”According to her financial disclosure report with the federal government, the U.S. Congresswoman from Hawaii invested in Litecoin (LTC) and Ether (ETH) back in 2017. During this period, the crypto market was in a bull run that led to Bitcoin hitting an all-time high of almost $20,000. It’s unclear how much of her crypto portfolio is still in place, as is whether Gabbard is holding onto her assets or has realized her crypto for a profit or a loss since then.The seasoned lawyer and Minnesota senator has dropped out of the 2020 race to the White House, but she was a darling of both Republicans and Democrats. While she hasn’t stepped forward to speak about cryptocurrencies, she may have touched on the topic during a congressional hearing about terrorism and money laundering, stating:“Is this transition we’re seeing from cash to digital going to make it easier or harder for law enforcement to track these money laundering cases, and do you think these drug cartels are going to start going cash-free, and what do you do about it?”The statement signifies her concern that cryptocurrencies are used by criminals to fund their activities around the world, a common belief shared by most politicians around the world.Presidential hopefuls aside, the current Treasury Secretary is rather skeptical about cryptocurrencies. In March 2020, when testifying before the Senate Finance Committee, Mnuchin stated that the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network would release new regulations touching on cryptocurrencies. Last year, Mnuchin raised fears about Facebook’s crypto project Libra, saying that it posed a serious “national security issue.” In a press conference, he stated:“Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have been exploited to support billions of dollars of illicit activity like cybercrime, tax evasion, extortion, ransomware, illicit drugs and human trafficking.’’The 70th U.S. Secretary of State, Michael Pompeo, believes that cryptocurrencies should be regulated in a similar way as other financial instruments. He thinks that crypto transactions should be governed similarly to SWIFT, though he admits that it would be difficult to accomplish. In one interview, Pompeo stated that pseudonymous cryptocurrencies were being used to fund terrorism and other criminal activities. The Trump administrator believes that the current global financial system needs to be preserved and protected. The current chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed approval of exchange-traded funds on several occasions. However, his nomination by President Trump as the U.S. Attorney for the New York Southern District was welcomed by crypto proponents who believe that it will be an excellent opportunity for the SEC to make a positive move."
611,"The “Buffett Indicator” is hinting that the United States’ stock market is currently at dot-com bubble levels, Yahoo Finance reported on Aug. 20. The indicator divides the Wilshire 5000 Index by the GDP of the U.S.Meanwhile, on Aug. 14, Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway invested in Barrick Gold, the second-biggest precious metal miner in the world. Some analysts said it could benefit Bitcoin (BTC) in the long term as it coincides with this stock market bubble alarm.The historical average of the indicator is 1, and before the dot-com bubble, it hovered at 1.71. Currently, the Buffett Indicator is reportedly at 1.7, signaling that the stock market is highly overvalued.If the U.S. stock market slumps as investors fear the overvaluation of equities, Bitcoin could see a major reaction.According to Tom Essaye, the founder of Sevens Report Research, stocks are considered as “fundamentally overvalued” when the Buffett Indicator hits 1.3. The current level of 1.7 indicates that there is a potential for a steep downtrend in the stock market if the trend reverses. He explained:“What does that mean for us? It means stay long stocks in longer-dated accounts, and make sure you own assets (such as a house, etc.). But it also means this asset inflation cycle better not stop, because as the 1.7 times total market cap to GDP ratio tells us if asset inflation stops, it’s a long, long way down to fundamental support.”Throughout the past four months, Bitcoin has shown some correlation with the S&P 500 and gold. Since late July, due to the decline in the U.S. dollar, BTC has more closely followed the price of the precious metal.An argument could be made that a potential pullback in the U.S. stock market could strengthen Bitcoin’s momentum. Some institutions have started to consider Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value, causing institutional inflows into BTC to spike.The correlation between Bitcoin and gold. Source: Skew.comThe correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 broke slightly in the past week, as stocks continued to surge. The price of BTC rejected at $12,400, recording an 8.6% drop to as low as $11,370. The deteriorating correlation between Bitcoin and the U.S. stock market, and the simultaneous slump of BTC and gold, buoy the bull case for BTC when stocks decline.In the short term, technical analysts are cautiously anticipating a consolidation phase for Bitcoin. A potential short-term scenario for Bitcoin. Source: Michael van de PoppeMichael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said dropping below $11,500 again could lead to a bearish divergence. He said:“Well, on the daily timeframe we've arrived at the crucial level to hold for further upwards momentum. White small square Bearish divergence only gets confirmed if we lose this $11,500 zone. White small square Holding here = bounces on altcoins. White small square In general still altseason and alts continue.”Robert Kiyosaki, the best-selling author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” also said that a banking crisis is coming. Emphasizing that Buffett has trimmed his positions in major U.S. banks, he hinted gold, silver, and Bitcoin could see significant gains as safe-haven assets.The confluence of a tightening correlation between Bitcoin and gold and the rally of the stock market could raise the likelihood of a BTC uptrend when stocks begin to fade."
612,"As whispers of Bitcoin’s (BTC) promised financial breakthrough failing to materialize over the last few months have continued to garner steam, the price of the premier crypto asset recently surged above the all-important $12,000 psychological threshold, only to once again slip right under. However, as part of this development, the total cap of the crypto market reached an impressive $386.4 billion, a level only attained back in 2018. That being said, a multitude of factors, such as poor investor perception and lack of regulatory direction, seems to be preventing the market from flowering as previously envisioned by many experts. In this regard, Samir Tabar, co-founder of decentralized P2P token trading network Airswap and ex-managing director for Bank of America in the APAC region, believes that while there is a long term structural upside for Bitcoin, there will be cyclical ups and downs like with any nascent asset class. However, the primary issue holding traditional capital market participants from entering this market is information asymmetry: “Certain players aka ‘whales’ control most of the market and have created massive market spikes or collapse. Market gyrations are ok, but massive information asymmetry is not.”Expounding his views on the matter, Ariel Zetlin-Jones, associate professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, told Cointelegraph that a primary headwind against cryptocurrency demand continues to be the COVID-19 pandemic, especially as more people start to face the economic uncertainty. He further added that it’s only natural that during uncertain times, not many casual investors would be willing to invest their life savings in a highly volatile asset class such as Bitcoin.Amid the pandemic, the United States dollar has thus far maintained its strength, in part, due to being the world’s reserve currency, and as long as countries continue to see the U.S. as a global powerhouse, its monetary value will continue to remain strong regardless of the recent stimulus packages. However, in terms of the dollar’s recent performance, there have been some hiccups. For starters, the U.S. dollar index is currently at 93.2, down nearly 10% from its peak in March. Also, due to being a global reserve currency, the dollar tends to increase in value during downturns, complicating assessments of its performance at such times. Furthermore, increasing social and political tensions along with incessant printing of dollars are creating conditions that can potentially form a bubble of hyperinflation in the foreseeable future. The situation has pushed some major investors like Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, to trim his company’s position in banking and investing heavily in stable stores of value such as gold.Buffett’s decision to completely close Berkshire’s position on Goldman Sachs also comes at a time when the financial institution recorded its second-ever highest quarterly trading revenue of $13.3 billion, thereby suggesting that Buffett and his associates are not comfortable with the idea of betting big on the long-term prospects of the banking industry. Ryan Taylor, CEO of the Dash cryptocurrency, told Cointelegraph:“The U.S. is not the only country to undergo massive stimulus in 2020. Also, in times of crisis demand for USD tends to spike globally. These two considerations give the U.S. a lot of leeway to inflate supply without immediately devaluing the dollar. However, we are starting to witness signs that inflation is a risk. Certainly the massive stimulus started by inflating asset prices, including equity and debt. And just last week the U.S. CPI for July registered the highest monthly growth rate since 1991.”Even though many naysayers have repeatedly pointed out the fact that BTC has failed to surge exponentially and reach new all-time highs despite the economic conditions being ripe for it, the cryptocurrency market as a whole seems to be having a stellar year.For example, Ether (ETH) has quadrupled in value, rising from $105 to $440 since hitting relative lows earlier this year in March. Similarly, currencies like Bitcoin, Ripple (XRP) and Dash are up by 72%, 50%, 124%, respectively, while many other smaller cryptocurrencies, especially in the decentralized finance sector, are seeing triple-digit growth as well.Tabar believes that crypto’s strong performance can be gauged in terms of the fact that some family offices have started to include BTC in their portfolio holdings. Not only that, certain neo-banks like Revolut and easy access investment apps such as Robinhood have also enabled easier access to crypto. This suggests that the next generation of young investors may eventually help spur the adoption of this asset class. In comparison to traditional commodities, Taylor has pointed out that crypto has outpaced most precious metals, like silver, which is up about 54% year-to-date:“Other precious metals are generally below 40% returns, especially if they have industrial uses. I suspect the attention of the general public continues to be fixated on the performance of stocks and bonds that makes up their retirement portfolios.”Also, Bitcoin has fared much better in comparison to oil than many fiat currencies, as oil prices have dropped due to negative growth in the economy influenced by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Statistically speaking, the year-to-date price of oil is down 32%. Furthermore, when compared with the S&P 500 (which is up +5.8%), Bitcoin’s year-to-date return currently sits at around 71.2%. Peter Goodrich, tax manager at U.S. accounting firm Prager Metis, told Cointelegraph:“When comparing the top market cap cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP to precious metals like gold and silver, there are increasingly positive correlations being witnessed between both markets that were accompanied by delayed market impulses.”Zetlin-Jones also pointed out that leading cryptocurrencies are appreciating relative to USD, gaining almost 0.3% per day on average over the past 90 days in comparison to May 2020, beating out the S&P 500 that has posted an average daily gain of 0.05%. However, Denis Vinokourov, head of research for digital asset exchange and brokerage firm Bequant, believes that since gold does not really compete directly with oil, Bitcoin too should not be related directly with traditional commodities: “It has properties that others do not and that is its strength, putting Bitcoin against the rest of the market is like comparing apples to oranges.”While it’s still far too early to judge, Taylor believes that with each passing month, expectations of inflation will continue to increase, leading many investors to seek out inflation-resistant commodities like top-tier digital assets. “I personally believe that we’re in the early stages of a bull run that’s actually moving along quite steadily,” he said. Also worth remembering is that the last major crypto bull run started in about mid-2015 and built up gradually to explode in the second half of 2017, suggesting that an overnight surge is unrealistic.Lastly, despite increasing adoption, there are still a lot of challenges for the masses when it comes to owning cryptocurrencies. For example, opening a digital wallet or even a crypto trading account is still not as easy as many would like to think. Commenting on the subject, Mike Onghai, serial entrepreneur and seed investor for Coinbase and TZero, told Cointelegraph:“If you look at history, it took about 20 years for cell phone web browsing to become as easy as it is now today. It took web browsing several years to go from Netscape to where it is now. Ease of owning cryptocurrencies will take some time. [...] The digital assets age still feels early — it feels like 1995 in the web browser era (after Netscape’s crash).”A somewhat similar opinion is shared by Vinokourov who believes that most people tend to forget the relatively young age of Bitcoin as well the rest of the market. Not only that, while Bitcoin and other digital assets have shown their worth during times of geopolitical and economic uncertainties, these assets are still considered to be much riskier by most:“There has only really been one cycle of initial coin offerings that did attract substantial interest from traditional firms. The core market may not be as ‘hot’ at the moment, but another area of the market that has attracted VC money recently is decentralised finance (DeFi). It’s always helpful to remember that this is a marathon, not a sprint.”"
613,"New data from Chainalysis shows Chinese investors reportedly used Tether (USDT) to move nearly $50 billion overseas. This has led some crypto investors to question whether or not Bitcoin price could be impacted by capital flight from China.Chainalysis researchers said:“Over the last twelve months, with China’s economy suffering due to trade wars and devaluation of the yuan at different points, we’ve seen over $50 billion worth of cryptocurrency move from China-based addresses to overseas addresses.”A large portion of the funds were moved through Tether and as this occurred the dominant stablecoin saw its market cap rise to a new all-time high at $12 billion on paper.China, along with several other Asian countries, have strict capital controls that make it difficult for investors to move large sums of money abroad.If Chinese investors moved tens of billions of dollars in Bitcoin (BTC) or Tether solely to move capital out of China, there is a chance that a large part of it is sold and turned into cash.Chainalysis emphasized that not all of the $50 billion is capital flight, but it can be considered as the absolute ceiling. The researchers said:“Obviously, not all of this is capital flight, but we can think of $50 billion as the absolute ceiling for capital flight via cryptocurrency from East Asia to other regions.”The researchers evaluated wallets based in China and their transactions to addresses in foreign countries. They found that $18 billion in Tether was moved from East Asia to other regions.But the company noted that it is unlikely that all of it is capital flight. As such, it is difficult to know what percentage of the funds were moved as a means to transfer capital outside of China. They explained:“In total, over $18 billion worth of Tether has moved from East Asia addresses to those based in other regions over the last 12 months. Again, it’s highly unlikely that all of this is capital flight.”If the outflow was purely capital flight being routed into BTC, then this would add selling pressure to Bitcoin. In such a situation, there should be some downturn in BTC price as these investors would be closing their newly opened Bitcoin positions in pursuit of USD or other fiat currencies.BTC/USD weekly chart. Source: TradingView.comOne variable that complicates the China USDT exodus theory is that in 2020 exchanges have seen their BTC reserves drop to record lows and more investors holding their Bitcoin in cold storage as they expect higher prices in the future.It is entirely possible that, if the funds were moved for the purpose of capital flight, they could have been sold anytime in the past year.Hence whether it could apply selling pressure onto the Bitcoin market in the near-term is practically impossible to conclude.Based on the broad timeframe of the movement of the funds and Tether accounting for a large part of the funds, it is not likely to have a big impact on Bitcoin in the short-term."

""I went in, I lost money — that's what's happening in Bitcoin,"" he added, noting his unwillingness to mess around with the asset to figure it out, stating a lack of available time.Portnoy also went on to call Chainlink (LINK) advocates, also known as Link Marines, frauds. ""Everyone is just selling it,"" he said, noting the community's perceived shilling of the asset. ""I haven't dumped anything,"" Portnoy said. ""I tried to pump — everything's getting dumped,"" he added. Later in the day on Aug. 21, Portnoy tweeted his exit from BTC, taking a $25,000 loss on the trade. A number of crypto space participants showed up to comment on Portnoy's Bitcoin departure, some of which bashed the internet personality for his inability to remain strong during falling asset prices.Portnoy, also known as Davey Day Trader for his stock trading antics, has previously expressed his lack of knowledge on crypto. He hosted Gemini crypto exchange founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss at his house on Aug. 13 for some industry education. Portnoy discussed LINK and a bevy of other topics with the Winklevoss twins, statedly allocating $250,000 for crypto trading.Only a few days later, the Barstool founder found himself deep in the crypto game, romanticizing pump and dumps. By Aug. 18, he boasted $98,000 of profit from BTC, calling himself the king of Bitcoin while projecting millions in gains over the coming months."
615,"The open interest on Bitcoin (BTC) options contracts has returned to $2 billion after briefly surpassing the level ahead of the July expiry.Since the beginning of 2020 the BTC options market has grown six-fold and this has led investors to question whether its potential price impact has become too extreme.Bitcoin options total open interest. Source: SkewJust over a third of these contracts are set to expire on August 28 and this is equivalent to 57K BTC. For this reason, traders have every reason to be worried about the expiry’s potential impact on markets, especially when considering there's a specific time for those settlements.Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) expiry happens at 8:00 am UTC, while Deribit and OKEx at 3:00 pm UTC. There are weekly contracts listed on some exchanges, but the monthly contracts usually handle most of the volume.Bitcoin options open interest by expiry, measured in thousands. Source: SkewIn futures contracts, even with specific expiry dates, there's a financial settlement among every buyer (long) and the seller (short). Unless a holder has been previously forcefully liquidated by lack of margin, every contract worth of open interest is settled at expiry.This statement is not valid for options markets, whereas call (buy) options above expiry price are discarded. The same happens for put (sell) options below the underlying BTC price at maturity. After all, why would someone exercise an option to sell below market level?When analyzing options, the first thing to focus on is the number of days until expiry. A shorter-term implies reduced odds for strikes 10% off market levels.

Nearly 60% of these are deemed out-of-the-money. This dramatically reduces any potential pressure from such a market.One should notice that both futures and options markets expire simultaneously, hence it is challenging to identify each derivatives instrument's responsibility on intense price swings.Bitcoin futures total open interest. Source: SkewThe total BTC futures contracts open interest surpasses $5 billion, although it is common for end of month expiries to reduce such figures for the following two reasons.Firstly, apart from CME and Bakkt, most exchanges offer perpetual futures known as inverse swaps. Those contracts have no set expiry, and are rolled over every 8h. Currently there is currently $2.44 billion open interest on these instruments.Even for contracts with a set expiry date, there's always some activity over the last few days rolling over for upcoming months. Buyers (long) can sell their August positions, simultaneously buying September or October contracts. Short contract holders can do the opposite.Running the risk of carrying until the expiry date opens a new position on a more distant contract and is very risky, thus, most institutional investors avoid such moves. Even though futures contracts’ open interest seem multiple times larger than options markets, they are quite similar-sized when excluding those perpetual futures.The futures contracts premium, also known as basis, is the best way to interpret how bullish/bearish professional traders are on futures contracts. Futures traders should demand more money than spot (regular) markets to postpone financial settlement.Bitcoin futures annualized 3-month basis.

Since that time, approximately 300,000 BTC has left exchanges in what appears to be a mass exodus.

The recent movement coincides with the recent bull run which saw the price of Bitcoin recover from below $5,000 to almost $12,000. Not all exchanges have suffered equally, however.

618,"There are some decentralized finance projects that make flash loans; Yam Finance (YAM) was a DeFi project that made a flash appearance.YAM, which initially described itself as a “minimally viable monetary experiment,” launched on August 11 amid some fanfare, and in less than two days, its market value soared from zero to $57 million. But on late Wednesday, the company announced that it found a bug in its rebasing contract and by Thursday, its market capitalization crashed back to zero. To no avail, the DeFi community rallied to save the project, whose rebase function turned it into a kind of global competition, with investors gambling on the token price.YAM’s short life has also highlighted a divide in the crypto community, with some concerned about the somewhat reckless direction that DeFi appears to be taking. Whether this divergence is generational, a matter of Bitcoinist versus DeFi “degenerates,” or something else entirely isn’t really clear, but an informal Cointelegraph survey uncovered two radically different views of YAM’s rebasing experiment.Erik Voorhees, CEO of ShapeShift, said on August 11, “YAM looks like a scam. [...] Projects like this are not going to be good for DeFi.” Meanwhile, Messari CEO Ryan Selkis slammed YAM Finance as a “perfect P&D [pump and dump] setup” with a 20% chance of becoming DeFi’s version of The DAO, Ethereum’s 2016 near-death experience.Meanwhile, software engineer and one-time Bitcoin core developer Jameson Lopp called on the crypto community to “shun and shame the folks who promote ridiculously irresponsible financial products” like YAM.Taylor Monahan, founder and CEO of blockchain interaction interface provider MyCrypto, told Cointelegraph, “YAM marks a turning point where things go from a bit wild to downright scary.” She mentioned that “everyone knows there is a lot of value at stake” in DeFi projects — more than $6 billion this week — “but no one imagined an openly unaudited project with absurd branding would capture $500 million in less than a day.”The bug that was discovered in the YAM protocol code resulted in excessive YAM reserves being minted, making it “impossible to take any future governance actions.” The project then called on the DeFi community for help, whose support was forthcoming, as BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes tweeted: “I did my part to save YAM, did you do yours?” CoinGecko also aided the project, and its founder and COO Bobby Ong described YAM to Cointelegraph as “a very successful crypto economic experiment — albeit a risky and careless one.”YAM proved that one can bootstrap a successful project community on top of other communities “by leveraging on the various DeFi communities such as Chainlink, Synthetix, Aave, Maker and others,” Ong explained to Cointelegraph:“It is a very interesting experiment as it also implemented a rebase function made popular by Ampleforth in its protocol rules. Tokens with rebase functions essentially turn it [the project] into a massive multiplayer crypto game with players all over the world betting on the token price. It creates an asset class that is not correlated with the price of Bitcoin, Ether, or any other tokens as its price is driven purely by its own protocol rules.”Others, while sympathetic to the Yam enterprise, weren’t willing to go quite so far as describing it as an experiment — at least not in the scientific sense. Ruaridh O’Donnell, the co-founder and director of information systems at Kava, a DeFi lending platform, told Cointelegraph, “Calling it an experiment implies that it was a carefully set up system designed to prove out a new concept. It was not that. It was a quickly put together mash up of existing DeFi ideas.” He then added, “However, sometimes that is what we need to inspire the real versions that come along later.”O’Donnell counseled taking the longer view. “New markets always have periods of over-hyping. They often follow an S-curve model where growth is slow at first before becoming over-hyped as people speculate on the potentials of the new technology, before evening out as people learn more,” he said.It may be difficult to maintain one’s equilibrium when a market is growing as fast as the DeFi market. When asked if DeFi was bubbling over, John Wagster, an attorney at Frost Brown Todd LLC, told Cointelegraph: “The rapid increase in the total amount of value locked in DeFi, from roughly $1 billion in May to over $6 billion today, could certainly be viewed as a sign that the market is overheating.” However, he also said that “the truly innovative concept of yield farming is the result of clever engineering that seems to have lured market participants looking for a new opportunity.”Lex Sokolin, chief marketing officer and global fintech co-head at ConsenSys, told Cointelegraph: “Software scales ideas like never before, where a single developer can architect and deploy a fantastic DeFi application to $500 million in assets overnight [...] When compared with the existing financial systems within banking and fintech, this space moves much faster and with more momentum.” He further shared:“My takeaway from YAM is that there is massive demand for financial infrastructure innovation, and that the demand can outpace the capacity of the existing operating environment.”Monahan, on the other hand, is worried that “things that were dangerous yesterday — naive and reckless teams with good intentions — will quickly be replaced by all scams and money grabs and criminals. We are already seeing phishing sites and extensions exclusively targeting DeFi products — e.g., Uniswap. We are seeing Google ads and malicious DMs and tweets to fake sites.” She further shared:“I said in February that the total value locked (TVL) for DeFi was clearly the early stages of going parabolic and it will happen faster than we foresee. COVID-19 put a damper on things but ultimately there is nothing — not even a global pandemic — that can stop the momentum of the crypto markets.”Asked if DeFi was already boiling over, Tone Vays, Bitcoin analyst and organizer of The Financial Summit, told Cointelegraph: “Unfortunately due to the recent rise in Bitcoin, it does not look like DeFi is overheating yet, and that is why everyone is rushing to get rich from these scams while they can.” Vays went on to add:“The developers don’t even really need a functioning product. The YAM founders probably wanted it to last more than two days, but considering there was a market on day one and it was valued at a $60 million market cap, the founder could have sold $5 million worth of YAM on day one and now can relax and enjoy the rest of life.”Asked whether he considered YAM a scam, Vays answered, “To me, anyone that prints their money is running a scam. It was different when Satoshi [Nakamoto] did it because he was the first to solve an actual problem.” In contrast, CoinGecko’s Ong said: “I would not consider it a scam as the rules were clearly defined upfront for everyone to see. I do however consider YAM to be very risky and a careless experiment.”The point about risk revolves around the rebase function, which can mint huge amounts of YAM tokens, thereby diluting existing token holders, but this may not have been known to all participants. The project is being called careless because its code was not properly audited and tested before launch.There really isn’t much precedent for these sorts of weekly detonations. As Sokolin told Cointelegraph, “Incumbent systems have been built much more like complex cathedrals. [...] The crypto space will not feature-match 50 years of core banking and portfolio management software overnight.”Ong added that he sees the current rush mimicking the mining craze of 2014–2016. Back then, however, one had to understand the mechanics of mining, but now, “one just has to have capital to stake and farm the early tokens, making this a more democratic process.”There is a danger of moving too fast and breaking too much when it relates to people’s financial assets, added Sokolin, “If we want to get to mass retail adoption, the standards will end up being more stringent and the assets more regulated.” Ong also added: “Eventually, this ‘test in production’ behavior will result in a massive loss, and it won’t surprise me if a Mt. Gox-like catastrophe was to happen at some point.”Has anything been gained from last week’s events? Wagster told Cointelegraph: “The fact that YAM apparently went live with unaudited software code is a huge red flag to anyone paying attention, but one bad apple should not spoil the whole bunch.” Ong added that in the future, those staking a large amount in DeFi should consider buying insurance. In this instance, “insurance for the YAM contract was available on Nexus Mutual but there was no buyer for this contract,” he said.O’Donnell emphasized the outsized impact of coding errors in this high-stakes environment: “I think it highlights that building these systems is hard and quite unlike other software development. Mistakes can lead to catastrophic failures unlike anything a standard webapp is capable of.”Vays was doubtful that any insights at all were gathered from the recent events: “The only thing useful that came from YAM is to show that these projects can lose you all your money in two days — but I already see people waiting for YAM 2.0 so the lesson was not learned.” Indeed, as Cointelegraph reported, total value locked in YAM has surpassed $400m since the collapse of the network, according to a report from crypto analytics firm Messari.Others, however, believe the project’s quick demise may find a place in crypto’s annals. “YAM is now a cautionary tale,” Kara Miley, global public relations lead at ConsenSys, told Cointelegraph. “An audit could have prevented the initial issue — rebasing, as it was missing a basic mathematical function to get the right numbers — and a proper test suite would have caught this,” she added.Still, Sokolin wouldn’t be surprised to see more implosions of this sort, given that DeFi is about committing financial assets on a potentially perpetual, decentralized network: “I would expect multiple periodic collapses within the DeFi space, but hope that their magnitude and impact — think the DAO, then the ICO collapse — will be less and less existential, and increasingly informative.” Meanwhile, Wagster said investors should remain ever vigilant:“Expect highs and lows as the DeFi market matures — investors should approach the market with their eyes wide open. New investors in particular should avoid trying to cash in on a fad that is not yet well understood.”As the dust from Yam Finance settles, many look out and see a bright horizon for DeFi yet. “The crypto community is sitting on one of the most fundamental innovations in the history of financial services,” Sokolin told Cointelegraph, “The key takeaway for me is to play the long game, rather than focus on asset prices in the short term.”"
619,"Another week, another attempt to break higher meets resistance.Bitcoin (BTC) entered the week surging past $12,000 only to retrace below that key level as altcoins continue to rise and fall.At the same time, it appears Ethereum’s well-documented problems have caught up to it faster than the blockchain can confirm transactions right now.Cryptocurrency market weekly performance. Source: Coin360The mantra is increasingly becoming the theme as Bitcoin pops above a key level only to retrace. This time, BTC surged past $12,000 for the first time this year only to fall back to around $11,800.Unlike last week, profit-taking wasn’t the only cause, as Chainlink (LINK), which has been soaring for most of the year, became the latest victim of a flash crash.Shortly after passing $20, LINK spectacularly fell 25% in under a minute as the subsequent cascade of margin calls linked to various trading strategies gradually filtered through to the market and put a real dent to overall market sentiment. No one was spared from the carnage, not even the almighty digital gold.Despite this disappointing development, crypto bugs should take solace in the fact that Bitcoin is still seeing higher highs and higher lows, an indicator of bullish sentiment. And, some profit-taking after an asset passes pricing milestones is normal, if not expected, and evidence of an orderly and (gasp!) perhaps maturing market.A little-known token attached to the OMG Network protocol has outperformed just about any other publicly traded asset this year. To date, OMG Coin is up almost 500% as it joins the growing ranks of projects chipping away at ETH’s lead as the dominant non-Bitcoin cryptocurrency.More and more projects are being given serious consideration by individuals and companies alike, as Gas fees continue to skyrocket and the Ethereum blockchain continues to creak and sputter under the weight of congestion from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms jamming the pipes.As a reminder, OMG Network can take USDT transactions off chain. The idea is to enable USDT deposits and withdrawals on the OMG Network, which will reduce confirmation times, make payments faster, and lower transaction costs at the same level of security as Ethereum.DeFi, however, remains largely immune to the Ethereum network’s issues despite ETH being a critical component of the ecosystem.The amount locked across various platforms — thought the real number is debatable — has risen to a staggering $6.5 billion at the three largest platforms. Namely, Maker, Aave and Curve Finance all have over $1 billion each. Just to think, all this capital could be splashing around across centralized exchanges.However, DeFi is not all about Ethereum and there is a new trend that has been taking shape for some time that has mostly escaped the front pages until now — the amount of Bitcoin that is locked on Ethereum.At the time of writing, 45,496 Bitcoins are locked on the Ethereum network as WBTC accounts for the vast majority with 30,798 Bitcoins locked.The second spot is occupied by RENBTC with 8,891 Bitcoins. As a reminder, this trend of locking Bitcoin on Ethereum really accelerated after Compound Finance’s governance proposal was approved earlier in the year whereby collateral factor on cWBTC was set to 40% (this was executed on July 14).Up until that point, it was not possible to use WBTC as collateral on Compound, although it was possible for it to be loaned and borrowed. This change allows users to loan WBTC while using 40% of its value as collateral.Disclaimer.

620,"The new work-from-home culture is gaining more traction than ever before as businesses, government departments and schools try to remain afloat while flattening the pandemic curve. This migration to remote working is a double-edged sword that creates a fertile land for cybercriminals to thrive on. There is no way that cyberattacks can be eliminated completely. The best that companies can do is minimize the frequency of the threats.Cybercriminals use malicious software code to block people or organizations from accessing their computer systems until a ransom has been paid. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) have made it easy for these nefarious actors to receive payment without exposing their identities.The United States cybercrime arm of the Department of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the United Kingdom’s National Cybersecurity Centre has already issued alert warnings about an increase in phishing scams that can lead to installing malware on computer systems. The joint alert was issued as the number of cyberattacks against remote workers increased.Hackers are targeting individuals and all kinds of establishments. In June, the University of California at San Francisco was forced to fork out $1.14 million in Bitcoin after suffering a ransomware attack. In May, hackers successfully attacked celebrity lawyers Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks. The criminals threatened to expose one terabyte of data of celebrities’ private data unless a ransom was paid in Bitcoin. Additionally, the City of Johannesburg, South Africa’s financial capital, was targeted in a Bitcoin ransomware attack in October 2019.Cryptocurrencies, due to their anonymity, are becoming popular with cybercriminals. Hackers receive the ransom payment in privacy coins or major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. The digital assets are then cleaned by being passed through mixing services.As companies allow their employees to work from home, they have to realize that their data and secrets are at stake. While remote employees are the targets, it is the companies that suffer at the end of the day. It goes without saying that prevention is better than a cure. Companies need to invest in teaching their employees how to safeguard their computers or systems.According to cybersecurity firm Sophos, about 73% of ransomware attacks result in data being encrypted. For a ransomware attack to be successful, it goes through three stages:Data encryption.Getting payment.Data decryption.There are several ways in which ransomware begins its process. It could be a simple phishing email or hackers could exploit vulnerabilities in network systems. Firewalls should be used to block ransomware. Some companies may think that implementing a firewall is expensive, but the clean-up bill is much higher.Employees should use strong passwords that are a mix of all types of characters found on a standard computer keyboard. The passwords should also be constantly changed. There are free tools that can be used to generate strong passwords that are not easy to crack.This is a difficult question, as it normally depends on what the company has to lose if the ransom is not paid. Hackers usually target a company if they know that there is valuable data. In most cases, it could be damaging for a company’s operations and reputation if its data, or that of its clients, is leaked on the internet or sold to the highest bidder on the darknet. Nefarious actors were recently selling 160 million user records stolen from 11 companies on the dark web, asking for a combined price of just over $23,000.The answer to this question is not clear, but logic points to paying the ransom. And cryptocurrencies will be used to facilitate these transactions.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Michael J.

621,"Bitcoin price and Tesla stock have both been in the limelight recently, leading some retail investors to question if there are commonalities between the two assets. As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to hover around the $12,000 mark (as of publication time), in doing so, the largest coin by market capitalization is reaching year-to-date highs that haven’t been seen since June 2019.Tesla stock has also set a number of benchmarks. On Aug. 20, Tesla’s stock price hit an all-time high, jumping over 45% in 10 days to close above $2,000 per share.Furthermore, data suggests that Bitcoin was the most viewed asset after Tesla stock in the United States last month.The increasing interest in both Bitcoin and Tesla have some wondering if BTC is behaving more like a tech stock. Findings from London-based digital asset management firm CoinShares noted that in its growth phase, Bitcoin does indeed behave like a tech stock:“Bitcoin’s risk profile is rather similar to that of a technology stock: if it reaches its potential, the value could be immense, but at the same time, there is a non-zero chance that it fails entirely.”While this may appear to be the case, Phil Bonello, director of research at crypto fund Grayscale Investments, told Cointelegraph that it isn’t fair to simply look at returns when drawing conclusions between Bitcoin and Tesla, with BTC being up by about 63% year to date and TSLA with a 365% rise:“Most risk assets have been correlated with each other because they have all been dependent on the strength or weakness of the denominator: the US dollar. Additionally, when assets sell off aggressively like they did in March, correlation approaches 1 as everyone needs liquidity.”Bonello’s point is verified by Tesla stock dipping to a low of $361 on March 18. Bitcoin also reached a low of nearly $3,800 back in March. Bonello further commented that while he doesn’t watch the ins and outs of Tesla closely, there is currently a secular bull market. “I tend to believe we are in a secular bull market driven by monetary and fiscal stimulus,” he said.Echoing Bonello, Natalia Karayaneva, advisor to Arrington XRP Capital and CEO of Propy — a blockchain-based real estate platform — told Cointelegraph that there are new bubbles emerging around the stock market and Bitcoin:“Instead of buying tangible consumer goods, people are investing in these assets as a way to not hold fiat. Similarly, institutional investors are investing in everything related to digital assets.”Market value aside, it’s interesting to consider the inherent similarities between Bitcoin and Tesla. According to Bonello, what Bitcoin and Tesla have in common is the potential for exponential growth, making them both especially volatile and reflexive.This point is also valid for most cryptocurrencies, not just Bitcoin. Mati Greenspan, a crypto market analyst and founder of Quantum Economics, told Cointelegraph that he had been tracking a correlation between TSLA and Chainlink’s LINK token, which is now the world’s fifth-largest coin by market value. Greenspan’s findings highlight the volatility of both asset classes.Millennial retail investors seem to be the most interested in volatile assets like Tesla and cryptocurrencies. Recent findings indeed prove this to be true, as CNBC noted in February that Tesla was the most held stock on the personal-finance company SoFi Invest, which is heavily used by millennials. Cointelegraph also previously reported that research from Stack Funds shows that 50% of Bitcoin investors are millennials.Another interesting commonality between Bitcoin and Tesla is the revolutionary impact associated with the two assets, as Tesla is greatly disrupting the transportation sector while Bitcoin is aiming to revolutionize finance.Yet, while disruptive technologies like Bitcoin and Tesla may drive mass interest from younger investors with similar behaviors, Bitcoin still remains a unique asset class. Grayscale’s Bonello commented that Bitcoin’s unique qualities may make it an appealing investment, but it has also been a challenge for traditional investors to make sense of its value, “particularly because Bitcoin doesn’t offer cash flows like other investments, such as Tesla,” he noted.Michelle O’Connor, vice president of marketing at trading platform Uphold, told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin, unlike Tesla, has a more realistic point of entry: “There’s an appetite for risk or returns that have become fluid as the ability to buy these assets on a smaller scale (fractionally).” She concluded:“Bitcoin is around $11,500 right now, if that was the point of entry it would be far less appealing to a wider audience. Because you can purchase fractions of Bitcoin, it’s point of entry is more realistic, the potential returns are instant and they’re not associated with a government.”"
622,"Cryptocurrencies — and Tether (USDT) in particular — could be playing a key role in recent capital flight from China, according to a new report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.The report states that over 44% of crypto transactions in East Asia are conducted with counter-parties within the region, making it “the closest we have to a self-sustaining market” in the industry.However, over the past 12 months, East Asia’s relative share of global crypto activity has begun to decline, with over $50 billion worth of cryptocurrency leaving China. Grayscale director of research Philip Bonello said: “It appears that users in many regions use stablecoins to access U.S. dollars for cross-border payroll, remittance, and capital flight from local currencies.” Since Beijing’s 2017 ban on direct conversions of yuan for cryptocurrency, the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin Tether has served as a popular stand-in for fiat for traders in the Chinese market. Relative to other regions, East Asia has the lowest share of on-chain volume devoted to Bitcoin (BTC), at 51% of transfers by volume. The rest consists of stablecoins, 93% of which is USDT.While yuan-USDT trades are, strictly speaking, also prohibited, OTC brokers continue to sell the stablecoin to enable traders to lock in their gains from crypto trades without worrying about price volatility. In June of this year, Tether outflanked Bitcoin to become the most-received digital asset by East Asian addresses. In the East Asian market, over $18 billion worth of Tether was moved to addresses based in foreign jurisdictions over the past year. How much of this reflects capital flight remains difficult to conclusively establish.Analysts claim that the yuan’s fluctuating valuation over this year and tensions amid the ongoing U.S.–China trade war could be spurring local investors to evade capital controls. Beijing bars citizens from moving more than the equivalent of $50,000 out of the country each year.  The government has meanwhile cracked down on routes for offshoring capital via foreign real estate investments and other assets, leaving cryptocurrency as a possible alternative.Other contributing factors include uncertainty as to how Beijing’s forthcoming national cryptocurrency will impact the private digital asset market. Chainalysis suggests this may be driving China’s cryptocurrency community “to move portions of their holdings overseas.” Primitive Ventures founding partner and regional expert Dovey Wan said that when it comes to Beijing’s approach to new technologies, “undertones matter”: “It’s important that [President] Xi talked about ‘the blockchain’ but not ‘Bitcoin.’ It implies that the digital yuan will be the only official, state-sanctioned cryptocurrency and dampens the view of crypto as a private asset.”Chinese state policy toward crypto has long been shaping which assets traders use and why. In commentary earlier this month, American broadcaster Max Keiser also claimed that geopolitical tensions were spurring capital flight out of Asia — though he cast the spotlight on Bitcoin, rather than stablecoins like Tether. “Capital flight out of Asia taking the Bitcoin express,” he said, as the asset rallied to hit $12,000."
623,"Bitcoin (BTC) is an essential investment as the world is about to face a “major banking crisis,” popular author Robert Kiyosaki has warned.In a tweet on Aug. 21, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad told followers that there was no time to “think about” investing in safe havens.The reason, he said, was that Warren Buffett had chosen to dump bank stocks.“WHY BUFFET is OUT OF BANKS . Banks bankrupt. MAJOR BANKING CRISIS COMING FAST,” he wrote. “Fed & Treasury to take over banking system? Fed and Treasury ‘helicopter fake money’ direct to people to avoid mass rioting? Not a time to ‘Think about it.’ How much gold, silver, Bitcoin do you have?”Kiyosaki is a well-known supporter of Bitcoin, frequently advising the public to buy and actively concern itself with the downward trajectory of fiat currency.The coronavirus crisis has only exacerbated his calls to exit dependency on fiat, in line with various Bitcoin proponents who fear that coronavirus responses by governments have all but doomed already inflated paper money.In the intervening period since March, when macro assets crashed en masse, both Bitcoin and precious metals have seen huge gains, fueled by the U.S. dollar currency index hitting its lowest in two years.U.S. dollar currency index chart since March.

Following MicroStrategy’s $250 million buy-in in late July, Bitcoin futures open interest hit an all-time high of $5 billion this week."
624,"A new report by crypto fund manager Grayscale Investments argues that the current Bitcoin (BTC) market structure “parallels that of early 2016 before it began its historic bull run.”Grayscale predicts that demand for Bitcoin will significantly grow as inflation accelerates, highlighting the need for a scarce monetary commodity, bolstering the use-case of the cryptocurrency.The report identifies several on-chain indicators showing growing interest in crypto, noting an increase in long-term holding over short-term speculation, amid historic lows for the number of Bitcoin held on exchanges.Grayscale also notes that daily active addresses are at their highest level since 2017’s all-time highs.The report asserts that loosening monetary policy from the United States’ abandonment of the gold standard onwards have created cycles of debt-fuelled asset bubbles followed by aggressive quantitative easing.Grayscale notes the increasing dependence of the U.S. economy on quantitative easing (money printing) to stay afloat and that history shows it’s an addiction difficult to quit.The S&P dropped 20% over three months in response to the Federal Reserve floating plans to reverse its monetary expansion in 2018.Despite the US dollar remaining “structurally strong relative to other currencies” the report asserts that investors who are wary of inflation amid the “unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus” are searching for ways to protect against the ever-expanding money supply — bolstering the case for Bitcoin as a store of value.Grayscale cites the scoring system used by hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones to assess Bitcoin’s attributes against cash, gold, and financial assets and determine the market’s growth potential.Quoting Jones, the report noted:“What was surprising to me was [...] that Bitcoin scored as high as it did. Bitcoin had an overall score of nearly 60% of that of financial but has a market cap that is 1/1200th of that. It scored 66% of gold as a store of value, but has a market cap that is 1/60th of gold’s outstanding value.”“Something appears wrong here and my guess is it is the price of Bitcoin,” Jones concluded."
625,"Data from a pseudonymous analyst compared the performance of Bitcoin (BTC) against global currencies since the start of 2020.The data shows that BTC has increased by anywhere between 50% to 128% against the world’s major currencies.The performance of Bitcoin against various global currencies. Source: DriftwoodPalaceThe analyst said:“Update on the bitcoin price in various currencies and on various time frames. Lets start with YTD, the price is up from 57% in the EU to 100% plus in Argentina, Brazil, SA, Russia, Turkey etc (prices are based on the official USD exchange rate and may differ in reality).”Bitcoin has performed significantly better against devaluing currencies, often with high rates of inflation. For instance, the Argentinian peso recorded 53.9% in 2019, its highest in over 30 years.Against the Brazilian real and the Argentinian peso, Bitcoin posted 128.4% and 103.5% gains. The digital asset also recorded a 56% to 69% gain against reserve currencies like the U.S. dollar and the euro.The Venezuelan bolivar also declined strongly against Bitcoin amidst uncontrolled hyperinflation. The unstable nature of many economies in Latin America frequently results in new all-time highs for peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions in Venezuela and Argentina.Since early 2020, prominent Wall Street investors, like billionaire Paul Tudor-Jones have described Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation. MicroStrategy, a billion-dollar publicly listed firm in the U.S., also recently purchased $250 million worth of Bitcoin as its primary treasury asset.Bitcoin’s strong performances against all global currencies year-to-date could strengthen the argument that BTC is evolving as a store of value.It is also important to note that Bitcoin price dropped more than any other commodity or index in March 2020. This occurred as the price declined by 65% to $3,596 on BitMEX.Despite this, Bitcoin has rebounded strongly, recording a yearly high at over $12,400 and posting a 244% year-to-date gain at the month’s peak. Emphasizing the strong momentum of BTC, the pseudonymous analyst added:“Bitcoin crashed harder than any other commodity or index earlier this year. Very few indices or assets have regained those losses. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is up in all currencies from mid-February. From 6% in Sweden to 50% in Brazil and Zambia.”Based on the positive price trend of BTC and its strong performance against reserve currencies, strategists believe Bitcoin could continue to prosper amid the current economic uncertainty.Meltem Demirors, the chief strategy officer at CoinShares, said:“So where does bitcoin sit in the economic cycle? During periods of economic uncertainty and dollar weakness, Bitcoin is likely to benefit in the same way as gold. If bitcoin’s financialization continues, it will be unable to remain insulated from the financial system.”Some analysts argue that rather than Bitcoin surging substantially in value, the value of global currencies dropped against BTC and other assets like gold."
626,"Chainalysis contends that the new issuance of Tether (USDT) may dampen Bitcoin's (BTC) bull run. In a weekly Market Intel newsletter, company's chief economist Philip Gradwell said:Source: Chainalysis Market Intel newsletter.Gradwell posited that the price change is mostly affected by the inflow of fiat into the market: ""At present, the data suggest the current price increase is driven by fiat demand."" Thus he concludes, that if Tether had not been creating new coins, more fiat would have entered the market. Though this may be true, it is also possible that at least some of the buyers who buy Bitcoin with Tether would have used other stablecoins or just stayed away completely.According to the firm's data:Gradwell concluded that the other half must have been acquired with fiat, arguing that the role of the other Bitcoin trading pairs was insignificant. Allegations had previously been levied against Bitfinex and Tether, accusing them of Bitcoin price manipulation."

Traders' sentiment certainly wasn't positive on Aug. 2 after a $1,400 crash that liquidated $1 billion in futures contracts.It's natural for the human mind to give more relevance to recent events, especially when presenting a negative outcome. Traders using leverage will undoubtedly have a more agonizing experience when facing such large unexpected red candles during more extended timeframe uptrends.Excessive leverage from buyers will be reflected in the funding rate. This is because perpetual futures contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded fee for margin usage.Funding rates are usually changed every 8 hours, and they ensure that there is no exchange risk overexposure imbalances. If buyers are using more leverage than sellers, the funding rate will be positive and buyers will pay. The opposite occurs when futures contracts sellers are the ones demanding more margin.Bitcoin perpetual swaps 8-hour funding rate.

This trend changed earlier this week as the indicator reached 0.10%, equivalent to 2% per week.This doesn't necessarily translate to bullish investors, but it does signal that buyers are the ones using more leverage.Volatility is the main gauge of price oscillations and it can either be calculated by historical prices or by the options market pricing, known as implied volatility. This means that regardless of the daily swings of the past week or month, implied volatility measures the present scenario.Only those Bitcoin options with the strikes closest to current underlying market levels are used, meaning $11,000–$13,000 ones at the present moment.

628,"In 2017, many traders and investors flocked to cryptocurrencies because they were attracted by the kind of returns not available in the less-volatile traditional markets. However, volatility inevitably comes with risks as well as opportunities. But crypto offers many opportunities that go far beyond traditional instruments. Programmable tokens and smart contracts create the potential to automate trading and investment vehicles, making them easier to understand and more accessible to retail users of all risk appetites.Derivatives trading platform FTX was the first centralized exchange to pioneer the use of leveraged tokens, enabling users to gain margin exposure without the hassle of managing margin, liquidation or collateral. Leveraged tokens are derived from the exchange’s perpetual swap contracts and operate as tradeable ERC-20 tokens that can be withdrawn and traded.They rebalance every day and can also be redeemed based on the user’s trading activity. These are higher-risk instruments suitable for traders looking for more exposure to volatility.If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then FTX can take comfort from the fact that Binance was relatively late jumping on the leveraged token bandwagon. After initially listing FTX’s leveraged tokens, Binance suddenly u-turned and removed them, citing user confusion as the reason. Only weeks later, the exchange giant announced it was launching its own version of leveraged tokens.However, FTX has been determined to continue providing innovative trading solutions to crypto users. One such example is its MOVE contracts, which are basically an options straddle strategy with centralized liquidity for speculating on Bitcoin’s (BTC) volatility. Rather than managing two options contracts with the same strike price and expiration, known as a straddle, MOVE contracts allow users to access a more sophisticated type of investment with a more user-friendly and understandable format. Due to its immaturity and experimental nature, decentralized finance applications have experienced several notable setbacks in 2020, including the bZx and Balancer exploits. Nevertheless, the value locked in DeFi has soared and is set to touch the $7-billion mark soon.Much of this popularity can be attributed to the fast pace of innovation, as the fertile ecosystem layers on more sophisticated products beyond lending pools, insurance instruments and stablecoin-issuing decentralized autonomous organizations.Aave is one example of an application that has moved up the rankings to rival the popularity of MakerDAO. The main reason is the opportunity for flash loans that involve borrowing and repaying a loan in a single blockchain transaction. Their demand has been fueling the practice of yield farming — running funds through a series of DeFi applications in an attempt to extract maximum returns.Some of the current limitations of derivatives products on DeFi platforms are worth noting, however. Ethereum congestion and gas fees could pose a threat to the continuing expansion of DeFi DApps, while the network continues to grapple with the complexities of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Furthermore, Vitalik Buterin himself has warned traders about the risks of yield farming.Nevertheless, for professional traders, the volatility of crypto paired with an increasingly impressive suite of trading products is enticing, to say the least. As more analysis firms and traders conduct their due diligence of the booming derivatives market, expect the deluge of products to continue parallel to growing interest. For the more risk-averse average Joe investor, passive investment is usually the optimal risk-adjusted method for investing in the crypto space long-term. Using strategies like dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin and Ether (ETH), users can gain exposure to an asymmetric call option on the future of money. However, piling into a single crypto asset risks maximizing the drawdowns during price crashes, such as March’s “Black Thursday.” Attempts to offset this risk have led centralized finance and DeFi innovators to develop more passive investment vehicles.Unfortunately, there is no crypto exchange-traded fund yet, but the vanilla option for a broader market exposure of large-cap altcoins is index funds. Similar to major stock index funds, crypto index funds encompass a basket of crypto assets aggregated into a single investment vehicle. They are independently weighted based on investor preferences and the fund’s design and can range from baskets of the leading 10 assets to the top 200 by market capitalization. Some centralized finance index funds have been stealthily gaining traction in a way that’s somehow escaped the attention of the crypto media. Adrian Pollard, a co-founder of bitHolla — a producer of white-label crypto exchange software — pointed out:“Many have been so focused and concerned about Bitcoin’s price volatility not noticing a secret stash quietly piling up at Grayscale, which now manages the largest crypto investment vehicle around.”Related: Interest in Grayscale Crypto Products Not Easing Up, Not Just BTC NowFunds that include more assets, particularly lower cap altcoins, grant investors more potential upside should anything resembling the mania of 2017 repeat. However, they also mean more exposure to drawdowns, as lower cap altcoins still tend to fare poorly during sharp downswings in larger-cap crypto assets.The caveat with Grayscale is that it’s only available to accredited investors, which is somewhat antithetical to the notion of crypto becoming a more inclusive financial system. That’s where “tokens as a fund” of different shapes and sizes enter the picture. A tokenized fund is essentially an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network that mirrors the price of an index fund using oracle price feeds and other technical components.Coinbase’s Index Fund, which covers Coinbase’s listed basket of assets, is an optimal method for retail investors to gain index exposure, and since Coinbase is also the largest fiat-to-crypto gateway in the United States, its index would be easy to access for many.The retail-friendly funds remove the accredited investor hurdle, making them more appealing to retail investors who want broader exposure and less volatility. To manage volatility spikes, index funds are ideal passive options for investors who are hesitant to dive all in on BTC, ETH or a handful of large-cap altcoins.

629,"Tone Vays, the well-known Bitcoin (BTC) derivatives trader, believes Bitcoin will stay above $10,000 for the rest of 2020. At the start of the year, Vays said he was skeptical BTC would break $20,000 in 2021 but now he thinks it’s possible for the top cryptocurrency to overtake its record all-time high.If the price of Bitcoin surpasses $20,000 in the medium-term, Vays said history shows it tends to double. Based on the historical price cycles, he said the $45,000 to $50,000 range is a reasonable target.The historical cycle of the Bitcoin price. Source: TradingView.comDuring an interview with IGTV, Vays said:“Every time Bitcoin breaks a prior all-time high, especially when it takes years to break that all-time high, it tends to usually more than double. So I think $45,000 to $50,000 is a reasonable target.”Throughout 2020, Vays said Bitcoin would likely stay above $10,000 and gear towards $20,000 the following year. He noted:“In the beginning of the year, I thought that even next year would be a struggle to break $20k. Now I think it's pretty likely that we'll break $20k next year.”As on-chain analysts have said throughout August, the $10,000 area has become a strong support level for Bitcoin. As long as a key psychological level at $10,000 is intact, an extended uptrend becomes more likely.Vays also drew a comparison between Bitcoin and gold. He emphasized that gold broke its all-time high and saw a 5% upside past its previous high fairly quickly. The trader explained that Bitcoin could do something similar over the medium to long-term when it breaks its previous all-time high at $20,000. He stated:“We are watching what's happening with gold right now. Gold finally broke its all-time high, that it made ten years ago, just recently, and it went already $100 past that. So it went 5% more fairly quickly. So let's see how fast gold goes up since breaking all-time high, and Bitcoin can do something similar.”Various price models predict the price of Bitcoin to reach anywhere between $30,000 to $250,000 in the long-term. According to Vays, he would be satisfied if the next top of Bitcoin is at around $45,000. Historically, Bitcoin has seen a major breakout past its previous record high, reach a new peak, then correct. A rapid upsurge to unsustainable price levels could leave BTC vulnerable to sharp drops. He added:“Do we think we go as high as $100,000? I'm not willing to make that statement. For me, I would be happy if the next top was around $45,000, and that can happen quickly.”A consistent theme that supplements the uptrend of Bitcoin is a favorable global macro backdrop that also complements gold. Fear towards rising inflation and economic uncertainty could sustain the momentum of Bitcoin."
630,"A month after the Texas State Securities Board took action against Mirror Trading International (MTI), South Africa’s Financial Services Conduct Authority (FSCA) is also investigating the company’s trading activities.According to the information MTI shared with FSCA, the company conducts high-frequency derivatives trades using bots on behalf of its clients.The financial watchdog said in a statement that the current business model of MTI requires it to own a financial service provider license but it does not seem to have one.The FSCA’s biggest concern was that MTI was promising its clients returns of as much as 10% per month. This, they stressed, was quite far-fetched and unrealistic.While the company claims to have more than 2.9 billion South African Rand (~$168 million) in clients’ funds in trading accounts, the FSCA said it was concerned whether the funds really existed.The FSCA warned people against using MTI’s services, claiming it did not own the mandatory license to operate and has advised its existing clients to request immediate refunds.To add more substance to their doubts against MTI, the FSCA pointed to a public statement by MTI’s platform broker FX Choice, which denied the legitimacy of the services and trading volumes claimed by MTI. The regulator said it was currently in the process of obtaining confirmation regarding these claims.The regulator said that it was reviewing information and will involve the South African Police Service once they are able to confirm the discrepancies.In July, MTI had claimed that it was in discussion with the FSCA and was working on regulatory compliance. It also said it would engage with “U.S. Texas Securities Commission“ regarding the cease and desist order from the Texas State Securities Board."
631,"BlockFi, a major American cryptocurrency lending startup, has completed another funding round featuring major industry investors.The company has raised $50 million in a Series C round led by Anthony Pompliano’s crypto asset management firm Morgan Creek Digital, BlockFi announced on Aug. 20.Also known as Pomp, Morgan Creek’s co-founder Pompliano is joining BlockFi’s board of directors following the investment.The appointment comes after Morgan Creek participated in all three of BlockFi’s funding rounds over the past 12 months, including the $18 million Series A round in August 2019 and the $30 million Series B round in February 2020.The funding round also featured some established BlockFi investors like Winklevoss Capital, venture capital fund Valar Ventures and CMT Digital. Other participating investors included Castle Island Ventures, SCB 10X, Avon Ventures, Purple Arch Ventures, Kenetic Capital, HashKey, and NBA player Matthew Dellavedova.As announced, the new funding comes amid BlockFi seeing a 10-fold revenue increase over the past year. The company now has $100 million in revenues over the past year, while managed assets account for more than $1.5 billion to date, BlockFi’s representatives said.Similarly to previous funding round announcements, BlockFi outlined that the newly raised funds will be used to further grow the company as well as the upcoming release of a Bitcoin (BTC) rewards credit card.BlockFi revealed plans for the card in early 2020, positioning it as the “world’s first ever crypto-rewards credit card.” Similarly to existing crypto reward apps like Lolli, BlockFi wants to provide global customers with cashback in cryptos like Bitcoin. The card is expected to be released in Q3 or Q4 2020, with CEO Zac Prince claiming that the crypto rewards would amount to somewhere between 1.5% and 3% from purchases in fiat."
632,"The former governor of Reserve Bank of India, Raghuram Rajan, said that private cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Facebook’s Libra may have a future even when central banks roll out their own digital currencies.Rajan, who was also the Chief Economist and Research Director at the International Monetary Fund from 2003–2006, said during a CNBC podcast that one of these digital currencies might only become problematic if it were to hold a monopoly.However, he believes that there will be other private digital currencies that will play different roles and provide strong competition to existing ones.The former central banker said that in the future, Bitcoin will mainly act as a store of value or a speculative asset rather than a medium of exchange. “Bitcoin is a bit like gold,” he added.Conversely, Libra will be used for day-to-day transactions, Rajan said.Rajan also expressed his concerns about banks issuing central bank digital currencies. He said that banks will be able to obtain a huge amount of information through the use of CBDCs, but people may not be comfortable sharing all their personal payment information. Banks would need to decide what data they want to collect and how they would want to use it, he added.Similar to private digital currencies, it will also be a problem if there is a “monopoly central bank digital currency without safeguards on the central banks use and management of the currency and the data that accompanies it.”It will be beneficial to have competition for both private as well as central bank digital currencies, Rajan said.Rajan concluded that, while there are challenges to be solved in the digital currency space, he would like to see private digital currencies co-exist with central bank digital currencies and see what works out best."
633,"Bitcoin (BTC) needs to hit $340,000 just to match its performance from its last halving cycle, data shows.In a Twitter series on Aug. 20, popular statistics resource ChartsBTC noted that Bitcoin still has huge room for growth at current levels of $11,700.Comparing lows, highs and halving prices from its two previous halving cycles, ChartsBTC put the difference between peaks at 36x for the 2012 cycle and 17x for the 2016 cycle.In order to repeat even the more modest cycle’s success, BTC/USD would have to trade at $340,000. 36x from last cycle’s high — Bitcoin’s all-time record of $20,000 — comes to $720,000.Comparing cycle lows, the results are even more dramatic — the smallest jump of 130x from the previous cycle would deliver a Bitcoin price of $400,000.Running the same diagnosis for Bitcoin’s price at the time of its halving events, the price target is $250,000.“The multiples from prior cycles applied to the current one arrive at highs between $250k and $1.6M in the next 18 months,” ChartsBTC summarized.The account noted that while the math adds up, there is little evidence which demands that such levels really do appear within the given timeframe.“While this may sound exciting, it's just hopium,” it added.  “The prior highs and lows won't dictate the future.”Bitcoin price chart with halving data. Source: ChartsBTC/ TwitterBitcoin investors are nonetheless primed for good news in current conditions as 30% monthly gains give bulls the firm upper hand.As Cointelegraph reported, the outlook seems rosy despite a modest pullback costing hodlers shaky $12,000 support once again.Previously, Vijay Boyapati, author of “The Memory Pool,” delivered his own halving-based price prognosis. Following the course of the 2016 cycle, which Bitcoin is currently frontronning, a new all-time price high should appear before the end of 2020.The current third halving cycle should also deliver a peak price similar to what ChartsBTC hypothesized.“If we were to follow the 2016/17 trajectory (we're ahead of schedule right now), the peak of the cycle would occur on October 19th, 2021 and the peak price would be approximately... $325,000,” Boyapati concluded.Quant analyst PlanB has argued that an average price of $288,000 and a peak of $576,000 or more is possible between now and 2024, the end of the current halving cycle."
634,"Details of a week-long negotiation between the University of California and a NetWalker ransomware gang have been revealed by Bloomberg.The University’s School of Medicine was working on a vaccine for Covid-19 in June this year when seven of its servers were locked down by the hackers. Against the advice from FBI, the university took matters into its own hands and conducted private negotiations.The university negotiator used flattery, appealed to the hackers sense of sympathy and ethics, and managed to reduce the ransom amount from as much as $6M, down to just over $1 million in Bitcoin (BTC) and successfully restored the systems.Right off the bat, the negotiator ensured they had the hacker’s ‘operator’ on their side, calling for respect from both sides, “I’m willing to work this out with you, but there has to be mutual respect. Don’t you agree?”. Before waiting for a response, they also appealed to the attacker’s pride:“I have read about you on the internet and know that you are a famous ransomware hacker group and very professional. I know you will honor your word when we agree on a price, right?”This appeared to work with the operator responding: “We are 100% about respect, and never will we disrespect a client who talk to us with respect.”Negotiations shifted to feeling out how dedicated each side was, with the negotiator crying poor and stating that all funds had gone into the research with none left to spare.Calling the apparent bluff, the operator replied that a school who collects over $7 billion in annual revenue should have no trouble paying a few million:“You need to understand, for you as a big university [...] you can collect that money in a couple of hours. You need to take us seriously.”The first offer by the university was $780,000 and was also scoffed at by the operator. “Keep that $780k to buy McDonalds for all employees. Is very small amount for us,” adding, “I am sorry.”As is typical in ransom situations, the negotiator then asked for two more days in order to allow “the university committee that makes all the decisions” to meet again. The operator agreed on the condition that the $3 million ransom be doubled to $6 million.A ransomware negotiator from Tel Aviv, Moty Cristal, told Bloomberg the extension might have proved useful for the attackers too, giving them time to identify the value of their stolen data.The Netwalker Group is a large-scale criminal enterprise and leases its software in a franchise style program. The group posted a recruitment ad in March this year, adding new affiliates to their network.At this point, either out of desperation or as a psychological strategy, the negotiator started appealing to the operator’s sympathies. “I haven’t slept in a couple of days because I’m trying to figure this out for you,” they said, “I am being viewed as a failure by everyone here and this is all my fault this is happening.”“The longer this goes on, the more I hate myself [...] All I ask is that you be the only one in my life right now to treat me nice. You’re the only one in the world right now who knows exactly what I’m going through.”The operator seemed responded: “My friend, your team needs to understand this is not your failure. Every device on the internet is vulnerable.”Four days into the attack, the negotiator eventually came back with an offer over $1 million, saying they were bending their internal rules to accept an additional $120K donation on the grounds that the negotiations come to a close. They even added a time pressure:“We normally can’t accept these donations, but we’re willing to make it work only if you agree to end this quickly.”The university spent 36 hours organising the purchase of 116 Bitcoin ($1.14 million) and sending the funds to the attackers. Two more days were required for the hackers to confirm the deletion of all sensitive data and give access back to the university.After more than eight days without access, the university successfully gained complete access back to all their servers. However the servers remained offline while they investigated the incident with the FBI and other cybersecurity consultants. In the most recent update on June 26, the university stated that the investigation was still ongoing."
635,"A Canada-based Middle Eastern restaurant chain just converted their entire fiat cash reserves into Bitcoin.According to an Aug. 19 tweet from Tahini’s — ‘the best Middle Eastern restaurant in the world’ — the decision to switch its cash reserves to crypto had its genesis in March’s crash, and when the Canadian government began to provide assistance programs for businesses unable to stay open due to the pandemic.With the United States and Canada printing money to prop up their ailing economies, Tahini’s owner Omar Hamam started to see the financial system as “a game of musical chairs being played right now and the music will stop and some people will get left out.”Hamam said he was concerned that the handouts and money printing would devalue fiat currency. “It was apparent to us that cash didn’t have the same appeal,” he said. “That eventually with all the excess cash circulating the economy that cash would be worth less.”“As time went on I was constantly trying to learn and grow my knowledge about finance. I heard people in the Bitcoin community saying you have to hear about Bitcoin at least 7 times before you get into it. 100% accurate.”He decided to convert the company’s savings into Bitcoin because it “offers a much better alternative to saving cash.” He reported that they would continue to use Bitcoin as a reserve asset — “maybe forever, if we don't have a need for fiat.”Tahini’s is following the same financial planning strategy as listed business intelligence company MicroStrategy, which last week announced it had adopted Bitcoin (BTC) as its primary reserve asset. MicroStrategy purchased 21,454 BTC for roughly $250 million.The landscape is changing so fast, some now wonder if even Berkshire Hathaway, controlled by Warren Buffett, may invest in cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation. The company invested in a gold miner for the first time this week.The restaurant’s decision to switch to Bitcoin received enthusiastic support from the crypto community. Podcaster Anthony ‘Pomp’ Pompliano tweeted his support, saying “another company converts their balance sheet capital to Bitcoin” adding he thought the idea was catching fire. Peter McCormack, host of the What Bitcoin Did podcast, echoed Pomp’s thoughts and tweeted he is also considering converting all his non-working capital into BTC."
636,"Ransomware gang REvil, known also as Sodinokibi, claims to have mounted a successful attack against the U.S. wine and spirits giant, Brown-Forman Corp — but the company claims otherwise.The company is the official manufacturer of Jack Daniels whiskey.According to cybersecurity services provider, AppGate, the famous alcoholic beverages manufacturer did fall victim to an attack but refused to pay the ransom demanded by REvil.However, Brown-Forman Corp told Infosecurity-Magazine in a statement they had successfully prevented cybercriminals from encrypting its files. This does not necessarily mean the gang’s claim to have compromised the internal network and stolen sensitive data is incorrect.Speaking with Cointelegraph, Felipe Duarte, a security researcher at AppGate and the author of the study, said the only proof that the gang has revealed are screenshots published on their darknet site of the alleged data stolen.Duarte confirmed that REvil group also infiltrated three international targets in the oil and gas, insurance, and consulting industries, including quest-worldwide.com in Australia, eurecat.com in France, and National Western Life in the USA.Duarte told Cointelegraph that REvil and other hacker groups have seen significant financial gain from their model of teasing out some of the stolen data and selling the “crown jewels” to the highest bidder.He adds that if companies continue to pay these ransoms, these groups will be able to fund and expand their operations to additional targets exponentially faster.Additionally, the REvil group also claimed to have stolen gigabytes of legal documents from GSMLaw law firm, containing dozens of international stars and celebrities sensitive data. In response, the hackers put data stolen in the attack up for sale for around $1.5 million on the “wall-of-shame” section in their darknet official blog.However, Duarte clarifies that there is no way to confirm if the data allegedly stolen by REvil really exists or “if it’s just a threat.”Duarte said that most ransoms are migrating from Bitcoin (BTC) to other cryptocurrencies such as Monero (XMR). “Sodinokibi used Bitcoin until 2019, this year they started accepting only Monero (XMR) for ransom payments and stolen data auctions,” he said.“Monero seems to be the main choice for most of the new attacks, as it's significantly harder to track than Bitcoin. We would expect to see governments and others turn an eye towards improving their tracking of this currency, as they have with Bitcoin, as these attacks on critical infrastructure companies grow.”Recently, REvil stole over 800 GB of data from ADIF, the Spanish state-owned railway infrastructure manager, after a successful attack deployed on their systems."

638,"As Bitcoin (BTC) price pulled back below $12,000, some investors began to worry that another crypto market crash like one that occurred on March 11 would occur. However, data from CryptoQuant, an on-chain analysis firm, suggests otherwise, as Bitcoin exchange reserves hit a 2020 low. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said:“People keep worrying about the great sell-off like March, but exchanges don't have as many idle Bitcoins (waiting to be sold) as that day.”All Exchanges Reserve and MPI charts. Source: CryptoQuantThe Bitcoin exchange reserve metric shows how much BTC is being held at exchanges. When the figure reaches a low it suggests that investors have withdrawn their holdings from the exchange into a more secure and permanent storage. Data from Chainalysis, also shows that the amount of BTC held for to 52 weeks is on the rise. Furthermore, Glassnode, an on-chain analytics provider, recently observed similar behavior and said that “the decline of Bitcoin exchange balances signals reduced selling pressure.” At the time of writing, 2.6 million BTC are being held at exchanges, which is lower than the amount held before the March sell-off when the figure sat at 2.9 million BTC.Data from CryptoQuant also revealed that miners are choosing to hold on to their current BTC supply. This suggests that miners expect higher prices and is a good indication of positive sentiment as miners constitute a significant portion of the Bitcoin selling pressure, they hold some influence over the Bitcoin price.The Bitcoin hash rate has also been increasing, another bullish sign as more people see the BTC price as being reliable above their price of production, a factor that gives the hash rate and price a strong correlation. All Bitcoin Exchange Inflows. Source: CryptoQuantWhile the number of BTC held by exchanges is at a 2020 low, data from CryptoQuant also shows that this figure may change soon as Bitcoin inflows to exchanges are on the rise. According to Ki Young Ju increasing amounts of BTC being sent to exchanges is typically a bearish sign. “BTC Inflows (netflows) into spot exchanges could indicate a potential sell pressure, stablecoin inflows indicate a potential buy pressure.”While increased exchange inflows for Bitcoin are typically bad news, USDT transfers are also on the rise, according to data from Glassnode, having reached their 2020 high on Aug. 17."

641,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) pulled back after achieving a new 2020 high at $12,486 on Coinbase. In the last 48 hours, BTC fell by around 5%, leading to larger losses in the altcoin market.There are three key reasons why Bitcoin rejected at the $12.4k level, namely major resistance, high funding rates, and an overheated rally. But traders believe it was a healthy pullback that could strengthen the momentum of BTC.As seen in previous Bitcoin price cycles, the digital asset typically sees a rapid upsurge followed by a sharp correction. For instance, from January to February 2020 Bitcoin price rose from $7,400 to as high as $10,500. In the subsequent month, the price of BTC declined to pre-January levels.Bitcoin price also sees massive spikes in volatility likely due to the futures market. When BTC sees a relatively large upsurge or a drop, it causes a cascade of liquidations to occur, resulting in large price movements.The minor pullback over the last 48 hours allowed funding rates to neutralize, meaning, the futures market is no longer overcrowded with long contracts and overleveraged positions have been flushed out.A potential consolidation phase for Bitcoin. Source: Michael van de PoppeSome traders say that it was a healthy pullback, which might temporarily lead to a period of stabilization or consolidation. Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said he wouldn’t be surprised if BTC trades sideways between $12,200 and $11,200 in his latest technical analysis.Similarly, Nik Yaremchuk, an on-chain analyst and cryptocurrency trader, said BTC is showing signs of a previous fractal found in May 2019. At the time Bitcoin saw two minor corrections, recorded several weeks of consolidation, then rallied to a new high. Bitcoin price cycle fractals. Source: Nik YaremchukBitcoin often sees historical fractals play out because the market likes to move in a cycle, both in the short and the long-term. Yaremchuk noted:“Another fractal: We have a similar base as in May 2019. Feels like it is 1: 1, cus in both cases we have triangle and wedge inside the Ascending Broadening Wedge. It doesn't look as perfect and bullish as it did before, but after we get $11.3k-$11.4k it'll be a new rally.”The price of BTC tends to consolidate after seeing a major rally, especially before entering a key resistance range between $12,000 and $14,000.Since June, a consistent theme throughout the current Bitcoin bull trend has been declining selling pressure across the market. On-chain analysts at Glassnode explained that Bitcoin reserves are much lower than the previous BTC top in July 2019. They stated:“The decline of BTC exchange balances signals reduced selling pressure. Currently 2.6M BTC are being held on exchanges. Significantly lower than the last time BTC hit a local top a year ago (2.8M), and lower than before the sell-off in March (2.9M).”The confluence of a neutral futures market, historical fractals showing similar price action, and declining exchange reserves support Bitcoin’s medium-term bull case."

643,"A global pandemic, massive and worldwide protests, job automation, environmental issues and geopolitical tensions are just a few of the challenges facing humanity today. Amid the chaos, keystone global institutions and bureaucrats have openly discussed the present day as an opportunity to remake the world. “The Great Reset,” as the plan has been called, represents a radical initiative by world leaders — many of whom are unelected — to transform the global economy.The World Economic Forum, for instance, claims there is an “urgent need” for “global stakeholders” to manage the direct consequences of what the International Monetary Fund has called “the Great Lockdown,” referring to the quarantines and social distancing practices implemented to contain the pandemic. At a WEF meeting in early June, the world’s most powerful business leaders, government officials and activists first announced the proposal to reset the global economy in the aftermath of the COVID-19 lockdown.The WEF sees a “unique window of opportunity to shape the recovery.” The Great Reset will inform the “future state of global relations, the direction of national economies, the priorities of societies, the nature of business models and the management of the global commons.” In short, the Great Reset represents a new social contract for the world. The WEF also stated: “The inconsistencies, inadequacies and contradictions of multiple systems — from health and financial to energy and education — are more exposed than ever.”Writing for The Hill, Justin Haskins calls the Great Reset “the most ambitious and radical plan the world has seen in more than a generation.” Even the British monarchy has weighed in. “We have a golden opportunity to seize something good from this crisis — its unprecedented shockwaves may well make people more receptive to big visions of change,” said Prince Charles at the meeting, adding: “It is an opportunity we have never had before and may never have again.”Many details of the Great Reset won’t be rolled out until the WEF meets at Davos, Switzerland, in January 2021. It is clear, however, that world leaders have big plans of a new world order and, contrary to the founding principles of Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto, centralization appears to be a big part of it.“Every country, from the United States to China, must participate, and every industry, from oil and gas to tech, must be transformed,” wrote Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, in an article published on the WEF’s website. He added: “In short, we need a ‘Great Reset’ of capitalism.”Schwab said that “all aspects of our societies and economies, from education to social contracts and working conditions” must be “revamped.”The cryptocurrency industry has been planning its own “Great Reset” as well — one based on decentralization. While global governments want to put the world on a distributed ledger in order to digitize finance so governments can have more control, there are very smart people on this planet who have their own plans. We in the crypto industry, for example, want to put everything on a blockchain. Instead of social credit systems and centralized fiat currencies, we want each individual to be in control of their own money, to be less dependent on banks, and to be in control of defining what money and real value is.The Great Reset will be a revolutionary upheaval. It will create many hardships but also opportunities for companies, which recreate financial products in a decentralized fashion on blockchain, and for individuals, who no longer must rely on the traditional financial system.As we find ourselves in a digital and technological revolution, hastened by the Great Lockdown, we as an industry cannot underestimate the implications of a crisis that has only just begun. We must now change our mindsets in order to properly bear witness to the Great Reset and turn it into “The Great Awakening.” That’s how we come out stronger on the other side.We’ll need to reconsider everything, including money. We must ask ourselves questions such as: What is this abstraction we call money? As an industry, for instance, we’ll need to place less emphasis on price. We’ll need to stop celebrating the development of central bank digital currencies as victories for cryptocurrency. The fact is CBDCs are not cryptocurrencies. They’re more like credit cards than cryptocurrency.Satoshi Nakamoto saw an economic dislocation like the Great Reset coming. He etched the now famous line into the Bitcoin network’s genesis block: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” The 2008 financial crisis and the consequent bailouts of “too-big-to-fail” banks had inspired him to release open-source and peer-to-peer money.“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work,” wrote Satoshi, adding:“The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.”While world leaders openly announce the Great Reset, imploring the world to trust their vision, they paint a picture of a future, more centralized world. Contrarily, Satoshi stressed the importance of decentralization. “A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990’s,” he wrote, adding: “I hope it’s obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we’re trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system.”Satoshi believed peer-to-peer solutions and decentralization gave people back their freedom. He thought decentralization was a poignant answer to centralization and monopolies.“[...]You will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography. Yes, but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years,” he wrote. “Governments are good at cutting off the heads of centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.”For how many years we can hold this “new territory of freedom” depends entirely on how well the cryptocurrency industry adapts to the Great Reset. People have only just begun to lose their livelihoods — that is, their businesses, their jobs, and so on — as a result of “the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.”We’ve seen increased digitization in 2020, and from artificial intelligence to blockchain to distributed ledgers, the Great Reset will only hasten this trend as the Great Lockdown hastened similar trends. As central banks create their own digital currencies, the cryptocurrency industry is building its own digital economy, too.After PC World published an article commenting on Wikileaks’ adoption of Bitcoin to circumvent a financial blockade against the whistleblower organization, Satoshi wrote: “It would have been nice to get this attention in any other context. WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet’s nest, and the swarm is headed towards us.”It would have been nice to get the coming attention in any other context, but the Great Lockdown and subsequent economic depression has kicked the hornet’s nest, and the swarm is headed toward us in crypto. The Great Reset might come down to central bank digital currencies versus the cryptocurrencies of the people — centralization versus decentralization.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Raoul Milhado is an entrepreneur with deep roots within the crypto and blockchain industry since 2015.

644,"The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has increased by 28% in the last 30 days and 36% at the weekly peak. Following the top cryptocurrency’s first breakout above $12,000 since September 2019, the sentiment remains optimistic. Many fundamental factors point toward an extended Bitcoin uptrend over the long run. Bitcoin has a favorable macro backdrop with the decline of the United States dollar and the rising demand for gold. The premier cryptocurrency has continuously rallied with the U.S. stock market and gold, demonstrating a consistent increase in appetite for BTC.Bitcoin also has strong technical factors buoying the sentiment around the entire cryptocurrency market. The hashrate of the Bitcoin blockchain network is at an all-time high once again, which suggests a stable mining industry. The closure of BTC’s weekly candle above $11,900 indicates a strong uptrend following weeks of consolidation in June.But on Aug. 19, the price of Bitcoin declined from $12,486 to $11,611, demonstrating steep rejection at a pivotal resistance area. Last August, the price of Bitcoin briefly went to the same resistance at around $12,300 before pulling back.Due to the abrupt rejection of Bitcoin at $12,400, traders seemingly anticipate a stable consolidation phase over the next several weeks, cooling down the futures market, neutralizing the funding rates, and providing the market with a stronger foundation for a prolonged recovery. The term “funding rate” refers to the mechanism used by Bitcoin futures exchanges to provide market balance. If the market is majority long, then long contract holders need to compensate short holders. When funding rates are too high, the price of BTC stagnates, since it’s less compelling to long the market.Based on various metrics and the pause of Bitcoin’s rally at a pivotal resistance level, crypto traders say that BTC is likely to stay in the current price range. Michael van de Poppe, trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and Cointelegraph contributor, thinks BTC could stagnate throughout August and possibly into September, meaning that, altcoins could reap the benefits at least in the short-term: “The general scenario is that we’ll be ranging a bit here, before continuation of the downwards momentum. Overall -> alts [altcoins] (smaller ones) continue to do well.”A minor pullback in the near-term would be a healthy reset for the price of Bitcoin, especially when funding rates are considered. Prior to the drop, the funding rate of Bitcoin futures contracts on BitMEX and Binance Futures were nearing 0.0864% and 0.1199%, respectively.When funding rates are this high, it could leave Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies vulnerable to a potential long squeeze. As such, a stabilization period supplemented with a minor pullback and a drop in funding rates could benefit the longer-term trend of Bitcoin. Considering numerous factors, including the positive reset of funding rates, derivatives trader Cantering Clark said that the BTC trend is overall positive, but uncertainty is beginning to build in the crypto market following BTC’s overnight drop. When the sentiment around Bitcoin turns cautious after weeks of rallying, it is generally optimistic. According to Clark:“This is good, it’s already happening. The charts are coming out. Uncertainty is brewing. ‘Distribution,’ 7k calls, top, etc etc. Bring it to the brink, flip funding and then rip it up again.”Similarly, Mohit Sorout, founding partner of Bitazu Capital, said the recent pullback would cool off the overheated derivatives market. The futures market overran the spot market in July, as BitMEX Research and CryptoCompare show. As the crowded futures market now begins to settle down, it could further strengthen the BTC uptrend. Mohit also said: “Cool off overheated derivs for a few days here then take us to the promised land.”Over the long-term, researchers, especially on-chain analysts, are optimistic about the trend of Bitcoin due to an inflow of institutional capital into Bitcoin, more wallets holding onto BTC, and the amount of Bitcoin reserves on exchanges declining. The three data points indicate that fewer retail investors, for now, are willing to sell BTC at current prices, according to Glassnode: “Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) broke in to the ‘Belief’ zone for the first time over a year. Its current value is lower than the last time $BTC hit $12,000 — suggesting potential for more price upside from here.”While the momentum of Bitcoin remains generally strong due to institutions like Microstrategy acquiring more BTC and retail investors continuing to withdraw their Bitcoin from exchanges, whales or miners starting a BTC sell-off remains a persistent threat.As Cointelegraph previously reported, whale clusters are found in the $12,000 to $14,000 macro resistance range, with $12,000 either marking a profit or break-even point. Whales typically don’t sell when they are below their break-even point, and instead wait for sufficient liquidity in the market. Similar trends were spotted in October 2019 and February 2020, when BTC abruptly dropped from $10,500.Overall, as the OKEx on-chain data report shows, traders are beginning to treat the $10,000 level as a strong area of support. The exchange found that many traders closed their old positions from $6,200 to $9,700 and built up new positions at $10,000 onward. As BTC has remained above $10,000 for a prolonged period, the likelihood of a newfound rally would likely increase: “A lot of older positions (between $6,200 and $9,700) were recently (in the last seven weeks) closed for profit, reducing the downward pressure on BTC’s price.”Talking to CNBC, Dave Chapman, BC Group’s executive director, said that the firm is seeing traditional finance investors joining the crypto space: “OSL is witnessing institutional investors and traditional finance scrambling to participate in the Bitcoin, Ethereum and wider digital asset space.”One consistent theme throughout the rally of Bitcoin since early June has been the booming altcoin market. Led by the interest in decentralized finance, some altcoins have outperformed BTC in the past several weeks. Yearn Finance (YFI), Chainlink (LINK), Band Protocol (BAND) and Aave (LEND) all posted two-to-ten-fold gains.Researchers at Santiment, an on-chain analysis firm, believe the so-called alt season “is about to be finished.” If it does, there are two scenarios: profits flow into stablecoin and the market corrects, or profits flow into Bitcoin:“Alts will enjoy the party, one by one, crazy money will move from one to another, there are still some alts to pump (though their number is getting less and less). [...] After process is over either we all together go down, or Bitcoin will go up alone.”In the medium- to long-term, on-chain analysis and the trend of altcoins suggest that the $10,000 support level of Bitcoin could hold. An extended accumulation phase above a key level could catalyze another BTC rally in the final quarter of 2020."
645,"Bitcoin (BTC) will only stop gaining in value if “something unexpected” stops it, Bloomberg researchers believe.Tweeting a summary of the latest Bloomberg Intelligence Commodity Primer on Aug. 19, senior strategist Mike McGlone revealed a clear bullish stance on BTC.Bitcoin has reentered mainstream consciousness in recent weeks thanks to price rises which topped out at over one-year highs of $12,400.Despite a modest pullback, gains have broadly been retained, and analysts are confident that trajectory remains skewed to the upside beyond the immediate short term.“Something unexpected needs to happen for Bitcoin's price to stop doing what it's been doing for most of the past decade: appreciating,” he wrote. “Demand and adoption metrics remain favorable vs. the crypto asset's unique attribute of fixed supply.”Charts confirm that Bitcoin is currently within its narrowest Bollinger Band scenario on record — a timely occurrence after creator John Bollinger on Monday described the current bull run as “picture perfect.”BTC/USD historical chart with Bollinger Bands.

Source: GlassnodeDespite a slight pullback overnight on Tuesday, Bitcoin continues to delight hodlers, with monthly gains still at almost 30%.A retracement for gold and stocks appeared to fuel selling pressure, but under the hood, Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain stronger than ever. As Cointelegraph reported, hash rate has hit its highest ever average rate, while difficulty is set to follow suit at the next readjustment in four days’ time. Continuing, Glassnode added that each time UTXO profitability passes 95%, it sparks a brief but intense bull run for BTC lasting up to three months.Other metrics, meanwhile, suggest that Bitcoin is rather at the start of a longer bull run than at the end of a sudden uptick. Specifically, Glassnode’s Compass, which employs a basket of factors to chart Bitcoin’s strength, continues to flash firmly bullish.“The compass' continued position in the upper right quadrant provides an optimistic signal of continued bullish sentiment and on-chain activity,” the report added. “This trend supports the widely circulating speculation that BTC is indeed in the early phases of entering a bull market.”Glassnode Compass showing the latest weekly Bitcoin performance.

647,"Rampant inflation is affecting Turkish residents’ confidence in the nation’s lira fiat currency. According to a Reuters report on Aug. 14, locals are dumping lira, converting it to dollars and buying gold. Even with market interventions and reassuring stories about monetary stability coming from the government, the locals’ faith in the lira is on a downward trajectory. Inflation is currently at 11.8% and has overtaken the amount of interest offered for savings at banks. One resident was quoted as saying he had bought gold as a safe-haven asset:“I think it is the best investment right now so I converted my dollars to buy gold, I might withdraw my lira and buy gold with it too, but I am scared to go to the bank right now because of coronavirus.” Locals expect more panic-selling of the lira if the government can not boost confidence in the currency, which has dropped by almost 20% in 2020.Turkey’s economy depends mostly on imports. The pandemic has worsened inflation and it may also cause a balance of payments crisis, further weakening the currency.As fiat currency like lira continued to lose value due to massive inflation, Bitcoin’s market cap has reportedly become greater than Bank of America and the New Zealand dollar.

While reports of widespread crypto adoption in Turkey have been debunked recently, local exchange BtcTurk conducted a small survey with the Istanbul University’s Statistics Appliances and Research Center in July. It found that during the COVID-19 pandemic, trust in Bitcoin increased by 23%, while satisfaction spiked 58.5%. Usage among the Turkish audience has reportedly doubled since February 2019."

On a recent podcast hosted by Peter McCormack featuring Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Blockstream CSO Samson Mow said tokenized Bitcoin only proved that Ethereans needed Bitcoin:“The whole reason that Bitcoin is staying wrapped to be used on Ethereum is because it is stable and reliable. That's why it seems to be Ethereans prefer using wrapped Bitcoin to Ether to do their DeFi stuff.”Samson Mow’s argument was labeled a “blatant lie” in a YouTube response video released by Bankless. The Bankless hosts said that Bitcoin has exactly the same problems with scaling and high transaction fees when demand is high that Ethereum currently does and claimed the way Bitcoin “scales” at the moment is by being tokenized on Ethereum.Like many ETH fans, they had a negative reaction to Mow’s attacks on the project and said they’d turned off the podcast in disgust."

650,"With the global air industry in turmoil due to pandemic-induced flight delays and cancellations, a startup in Bulgaria is providing the option for travellers to receive compensation in Bitcoin.Compensation via the Colibra app is available to passengers who experience a flight delay of one hour or more. The Bulgaria startup has been offering inconvenienced travelers compensation in fiat since it commenced operations in June 2019, but has now added crypto as a payment option.As BTC is a volatile asset, users can choose whether they want to lock in the price on the day they register for their flight, or the day they travel. For example, a frequent flier who booked a flight last week and locked in a rate on the app when Bitcoin was priced in the $11,000s would have gained a decent return from a flight delayed today, when BTC is above $12,000.Colibra states that it will guarantee a Bitcoin payout for any user delayed by one hour or more no matter what reason the airline provides.In the EU, airlines are required to compensate any passenger for delays of three hours or more which are the company’s fault. The app works by filing for compensation for all eligible passengers affected by three-hour or more delays, and sharing the funds with all passengers who were delayed more than one hour. According to the startup, the chance of experiencing a 90-minute airline delay is 30 times greater than a three-hour one, so travelers get compensated more often.In France, insurance company AXA has used a similar blockchain-based compensation process for passengers whose flights are delayed more than two hours.However, fewer people are flying now than at the same time last year due to airlines and authorities trying to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Global travel data provider OAG states that the number of scheduled flights on Aug. 10 dropped 47.9% globally, with flights out of Hong Kong and Singapore being reduced a staggering 91%."

652,"Determining Bitcoin's (BTC) value can be more complicated than simply looking at its current market price.""Most Bitcoins already cost at least $100,000, but probably more like $10 million,"" said Michael Goldstein, also known as Bitstein, in an Aug. 17 tweet. While Bitcoin sits around $12,000 at press time, many folks in the crypto industry likely value the asset at a much higher price tag. If someone buys a BTC at $10,000, but is unwilling to sell it until the asset reaches $100,000, then the price tag of that Bitcoin is naturally much higher than its current market value. This then begs the question: How many Bitcoin are currently worth $100,000?At the start of the year, 64% of Bitcoin's circulating supply had remained in the same wallets since 2018, which seems to suggest that most BTC has a higher valuation than current market prices indicate.According to Goldstein, many of Bitcoin's largest bag holders value the asset between $100,000 and $10 million. These numbers sit in line with a bevy of price predictions from various authorities over the years.On March 5, 2020, Bitcoiner Max Keiser predicted Bitcoin shooting up to $100,000 in 2020 as fueled by COVID-19 repercussions.

655,"Ethereum recently turned five years old, and coincidentally, it also appears to have reached an inflection point for user adoption. In the second quarter of 2020, daily active Ethereum users nearly doubled to 1.26 million, up from 637,000 in the first quarter, according to a recent report from Dapp.com. The sudden spike is widely attributed to the release of Compound’s COMP governance token.In the same report, several other numbers stand out. Notably, after Ethereum, the two blockchains with the most daily active users are Klaytn and Terra, with Klaytn having been far ahead of Ethereum in daily active users before the excitement around decentralized finance following the COMP token release in June. Furthermore, Klaytn has also made strides in achieving over 7.5 million total unique users, versus 4.5 million on Ethereum. Although Terra is still catching up with 1.78 million total users, it’s worth noting that it’s outpaced every other major blockchain platform, including EOS, Tron and NEO. What is it about Klaytn and Terra that’s managed to attract such sizable user bases when they’ve both been around for less than half of Ethereum’s lifetime? There could be many driving factors at play. However, perhaps the most obvious comparison is of the East and West. The Ethereum Foundation is based in Switzerland, and many of the decentralized applications based on Ethereum are developed by teams in Western countries, whereas Klaytn and Terra both have more of an Asian focus. Zooming out to the macro level, there are some critical variations in the path to adoption between countries in the East and those in the West. I believe these differences create a plausible basis to account for the variation in adoption rates.While Silicon Valley has firmly established itself as the epicenter of Western tech development, entire Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan and Singapore have become renowned for their affinity with technology in consumers’ daily lives. In the case of South Korea, the government has been on a mission to put the nation at the forefront of telecommunications development for over four decades. From 1980 to 1987, government investment took Korea to universal status in telecommunications. Fast forward to today, and South Korea has had universal fiber network access in place for years now. Compare this to the United States, where fiber access stands at around 30%. Furthermore, the existing investment means that the Korean infrastructure can be upgraded to substantially higher speeds at low costs for decades to come, according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation.Extensive government investment in infrastructure ultimately led to major global technology firms, including Samsung and LG, establishing themselves in Seoul. Moreover, these firms have also been at the forefront of embracing blockchain technology and incorporating it into their existing range of consumer products. For example, Samsung has integrated blockchain technology into its Galaxy S10 and S20 phones and also teamed up with Gemini to connect the exchange directly into the Samsung blockchain wallet.Related: Samsung Phone Support for Gemini Exchange Can Further Crypto AdoptionA massive reason for the rapid success of Klaytn and Terra is that they have been established by companies that already had an existing working product and consumer base. Klaytn emerged from a subsidiary of Kakao, which operates Korea’s biggest messaging app, holding a 98% market share, KakaoTalk.Similarly, Terra hosts CHAI, a mobile payment service that is integrated with several major partners for its payment services, including Yanolja, Korea’s number one hospitality app, and Nexon, Korea’s premier game publisher. Terra is on track to surpass 1 trillion Terra (KRT, equivalent to over $830 million) in organic volume within the next six months. In a similar way to Samsung, these projects have taken an existing product or platform and incorporated blockchain technology in such a way that users don’t even need to know that the underlying technology is based on a blockchain. Furthermore, they have an established user base and understand their needs, enabling them to create solutions that consumers value.This could account for why it’s taken longer for Ethereum to gain traction among users. A critical barrier to entry is that users need to hold Ether (ETH) to pay gas fees, a barrier which developers either leave in place or have had to work to overcome.The rise of DeFi represents the first paradigm shift in the crypto industry where developers have started building around market demand, capturing an opportunity to provide a new financial infrastructure for users. While DeFi is undeniably a fascinating and burgeoning segment that’s being powered by the Ethereum ecosystem, it’s operating in a niche of users who already know and understand blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. The barriers to entry are a natural consequence of the way that Ethereum emerged — as an infrastructure solution, rather than in response to consumer demand.Where Western firms have attempted to take a more consumer-focused approach to blockchain implementation, it’s unfortunately been the case that U.S. regulators have stopped them in their tracks. Two of the most prominent examples are the Telegram Open Network project and Facebook’s Libra venture.Telegram was forced to abandon the TON project after the Securities and Exchange Commission deemed its token sale an offering of securities, a decision that was later criticized by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce. As Peirce pointed out, Telegram isn’t even a U.S. company.Similarly, Facebook’s Libra project has come up against intense regulatory scrutiny from both the U.S. and countries in the European Union. This ultimately led to many of the Libra Association’s original members, such as PayPal, to drop out of the project entirely. The project now faces lengthy delays.This leads to another critical difference between East and West — the approach to regulation. This issue also has roots going back further than it may first appear. To compare the U.S. and South Korea, the authorities of both countries started sitting up and taking notice of cryptocurrencies around the time of the ICO boom in 2017.However, partly thanks to the established digital infrastructure in South Korea, many citizens were already heavily invested in cryptocurrency. At one point in 2017, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether were trading on South Korean exchanges at a 30% premium above their western counterparts because crypto was in such high demand.Therefore, in contrast with the positively draconian attitude of the SEC, the South Korean government has had to take a more cautionary approach. Clamping down with a similar attitude to the U.S., regulators would have been a political death knell.Furthermore, obtaining investment can be fraught with friction in the U.S. due to the onerous obligations that the SEC imposes on venture funds. In contrast, the Korean Financial Services Commission takes a hands-off approach to proprietary investment funds such as Hashed, which has provided early-stage backing to projects including Klaytn and Terra.Nevertheless, Hashed has been working with South Korean government agencies to help better regulate cryptocurrencies to bring greater clarity to those operating in the space. In March, a law was passed that introduced a permit system for digital asset exchanges, while more recently, the government approved an amendment to existing legislation around taxation to include a flat tax on crypto profits.While some quarters of the crypto community prefer an unregulated environment, it’s unarguably the case that regulation brings more freedom to operate for existing businesses wanting to expand into digital assets. As a result of the South Korean government’s improving framework, major banks are now starting to develop infrastructure for cryptocurrencies, such as custodial solutions.None of this is to say that the path to blockchain and cryptocurrency adoption is simple. In the East and West, the journey is convoluted and comes with its own challenges. The cryptocurrency community should work together with regulators to ensure that the necessary legal frameworks are in place to enable freedom to operate and attract broader investment from outside the space.However, this will only help to achieve adoption if it’s coupled with a consumer-centric approach to blockchain applications. With the last few years having placed a heavy focus on developing the technological underlayers, now is the time to start considering how consumers can best interact with blockchain technology. By removing these two significant rocks from the road, we can accelerate the quest for mainstream mass adoption.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Simon Seojoon Kim is the CEO and managing partner at Hashed.

656,"Amid turbulent times for the world at large, the cryptocurrency space seems to be cruising on its own steam in 2020. The coronavirus pandemic has put a major strain on economies around the world, and countries such as the United States have seen their central banks resort to extended quantitative easing in order to stimulate their financial ecosystems.Some analysts believe that this continual fiscal stimulus is part of the reason that the cryptocurrency market is enjoying relative success compared with its traditional financial counterparts.The likes of Anthony Pompliano, co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital, and Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, have spoken to this very point in a number of recent newsletters to investors. Their insights have been directly mirrored by some major moves from traditional companies that have made significant investments into Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.MicroStrategy, considered to be the largest business intelligence firm in the world, made headlines last week as it invested $250 million directly into Bitcoin. The company hammered home its belief that Bitcoin is a superior store of value compared with other financial assets and will deliver better long-term appreciation than holding fiat currency.Another clear sign that positive sentiment is soaring in the space is the growth of assets under the control of cryptocurrency fund manager Grayscale Investments. Those numbers may well increase over the next few months considering the fact that Grayscale is now actively advertising its services on mainstream television in the United States.While it’s not the first time that cryptocurrency exchanges and fund managers have advertised in traditional media outlets, the sheer amount of interest in the space suggests a shifting sentiment from the wider public.As Cointelegraph Magazine explored on Aug. 10, the launch of Grayscale’s television ad could be a major catalyst for increased investment in crypto, likened to a Merrill Lynch ad in 1948 that introduced investors to the stock and bond markets. Grayscale released a teaser for the ad on Twitter, with the full version now running on CNBC, MSNBC, Fox and Fox Business, and other channels.Our new commercial debuts TODAY... Trust us: AUDIO ON! #GoGrayscale pic.twitter.com/hPhUgp7HiYWhile Grayscale’s ad is running on TV screens and social media channels, traditional print has not been neglected either. Galaxy Digital, famously set up by millionaire investor Mike Novogratz, ran a large block ad on Aug. 13 in the well-known United Kingdom-based business newspaper the Financial Times. The publication had over 1 million subscribers in 2019, with an estimated 18% of its readership being millionaires. The ad itself contains emotive language that encourages people to invest in Bitcoin by highlighting the tough sociopolitical and economic landscape this year.Big ad for bitcoin in the FT today from Galaxy Digital. Love it pic.twitter.com/ro05QdvDFfWill mainstream advertising drive adoption?The cryptocurrency space was already enjoying a period of heightened interest and resulting investment before these advertising campaigns were launched. What remains to be seen is whether these initiatives to coax new users into the ecosystem will pay dividends.Cointelegraph reached out to Joshua Frank, co-founder and CEO of crypto data aggregation platform The Tie, to assess the potential efficacy of these marketing drives. Frank was not entirely surprised to see these advertising initiatives, given that running campaigns seems to be the mood of the hour, judging by the campaign of the controversial HEX token seen in the United Kingdom recently. Nevertheless, he conceded that it’s a change in tactics for the cryptocurrency industry:“A few years ago I would have never expected a print advertisement related to cryptocurrency. I think the transition to the Bitcoin as a digital gold narrative is the reason that a print ad has been pursued. Trying to get an older generation who invests in gold to view Bitcoin as a digital alternative.”Frank is of the opinion that Grayscale’s television ads are likely to be more impactful than Galaxy Digital’s print campaign, although he noted that the response to Grayscale’s video may not have been as positive as the firm had desired.An intriguing takeaway from Frank’s insights is his belief that the bigger marketing impact may come from social media influencers. Frank mentioned Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy and his recent meeting with the Winklevoss twins, which made waves on Twitter in particular, as a prime example of the effect influencers can have on specific cryptocurrencies:“It hasn’t been TV or print advertising that has driven the Robinhood rally, it is Tik Tok influencers and Dave Portnoy. [...] Portnoy, Barstool, and Tik Tok can drive the next wave of users to digital assets. Influencers and social media drive retail flow, and retail flow attracts more institutional clients.”The final consideration of these advertising campaigns is their timing. The overall cryptocurrency market has been in a particularly positive space, in stark contrast to the global economic climate. Quantum Economics’ Greenspan told Cointelegraph that the “Blitzkrieg Bop” song came across as “loud” but countered that by complimenting Grayscale on its growing client base. Meanwhile, he felt that the approach taken by Galaxy Digital was arguably more effective, adding:“TV and newspaper advertising is an industry standard. I believe the fact that we’re seeing these levels of advertisement in mass media is really a hallmark moment for the crypto industry — a sort of ’coming into the light.’ Whether that is a good thing or bad thing, I am not sure.”Frank’s thoughts around HEX were echoed by Greenspan, who highlighted the advertising in the U.K. as one of the downsides of crypto going mainstream, marking a blip on what has been a figuratively seminal moment for the crypto space, as he explains: “We’ve certainly seen it backfire with the stuff that HEX has been doing, and certainly, I think at least in the UK, the regulators there should lose their jobs over this.” He went on to add: “I can’t believe that The Economist was willing to publish an ad about HEX with an indication of 11,500% gains. All the disclaimers in the world are not going to make that OK.”Overall, analysts like Greenspan have been highlighting an ever growing negative sentiment of late toward the inflationary nature of fiat currencies, and the Quantum Economics founder believes that people are coming to this realization by themselves — with or without ads touting the benefits of cryptocurrencies:“Price alone is a good indicator that people are understanding this message more and more clearly. Bitcoin was invented as a form of money that is independent of governments and central banks. [...] I just hope that the crypto solutions are ready by the time they’re actually needed.”"
657,"The Bitcoin (BTC) and gold one-month correlation reached a record high of 68% as Bitcoin hit $12,000 early in August, but the correlation crashed by 20% the following week. Despite this, Bitcoin looks set to become digital gold in 2020 considering the price correlations and trends in the futures market.Both gold and Bitcoin are having a phenomenal year in terms of year-to-date returns. According to Skew Analytics, gold has a 27.93% YTD return, while Bitcoin has racked up a 71.68% YTD yield. Although Bitcoin sees much higher volatility than gold, it seems that in these uncertain, pandemic-stricken times, investors are gravitating toward store-of-value assets such as gold and Bitcoin.Bitcoin and gold are very different assets in the traditional sense, which is mainly due to liquidity, owing to both being in different phases in their asset lifecycle. Gold currently has a market capitalization of about $9 trillion, whereas Bitcoin’s is only $228 billion.These major differences aside, gold and Bitcoin are largely associated due to two similarities: both assets are “mined” and their scarcity entails an inelastic supply. The latter means that no matter how much the price of the asset increases, supply cannot increase due to production limitations. Commodities with an elastic supply would not be scarce, and thus cannot be considered a store of value. Dan Koehler, liquidity manager at crypto exchange OkCoin told Cointelegraph: “While any asset can have value based on supply and demand, limited availability in gold and BTC give them a unique blueprint as a store of value.”Even though gold is an asset that is considered to be a store of value, in terms of usage, it has a few applications in the electronics and jewelry industries, and is predominantly used by governments and central banks as a value holder for fiat currency, while Bitcoin is purely used as a store of value for investors.Koehler also pointed to Bitcoin’s volatility being detrimental to the title of “digital gold” as it looks to become a safety asset: “Bitcoin has fought to hold this title as well, but its periods of high volatility in the past has prevented it from capturing more market share for this title.” Dennis Vinokourov, the head of research at BeQuant — a crypto exchange and institutional brokerage provider — told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin maximalists admire deflationary assets, adding, “Given the safe haven and inflation hedge status that gold holds, it is probably the only other asset that somewhat resembles what Bitcoin native stand for.”While correlations are often used to compare two assets in the financial markets, Vinokourov further warns investors to focus on Bitcoin’s diversification instead of relying too much on correlation values over various time frames:“While the 1-month correlation between the two has risen lately all the way to 68%, the much more widely used 3-month measure stands at a mere 15%, while longer duration such as 1-year, the correlation coefficient is even lower. As such, caution is warranted when building investment thesis based on the above metrics and instead, it may be better to focus on Bitcoin’s diversification capabilities instead.”It is important to note that over longer durations, Bitcoin is largely uncorrelated with all the major assets available to investors. The correlation with traditional assets is usually between 0.5 and -0.5, suggesting that the relationship between their returns is extremely weak.When looking at correlation figures, it is critical to keep in mind that the two assets ultimately represent separate markets that have different macro and micro economic factors affecting each of them. Koehler furthered this voice of caution by stating:“It’s important to remember that historical correlation merely looks to show how two markets have moved together or disjointed, but is not an explanation of such movements. [..] News in one asset (a BTC hard fork for example) doesn’t necessarily have any effect on the Gold market and as such BTC volatility around that event may not be reflected nearly as much in the Gold market and correlations may decrease as the asset’s returns deviate.”For example, the all-time high in Bitcoin and gold correlation was seen at the same time when Microstrategy, the world’s largest business intelligence firm, bought $250 million in Bitcoin, making the asset its primary treasury reserve. This is seen as a major sign of institutional interest. Marie Tatibouet, chief marketing officer of Gate IO — a cryptocurrency based in Virginia — told Cointelegraph that this signals a huge validation, adding:“During Q1 and Q2, the correlation has been rising, reaching prominent peaks, close to 50% and 60%, since the coronavirus outbreak. In these times of uncertainty during the pandemic, with significant inflation hovering over the world, people are looking for a safe-haven asset.”In addition to being correlated to gold, Bitcoin is often compared with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the United States dollar and even the VIX volatility index. Yet, in spite of oil being the highest-traded commodity on the market, no correlations can be drawn between West Texas Intermediate and BTC.This is due to the high supply of oil and it being considered a bountiful, inexpensive resource. This was demonstrated recently during the pandemic, when oil prices dropped to negative and investors were being paid just to store the oil. Tatibouet elaborated on why the S&P 500 is often used as a benchmark for price correlation with Bitcoin:“The correlation between the coin and the S&P has been more significant throughout the years than between the digital asset and gold. At the same time, gold and BTC seem to have a more parallel relationship, but BTC–S&P 500 interaction happens differently, which moves more cyclically most of the time. When BTC price drops, the correlation with the stock market index grows, and as BTC price bounces back, their correlation diminishes.”In both long- and short-term correlation metrics, Bitcoin seems to have a higher correlation with the S&P 500 index than gold, with a one-year correlation of 0.36, while gold’s is at 0.08.In comparison to gold, Bitcoin is often perceived to be more risky due to its higher volatility, lesser liquidity and lower levels of adoption by governments and institutions in comparison to gold, which has been one of the most highly commoditized assets in the markets historically. Vinokourov elaborated on Bitcoin’s price volatility in relation to risk:“Bitcoin’s propensity to undergo parabolic price runs, as well as flash crashes for that matter, is a bigger risk to its perceived notion of being a store of value asset than price volatility. After all, it is said that volatility is an inverse gauge of liquidity. [...] Any asset can be subjected to excessive volatility, it is how market participants, including the liquidity providers react to price discovery vacuums and other risks that ultimately matters.”Agreeing that gold is historically the more stable asset, Tatibouet elaborated that “when it comes to hedging, BTC is more effective in the short term, especially against the agitated markets.” In addition, she pointed out that “gold’s returns are lower than Bitcoin ones, making the digital gold a lot more attractive despite its risky aspects.”In the current bull run that has taken Bitcoin into the $12,300 range, several traditional assets and commodities could establish price relationships with Bitcoin. However, investors would need to be wary of macro economic events impacting these correlations."
658,"The creator of arguably the most famous Bitcoin (BTC) price forecasting tool has declared that the largest cryptocurrency is in a bull market.In a tweet on Aug. 18, quantitative analyst PlanB — creator of the stock-to-flow series of Bitcoin price models — said that with a relative strength index (RSI) of 64, the bull market was “confirmed.”RSI is used to determine whether Bitcoin is overbought — or oversold — at a specific price point.Current behavior mimics that of previous halving cycles, with 2012 and 2016 both seeing solid RSI scores accompany a price run shortly after the halving event itself.“#Bitcoin looking strong, RSI 64, bull market confirmed,” PlanB wrote.Bitcoin RSI historical chart.

As analyst Mati Greenspan noted, the value is now at its lowest in two years.Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe further described the index as “the actual reason of Bitcoin’s and Gold’s strength.”Continuing, gold bug Peter Schiff gave a dire outlook for the dollar.“The U.S. dollar's slow bleed continues, with the Dollar Index breaking below 92.50 for the 1st time since May 2018,” he tweeted.“Once the Jan. low is breached (4 handles lower), a larger wound will open and the blood loss will accelerate. Once it breaks the 2008 low the dollar will bleed out.”The Federal Reserve is widely tipped to demand higher inflation going forward, something that commentators previously said would be extremely bullish for safe havens."
659,"Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, is collaborating with law enforcement authorities in Ukraine to take down some large-scale money laundering schemes.Working with the exchange, Ukraine’s cyber police identified and arrested a group of criminals involved in a $42 million ransomware and money laundering operation, Binance told Cointelegraph in a criminal investigation report on Aug. 18.According to the report, the criminal group has been laundering millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies since 2018. A Binance representative said that the suspects were all Ukranian nationals, and were arrested in June 2020.According to Binance, the group was primarily operating in Ukraine but was also involved in several cyber attacks on a global scale. The spokesperson denied to provide additional details about the size of the group, or other individuals and entities involved.The successful criminal investigation comes soon after Binance began cooperating with Ukrainian law enforcement in early 2020.The investigation is part of Binance’s so-called “Bulletproof Exchangers” project that aims to track down transactions between Binance and high-risk entities.Investigations of this kind are primarily conducted by Binance’s internal risk intelligence unit known as Binance Sentry as well as an analytics arm, the Security Data Science division.Alongside Ukraine, Binance handles law enforcement requests from numerous jurisdictions across the globe, the exchange representative noted. As reported, Binance was involved in a similar investigation in the United Kingdom in September 2019. The exchange said that Binance helped British prosecutors investigate an online fraud that caused $51 million in losses to victims.Binance’s efforts to help Ukraine combat local crypto crimes comes against the backdrop of an established cooperation between the exchange and the former Soviet republic. In late 2019, Binance signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation to help Ukraine develop crypto-related legislation. According to a report by major crypto analytics firm Chainalysis, Binance and Huobi exchange received more than 52% of all illicit Bitcoin (BTC) transfers in 2019, with Binance itself accounting for more than 27% of the total."

Similarly, the second rally also saw the percentage of bought vs sold BTC rise before the price, again suggesting buyers were proactively pushing the price up.”The U.S. stock market has risen in the past two days due to optimism towards the performance of “Big Tech.” The stocks of Tesla, Alphabet, and Amazon increased by 11.2%, 0.77%, and 1.09%, respectively, buoying tech-heavy indices like the Nasdaq.Pre-market data show the U.S. stock market awaits a slight gain at market open, with the Dow Jones and Nasdaq both set up for 54-point and 37-point gains.The price of Bitcoin is continuing to go up in tandem with the stock market, but some analysts are cautious about September. Historical data shows that September is typically the worst-performing month for Bitcoin.If both the U.S. stock market and Bitcoin retrace, like gold, cryptocurrency analyst Edward Morra suggested that market turbulence might emerge. He wrote:“If BTC and SPX will resolve like Gold did - then decent correction for BTC is in September, for SPX - November. For BTC - September is usually the worst months histrionically, for SPX - elections in November so might cause some turbulence.”For now, the confluence of a simultaneous rally between Bitcoin and stocks and the noticeable increase in buying demand is buoying the sentiment around Bitcoin."

662,"21Shares, formerly known as Amun, now has $100 million in assets under management, or AUM, posting major growth in 2020.Hany Rashwan, CEO of 21Shares, told Cointelegraph on Aug. 17 that AUM volumes spiked about 164% this year, up from just $39 million in early January. According to the exec, 21Shares hit its $100 million milestone on Aug. 14, with the company’s AUM reaching a threshold of $101.6 million last Friday.According to Rashwan, 21Shares’ AUM surge has come in response to an increased demand for crypto investment services in Switzerland; the firm is one of the largest providers for crypto Exchange Traded Products, or ETPs. To date, 21Shares’ ETP offering is composed of 11 various ETPs like Crypto Basket Index ETP, 21Shares Bitcoin, and 21Shares Ethereum.Rashwan said that the overall spike in crypto prices is not the biggest reason for his company’s success:“From the start of the year, AUM is up around 164%.

663,"As Bitcoin gets more support from first-time investors, its market capitalization has risen past Bank of America’s market valuation, putting the leading cryptocurrency within striking distance of PayPal’s.According to AssetDash data at the time of writing, Bitcoin’s (BTC) current market cap sits just over $226 billion, having risen 3.2% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bank of America’s market cap has fallen more than 2% today to $224.4 billion. This bullish behavior from Bitcoin and slight drop in BoA means the analytics site ranks BTC as the 25th most valuable asset by market capitalization, just behind PayPal at $230 billion.However, Bank of America was not the only fiat-based institution to fall behind the crypto asset today, which reached a yearly high of $12,470. FiatMarketCap, a site that tracks BTC’s rise against major fiat currencies, states that Bitcoin’s market cap now puts it ahead of that of the New Zealand dollar.Bitcoin is now ahead of the site’s estimate for the total number of NZD in circulation at 346.4 billion, or roughly $227 billion. This would make Bitcoin the 34th most valuable of all fiat currencies.Bitcoin’s price has grown substantially in 2020 as the Federal Reserve has pushed many controversial measures to lessen the economic impact of the pandemic, prompting prominent figures in finance to consider crypto for the first time.While billionaire Warren Buffett has made his feelings on cryptocurrencies well known, saying they “basically have no value,” others such as Morgan Creek Digital’s Jason Williams have predicted that Buffett’s multinational conglomerate holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, could invest in Bitcoin soon. Williams said that “young managers and analysts” at the firm would make the decision to buy BTC, even if Buffett were unaware of their actions.Buffett isn’t the only billionaire to potentially consider crypto as a way to hedge his bets in this economy. Paul Tudor Jones, the founder of hedge fund Tudor Investment Corporation, is also still bullish on Bitcoin since revealing the crypto asset was part of his portfolio in May.  Another possible new face to the crypto world is Barstool Sports founder, Dave Portnoy, who recently spoke with Gemini exchange founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. With the assistance of the twin brothers, Portnoy purchased $200,000 in Bitcoin and $50,000 in Chainlink (LINK), some of his first crypto purchases."

However, evidence suggests that the mining equipment had been there for more than a year.CEZ Deputy Director Philip Yordanov said this was “the largest theft” of electricity the utilities firm had ever discovered. The amount stolen was enough to power the neighboring township for roughly a month.The two men were detained by police for 24 hours before being released to await trial.Unscrupulous crypto miners in many countries have attempted to siphon power off the network as more become aware of the profitability of tokens.One of the largest thefts occurred in China in July 2019, when 22 suspects were arrested after reportedly being involved in an illegal crypto mining farm using $3 million in stolen electricity. Police confiscated 4,000 mining rigs at nine different factories.Russian authorities have also attempted to crack down on Bitcoin miners stealing power. In June, police arrested a 30-year-old miner accused of stealing nearly $500,000 in electricity from the state power network. Another suspect and his nine alleged accomplices were arrested in March in a similar incident involving the theft of $200,000 in electricity every month to mine crypto."

They do not care about you and me and our kids. They care about November and getting re-elected. So, all sorts of good things will keep happening and the markets will be ok for a while…”Rogers revealed that he owns gold, silver, and is still confident in agriculture. He also said he would bet on transportation, airlines, tourism, and other industries which have been severely affected by the pandemic:“I bought a shipping company in Russia last week, and a wine company in China last week. Some of these things have been really beaten down and probably even if the bear market hits again, they are probably not going to go down much I hope.”In a previous interview, Rogers said that he wished he had invested in Bitcoin during the technology’s early days.

Source: TradingViewThis bullish setup has a pattern target of $13,702.55, which is just below the June 26, 2019 high at $13,973.50. If the price reaches this level, it may act as a stiff resistance.Currently, both moving averages are rising, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the overbought zone, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand.If the bulls fail to sustain the price above $12,113.50, Bitcoin's price could drop to the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) ($11,457). A break below this support will be the first indication that momentum has weakened.Ether (ETH) has been sustaining above the $415.634 level for the past few days, which is a positive sign. This suggests that the bulls are not waiting for a deeper correction to buy.ETH/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf the bulls can sustain the price above $444.15, the uptrend is likely to resume. The next target is the $480–$500 zone. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought zone suggest that the trend favors the bulls.Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below $415.634, a drop to the 20-day EMA ($387) is possible. If the ETH/USD pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again attempt to resume the uptrend.A break below the 20-day EMA will be the first sign of weakening momentum and a break below $366 could tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.XRP has picked up momentum after breaking out of the falling wedge pattern on Aug. 14. The bulls will now try to push the price above the $0.326113–$0.346727 overhead resistance zone.XRP/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf they succeed, a rally to $0.40 is possible. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the overbought territory indicates advantage to the bulls.However, if the pair turns down from the overhead resistance zone, then the XRP/USD pair could remain range-bound for a few more days.A breakdown below the 20-day EMA ($0.28) will be the first sign of weakness. The trend will turn in favor of the bears if the pair plummets below $0.268478.Chainlink's LINK continues to be in a strong uptrend. Since the start of this leg of the up move on July 30, the altcoin has not corrected for three days in a row, which shows that the bulls are buying on every minor dip.LINK/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe sharp rally of the past few days has pushed the RSI above the 80 levels, which suggests that the LINK/USD pair is heavily overbought in the near term. However, this alone is not a reason to fall because in May 2019 the RSI topped out close to 90.If the bulls push the price above $20.1111, the uptrend can extend to $21.60 and then to $24.18. However, vertical rallies usually witness waterfall declines. Hence, traders should be careful not to be swayed by greed.On the downside, a break below $16 could be the first sign that momentum has weakened.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has broken out of the downtrend line, which invalidates a developing descending triangle pattern. The 20-day EMA ($292) is sloping up, and the RSI has risen close to the overbought zone, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand.BCH/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe bulls will now try to push the price to $326.30 and then to $353. A breakout of this resistance is likely to result in a rally to $410 and then to $430.However, if the bears defend the overhead resistance at $353, the BCH/USD pair might extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.The trend will turn in favor of the bears if the pair turns down and breaks below the $280 support.Litecoin (LTC) picked up momentum after breaking above the descending channel on Aug. 15. The bulls are currently attempting to push the price above the overhead resistance at $65.1573.LTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($57) has started to slope up once again, and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, which suggests that the bulls are again back in the driver’s seat.A breakout and close (UTC time) above $65.1573 is likely to start the next leg of the up move to $80 and then to $84.However, if the LTC/USD pair turns down from the current levels, it could drop to the 20-day EMA. A break below this support could sink the price to $51.Bitcoin SV (BSV) broke above the downtrend line on Aug. 15, but the bulls have not been able to pick up momentum, which shows a lack of demand at higher levels. The altcoin is currently facing resistance at $227.BSV/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewHowever, a minor positive is that the bulls have not allowed the BSV/USD pair to slip below the 20-day EMA ($217). If the bulls can push the price above $227, a rally to $260.86 is likely. A breakout of this resistance could extend the rally to $320.Conversely, if the pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the 20-day EMA, a drop to $200 is possible. A break below this support will shift the advantage in favor of the bears.Cardano (ADA) remains range-bound between the $0.13–$0.15 zone, which suggests a balance between supply and demand. It is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout, hence traders should wait for the price to make a decisive move before entering any trades.ADA/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe 50-day SMA is sloping up, which suggests that the medium-term trend remains in favor of the bulls.

The next target to watch out for is $0.20.If the bears defend the overhead resistance at $0.1543051, the ADA/USD pair could extend its stay inside the range.A breakdown and close (UTC time) below $0.13 will signal the possible start of a deeper correction to the $0.11–$0.10 support zone.The bulls are attempting to push EOS above the overhead resistance at $3.8811, but the bears are defending this level aggressively.Both moving averages have turned up, and the RSI is in the overbought zone, suggesting advantage to the bulls.EOS/USD daily chart.

There is a minor resistance at $4.40 and again at $4.60, but both these are likely to be crossed.However, if the EOS/USD pair turns down from the current levels, a minor consolidation or correction is possible. The momentum might weaken if the bears sink the pair below the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $3.4052.Binance Coin (BNB) is facing resistance in the $22.93–$24.4588 resistance zone; however, the positive sign is that the bulls have managed to keep the price above $22.93 for the past two days.BNB/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe moving averages are sloping up, and the RSI is in the positive zone, suggesting advantage to the bulls. Above $24.4588, a rally to $27.1905 is possible.

668,"Anthony Pompliano believes that by the end of 2029, the market capitalization of Bitcoin (BTC) will be higher than that of gold.Source: Twitter.The Morgan Creek Digital co-founder’s tweet provoked a reply from Peter Schiff:“By 2029 you'll be lucky if the market cap of #Bitcoin still exceeds the market cap of a baseball cap.”This only led to Pompiliano doubling down on his prediction. He responded to Schiff, saying that he was trying to be conservative:“[I] Think approximately a decade is rather conservative, so trying to account for many things that could possibly happen to slow growth.”The current market capitalization of Bitcoin stands at $227 billion, while gold’s cap is about $9 trillion. That means that gold’s market cap is roughly 40 times higher than Bitcoin’s at time of writing. It was not clear from the tweet whether Pompiliano meant that Bitcoin’s cap would be higher than the current capitalization of gold, or the cap he expected gold to hold by 2029.In conversation with Cointelegraph, Pompliano clarified:“In 2029, the bitcoin market cap will be bigger than gold when they’re compared side by side.”Bitcoin’s road towards overtaking gold has a number of potential paths. On one hand, both assets could grow in value, with Bitcoin growing much faster. Alternatively, Bitcoin could continue to gain value, while gold begins to depreciate. If it follows the first path, Bitcoin’s capitalization by 2029 would have to be above the $9 trillion mark. In the second case, Bitcoin could potentially be below this mark while still exceeding gold’s market cap.Either way, this would be quite an achievement for a store-of-value asset that was created a mere ten years ago."
669,"Demand for Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) has been growing tremendously in the last few weeks, with more than 23,100 WBTC ($274 million) currently in circulation.According to data from FlipsideCrypto, a digital asset data provider, more than half of the WBTC was minted in the past month as the decentralized finance sector saw record growth.Net wBTC supply since launch. Source: Flipside CryptoLaunched in 2019, WBTC is an ERC-20 token that is pegged to the price of Bitcoin (BTC). It allows users to seemingly transfer Bitcoin to the Ethereum network and interact with smart contracts.To get WBTC, users must go to an authorized merchant who will hold the user’s BTC and exchange it for WBTC tokens. Merchants can mint and burn WBTC tokens as needed.The growing demand for WBTC shows that Bitcoin users are looking for high-yield options to hold Bitcoin. According to a recent report by Genesis, a digital currency prime broker, institutional clients are also showing similar interest.While there is growing interest in WBTC, its growth is also inflated by the yield farming phenomenon, as more than half of all WBTC in circulation is currently locked in DeFi lending protocol Compound.WBTC is by far the most popular Bitcoin-backed token used on the Ethereum network, but it is also a centralized option that requires users to go through a Know Your Customer procedure and to use a third-party custodian service. For some potential users, this raises privacy and censorship concerns.While institutional interest around DeFi has been growing and even central banks are beginning to get involved, many users are individuals who may want to stay anonymous while using WBTC.As such, the demand for renBTC, a decentralized and anonymous alternative to Wrapped Bitcoin, has been surging as well.WBTC and renBTC net supply since launch. Source: Flipside CryptoRenBTC is similar to wBTC but it features trustless storage for the Bitcoin being locked. This allows users to fully own their asset and remain anonymous in the process.While not all DeFi protocols accept renBTC, this token can also be exchanged for WBTC and used to access DeFi protocols like Compound that only accept the latter.According to Flipside Crypto, 19% of all new addresses using WBTC in August bought it through renBTC. This shows that privacy can indeed be a driving factor for more growth in the DeFi sector.Purchase amount for first acquisition of BTC on Ethereum. Source: Flipside CryptoAs DeFi continues to grow, new security issues are arising. Not only have several DeFi protocols been subject to hacks and malfunctions, but the growth of yield farming itself could have consequences to the tokens involved with each platform.For example, currently, more than 50% of all DAI is locked in Compound, which can disrupt its peg with the dollar. In the case of WBTC, more than half of its supply is locked in Compound as well. The continuance of this trend could easily bring liquidity issues for the tokens at hand.Even more concerning is the fact that the Ethereum network is becoming increasingly bogged down by network congestion and high fees.While it seems that the future for DeFi and all its related parts is limitless, the nascent sector requires a strong foundation to stand on.At the moment, the cornerstone is the Ethereum network, but the question is: Can it sustain the growing number of smart contracts and demands being placed upon it?"

After a few weeks of consolidation, the price of Bitcoin finally broke the resistance zone of $12,000.However, it’s uncertain whether the price will continue moving upward to $15,000 from here. Is the upside move a clear breakout or a fake-out intended to grab overhead liquidity?Crypto market daily performance. Source: Coin360As Bitcoin’s price broke through the crucial resistance at $12,000, a massive move was expected to occur. However, the market failed to provide one.BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe daily chart is showing a definite breakthrough of the final hurdle before bull market expansion. However, the move above $12,000 is not convincing enough to state and confirm the breakout.One of the critical indicators for a breakout is the surge of volume, which is lagging heavily in this recent push.The good part is that Bitcoin is still acting above the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which supports the current bullish momentum.An apparent gain of this level, through which support is granted on $12,000, would justify and confirm further upward momentum of Bitcoin.BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewQuite often, a breakout like this leads toward a fake-out. A fake-out is justified by a similar move. In such a related move, the liquidity is taken above the recent highs or resistances.Usually, when someone shorts, they place their stop-loss above the recent high. This grants a very obvious “liquidity pool” as all the obvious stop-losses are placed above this resistance high.Therefore, a move slightly above the recent high can trigger all those stop/losses, fueling a move in the opposite direction, as the chart shows as an example.The crucial barrier remains to be seen with the $12,000 level. If that level doesn’t grant support, a similar move toward the range lows is likely to occur.As discussed earlier, a fake-out is always a possibility when the price is testing a strong overhead resistance.BTC/USD bearish scenario 3-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe crucial part is defined in the red box as that’s the previous resistance zone through such a fake-out. This resistance zone got broken through in the recent move and has to sustain support if the price of Bitcoin wants to continue surging.If the price of Bitcoin can’t find support on this resistance level at $12,000, the support/resistance flip can’t be justified and the price of Bitcoin drops back in the range.The key support level to watch is the $11,500 area, as this is an untested level and previous range low. If the price of Bitcoin breaks back in the range between $11,500 and $12,000, it’s likely to be testing the exact opposite of the range.In this case, we can define the exact opposite of $11,500. More likely would be a further continuation of range-bound movements in the coming weeks, which would suit altcoins even more.BTC/USD 4-hour bullish scenario chart. Source: TradingViewThe bullish scenario is similarly relying on the $12,000 barrier, as in this case, the support should be warranted on $12,000 to justify continuation.If the $12,000 level continues to hold for support and a support/resistance flip is warranted, further continuation upward is likely to expect.In such a way, altcoins will start bleeding heavily in their BTC pairs, as BTC retakes the spotlight. The next resistance zone for Bitcoin is defined at $13,000, but a further surge towards the $15,000–$17,000 zones is on the tables.However, it’s all coming down toward the $12,000 level.

He will buy #Bitcoin soon.Williams was referring to the most recent changes to the portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway, where Buffett is chairman and CEO. Fortune reported on Aug. 14 that the firm sold bank stocks alongside airline stocks and bought Barrick Gold, a Canada-based mining company whose stock price is correlated with that of gold.Berkshire Hathaway sold Goldman Sachs stock, alongside cutting its position in JPMorgan Chase by 61% and selling some of its Wells Fargo and PNC holdings. The report suggests that Buffett may be anticipating increasing loan defaults caused by the coronavirus-related economic downturn, which could affect banks and their stock prices.As Cointelegraph reported in May 2018, Buffett has been rather negative about cryptocurrencies as a whole. Notably, he said that Bitcoin is ""probably rat poison squared.”While Buffett's past comments about crypto make his direct investment in Bitcoin seem rather unlikely, Williams believes that his multinational conglomerate holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, is likely to buy the coin:“It’s the young managers and analysts that push the gold trade and BTC trade. He won’t even know it when it happens.”As Cointelegraph reported on May 15, Max Keiser — the founder of Heisenberg Capital and an early Bitcoin investor — suggested that Buffett’s investment in gold could push Bitcoin’s price to $50,000. He suggested that positive sentiment around gold implies a higher valuation for Bitcoin:“Global $100 trillion fund management biz is less than 1% invested in Gold. With Buffett now moving into Gold.

Meanwhile, total spot volumes have decreased by 0.5% to $639.1bn. As a result, derivatives have continued to gain market share and represented 41% of the market in July (vs 38% in June).”The trend demonstrates the growing demand for cryptocurrency futures and options contracts, which are typically sought out by professional and full-time traders.The data could be analyzed in two contrasting ways. It could mean that there is an overall increase in demand for Bitcoin from traders or the market is reaching an overheated territory. When the futures market becomes the primary catalyst of the Bitcoin market, it can increase the chances of a major spike in volatility. Since futures contracts are leveraged, and top-tier exchanges provide up to 100x leverage, the chances of a long squeeze could increase if the spot market is not sufficiently complementing the futures volume.For now, the researchers explained that the spot market volume is climbing in tandem, albeit at a slower rate. The researchers noted:“Spot volumes have picked up again towards the end of July amid the current market bull run. Following the July update to CryptoCompare’s Exchange Benchmark Ranking, the data shows that higher risk exchanges have generally dwindled in volumes, as users begin shifting to lower risk (Top-Tier) exchanges.”Whether the spot volume and general mainstream awareness are sufficiently high to catalyze a Bitcoin price breakout above a major resistance level at $12,500 remains uncertain.The weekly chart of Bitcoin.

He continued: “I definitely don't think that we discovered any fundamental flaws that make it impossible, and I do think it will be finished. It's just a matter of time, and it's actually been progressing quite quickly lately.”Speaking candidly about how he expects the project to develop, Buterin added that it’s likely some Ethereum applications may fail, while others succeed. But he sees these ebbs and flows in the project’s multiple aspects as being independent of each other:“If Ethereum tries to get into one space and it turns out it's actually not useful for that space, then fine, you know, those applications will not go anywhere. Meanwhile, the other sectors will keep going,” he said.Earlier in the podcast, Samson Mow criticized Ethereum proponents for purportedly shifting the narrative around the project’s ambitions and goals, arguing that “It's okay to pivot and evolve, but there needs to be a healthy disclaimer that this thing is experimental.""Mow continued to claim that “A lot of the Ethereum people are saying Ethereum is money now and whatnot, and now it's competing with Bitcoin. [...] Even I'm not sure what Ethereum is, or what it does, or what it competes with. Is it a world computer? Or is it money?”Responding to this, Buterin hit back strongly against the notion that Ethereum is reducible to money and said that non-financial applications have been an integral part of the project since its beginning: “I definitely did not initiate the whole Ether is money thing, the Ethereum Foundation did not initiate it. That's something that really did come from the outside.”"
676,"Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week at the upper end of its new price range near $12,000 — will the market finally crack it this week?Cointelegraph takes a look at five things to consider when working out where Bitcoin is headed in the coming days. Unlike previous weeks, macro markets and their impact on Bitcoin are back in the spotlight on Monday.China leads the way, with its stocks rallying to near their highest levels in two years on news that the People’s Bank of China, or PBoC, is planning to ease monetary policy.The Shanghai Composite Index rose 2.3% on the day, with year-to-date gains sitting at 13% despite the coronavirus turmoil.Elsewhere, the S&P 500 is already up over 50% versus its March crash lows, with Goldman Sachs analysts revising their end-of-year forecast upwards. The target is now 3,600 points, not 3,000 — a new record high.Even at publishing time, the index was just 14 points away from the all-time highs it had seen in February before coronavirus hit.

Source: SkewWithin Bitcoin, market sentiment is facing a hurdle of its own. $12,000, a level that has seen several retests over the past two weeks but failed to become support, continues to cause traders problems. Recent price action has underscored the fact that $12,000 does not have the appeal to crack as resistance. “We are still in an uptrend so I should lean on the side of bullish,” said Cointelegraph Markets analyst filbfilb on Aug. 13 in his Telegram channel. He also considers altcoins moving higher as BTC price stays sideways a bullish sign particularly after “price action showed a big bounce out of demand,” he explained. “Lots of wicks.” Over the weekend, meanwhile, fellow analyst Michaël van de Poppe suggested that the repulsion of $12,000 was strong enough to spark a more pronounced retracement for BTC/USD. A bounce off support at $10,500 was “very likely,” he argued before strength appeared to climb higher and finally flip $12,000 to support.“Given the significance of this level, I'm starting to think this is becoming a very likely scenario,” Van de Poppe told Twitter followers. “However, a clear break and flip of $12K are continuations towards $13K and possibly $15-17K area.”BTC/USD price chart showing possible $10,500 retrace and reversal.

Beyond price features, Bitcoin is looking stronger than ever under the hood. On Monday, Bitcoin’s network hash rate was sitting at all-time highs of 129 exahashes per second (EH/s).Hash rate refers to the overall computing power that miners have dedicated to validating the blockchain and processing transactions. The metric is an estimate rather than a hard-and-fast measurement, with the all-time highs concerning the seven-day average hash rate. Miner behavior changes and impacts the estimate, and hash rate therefore fluctuates. Last week, additional concerns surfaced after one mining pool suddenly sent 800 BTC to exchange Binance — potentially in advance of a sale.Nonetheless, the latest numbers serve to show that miner sentiment remains strong. Network difficulty, arguably the most important signal for determining Bitcoin’s immediate health, is also set to increase at its next adjustment in six days’ time. That will also deliver a new all-time high.As Cointelegraph has reported, a popular theory suggests that sustained strength in network fundamentals subsequently triggers an advance in price. Bitcoin 7-day average hash rate. Source: BlockchainOne factor — or rather a basket of them — is triggering a warning this week. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which uses multiple sources to calculate an impression of investor sentiment, continues to sound the alarm over excessive “greed” among hodlers.On Monday, the Index sat at 84/100, just three points off its all-time high of 87 from June 2019. Derived from the Fear & Greed Index for traditional markets, the metric aims to suggest when volatility up or down may ensue.Specifically, the higher zone in which the Index currently resides means a significant change that the market is “due for a correction.”In late March, by contrast, the Index hit lows of 8/100 as investors were “too worried” over Bitcoin’s strength after the cross-asset crash two weeks previously.Crypto Fear & Greed Index as of Aug. 17, 2020.

Bitcoin and gold may prove to have a stronger correlation in 2020 as many investors turn away from traditional finance during the Federal Reserve’s and other central banks’ response to the pandemic.

678,"Edward Snowden may be able to return to the United States if Donald Trump chooses to grant the whistleblower a presidential pardon.According to an Aug. 15 report from Reuters, Trump said he was “going to start looking at” a possible pardon for the whistleblower, who has been living in asylum in Russia since he left the U.S. in 2013. The comments came shortly after Trump told The Post “a lot of people” think that Snowden “is not being treated fairly.”In a Twitter response to Trump’s comments, Snowden said:“The last time we heard a White House considering a pardon was 2016, when the very same Attorney General who once charged me conceded that, on balance, my work in exposing the NSA's unconstitutional system of mass surveillance had been ‘a public service.’”Under Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution, a sitting president has the power to grant reprieves and pardons “for offenses against the United States.” Snowden still faces federal charges for violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and theft of government property. Should the U.S. president invoke this authority, it would make the former National Security Agency contractor the 26th person Trump has pardoned since taking office in January 2017.From exile in Russia, Snowden has often expressed his opinions on Bitcoin (BTC), even voicing concerns over its blockchain as “devastatingly public.” The servers Snowden used back in 2013 to leak thousands of documents to journalists were reportedly paid for using Bitcoin. In addition, the whistleblower said he “felt like buying Bitcoin” during the March downturn when the price of the coin dropped to $3,782.In 2019, Snowden had hinted he might turn to crypto in order to circumvent the U.S. government‘s attempt to restrict his access to profits from the publication of his book, Permanent Record.

680,"David Puell, an on-chain analyst, laid out several key data points on Aug. 16 based on the past 4-year cycle of Bitcoin (BTC). Data show that the $14,000 level is a crucial price point for Bitcoin due to whale clusters.According to Puell, whale clusters show many large buyers bought in the $9,000 to $12,000 range. Whales that bought at $9,000 are seeing relatively high profits, and those that bought the top are at a breakeven point.The clusters could result in a volatile price action where buyers and sellers aggressively try to break out from the $12,000 to $14,000 price range. Whale clusters on top of a weekly Bitcoin price chart. Source: David PuellThe data support arguments for both a pullback and a continuation. If whales bought at $9,000 and $12,000, they have a compelling reason to take profit in the $12,000 to $14,000 range. They have seen some profits and/or are at breakeven after months of stagnation.On the flip side, if the whales are in profit and are at breakeven, they might want to see the rally continue. Puell said that he expects an accumulation phase to occur in the $10,000 region following BTC’s move to $12,000 or $14,000. He said:“Finally, unspent whale clusters confirm a great battle taking place. Two actors at play: top buyers at 12k-14k reaching their breakeven price, and current buyers active after the first higher high in over a year. If we get a correction, it will most likely result in another major cluster of re-accumulation at the 10k area (as expected from the volume profile before); if we breakout, well... enjoy the ride.”The current landscape of the Bitcoin market is unique when compared with previous cycles. Puell said that due to macro factors, including the pandemic, Bitcoin saw unprecedented price movements.For instance, on March 13, the price of Bitcoin dropped to as low as $3,596 on BitMEX in a 50% drop overnight. The unusual price movements Bitcoin saw throughout 2020 as a result of unexpected external variables increase the chances of an uncommon price cycle. Puell explained:“Looking only a year and a half back, we had some of the most interesting market structures in any Bitcoin cycle. During several attempts at a ‘typical’ bullish trend with a strong halving narrative, two swans hit price discovery one after the other: PlusToken and COVID-19.”In the short to medium-term, there are several variables that could have an impact on the price trend of Bitcoin. In recent months, Bitcoin saw some correlation with gold, possibly due to the uncertainty in global markets causing investors to consider alternative stores of value. The low-interest rate policies by central banks across the world and the rapidly growing money supply will likely have a positive effect on Bitcoin price as well, many analysts believe."
681,"The rapid growth of the decentralized finance space, the rise in demand, the improvement of its protocols, and the breadth of offered services and opportunities will provide retail users with the options they are sorely lacking in the existing financial system. And it will enable institutions to move real-world assets onto the blockchain, generating untold cost-savings and improved efficiencies.But it doesn’t have to be a violent revolution. DeFi doesn’t necessarily need to overthrow the incumbent system. I believe that DeFi will complement traditional finance, force it to do better, and, more importantly, allow for financial inclusion of the world’s 1.7 billion unbanked at last.At OKEx, we have been following the growth of DeFi with keen interest. Despite our main product being a centralized Bitcoin (BTC) exchange, we believe that the two ecosystems can coexist. We believe that there is a place for the traditional financial system alongside Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, so there will be a need for centralized exchanges. Yet, the panorama is certainly beginning to shift.Major exchanges have been moving their focus to a new area: the public chain. And, unlike our competitors, at OKEx, our vision is for OKChain to be fully decentralized and not to be just an extension of our core business. We believe there is a need, indeed, a responsibility, for all of those who can contribute to the growth of the burgeoning DeFi space.Fiat-to-crypto exchanges will always be an important fiat currency deposit channel for the crypto world. However, as the recent incident with Wirecard has highlighted, they cannot be the only way to acquire more fiat on-ramps.One important and currently underused way of depositing fiat funds to crypto is through customer-to-customer trading. This way, retail customers can securely deposit funds with stablecoins in a completely decentralized manner. This is actually a better choice for many people, given the uncertain regulatory climate and, in some countries, it may even be people’s only gateway into crypto.C2C trading platforms are constantly improving yet, like everything in this nascent space, more work still needs to be done. Consumers need more education about the right stablecoin or token to use and how to choose a platform that offers security, a good user experience and trading depth. As improvements are made across the industry in this area, C2C trading will become the next essential fiat on-ramps for crypto and push adoption further.OKEx’s peer-to-peer trading platform in India is a prime example of such a step forward in P2P trading. Through the platform, users in India can buy Bitcoin, Tether (USDT) and other cryptocurrencies with the Indian rupee, using multiple payment methods, including credit/debit cards, PayPal, PhonePe, IMPS, UPI and more.India is a potentially huge market with a thriving population of 1.3 billion, of whom around 5 million currently own digital currencies. This shows great potential for growth. In addition, the combination of the Reserve Bank of India’s ban on cryptocurrency being lifted on March 4 and the widespread COVID-19 lockdowns has caused the crypto market in India to boom.The development in the DeFi space has been nothing short of arresting. We are proud to support its inevitable expansion as Ethereum transitions to Ethereum 2.0 and other innovative projects in the space start to hit records left and right. This is why the OKEx Bitcoin exchange jumped at the chance of being one of the first validators on the Topaz testnet for Ethereum 2.0 with our mining pool OK Pool.This is also why we have been listing some of the most important projects in DeFi, including MakerDAO, Compound, DMM, Synthetix, Aave, Aragon, Curve and Serum. In our opinion, beyond Ethereum, these are some of the most important pillars of the space, with MakerDAO and Compound vying to be the largest DeFi protocols with more than $2.2 billion worth of crypto assets currently locked up combined.For users around the world to be able to access loans, lend and earn interest on their crypto in P2P transactions is an achievement of untold magnitudes that will eventually change the lives of many people around the world. For the first time, people will be able to sidestep a bank and transact directly from their mobile phones. They can earn interest, access credit, start businesses, send their children to school and lead dignified lives. All of this will be made possible through decentralized finance.And it’s not just the promise of banking the unbanked or, rather, servicing the unbanked. The current financial system with its near-negative yield on people’s savings and the troublesome prospect of eroding their purchasing power doesn’t possess what DeFi could offer to everyone — the chance to earn real, meaningful interest on their savings. At last, people have access to the tools that the ultra-rich have had for centuries. They can make their money work for them and not the other way around. Through collaboration, innovation and persistence, we really can achieve the goal of #FinanceAll.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Jay Hao is a tech veteran and seasoned industry leader.

683,"Last week, the Bitcoin news was all about lift-off. This week, it’s all about the leveling off. Bitcoin ends the week around $11,400, a fall of about 2.7% over the last seven days. That drop included a correction of $700 in one day so the question now is whether the bullish moment has gone or will Bitcoin push on to $15,000? Its first mission will be to break the resistance at $12,000. Bitcoin failed to do that twice in ten days but consolidated after each failure, which some experts believe is evidence of a continued bull run. MicroStrategy, a publicly-traded business intelligence company, certainly hopes so. The firm has spent $250 million buying 21,454 Bitcoins to use as its primary reserve asset. MyCrypto and MyEtherWallet co-founder Taylor Monahan has some advice for MicroStrategy, and for anyone else wondering how to manage their investments during a bull run. Pick a few long term coins, she says, don’t risk more than 5 percent of your net worth and if you lose it all, don’t try to recoup your losses.If you are going to buy, though, make your purchase on Sunday night. According to new research, that’s when Bitcoin sees the highest returns, helped by low volumes and high volatility. It’s not just Bitcoin that’s doing well, though. The token sale for the NEAR Protocol DApp had to be postponed for a day after CoinList, the exchange hosting the offering, was overwhelmed by traders. Adam Back thinks those buyers should back off. Bitcoin is enough, he says, and Satoshi should stay hidden. One person who is being kept hidden, though, is Andrew Yang. The former presidential candidate and blockchain advocate isn’t included on the DNC speaker list. That could be a huge oversight. Grayscale, a cryptocurrency investment firm, is broadcasting an ad on CNBC, MSNBC, FOX and FOX Business, among others. The ads may do to crypto investing what Merrill Lynch’s 1948 New York Times did for the popularization of stock investing.One aspect of the blockchain that new investors will need to bear in mind is China’s dominance. China holds most of the world’s Bitcoin mining capacity, which could let Chinese miners take control with a 51% attack. Jameson Lopp, the co-founder and chief technical officer of Casa, isn’t concerned. Attackers couldn’t steal Bitcoins, he noted, and any attack would also lower the value of their own holdings. But threats don’t only come from China. India is the world’s capital of call center scams, and those scammers are also now targeting cryptocurrency investors. Don’t expect Google to protect us though. The company is struggling to weed out fraudulent ads from scammers. The ads lead to a cloned Uniswap page which then demands secret login information. At least one victim has lost $30,000 to the scam.Tor isn’t doing much better. A vulnerability in the secret, government-made browser might have let attackers steal Bitcoins from users. On the other hand, police have arrested a U.K. sheep farmer for allegedly trying to extort a supermarket chain. Nigel Wright is said to have told Tesco that he had contaminated baby food. He’d only reveal the location of the food in return for $1.8 million in Bitcoin. The farmer is reported to have been part of a group who felt that Tesco had underpaid them for goods. In better news, a new report explains how the recycling industry could benefit from the blockchain, and enterprises look toward public blockchains as the technology matures.And finally, John McAfee’s claim that he had been arrested in Norway for using a thong as a face mask was exaggerated.

684,"Former Prudential Securities chief executive and current chairman of Sanders Morris Harris George Ball sees Bitcoin as a safe haven for those looking for different investments. In an interview with Reuters on August 14, Ball admitted he was previously a “Bitcoin opponent” but, with the government participating in the financial markets, he’s seen the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. “I’ve never said it before, but I’ve always been a blockchain and Bitcoin opponent but if you look now, the government can’t stimulate the markets forever. The liquidity flood will end and sooner or later the government’s got to start paying for some of this stimulus, for some of the deficits, for some of the well-deserved, very smart subsidies that it is providing to people. Are they going to raise taxes that high or if not? Are they going to print money? If they print money that debases the currency and probably even things like TIPS, you know the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, can be corrupted. So the very wealthy investor or trader probably turns to Bitcoin or something like it as a staple.”Ball added Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies “becomes a very attractive either long-term, I want a safe haven for money, or a short-term speculative bet.” He also made a bold claim in the interview that many people will turn to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as investments “after Labor Day.” The reason for this investment rush to cryptocurrencies, Ball said, is that people want something that “can’t be undermined by the government.”Ball is just one of the many investors previously skeptical of cryptocurrencies that have changed their views in the past few months. Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said in December Bitcoin “can be a viable stable financial asset” if one sees art or gold as such. Bridgewater Associates Chief Investment Officer Ray Dalio, who still hasn’t formally thrown his weight into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, said the U.S. dollar might lose its attractiveness the more central banks drive asset ownership."
685,"Authorities recently took three men into custody following their alleged swindling of $226,000 in Hong Kong dollars from Bitcoin (BTC) ATMs in the territory. The apprehended male trio, ranging from age 26 to age 55, allegedly exploited six different Bitcoin ATM machines, manipulating them to cough up the Hong Kong dollar equivalent of roughly $30,000 U.S. dollars, an article from the South China Morning Post detailed on Aug. 15. The alleged robbers took the cash out across 11 transactions. Authorities think the three males in question reportedly make up part of a larger criminal operation, the South China Morning Post article said. Two crypto exchanges tipped authorities off to the nefarious activity prior to the arrests. Wilson Tam, superintendent of Hong Kong's cyber security and technology crime bureau, did not divulge the exact thievery methods used, although the bureau did provide the two affected ATM businesses with tips on increased security measures. ""It is the first time we came across fraud linked to bitcoin ATMs,"" Tam said, as reported by the South China Morning Post.  The number of Bitcoin ATMs in the world reached 8,000 in June 2020, while Bitcoin itself has gained further publicity as a viable asset over the course of the year, making the asset a logical target for attacks. "
686,"During times of international economic crisis, governments print money. This leads to inflation and investors subsequently stashing their investment capital in long-term, stable investments. Historically, that has meant gold, but in the current economic crisis, gold has been joined by another long-term store of value: Bitcoin (BTC).There are several good reasons for this. The United States Federal Reserve is handling the crisis terribly, and has responded to soaring unemployment numbers in the same way they always do: by printing money. Already, the dollar has lost 5% of its value, with predictions that this is only the beginning. The currency is expected to shed up to 20% in the next few years, according to analysts at Goldman.Alongside this devaluation has come another threat to investors: deflation. With the value of dollar assets dropping rapidly and the worst yet to come, investors are looking to Bitcoin as a hedge against deflation. This appears to be the primary reason why Bitcoin has retained its value despite woeful news in other parts of the economy.Are these investors correct, though? Can cryptocurrency act as a hedge against the dollar’s inflation? Let’s dive into it.For crypto investors accustomed to dealing with daily — or even hourly — market movements, it can sometimes be easy to forget about the macro-level trends that drive our economy. Inflation is one of these, and it’s useful to have a broad definition of the term before we look specifically at the role of crypto in beating it.Essentially (and as you might remember from Economics 101), inflation generally comes about because of a general decrease in the purchasing power of fiat money. Many things can cause this loss of purchasing power: foreign investors pouring out of a particular currency, or even investors attacking a currency. Most often, though, inflation is the result of an increase in money supply, like when the Fed unilaterally creates billions of dollars and sends out checks to millions of Americans, for instance.Deflation is the opposite. In deflationary scenarios, prices decrease as fiat currency increases in value relative to different goods and services. Again, there can be different causes for this, but it generally comes about due to tightly controlled fiscal policies, or technological innovation.The key point in these definitions is that inflation can only occur in fiat currencies — i.e., those not based on the market value of a tangible asset, but largely on confidence in growing gross domestic product. Since the Bretton Woods agreement of 1944, the latter has been the basis of the U.S. dollar’s value.Having a fiat currency gives governments a powerful degree of freedom when it comes to printing money, and supposedly when it comes to controlling inflation. However, when confidence in the government is low (as it is now), government spending programs can lead to inflation quickly getting out of control. In the 1970s, gold boomed because investors saw it as a hedge against the dollar’s rapid inflation.This is similar to what is happening now. The global COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to a massively inflationary monetary policy and aggressive expansion of money supply while prices in certain key areas such as food staples keep increasing due to supply shocks caused by lockdowns.In this environment, it’s no surprise that gold is booming. There is, after all, only a limited supply of gold on earth, and so its price cannot easily be affected by government policy. Some crypto currencies, however, are also booming — apparently for the same reason. Billionaire investors are therefore lining up to compare Bitcoin to gold. The reason why some forms of cryptocurrency can act as a hedge against inflation is precisely the same reason gold can: there is a limited supply. This is something that is often forgotten about by many, even those in the crypto space, but it’s worth remembering that many cryptocurrencies — and most notably, Bitcoin — are built with an inherent limit.The 21 million Bitcoin limit means that at a certain point, there should be fewer Bitcoins versus the demand for them, meaning that in terms of value, the price per unit should increase as the supply decreases. In addition, the fact that Bitcoin allows investors to limit their exposure to government surveillance networks means that, in this time of low confidence in government, many people are moving their investments away from the U.S. dollar and toward crypto in order to avoid inflation and government tomfoolery. In other words, the comparison with gold investments of previous crises seems pretty apt.But here’s the thing: It’s not completely clear that Bitcoin is, in fact, a deflationary asset. Or at least, not yet. While it is technically true that the supply of the currency is limited, we are nowhere near that limit, with most estimates putting the last Bitcoin to be mined in 2140. What this means, in practice, is that Bitcoin will be unable to act as a completely stable hedge against inflation for at least another 120 years.This might not matter that much, of course. One of the primary driving forces behind the rise of Bitcoin has been the combination of (relative) stability and (relative) variability that it affords. In this context, it’s heartening that investors now regard crypto as a stable hedge against an inflating U.S. dollar, but to regard crypto as merely a replacement for gold would be to miss the point: Cryptocurrency is far more than just a hedge.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

687,"Galaxy Digital CEO and known Bitcoin (BTC) proponent, Mike Novogratz, said he sees upcoming financial market difficulties if Democrats take the U.S. presidential bid in November. ""Electing Biden and Harris, as much as it's going to be great for the country, it's not going to be great for the market,"" Novogratz told Bloomberg in an Aug. 14 interview.

""The Democrats are going to be tougher on Wall Street in terms of the tax plan,"" he said, noting increased corporate, income and capital gains taxation.In the midst of answering other questions, Novogratz described mainstream markets at present as comparable to Bitcoin's exuberant 2017 ride, due to various measures, such as government spending. ""Everything is trading literally like Bitcoin in 2017, into a speculative frenzy,"" he said.Noting abnormally high company valuations seen stock prices, Novogratz added:Novogratz also touched on Bitcoin as a store of value — an extremely common tagline for the asset among crypto industry participants. The CEO explained he thinks Bitcoin, over the last year, has transitioned from people seeing it as a possible store of value, to a cemented position in that role. ""It's literally a downhill race from here as opposed to an uphill race,"" Novogratz said of Bitcoin gaining acceptance, noting mainstream institutions joining the game as of late. He added:Bitcoin has gained a significant amount of mainstream financial interest in 2020 alone, as hedge fund giant Paul Tudor Jones entered the asset alongside other developments.

688,"As the massive protests in Belarus continue after a controversial election that saw President Alexander Lukashenko extend his mandate, questions arose about how Belarus could deal with potential U.S. and European Union sanctions and how cryptos such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) could help bypass them.An article published by Russian outlet, RBC, suggested that using cryptocurrencies could not be an effective option for the Belarussian government to beat financial sanctions that may be imposed by the EU and Washington on Minsk. According to The Guardian, the EU is moving forward with sanctions against Belarus.   Valery Petrov, vice president of Market Development and Regulation for the Russian Association of the Crypto Industry and Blockchain, said in the article that the usage of cryptos is “a realistic option” to escape from sanctions. However, he clarifies, this is possible only “if it does not contradict external and internal legislation.”Belarus has been showing a crypto-friendly attitude, as the recent developments in the sector across the country prove that the industry represents a significant business opportunity.In May, Belarusian authorities said that they consider digital technology a top priority issue, and are preparing a digital economy resolution for the OSCE session in Berlin.Belarus has also drafted a bill in July that addresses high tech IT spheres, including blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, among others, in the hope of attracting international investment in technology that were once forbidden or seen as too risky.Petrov pointed to Venezuela and Iran’s case, as he says that the usage of cryptos to deal with economic crises or circumvent sanctions proves that cryptocurrencies are only a “palliative” solution.Even other experts such as Nikita Zuboreb, a Russian analyst at crypto exchange, Bestchange, believes it could be only a “band-aid” solution for an economy that could be profoundly hurt by the sanctions.However, he recalled that the IT infrastructure is “much more developed and prepared” than other countries and Lukashenko could still consider it an option."
689,"The power of blockchain technology to decentralize control of our financial economy is well documented. It is one of the cornerstones of the origins of the technology, with the genesis block of Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin (BTC) containing a reference to the 2008–2009 financial crisis: ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.""The message, although never explicitly outlined by Bitcoin’s creator, is from the headline of a London Times article dated Jan. 3, 2009 that details banks being bailed out by the British government. Bitcoin, according to Nakamoto, is a means of reforming this corrupt and inefficient financial system to create a fairer, more democratic system of financial governance. What, then, would Nakamoto say to the current state of the blockchain and crypto industry? Increasingly, it is institutions rather than individuals that appear to be garnering control of the means of production in the blockchain sector. Facebook’s announcement of plans for its digital payments platform, Libra, was the initial public icebreaker for many last summer. However, the reality is that many governments and incumbent institutions from a range of sectors — including the likes of Walmart, JPMorgan Chase and PayPal — have been quietly building blockchain operations and capabilities for several years now.The recent decision by the United States Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to allow nationally chartered banks in the U.S. to provide custody services for cryptocurrencies is another significant affirmation of the legitimacy of crypto, which is likely to spark a race among financial institutions to build or acquire secure custody solutions.Such centralization appears to be at odds with the vision of the fair, democratic system of finance envisioned by Nakamoto and the original cypherpunks. Critics decry the end of the decentralized blockchain utopia as governments and institutions adopt the technology — but the situation is far more complex than such a black and white reading allows. Rather than institutions being fundamentally antithetical to the democratic ideals of crypto, I would argue that they are actually essential to fulfilling such a vision. The entry of centralized institutions to the crypto economy cannot possibly represent in itself a blow to the values of crypto. While public trust in centralized institutions may be at a historical low in countries such as the U.S., such institutions are not by their nature inherently malevolent or corrupt. The same counterpoint applies to decentralized organizations: They do not make inherently trustworthy or morally responsible actors. Numerous scandals in the crypto industry involving wallet hacks, initial coin offering scams and dubious projects illustrate that often, this is anything but the case. Institutional adoption of blockchain can offer tremendous benefits to the blockchain ecosystem as a whole: It is a key step in the evolution of the sector, which can significantly scale up adoption from a limited cohort of tech-savvy users (limited in terms of gender, age range and location) to truly global demographic spanning markets that the fractured crypto industry is incapable of reaching in its current form.To be clear, decentralization and democratization is still the end goal here. Truly decentralized control often comes from the roots of centralization, and in order to reach this next phase in the sector, a period of centralization is first necessary.The same path is evident in that of the internet. A considerably decentralized service during its nascent phase in the 1990s, today a centralized control of web services by the likes of Google and Amazon has brought worldwide adoption. Increasingly, with legislation targeting the protection of user data and a growing public appetite for limiting the influence of large technology firms, a shift in the balance of power from institutions to individuals appears to be taking place.What will be key to a successful transition is bringing institutions into blockchain the right way. Interoperability should be a core component of such a transition. A diversity of protocols developed by different actors and institutions is a net positive for the market — but only if these protocols allow for some degree of system interoperability. By doing so, users and developers will be able to both innovate across protocols and choose new services to adopt with low barriers to entry. A considered, measured approach to adoption by institutions, as has been occurring, will also ease the transition by consolidating blockchain use cases. The distributed ledger technology sector has to date been overly obsessed with exploring every wildly conceivable use case for the technology, from Akon’s crypto city to commodifying time itself. Large enterprises and institutions will ensure that value-driven use cases become the standard for the technology rather than unnecessary, unfit importation into projects for the shallow purposes of raising capital or grabbing headlines. Already, concrete use cases are becoming more coherent, with payments an early candidate likely to succeed as exciting projects such as Libra, Celo and Polkadot are all firmly establishing themselves in the space.Institutional delivery of blockchain technology to a mass audience will see a new type of user engaging in the technology: one with little awareness, or even interest, in the technology. Such adoption will be a barometer of true success for the technology. Blockchain is one of a number of emerging technologies that society has at its disposal. When we finally stop talking about blockchain as a noteworthy aspect of a service in itself, we will know it has become an established part of the technology mainstream.Make no mistake: Institutional adoption of blockchain is here, and it’s here to stay. The question that remains is how we can ensure that this process of adoption preserves the democratic ethos of the technology for the masses.Doing so will be a challenge, certainly, but one that the blockchain sector is more than capable of meeting.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Konstantin Richter is the CEO and founder of Blockdaemon, a blockchain node infrastructure platform.

691,"In a major new partnership, Samsung has announced that the Samsung Blockchain Wallet will be integrated with Gemini, a New York-based crypto exchange. This integration will allow owners of newer Samsung Galaxy phones to not only use their devices as cold storage wallets but to buy and sell crypto via the Gemini exchange as well.Samsung is the global leader in the smartphone market, with 298.1 million units shipped and a 21.8% market share in 2019, according to tech analytic firm Canalys. Adding support for Gemini will lower the barrier to entry to cryptocurrency use for millions of people.Previously, owners of Samsung Blockchain Wallet-compatible devices were able to store crypto on their phones, send and receive crypto, and use decentralized applications. However, with this latest addition, Samsung owners will now be able to buy and sell crypto via Gemini too, making it easier for those new to crypto to get their hands on their first tokens.Both Samsung and Gemini hope that by streamlining the crypto acquisition process, they will be able to overcome some of the roadblocks that have led to the somewhat underwhelming adoption of cryptocurrencies. Tyler Winklevoss, CEO of Gemini, stated in a press release:“Crypto is not just a technology, it is a movement. We are proud to be working with Samsung Blockchain to bring crypto’s promise of greater choice, independence, and opportunity to more individuals around the world.”From Bitcoin’s (BTC) mysterious origins as the brainchild of the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto to the sudden rise of crypto in 2017, cryptocurrency has experienced a wild ride over the past decade, with roadblocks at every turn.At the beginning of its journey, cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, was largely viewed as a means to conduct illicit affairs and, in some ways, that reputation has stuck around. From ordering drugs online to cryptojacking malware (malicious software that uses a computer’s resources to mine crypto), cryptocurrencies have earned something of a bad reputation.Unfortunately, because cryptocurrency is accessed through computers, which are always vulnerable to cyberattacks, many people are also concerned about the security of their funds if they were to adopt crypto as their go-to currency. Although cryptocurrencies use complex cryptography to stay secure, and there are many ways to further improve the safety of your funds — such as switching from cloud storage to cold storage — many people may be slow to switch over to digital currencies out of fear of being hacked.While these concerns haven’t stopped the growing public interest, it has made it more difficult to obtain crypto in some countries, hampering its ability to become a global currency. With several governments banning crypto outright and a lot of people not using a VPN to sidestep those bans, that reputation has put a dent in its user base — especially given that China, one of the largest consumer markets, is one of the countries making an active effort to suppress cryptocurrency.What’s more, even when people are not worried about cryptocurrency and aren’t legally prohibited from acquiring tokens, many crypto exchanges are simply too complex for the average user to navigate. While there has been an uptick in user-friendly exchanges over the past few years, of which Gemini is one, this lack of easy-to-use exchanges may have significantly hindered the early adoption of cryptocurrencies.Throughout all this turmoil, Samsung has been one of the largest proponents and supporters of cryptocurrency. In 2019, the company rolled out the Samsung Blockchain Wallet, which supports sending, receiving and storing ERC-20 tokens as well as using DApps built on Ethereum.This was viewed as one of tech’s biggest moves toward crypto adoption, along with Facebook’s digital currency, Libra. However, without the ability to purchase cryptocurrencies on exchanges, there was still somewhat of a barrier to Samsung owners who didn’t already own crypto.While the complex mathematics behind cryptocurrencies may be hard for consumers to grasp, the benefits of a global currency are not. With support for Gemini built into new Samsung Galaxy models, widespread adoption of cryptocurrency may be inching closer and closer.Unlike some other crypto exchanges such as Binance, Bittrex or Poloniex, Gemini focuses on providing a streamlined and intuitive crypto buying and selling experience for its users instead of an environment designed for active trading. It’s comparable to Coinbase in its beginner-friendly nature and its focus on buy-and-hold investment strategies.Gemini is also one of the few exchanges to be awarded a BitLicense, which is required to operate an exchange in the state of New York. This exposes Gemini to a potential market of over 19 million people that not all of its competitors have access to.By natively supporting Gemini with Samsung’s existing cold storage wallets, the two companies are making it exceedingly easy for new blood to enter the crypto space and safely secure funds in cold storage. Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto, managing director of operations at Gemini, said:""For millions of Samsung users across the U.S. and Canada, being able to store crypto directly on their phones lowers another barrier to entry."" While this alone likely won’t be enough to completely change the landscape of cryptocurrency, it sets the stage for other groundbreaking developments yet to come.Although Samsung Pay continues to lag behind Apple Pay in market share, it still maintains a sizable user base that is expected to hit 100 million users this year. While Samsung Blockchain Wallet doesn’t currently integrate with Samsung Pay, it seems to be just a small step away from allowing Galaxy owners to exchange fiat for tokens, or vice versa, on Gemini and then immediately use them for everyday purchases.With Samsung Pay so deeply integrated into the daily life of several Asian countries, the impacts of a development like this could be truly massive. Although such an integration is purely speculative at this point, the combined forces of Samsung and Gemini do seem to show that the future is bright for crypto.Indeed, regardless of whether this recent partnership has an impact, it’s clear that blockchain and similar cryptographic technologies are here to stay. From cryptocurrency to DApps, these technologies are poised to change the world.While the vision of cryptocurrency as a truly global currency is still far off in the future, these recent developments are drawing us ever closer.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Sam Bocetta is a freelance journalist specializing in United States diplomacy and national security with an emphasis on technology trends in cyberwarfare, cyberdefense and cryptography.

694,"All eyes are on Bitcoin (BTC), crypto's largest coin by market cap, and Tesla, a future-centric car company run by eccentric billionaire Elon Musk, thanks to a standout year for both assets.Tradable equity in Tesla, under the ticker TSLA, has captured more of the American public's attention than any other investable asset, according to July figures from financial charting platform TradingView, posted on Aug. 13. Bitcoin held the spotlight as the second most popular asset charted on the platform. TradingView also pointed out that Bitcoin interest is on the rise specifically in Washington, California and Oregon. ""The west coast loves crypto the most,"" the article said. ""Boeing was the third most viewed stock and American Airlines the 10th,"" the article added, detailing the airline sector — an industry that saw the brunt of COVID-19 restriction consequences. Bitcoin and Tesla earned their spots in the limelight as both have rallied tremendously in price over 2020. Bitcoin hit a low near $3,800 back in March as COVID-19 fears were ramping up. The asset recovered fast, however, flying up past $12,000 in the following months, tallying a radical comeback. Looking back on a similar story, TSLA's price fell down near $350 in March before flying up past $1,750 by July, as if riding one of its CEO's SpaceX rockets.  Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder Elon Musk is no stranger to the crypto space, although he reportedly only owns 0.25 BTC as of May."
695,"Over the past four months, the National Cyber Security Centre, or NCSC, removed over 300,000 URLs pertaining to fake celebrity-endorsed investment opportunities. More than a half of these sites belonged to fraudulent cryptocurrency investment schemes.Per an announcement published by the NCSC on August 14, an increasing number of these scams utilized fake endorsements from national celebrities, such as Ed Sheeran and Richard Branson. This raised red flags for authorities, prompting the launch of a massive retaliatory campaign.Ciaran Martin, CEO of the NCSC, commented:“These investment scams are a striking example of the kind of methods cyber criminals are now deploying to try to con people. We are exposing them today not only to raise public awareness but to show the criminals behind them that we know what they’re up to and are taking action to stop it.”In Australia, a similar warning was issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, or ASIC. They too asked people to remain cautious about celebrity-endorsed Bitcoin (BTC) scam sites.Cointelegraph recently reported that the United Kingdom Advertising Standards Authority, or ASA, and the Internet Advertising Bureau, or IAB, have launched a new system to help detect and remove fraudulent online ads."
696,"Bitcoin yet to clear $12,000 hurdleEthereum Gas prices skyrocketSmall-cap cryptos shineWatch the Bitcoin and gold correlationThis week, the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market roared into Monday like a lion only to end the week more like a lamb. Going into the weekend, let’s take a look at the major developments that have shaped the past week and what can be expected for the price of Bitcoin during the weekend. Bitcoin (BTC) price tested its year-to-date high, briefly surging past $12,000 only to fall back down into the same mid-$11,000 range it has been stuck in for the better part of the past couple weeks. Ether (ETH) also surged, along with Gas fees, largely on the back of DeFi growth and speculation. But the big story was a previously unknown token that shot astronomically higher only to fall back to earth almost as quickly.Moving over the $12,000 hurdle was always seen as the key to Bitcoin retesting all-time highs. Overcoming the gauntlet of resistance levels between the $12,000-14,000 level would be followed by a vacuum all the way to record highs, some analysts believe.Heading into the week, Bitcoin made a run at the $12K key psychological barrier. But despite leveraged interest, the lack of follow-through resulted in Bitcoin falling back below it. In turn, the market was forced to try again, in part helped by flat to minor positive perpetual funding rates.Alongside the technical price rejection, it is worth noting that Ethereum transaction fees began to creep ever so higher and, in fact, over the subsequent day, the rise was such that transaction fees reached $6.04 on Wednesday night, the highest since 2015. Ethereum network fees. Source: EtherscanVarious network upgrades are supposed to solve this issue or, at the very least, alleviate the immediate pressure, but these developments are believed to be months away. Still, despite the aforementioned price swings, the in-vogue DeFi sector continued to grow from strength to strength and the total amount locked across the ecosystem remained largely unaffected by the swings in the secondary market. In turn, this resilience and the appetite to take on risk to experiment with DeFi, AMM, and yield farming, as evidenced by the ongoing surge higher in the total amount of value locked across the DeFi ecosystem, pointed to strong dip-buying interest. Total value locked in DeFi (USD). Source: DeFi PulseStrong dip-buying interest was subsequently confirmed over the following days when the initial unwind of bullish price expectations in the options market, as seen by the evolution of Bitcoin and Ethereum front-end options skew, was gradually retraced. ETH 25d skew and implied volatility. Source: skew.comWhat’s more, this was driven by the front-end of the futures curve, while the back end held largely steady. A much more significant development, rather than profit-taking, would result in a much more significant and broader market repricing.However, while the media focused on yet another round of price swings by Bitcoin and ETH, the real movement was in small-cap tokens, which outperformed large-cap counterparts by a ratio of 3:1.The fast-growing world of DeFi is not without its risks and as well documented by CoinTelegraph earlier in the week, Yam Finance, an experimental DeFi protocol, made major headlines.The Yam protocol initially gained steam as the second purely decentralized DeFi project after Yearn Finance. It deployed a decentralized governance model that enabled YAM holders to have a say across the protocol. Within 24 hours, nearly $500 million worth of capital was locked in only for it to soon crash back down to zero after the discovery of a rebase bug.Initially, Yam opened staking pools for Compound, Aave’s Lend, Chainlink’s Link, Wrapped ETH (WETH), YFI, Synthetix (SNX), Maker (MKR), and Uniswap V2 LP tokens. But most of the tokens that were used in Yam staking pools crashed after the bug occurred. Despite the harsh lesson and reminder of the high risks that are involved, the market staged a strong recovery.Bitcoin was able to gradually recover into the $11,500 zone, but the total value locked on DeFi tracked near record highs.On a macro level, the one-month correlation between Bitcoin and gold has begun to grow closer by the day, climbing all the way to 68% before a slight correction. However, caution is warranted before extrapolating the thesis from the above, as the more prudent measure, the three-month correlation coefficient currently sits at 15%. It is also worth noting that while gold has advanced past $2,000 per ounce in the wake of rising uncertainty surrounding the ongoing monetary policy easing stance by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, continued uncertainty will make the correlation worth keeping an eye on for the foreseeable future.Disclaimer.

697,"A platform that paves the way for the creation of tokenized crypto funds has added deposits and withdrawals in Tether — giving greater flexibility for investors who are looking to emulate the strategies of successful traders.Tokenbox allows people who are interested in gaining exposure to the crypto market to buy shares in funds that have been curated by crypto professionals. While some of the opportunities focus on major digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), others are more heavily weighted in altcoins. Full, transparent information is provided about how each fund is performing, the team notes. The addition of Tether (USDT) deposits and withdrawals is significant because of how it further increases the cryptocurrencies that can be used to top up an account. Those who are seeking an on-ramp can also use their bank cards to get involved, if they wish.Tokenbox says there are plenty of other developments to report. One of them is that trading volumes of its TBX tokens have now exceeded $500,000 on the decentralized exchange protocol Uniswap, where work is underway to develop a liquidity pool. The goal is to ensure that TBX tokens enjoy long-term success, with the team adding: “The release of the Tokenbox platform with the running Portfolio Service has laid a solid foundation for further product development and organic growth in the usage and utility of TBX tokens.”Elsewhere, the platform can now be accessed using the InterPlanetary File System, or IPFS — a protocol that’s designed to make the web “faster, safer, and more open.”It has also been announced that Tokenbox has joined the “Startup with IBM” program — winning a grant of more than $120,000. The tech giant’s initiative means the company can make use of 130 services in the IBM Cloud, ranging from analytics and security to artificial intelligence and blockchain.The Tokenbox team recently released an in-depth guide that explains how TBX tokens work, and what they are used for. Those who own this crypto asset benefit from discounted trading fees, and they also serve as a digital license for traders who are running a portfolio.The company explains that “once your portfolio is created, you need to keep an amount of TBX worth 1% of all your assets in your wallet — otherwise the portfolio will not be able to accept new investments and will also be hidden on the marketplace.”In the fast-moving — and often complicated — crypto world, investors are often looking for accessible ways to get involved in digital assets. With Bitcoin and Ether recently embarking on a new bullish phase, there’s plenty of renewed interest.Meanwhile, traders who have a strong track record often struggle to build their profile — and if they want to create a crypto fund that investors can follow, they often have to build their own platform at great expense.Tokenbox solves the challenges facing investors and traders in one fell swoop. Investors can access a diverse range of crypto funds in one place and acquire shares in a few simple clicks. Better still, traders can set up their own portfolio in a few minutes — with Tokenbox taking care of marketing, legal requirements and the Know Your Customer checks that their clients have to go through.Alexander Muradov, a professional trader who operates two portfolios on the Tokenbox platform, says tokenized crypto funds can help remove some of the emotion out of trading for rookie investors — allowing them to trust the expertise and rationale of a seasoned expert.Disclaimer.

698,"The market capitalization of Tether (USDT) surpassed $12 billion as of Aug. 14, according to cryptocurrency market analytics firm Coinmetrics. Meanwhile, some believe the rapidly-rising valuation of the dominant stablecoin positively benefits Bitcoin (BTC) in the long term. But some investors also fear that it makes the cryptocurrency market vulnerable.Tether has been the most widely-utilized stablecoin for several years, and it has seen exponential growth. In January 2017, the total supply of Tether was hovering at around $10 million. Within four years, that number has increased by 1,200-fold.The increase in the supply of Tether since 2017. Source: CoinMetricsTether is used as a substitute for fiat currencies across major exchanges, including Binance and Bitfinex. As such, cryptocurrency investors often rely on Tether to store capital on the sidelines. Coinmetrics researchers explain:“Moving into stablecoins allows investors to effectively keep money parked on the sideline without having to completely cash out into fiat currency and incurring fees. This rush to safety likely accounted for a significant portion of the increased stablecoin demand following March 12th.”Since Tether is often used to hedge against major cryptocurrencies, an argument could be made that its supply represents capital waiting on the sidelines. When the supply of Tether expands, it might indicate that investors are actively hedging, leaving an abundant supply of capital ready to enter the crypto market.BTC/USD price vs. Tether market capitalization. Source: SkewCharles Edwards, a digital asset manager, pinpointed the increasing supply of Tether as a catalyst for Bitcoin. He said the 26% increase in Tether is one of the eight fundamental factors that is driving BTC upward. He said:“How can you be bearish Bitcoin here? - Portnoy in Bitcoin - Fed investigating crypto dollar w MIT - Gold S/R flip - +26% Tether - 45% supply hasn't moved in >2yrs - Energy Value increasing > price - Mining profitable & price near Production Cost - Accumulation price structure.”While some analysts consider the expanding supply of Tether as an optimistic trend, others have expressed concerns towards the stablecoin. Coinmetrics addressed several issues Tether has faced in recent years, including a lawsuit from the New York Attorney General’s office.Well-known trader Peter Brandt previously criticized Tether, calling it “just another fiat currency.” He said:“The problem is that tether is funny money -- a derivative make-believe peddled by the crypto exchanges. As the chart by @Silver_Watchdog shows, total market cap of tether exceeds total cap of cryptos. This is imaginary money backed by air”Still, the researchers emphasize that Tether remains dominant and continues to expand to other blockchains. The researchers noted:“But despite Tether’s issues and the introduction of new stablecoins, USDT remained dominant and continued to grow. Originally launched using the Omni protocol on the Bitcoin blockchain, by the beginning of 2018 Tether began to expand to other networks.”The confluence of various positive macro factors, including institutional adoption, the weakening of the U.S. dollar via the increasing expansion of the money supply, and rising Tether supply, has led the sentiment around Bitcoin to improve with some analysts predicting new highs for BTC before 2021."
